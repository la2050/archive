  Meet The Youngs, a community center for young creatives that aims to
  self-empower communities.
project_summary: ''
Please describe the activation your organization seeks to launch.: "We want to open our first physical community center in Los Angeles County to empower marginalized creatives with the infrastructure they need to live & work creatively.\r\n\r\nOur space will provide equipment creatives can borrow, facilities they can use, and serve as an offline platform for them to share work, gain business, and meet community-members.\r\n\r\nWe'll host workshops that inform, exhibitions that showcase, and community meetings to generate financial and social capital for creative projects."
Describe in greater detail how your activation will make LA the best place?: "Our community center will function as a critical bridge between high school graduation and entry into the creative economy. Per the 2017 Otis Report on the Creative Economy in Los Angeles, 759,000 jobs were generated earning $56.9 billion in total labor income. There are three main components to the creative economy. (1) The businesses and individuals involved in producing cultural, artistic, and design goods and services, (2) organizations that provide a venue for artists to share their work, and (3) the support system that nurtures and sustains creative activity.\r\n\r\nThe community center we plan to build is a needed part of the support system that nurtures and sustains creative activity. After high school graduation, having access to free or low-cost support of a creative career is not yet a reality. \r\n\r\nWe would achieve this possibility by leasing or buying a space in an underserved creative community - Jefferson Park, Arlington Heights, West Adams, and Downtown Pomona are all being considered as imprints. At this space, we will offer a range of resources to young creatives in our immediate and extended vicinity. The services and amenities available would include meeting and work spaces, free public wifi, tech equipment and creative supplies, photography and film studio space, and weekly events (galleries, lectures, fairs, workshops, trade shows, concerts, conferences, etc). A low-cost membership fee will maintain operating expenses and support our plans of investing in creative projects. Members and non-members will be able to apply for investments in their creative projects on a quarterly application cycle.\r\n\r\nMobilizing Angelenos is at the crux of our plan. By building this physical community center we are creating a door to creative and professional advancement, a vehicle for cultural activism, and tool for local civic good. Through our project, we aim to bring together people who aren't in the same room enough to strike up dialogues and create empathy. We want to provide a safe space for exhibiting and developing creative voices. And we want to match our social or educational investment in creative projects with a financial component. Each of our community meetings will operate like Kickstarter, serving as a crowdfunding platform for someoneâ€™s creative project. Ticket sales to meetings will be re-invested into developing creative ideas.\r\n\r\nMeet The Youngs will make LA the best place to create by developing the infrastructure to help young creatives progress socially and financially in the creative economy. Our plan would not only benefits thousands of young creatives it also benefits thousands of LA-based businesses, and the millions of people who will be affected by what they create."
How will your activation engage Angelenos to make LA the best place: "Our approach to engaging Angelenos will be hosting a series of meetings at our community center. We've already begun organizing these meetings in a pop-up format as a beta test and have been successful in mobilizing young creative communities. From our beta test, we've improved our strategies and tactics and have discovered how to effectively connect with this population and build environments for them that make LA the best place to create.\r\n\r\nThe population we serve is typically 18-29, a mix of junior college students, four-year university students, recent college grads, and emerging professionals. They live throughout LA County, have varying amounts of knowledge or success in the creative economy, and don't have the adequate resources or structure needed to create.\r\n\r\nThe first strategy to serving them is bringing together people from various social circles, creative industries, and socioeconomic status. This mix of people creates social equity for everyone in the group and improves the likelihood of learning something new or getting a job.\r\n\r\nAnother lesson is ensuring the space is comprised of multiple rooms that offer different experiences. This approach to spatial design focuses the activities that occur in each room.\r\n\r\nFinally, we implemented a crowdfunding component to our meetings in order to match the human capital we're facilitating with financial capital - cash investments in creative projects. This mix of approaches is what makes our activation unique and effective."
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your activation.: "We will prioritize depth and consistency of engagement over breadth and reach when it comes time to measuring success for our community center.\r\n\r\nThis means seeking sustained engagement from our community members. We'd track measurements such as length of time in the center, number of consecutive visits, and the number of members referring other members."
Where do you hope this activation or your organization will be in five years?: "In five years, the hope for Meet The Youngs as an organization would be to operate more than one community center in Los Angeles in order to create interplay between communities in different parts of the city. We'd hope to have incubated creative companies fully-owned by members of our community center and to have given thousands of young people access to the creative economy - getting jobs, launching business ventures, and publishing creative works.\r\n\r\nBeyond LA County, we plan to align our efforts with other underserved creative communities who are in the shadows of their city's creative industries. We're planning to start by organizing community meetings for creatives in cities like New York and Chicago and aspire to open additional community centers there as well."
