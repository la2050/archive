title: A social movement about how we finish this sentence.
project_summary: ''
Please describe the activation your organization seeks to launch.: >-
  Our goal is to make a documentary film that can be shown prior to a typical
  police community meeting.  There is something magical about a film where
  people will let go of their preconceived notions. Everyone agrees we have a
  problem and need to find solutions.  Unfortunately everyone shows up to these
  conversations to battle. This film will serve as an ice breaker to soften
  hearts and open minds only from there we can attack the problem not each
  other. 
Describe in greater detail how your activation will make LA the best place?: >-
  There is such a disconnect currently with law enforcement and the communities
  they serve.  This is a way to bring them together in a social way sort of the
  cocktail party to meet and greet rather then the volatile community meetings
  when emotions are high after a shooting.
How will your activation engage Angelenos to make LA the best place: >-
  I want to reach all of LA.  Each division of law enforcement would have to
  opportunity to host an event at a theatre in that division.  I have a film
  distributor that will hold a screening.  So each city can directly talk to the
  officers that are answering their calls and discuss issues directly related to
  their neighborhood.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your activation.: >-
  It will be hard to measure the true success because it will be what doesn't
  happen.  It will be one person deciding to lead with compassion and humility
  instead of anger and fear.  However, the way I would be able to measure
  success is people showing up to the event.  It may just be a small seed that
  is planted something they can chew on in the days to come.  Or relationships
  built with officers and civilians that later proves to have helped down the
  line where they needed to rely on each other.
Where do you hope this activation or your organization will be in five years?: >-
  It is my hope that this becomes an annual or bi-annual event.  We can continue
  to build on relationships or make new.  Each year we could tackle current
  issues.  This could potentially serve as an example to other departments
  across the state or nation.
