  At Brick we make it fun to take a vacation from our phones for a little every
  day.
project_summary: ''
Please describe the activation your organization seeks to launch.: >-
  Our phone habits have turned into compulsions, if not even full-fledged
  addictions. At Brick, we say itâ€™s time to take back our time. Using the most
  recent research in habit change, we combat distraction and distress from
  technology by making it fun to take a vacation from our phones for a little
  every day. Our products and services include phone-free events, a
  recommendation engine for phone-free businesses and activities, and a mobile
  app that rewards you for the time you spend off your phone.
Describe in greater detail how your activation will make LA the best place?: >-
  Our technology is amazing, and its no surprise Americans spend upwards of 10
  hours a day on our phones. But this has come at a cost. We have replaced
  real-world relationships with digital ones, and as a society we are somehow
  now more stressed, anxious, lonely, and more unsatisfied than ever before.
  Millions of us realize we need to spend less time on our phones, but there is
  no structure in place to make it fun, easy, and social. Brick challenges the
  LA community to Brick (TM) their phones for a little bit every day. To Brick
  your phone means to disconnect it from the grid for at  least an hour a day,
  turning it into a brick, and go to something engaging in the real world. We
  make it fun an easy to do this with our phone-free events like dinner parties
  and game nights, through our mobile app that rewards you for the amount of
  time you spend off your phone, and through our recommendation engine that
  supports and recommends other businesses that are phone-free, like yoga
  studios, meditation studios, restaurants and cafes that don't want you to be
  distracted.
How will your activation engage Angelenos to make LA the best place: >-
  We are putting all our efforts into making LA the primary hub for Brick. We
  are partnering with a large number of businesses and locations that support
  the idea of disconnecting to reconnect by spending daily Brick Time, and are
  growing a community of people who support the mission. We want to decentralize
  the process by allowing anyone to their their own phone-free activity,
  promoting meaningful connections and social bonding. We are developing various
  phone-free activities for Los Angelinos like sunset hikes, escape rooms,
  dinner parties, camping trips, cooking classes, and more. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your activation.: >-
  We measure success through increase in subscribers to our community (via
  www.gobricknow.com). We also measure success through ticket sale and
  partnership revenue. We also measure success qualitatively through our
  surveys. During onboarding our community fills out a survey about how
  detrimental their phone is to their health. Questions such as, "Do you wish
  you spent less time on your phone?" allow us to measure stress and then
  measure again months later to gauge improvement and increased feelings of
  balance and wellbeing amongst the community. 
Where do you hope this activation or your organization will be in five years?: >-
  In five years, we hope that Brick Time will be part of our cultures common
  vernacular, but more important, that spending structured time off our phones
  will be as much of a daily routine as brushing our teeth. For our health, and
  the survival of humankind.
