title: 'Grow LA''s creative economy with ARTWORK. '
project_summary: ''
Please describe the activation your organization seeks to launch.: "We believe in creative freedom and access, which is why we’re launching ARTWORK——a membership-based, fully-equipped shared studio and creative space designed for creatives to: get affordable access to space and resources to work on their craft, build community, become immersed in creative culture, and actively grow our creative economy.\t"
Describe in greater detail how your activation will make LA the best place?: "“Every city, town, and business that relies on the output and impact of the creative economy and access to a healthy creative workforce should be concerned about the availability of affordable and appropriate space to incubate emerging talent and retain a competitive pool of creative workers.” - Artspace (California Arts Council). \r\n\r\nFinding affordable space is a problem for LA creatives. Creatives need facilities designed for creatives, and traditional coworking spaces aren’t equipped for creative work. Access to professional equipment is expensive and can be difficult to acquire. And storing equipment takes valuable space. \r\n\r\nOur solution——ARTWORK——a membership based, fully-equipped shared studio and creative space designed for creatives to: \r\n-Get flexible access to space and resources to work on and develop their craft \r\n-Build community, network, and become immersed in creative culture \r\n-Save money and hassle, allowing creatives to focus on their work, and leave the rest to us\r\n-Actively grow our creative economy\r\n\r\nAccess to the proper space, equipment, and environment are important factors in growing our creative economy. In order to increase employment in the creative industries, we must grow and support the pool of viable candidates. By creating affordable access to professional studio space and equipment, coupled with creative workshops and networking opportunities, we can develop new and emerging talent ready to enter the creative workforce.\r\n\r\nCommunal culture has become a catalyst for high growth startups. We want to extend this model to the creative space. By creating shared studio spaces and access to resources, we’ll create an environment for collaboration, exploration, and community——all important drivers in startup success.   \r\n\r\nArt is culture. A creative environment is an inclusive environment and a reflection of the people. Inclusion in the workforce and creative economy are two of our top priorities. Through community outreach, and our diverse network of creative industry professionals, we’ll provide a platform for the next group of creative leaders, entrepreneurs and business owners from all walks of life. \r\n\r\n"
How will your activation engage Angelenos to make LA the best place: "“There’s never been a social movement without artists at the tip of the sphere.”- Yosi Sergant, co-creator of “Into Action” LA art festival. \r\n\r\nArt is activism. Creatives like Shepard Fairey and Tatyana Fazlalizadeh are examples of the mobilizing power of the arts. Our goal is to mobilize the LA creative community, which includes creatives from all 12 super sectors of the creative industry: architecture/interior design, art galleries, communication arts, digital media, entertainment, fashion, decorative arts, industrial design, publishing & printing, toys, visual & performing arts, and arts schools. Through ARTWORK’s collective of creatives, we’ll put our talents together to shape and activate the surrounding LA community through: \r\n-City rejuvenation projects: murals & public art \r\n-Providing creative resources for local issues & PSA campaigns (according to Matrix Media, just one LA billboard unit can receive nearly 96,953 impressions per week) \r\n-Community art shows and public gallery\r\n-Portfolio building workshops for High School students to pursue higher education and creative careers\r\n-Art therapy sessions open to the public\r\n \r\nARTWORK is not just a collaborative studio space for creatives to work on their craft, it’s putting artists to work in the community for a better LA.    \r\n\r\n"
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your activation.: "Success should be measurable. We’ll measure our impact through three key factors: \r\n1. Number of ARTWORK membership signups: ARTWORK creative members will be the driving force behind our activations. Our goal is to increase membership by 50% each year to grow a vibrant community of creative talent.\r\n2. Number of attendees to community events and activations: Through email captures, RSVPs, counter clickers, and additional tracking systems, we’ll be able to count the number of Angelenos activated at our in person events, such as creative networking nights, workshops, masterclasses, and art shows. Our goal is to double attendance from Year 1 to Year 2.\r\n3. Number of social and media impressions: Using social media tools we’ll track engagement on our social platforms. Our goal is to increase followers and impressions by 50% each quarter.\r\n"
Where do you hope this activation or your organization will be in five years?: >-
  Within 5 years our goal is to grow and expand ARTWORK to additional major
  creative markets in California and the U.S.
