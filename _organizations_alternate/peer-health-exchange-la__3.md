  <p>Since our founding in 2003, we have trained more than 6,200 college student
  volunteers to deliver effective health education to over 76,000 low-income
  public high school students in New York City, Boston, Chicago, the San
  Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C. This year, we reach
  19,000 teens across six cities. </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>Peer Health Exchange grew to Los Angeles in 2009. Since then, we have trained more than 750 college student volunteers to provide health education to over 8,800 low-income Angelinos.</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>This year, PHE Los Angeles is piloting several unique strategic investments as part of our larger organizational growth plan, including:</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>1) Accessibility of PHE Program for Volunteers: This investment aims make PHE more accessible to students from a variety of backgrounds by making additions and adaptations to our program model, including changing the organizational structure, incentivizing PHE through course credit or stipends, and adjusting the training structure to make it accessible to all learning styles. We are piloting this investment at Cal State Northridge.</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>2) School Environment: Extended Teen Learning: This investment will test whether addressing the overall school environment in which teens operate impacts their learning around health behaviors. We are working closely with teachers, administrators, and other external organizations partnering with pilot schools to co-construct interventions through multiple modalities beyond the 13 standard PHE workshops. We are piloting this investment at selected LA high schools.</p>
