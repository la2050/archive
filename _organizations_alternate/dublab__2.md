  dublab has been broadcasting since 1999. More than 300,000 international
  listeners connect to our audio streams and podcasts monthly. Over the past 14
  years dublab.com has been critically acclaimed as one of the premier Internet
  radio stations in the world. The LA Weekly says, "Tuning into the Dubstream at
  any given time is a music lover’s dream." dublab is part of Los Angeles’
  cultural landscape and continues to create innovative music programming that
  provides an important voice to the city.

   Besides its radio programming, dublab has presented hundreds of free concerts throughout the city of Los Angeles. We have curated the main music stages at the Eagle Rock Music Festival for six years running, at the Abbot Kinney Festival for the past three years and 2013 marks our third year presenting a series of free, dublab curated concerts as part of the Levitt Pavilion summer series. Our organization has also contributed to numerous free, public programs at the Getty Center, Hammer Museum, LACMA, Los Angeles Public Library, Santa Monica Pier, Grammy Museum, REDCAT and dozens of other major arts institutions in Los Angeles.

   dublab has succeeded as a community supported organization funded through contributions and underwriting from individual donors and organizations from around the world. In 2011 dublab became the recipient of multi-year grant funding from the Los Angeles County Arts Commission and the following year received a grant from the Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs. Its longevity is in great part due to the organization’s successful fundraising strategy and financial stability.
