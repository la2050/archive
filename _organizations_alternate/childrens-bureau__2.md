  <p>For over 100 years, Children’s Bureau has been a leader and innovator of
  child abuse treatment and prevention in Southern California. With a focus on
  young children, we were one of the first professional providers of foster care
  in the nation. Children’s Bureau was a vital partner in establishing the
  Community Chest, a precursor to United Way and played a key role in
  establishing the USC School of Social Work. In the 1980’s we transitioned from
  focusing on treatment and moving on to prevention as a key means of keeping
  children safe from harm. Our successes in the critical battle to prevent child
  abuse earned us a highly regarded reputation. The California Department of
  Social Services’ Office of Child Abuse Prevention awarded Children’s Bureau a
  grant to form the Family Resource Center Technical Training and Support Team
  which acts as a training model for other organizations. Children’s Bureau
  continues to be awarded numerous contracts and grants to implement county
  programs designed to protect vulnerable children and enhance their lives. We
  are one of a small group of agencies in Los Angeles County nationally
  accredited by the Council on Accreditation of Services for Families and
  Children, Inc. </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>Our NuParent program received international recognition in Spring 2012 with an invitation to present the program, measurement tools and results at the 8th Annual British Association for the Study and Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect. </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>In 2008, we successfully completed a $22 million capital campaign and opened our new headquarters in one of the poorest, most densely populated neighborhoods in Los Angeles. From this center we launched the Magnolia Community Initiative - a ground-breaking model for large scale community mobilization where children, especially those under age 5 living in the most vulnerable neighborhoods, break all records of success in their education and health milestones and in the nurturing they receive. </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>Our Magnolia Community Initiative has rapidly gained the attention and recognition of national leaders, policy-makers and funders including members of the U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, The Tides Foundation, United Way Worldwide, Gates Foundation and East LA Initiative. Through our work with the UCLA Center for Healthier Children, Families and Communities, we have collected and mapped the school readiness of young children in a 500 block area of Los Angeles. We are using this mapping data to help local communities map their needs and service gaps on a highly localized basis and engaging the community to improve these outcomes.</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>With an operating budget of $30 million and actively involved boards of directors and trustees, Children’s Bureau has the demonstrated depth of capacity, experience, relationships, and leadership to effect a community-wide transformation in Los Angeles.</p>
