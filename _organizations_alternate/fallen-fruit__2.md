  The three artists in Fallen Fruit, David Burns, Matias Viegener and Austin
  Young, have been developing their collaboration for nine years. We began
  simply by examining what was growing in our own neighborhood in Silver Lake,
  and we found numerous overlooked fruit trees, often a bit neglected, growing
  in or over public space. We mapped them, wrote manifestos about them,
  documented them and then brought people to see them. <p>
   
   
   
   
   
   Our neighborhood began to transform: more trees appeared and people started picking the fruit. We mapped other neighborhoods nationwide, and were invited around the world to create a range of work on things from the vast expanse of berries in the arctic to the contentious history of banana plantations in South America. <p>
   
   
   
   
   
   Our most ambitious project to date was EATLACMA, a yearlong residency at LACMA in 2010, which included an exhibition, five artist-commissioned gardens, several events including two Public Fruit Adoptions, and a day-long curated performance and intervention in the museum’s spaces that broke attendance records. It was funded in part by a $100,000 MetLife Foundation Community Connections Grant, and received over 100 million press impressions. EATLACMA included our Public Fruit Theater, an intimate amphitheater built with recycled city sidewalks around an orange tree, which delivered a slow and beautiful performance of the seasons: blooming, leafing and fruiting. <p>
   
   
   
   
   
   In the last three years we’ve had two projects titled Accion Fruta Urbana, one in Tijuana, Mexico, and the other in Madrid, Spain, as part of ARCO 2010. In the latter, we worked to populate a working-class quarter of the city with 50 fruit trees. Temporarily impeded by an uncooperative municipal government, the trees found a home in a communal park, Esta es una plaza. The project was accompanied by a billboard and bus shelter campaign in over 300 locations, which contributed tremendously to raising public consciousness. <p>
   
   
   
   
   
   Most recently, we completed the new Del Aire Public Fruit Park in Hawthorne, near the intersection of the 405 and 105 freeways. Funded by an award from the Los Angeles County Arts Commission, the park is planted with an “eye” of 27 fruit trees, with 65 trees “adopted” and planted by residents in the neighboring streets. It received a tremendous reception in the press, and KCET is currently shooting a documentary on the park and our collaboration.<p>
   
   
   
   
   
   The proposal for Endless Orchard is the recipient of a 2013 Creative Capital award, which will bring in at least $50,000 in funding for the project. Though this is not its full budget, it offers us a remarkable level of professional support in seeking out further funding and development.
