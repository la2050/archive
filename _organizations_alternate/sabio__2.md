  <p>Sabio is a brand new organization and has therefore had little opportunity
  to record many achievements. However, our most noteworthy achievement is that
  we have already received inquiries from potential candidates for our bootcamp,
  including actual signups. This has been accomplished through simple messaging
  on Twitter and with no marketing spend.</p>
   
   
   <p>In addition, we are happy to report that we have attracted attention from a number of key contacts not only in Los Angeles, but also Silicon Valley and other technology hubs. This includes some high level government agencies.</p>
   
   
   <p>We have also organized an initial board under our California entity made up of the following individuals: </p>
   
   
   <p>Christian Sanz: CTO and Founder of geekli.st</p>
   
   
   <p>Jesse Saucedo: Project Coordinator, Los Angeles Housing Departments</p>
   
   
   <p>Chantelle Silveira Co-Founder of Stealth Startup</p>
