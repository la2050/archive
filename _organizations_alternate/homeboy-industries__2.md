    - "Homeboy Industries has provided hope, training and support to formerly gang involved and recently incarcerated men and women for 25 years. In that time, we have become the largest, most comprehensive and most successful gang prevention, intervention and rehabilitation organization in Los Angeles â€“ if not the entire country.<br>\n \n \n <br>\n \n \n Currently we provide the following services free of charge each month at Homeboy Industries:<br>\n \n \n â€¢ 200 men and women are employed in entry-level positions at our headquarters and in our social enterprise businesses, and all receive case management to stay on track with employment and educational goals;<br>\n \n \n â€¢ 120 trainees receive individual substance abuse and mental health counseling with licensed clinicians;<br>\n \n \n â€¢ 200 trainees and community clients receive employment counseling services;<br>\n \n \n â€¢ 400 trainees and community clients participate in our broad curriculum of practical, educational and vocational classes; and<br>\n \n \n â€¢ 750 trainees and community clients receive tattoo removal procedures.<br>\n \n \n <br>\n \n \n Due to the breadth and impact of our services, Homeboy Industries was cited as a model program in a 2005 report by the CDC focusing on the ills accompanying gangs and gang violence. The report stressed that Homeboy, by focusing on intervention, serves a vital need and is instrumental in helping break the ongoing cycle of gang violence. The CDC has also endorsed job training programs as a youth violence prevention strategy. Related to, but distinct from traditional job training programs, they noted the importance of â€œsocial microenterprise,â€\x9D as modeled by the small businesses of Homeboy.<br>\n \n \n <br>\n \n \n Importantly, these services are far more cost effective than incarceration. The state and county spend $150,000-200,000 to incarcerate a minor for one year, and a high risk youth will cost society between $1.7 and $2.3 million over their lifetime. Likewise, incarceration of an adult for one year costs approximately $65,000. Employment and support services at Homeboy Industries, on the other hand, cost approximately $35,000 per trainee per year.<br>\n \n \n <br>\n \n \n Perhaps our greatest achievement to date is the unparalleled level of support we have generated among community members and the unequaled level of trust we have achieved among those seeking our services. Homeboy Industries does not conduct formal outreach to current or former gang members. Rather, as a demonstration of their commitment to personal transformation, trainees and community clients reach in to us knowing that they will get the help they need."
