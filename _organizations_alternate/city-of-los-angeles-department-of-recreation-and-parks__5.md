  RAP has provided quality recreational services to the residents of the City
  for over 100 years. This year, 2013 marks the 100th anniversary of RAP camping
  programs.
   
   
   
   
   
   Annually, RAP serves several hundred thousand people including more than 1,000 youth daily in our after school programs, more than 60,000 youths in our sports leagues, and 75,000 in summer day camps. RAP has worked cooperatively with other City entities and outside agencies on numerous foundation, state, and federally funded grant programs with budgets ranging from approximately $5,000 to more than $15 million. 
   
   
   
   
   
   For the past five years RAP has partnered with the Mayor Villaraigosa’s Summer Night Lights (SNL), an anti-gang program that keeps parks open after dark with organized activities for at risk youth, and provides job opportunities and a safe place to spend the summer. By empowering communities and targeting the traditionally most-violent summer months, SNL has become a national model for violence reduction. Since 2008, SNL has expanded from 8 parks to 32 city parks, leading to a 57% reduction in gang-related homicides in SNL neighborhoods. 
   
   
   
   
   
   In 2011, RAP’s One Watt’s Program, a cluster of programs serving residents of the Nickerson Gardens, Jordan Downs and Imperial Courts housing developments and the 109th Street Recreation Center, became the first park program based in Los Angeles County to win the “Governors' Council on Physical Fitness” gold medal since the competition was created in 2006. The Watt’s One Program was awarded for bridging communities through its innovative recreational programs that promote physical activity, fitness and well-being of California youth. Hundreds of boys and girls between the ages of 8 and 12 years participated in soccer, baseball, softball, basketball, and flag football programs in efforts to unite the Watts community.
