  <p>LA STAGE Alliance has provided dozens of services and short-to-long term
  initiatives over our 30 year history. A few highlights include:</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>1. The creation of the LA STAGE ARTS CENSUS, in partnership with TRG Arts, that is now the largest and most robust collective dataset of cultural patrons in LA’s history with over four million unique households currently included.</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   http://www.laimyours.com/40804/what-is-up-with-la2050/2. The creation of the LA PatronManager CRM initiative, providing gold-standard corporate data technology services to arts organizations at zero cost, through a multi-pronged partnership with a for-profit technology firm (Patron Technology), a corporate foundation (Salesforce Foundation), private foundations (the James Irvine and Doris Duke Charitable Foundations), over 100 non-profit arts organizations, and a non-profit service organization (LA STAGE Alliance).</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>3. The creation of LA STAGE Magazine in 2001, which moved online to become the award-winning LASTAGETimes.com in 2009. It is now guided by Editor-in-Chief Deborah Behrens and is the largest professional journalism outlet in Los Angeles dedicated specifically to in-depth, quality coverage of Los Angeles performing arts.</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>4. The founding of the LA STAGE Warehouse Co-op, a 10,000 square foot shared materials facility for the LA theater community, saving LA theaters thousands of dollars a year and preventing the loss of tons of reusable materials (sets, props, costumes, equipment) that would otherwise be sent to landfills.</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>5. The creation of the LA STAGE Ovation Awards, now in their 24th year, the highest-profile awards for excellence in theater on the West Coast. The Ovation Awards consider over 400 productions each year; celebrate over 150 nominees and 35 Ovation recipients at an annual black-tie ceremony, which is attended by 1300 leaders of the LA cultural community.</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>6. Hosting the 2011 Theatre Communications Group Conference in Los Angeles — the first time it had been to LA in its 50 year history — bringing over 1,000 theater professionals from around the country to Downtown LA, in conjunction with the first ever RADAR LA international theater festival.</p>
