  <p>In just two years since it was established, LAFPC has been recognized as
  one of the largest and most advanced food policy councils in the state, with
  the broadest reach of any such council in the country. LAFPC is the subject of
  two national evaluations and was profiled as a model in a report by the
  Applied Research Center entitled, Good Food+Good Jobs For All: Challenges and
  Opportunities to Advance Racial and Economic Equity in the Food System.</p>
   
   
   <p>Key LAFPC achievements include:</p>
   
   
   <p>* Good Food Purchasing Pledge. LAFPC developed and successfully advanced the most comprehensive Good Food Procurement policy in the nation. The policy was adopted by the City of LA through a Mayoral executive directive and a LA City Council motion on 10/24/2012, and by the LAUSD, the second largest food purchaser in California, on 11/13/2012. GFPP is the first municipal food procurement policy in the country to include labor standards.</p>
   
   
   <p>* Community Market Conversion (CMC) Collaborative. LAFPC created the CMC Collaborative to continue the work of the Community Redevelopment Agency-initiated CMC program and received funding for at least three additional store conversions, in partnership with a CDFI. LAFPC has pioneered the use of business and leadership development trainings for neighborhood markets interested in offering healthier fare. The first event, “From Corner Store to Community Grocer: Everything You Need To Know To Be a Healthy Food Retailer,” held in July 2012, offered over a dozen workshops and provided storeowners and community groups with technical, marketing and produce management skills to expand healthy food retail. Over 150 people participated, including 60 storeowners from across LA County. The second training, held on March 19, 2013, focused on Korean American store owners.</p>
   
   
   <p>* National Food Day, October 24, 2012. LAFPC organized an information fair in City Hall Rotunda of its seven Working Groups’ priorities and achievements with over 100 guests; hosted a speakers’ program with an announcement and signing by Mayor Villaraigosa of the Good Food Purchasing Policy executive directive, and comments from Council Members Paul Koretz and Jan Perry, and Dr. Jonathan Fielding, Director of LA County Department of Public Health; received a Food Day resolution from Council Member Eric Garcetti; followed by the unanimous adoption of the Good Food Procurement motion by City Council.</p>
   
   
   <p>* Good Food Day LA — A Day of Service, March 31, 2012. In partnership with the Mayor’s office, LAFPC conducted a citywide awareness and volunteer service event, coordinating 1,000 volunteers and over 100 organizations. The event drew over 3,000 participants.</p>
   
   
   <p>* Infrastructure & Capacity Development. LAFPC organized a network of nearly 700 stakeholders from 325 organizations into a thriving and cohesive collaborative of seven high functioning Working Groups and 40-member leadership body to guide the Good Food vision and framework. </p>
