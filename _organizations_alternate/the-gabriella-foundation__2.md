  <p>“I can’t tell you how much this program and everything it stands for means
  to me. . . . I learned to love, I learned to cope, I learned to express
  myself, and most importantly, I learned to BE. I am much more confident now
  that I know what dancing is and what it brings to me. I am infinitely
  grateful!” -- Sandy Vasquez, 18 (Everybody Dance! participant; current UCLA
  Regents’ Scholar double-majoring in Chicano Studies and English)</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>Everybody dance! is the largest dance program in Los Angeles providing sequential, long-term dance training to inner-city children. Our program’s achievements have been highlighted in the Los Angeles Times, Dance Magazine, People Magazine, Biography Magazine, California Lawyer Magazine, Family Circle Magazine and on multiple television and radio stations. Our faculty of professional dancers has been described by the Los Angeles Times as "some of the best children's dance instructors in the world.”</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   The dance program has opened doors for our students, enabling them to win prestigious awards and scholarships to acclaimed dance schools and academic institutions, including Juilliard, Rock School of Ballet, Kirov Academy of Ballet and summer programs at American Ballet Theater, San Francisco Ballet, and Bolshoi Ballet. Some of our alumni are now using their training to become professional dancers with companies such as the Los Angeles Ballet, Vox Dance Theatre and Complexions Contemporary Ballet in NYC. 
   
   
   
   
   
   Gabriella Charter School was honored at the 19th Annual California Charter Schools Conference in 2012 with the Hart Vision Award for Charter School of the Year as an innovator and leader among charter schools statewide. GCS received the Music Center’s 2011 BRAVO Program Award, which honors educators and schools for their commitment to delivering exemplary arts education in both visual and performing arts. Our faculty and staff are frequently invited to give presentations at universities, arts institutions and national conferences, such as the Colburn School of Performing Arts, UCLA, the Delta Kappa Gamma XI Education Conference (an educational honor society for school leaders and teachers), the California Charter School Summit and the National Dance Education Organization’s Annual Conference. 
   
   
   
   
   
   We believe our dance program is directly responsible for our school’s academic success as well: In 2010, the California Department of Education (“CDE”) awarded Gabriella Charter School the Title I Academic Achievement Award, recognizing significant academic achievement by disadvantaged students who had doubled the academic targets set for them by the CDE for two consecutive years. GCS also received six-year accreditation (the highest possible) from the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, which sited GCS as a “model school for any number of schools wishing to get high academics in a predominantly low-income and underserved community.” (WASC Self Study Visiting Committee Report, April 2010.)
