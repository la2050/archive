  From Lot to Spot (FLTS) is a 501c3 non-profit founded in 2007 as a direct
  result of the relationship between lack of accessible greenspace and the
  quality of life in low-income neighborhoods. FLTS’s unique approach involves
  grass-root, community engagement to ensure disadvantaged communities
  contribute their voice in developing healthy spaces in their neighborhoods. In
  the last five years, FLTS has worked on healthy living community engagement
  projects in the cities of Inglewood, Gardena, Lawndale, Hawthorne and Lynwood.
  2012 was a landmark year for From Lot to Spot. FLTS constructed and opened the
  first ever community garden in the community of Lennox, CA. , opened the
  118th/Doty Ave Pocket Park: the first community-designed pocket park in the
  City of Hawthorne. In collaboration with SWA, we planned, funded and
  constructed a 9000 sq.ft. recreation space along the Dominguez Creek that was
  designed and implemented by high school students and community members.
   
   
   
   
   
   SWA projects span over 60 countries and have garnered over 700 awards. In 2005, SWA received the Landscape Architecture Firm Award, as designated by the American Society of Landscape Architects. One of the seven SWA offices is located in Downtown LA and is continually excited about the opportunity to enhance the city we live in.
