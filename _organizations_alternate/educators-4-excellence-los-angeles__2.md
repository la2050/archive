  <p>In just over a year, our members have influenced local and state education
  policy. Our early impact has included the following:</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>E4E Members helped break the stalemate on teacher evaluation by presenting their recommendations to UTLA President Fletcher, LAUSD Superintendent Deasy, School Board Members and media, with select recommendations included in the ratified deal.</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>Dozens of E4E Members signed onto an amicus brief calling on California courts to protect students from layoff policies that disproportionately violated the constitutional rights of students and our most vulnerable, low-income schools.</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>100+ E4E Members sent voices to Sacramento to block a regressive bill on teacher evaluation and call for smarter state leadership on education</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>500+ E4E members signed E4E”s “Raising School Revenue and Achievement” petition calling for increasing school funding and tying revenue to meaningful reform and 20+ engaged voters through door knocking and phone banking.</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>50+ E4E members expanded their influence beyond the classroom by holding leadership positions in their schools, districts and unions.</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>120+ E4E members took their voices to Sacramento to block the passage of a regressive bill on teacher evaluation.</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>40+ E4E media mentions that influenced public opinion through high-profile coverage in Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles Daily, Huffington Post, Education Week, KPCC, KCAL-9 News and others.</p>
