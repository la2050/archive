  <p>LIFT is a national organization that was founded over fourteen years ago.
  Since its founding, LIFT has helped over 70,000 low income community members
  work side by side with volunteer advocates to help them achieve their goals.
  Today, LIFT operates 11 resource centers in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New
  York, Philadelphia, and Washington D.C.. Over the last decade, LIFT has
  established a track record of success in supporting families on their path to
  economic security. In Fiscal Year 2012, 730 advocates helped 11,000
  individuals and families move forward on path to economic self-sufficiency. At
  a time when the economic climate makes the job market hard to enter,
  affordable housing hard to find, and resources hard to secure, LIFT is telling
  a different story for its clients. Last year, LIFT generated $13.7 million in
  wage increases, tax refunds, public benefits, and housing assistance for its
  clients, providing $1,245 in value for the average client.</p>
   
   
    
   
   
   <p>As David Bornstein wrote in the New York Times (January 2012), “If the American Dream is to be resuscitated for many of nation’s poor, there is a great deal that we can learn from LIFT.” LIFT’s socially innovative model has received national and local attention
   
   
   -In the NYTimes, Huffington Post, and other publications.
   
   
   -At gatherings of thought leaders like the Milken Global Conference, LA 2050's Meet Up on Income and Employment, and Chicago Ideas.
   
   
   -LIFT ED, Michelle Rhone-Collins, was also able to get a mention of LIFT-LA on HBO’s Enlightened
   
   
   -LIFT-LA has been on KIRN, Persian Radio, is soon to be on KPFK, and has garnered interest from KCRW field reporters—all with the idea of getting the stories of what our clients face daily in order to break the stereotypes and create understanding.</p>
   
   
    
   
   
   <p>After 5 years of feasibility study, a thorough environmental scan performed by Nike Irvin, and seed funding from the Goldhirsh Foundation, we have recently open up our landmark LA office in January 2013 with a beautiful ceremony held in March 2013.</p>
   
   
    
   
   
   <p>LIFT-LA’s executive director was able to secure space in the reputable and like-minded Magnolia Place Family Center.</p>
   
   
    
   
   
   <p>In the year since Michelle has been on board, she has built a strong board including Claire Hoffman, Eric Lodal, Cash Warren, Coddy Johnson, Carrie Southworth, Sonia Isaacs, Tonia Davis, Laura Smolowe, and Michael Muller. Together they have raised over $250,000 before doors opened.</p>
   
   
    
   
   
   <p>In the 8 weeks that we have been open, we have served 90 clients, and word of mouth has already kicked in with community members hearing about us from their neighbors, in churches, and at community gatherings.</p>
   
   
    
   
   
   <p>We have already reached our capacity for advocates with volunteers coming from USC, UC Irvine, Azusa Pacific University, University of Phoenix, and Loyola Law School. Several other colleges and universities are seeking to partner with us when we have space to include additional volunteers.</p>
