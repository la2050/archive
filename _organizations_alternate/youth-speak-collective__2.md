  <p>YSC's greatest achievement is actually following through on our
  youth-driven philosophy. We listen carefully to what the youth want and need
  and work with them to implement their ideas. This youth/adult collaboration
  has created effective programs that youth gravitate toward and has brought
  about the following achievements in just seven short years.</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>* Project Kawazoe - A drought-tolerant, Japanese-inspired pocket park in Pacoima, designed and built by students in the community. </p>
   
   
   <p>* Club Futbolito - A free club soccer program for at-risk youth, serving over 1000 players </p>
   
   
   <p>* Pacoima Neighborhood Partnership â€” A founding member of a community led forum of over 50 community members, nonprofits, for-profits, elected offices, law enforcement, educators and students who meet monthly to discuss community issues and come up with viable solutions</p>
   
   
   <p>* Creation of ten murals and developing more in the Northeast San Fernando Valley</p>
   
   
   <p>* Project Youth Green - a four-acre community garden and activity space in the heart of Pacoima</p>
   
   
   <p>* Youth Speak Media Solutions - A social enterprise that provides youth with jobs in the digital arts and film industry</p>
   
   
   <p>* Creation of over twenty marketing films for local businesses and Los Angeles based nonprofits</p>
