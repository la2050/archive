  Over more than two decades in Los Angeles, our corps members, alumni, and
  their students have proven what is possible in classrooms and in schools
  throughout our city. Some exciting recent developments include: <BR>
   
   
   <BR>
   
   
   1) A recent report released by the Harvard Strategic Data Project found that Teach For America Los Angeles teachers and Career Ladder teachers (a pathway for LAUSD paraprofessionals such as teacher’s aides) are more effective than other novice teachers within LAUSD at promoting student learning in math. The effect of having a TFA teacher corresponded to a month and half, or nearly 20 percent, of additional learning, compared to other teachers. <BR>
   
   
   <BR>
   
   
   2) This year’s Los Angeles corps represents diversity of background (two-thirds identify as people of color); diversity of experience (30 percent came from graduate school or professional backgrounds); and diversity of teacher placement (more than one-third teach math or science). <BR>
   
   
   <BR>
   
   
   3) As noted above, alumnus Tommy Chang (corps year ’97) was appointed by Superintendent John Deasy to be one of five local superintendents in LAUSD. As superintendent of intensive support and innovation, Tommy oversees 130 schools and 130,000 students, including a majority of chronically failing schools in the district. He and his team work aggressively to transform outcomes for students across these schools. Other notable TFA alumni in the district include Drew Furedi (corps year ’93) who is spearheading the new teacher evaluation pilot in his role as the executive director of talent management for LAUSD. Drew’s team includes at least six other TFA alums. <BR>
   
   
   <BR>
   
   
   4) One hundred percent of Camino Nuevo schools K-12 principals are TFA alumni, as is the charter network’s chief executive officer, Ana Ponce (corps year ’91). Ana was also named one of the World’s Seven Most Powerful Educators in Forbes magazine this year. <BR>
   
   
   <BR>
   
   
   5) In the KIPP LA network, six out of seven schools currently operating are run by TFA alumni. Alumna Angella Martinez (corps year ’01) led KIPP LA Prep to become the top-performing middle school in LAUSD and now supports all KIPP schools in Los Angeles as their chief academic officer. Other alumni continue to increase their leadership presence in charter organizations like the Alliance College-Ready Public Schools, PUC, and Inner City Education Foundation (ICEF), as site principals, assistant principals, and school-based instructional leaders. Alumna Allison Bajracharya (corps year ’00) supports all charter partners as vice president of regional advocacy at the California Charter Schools Association. <BR>
   
   
   <BR>
   
   
   With the striking evidence of what our corps members and alumni are capable of we can only imagine what our leaders will accomplish toward our goal of educational equity over the coming decades.
