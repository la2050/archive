  Founded in 1985, Heal the Bay is a nonprofit environmental organization making
  Southern California coastal waters and watersheds, including Santa Monica Bay,
  safe, healthy and clean. We use science, education, community action and
  advocacy to fulfill our mission.
   
   
   
   
   
   Heal the Bay's first major challenge as a grassroots organization was taking on the Los Angeles’ Hyperion Sewage Treatment Plant. At the time, Hyperion was breaking the law on several counts, including the dumping of sewage sludge into the Bay. Heal the Bay attacked on many fronts: holding rallies at the beach, informing the media and the public about what was happening, packing hearing rooms, testifying before regulatory agencies, and signing up members along the coast. Due in large part to Heal the Bay’s efforts, the City of Los Angeles was forced to rebuild Hyperion and stop dumping sludge into the Bay. In the years since, Heal the Bay has been overjoyed to see the return of plant and animal life to the former "dead" zone in the Bay, and to know that ocean users are much less likely to become ill from swimming in contaminated coastal waters. 
   
   
   
   
   
   Recent achievements:
   
   
   
   
   
   The Education and Environment Initiative (EEI) 
   
   
   As a co-author of AB1548, more commonly known as the Education and the Environment Initiative (EEI), Heal the Bay has helped bring environmental education to classrooms throughout the state and at all grade levels. Staff continues to work closely with National Geographic and local school districts to ensure that the new curriculum is accessible to classroom educators and their students.
   
   
   
   
   
   Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) 
   
   
   Due in large part to Heal the Bay’s efforts, new MPAs have been established along the Southern California coastline. These underwater “safe havens” allow marine life, especially those fish stocks suffering from the great decline, to replenish and thrive. Heal the Bay will continue to educate ocean users, including anglers, about the benefits of MPA and monitor activities through our citizen-led MPA Watch program.
   
   
   
   
   
   Combating Plastic Pollution 
   
   
   Heal the Bay continues to lead the charge on banning environmentally harmful and fiscally wasteful single-use plastic bags throughout the state. Staff is gearing up to work closely with policymakers and additional stakeholders to facilitate the adoption of a bag ban in the City of Los Angeles.
   
   
   
   
   
   Environmental Stewardship and Volunteerism 
   
   
   An astounding 36,400 volunteers participated in Heal the Bay-coordinated beach cleanups in Los Angeles County from November 2011-September 2012 (includes Coastal Cleanup Day 2012).
   
   
   
   
   
   The WAYS Reading & Fitness Park 
   
   
   In partnership with Wisdom Academy for Young Scientists (a charter elementary school in South Los Angeles), Heal the Bay is developing a multi-use park, which will serve as an outdoor classroom, community green space, fitness area, and water-quality improvement project in a community that is already underserved and disproportionately lacking park space.
