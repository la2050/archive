    - "Jenesse Center has long believed that in order to make a real and lasting change in how families and communities view and respond to domestic violence, we have to talk about it openly and honestly.

The events also provide an opportunity to discuss domestic violence without the stigma that is usually associated with this issue and remind people that victims of domestic violence should be applauded and supported in their efforts to stand tall, and ready, to improve their lives and the lives of their children.\n \n \n \n \n \n *Kaiser MLK Project â€“ Employees from Kaiser participated in a special remodel warehouse project at our Emergency and Transitional Shelters organized\n \n \n *Joan Honig and Carolyn Wright Lewis held a special jewelry fundraiser on Jenesseâ€™s behalf.\n \n \n *Jenesse Center hosted an series of information booth s at West Los Angeles College for Teen Violence Prevention Month and Denim Day\n \n \n *Jenesse hosted a visit from the Womenâ€™s Foundation\n \n \n *Jenesse hosted a Learning Collaborative site visit for Blue Shield as the beginning of its ongoing Leadership Educational program to build capacity of leaders in the field\n \n \n * Jenesse CEO Karen Earl was appointed to the City of Los Angeles DV Task Force for the Council District 8 to offer policy recommendation\n \n \n * Jenesse hosted its annual â€œSilver Rose Weekend ,â€\x9D which includes its Gala and Awards Auction and its Halle Berry Celebrity Golf Tournament\n \n \n  Blue Shield hosts Jenesse as its technical assistance provider\n \n \n *Jenesse receives a grant from Verizon\n \n \n *Jenesse hosts its first session in partnership with Blue Shield for its cultural competency Learning Collaborative\n \n \n *Jenesse hosted its first annual Soul Cycle event\n \n \n *Halle Berry hosted her second annual â€œConversation for Jenesseâ€\x9D\n \n \n *Jenesseâ€™s Legal Department assists with trafficked youth program\n \n \n *Jenesse hosted a special presentation at Morgan Lewis Stanley, to recruit pro-bono attorneys\n \n \n  *The Grant LA Bar Foundation presented Jenesse with $10,000"
