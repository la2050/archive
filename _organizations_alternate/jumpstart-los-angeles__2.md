  <p>Jumpstart Los Angeles has achieved rapid growth over the past several years
  and become one of the leading early childhood organizations in the region.
  Since hiring our first executive director in 2009, we have grown from a small
  program serving fewer than 300 children to serve more than 1,200 children
  annually. Through partnerships with leading universities, early education
  providers, and school districts, along with support from the funding
  community, Jumpstart has quickly established a strong reputation in the
  community.</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>Jumpstart’s program at UCLA, founded in 2009, is among our best and enjoys support among the school’s faculty and administration. Now in its fourth year, Jumpstart at UCLA engages more than 70 college students each year. UCLA hosts two full-time, paid Jumpstart staff members who work on-campus and have developed strong partnerships with leading early education providers, including Los Angeles Unified School District, Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District, and Neighborhood Youth Association in Venice.</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>Nationwide, Jumpstart has trained more than 25,000 college-student and community volunteers to serve more than 100,000 pre-school children in hundreds of early learning centers, and has been widely recognized as an innovative and impactful organization.</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>Jumpstart’s program is a model in efficiency. As the organization has grown rapidly since its founding in 1993, Jumpstart has consistently decreased the cost per child-served hour from $35 to $7, a reduction of over two-thirds in fewer than 10 years. The Stanford Social Innovation Review found that Jumpstart has reduced its costs by at least 6% annually, while simultaneously achieving substantial growth. Numerous organizations have recognized Jumpstart with awards that highlight its creative partnerships and effective programs:</p>
