  Women Against Gun Violence has been around since 1993 working to prevent gun
  violence in Los Angeles City and County. We have done this work through
  storytelling. Our Speakers Bureau members, gun violence survivors themselves,
  share their stories with students throughout Los Angeles Unified School
  District so that youth can see the actual tragedy of gun violence. Our
  Speakers Bureau members also share their stories with policymakers to
  encourage change in our gun regulations. We were included in Vice President
  Biden's meetings in January 2013 where our Speakers Bureau format was
  considered part of a national solution.
