  <p>Jovenes, Inc. is a growing organization that is changing the way homeless
  youth access opportunities for a brighter future. In the last year, weâ€™ve
  doubled our housing capacity through the creation of permanent supportive and
  affordable housing. We used to only be able to house 20 youth in our
  short-term shelter programs (for lengths of stay less than 18 months). Now, we
  are able to provide youth with their own apartments and continually support
  them as they grow into self-sufficient adults. At this point, Jovenes is
  housing 41 youth across our continuum of care- more than at any other point in
  our history. Our permanent housing programs have a 96% retention rate since
  opening in 2012.</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>Launching The Beacon Network in 2011 was a major accomplishment for our organization. As a traditional social-service organization that focuses primarily on the 1:1 work with our clients, taking on TBN required a different skill-set, vision, and capacity. TBN was developed through a process that included gaining input from many different non-profit partners on what information would be most useful to their clients & staff, as well as holding focus groups of youth to test the functionality and clarity of the system, as well as marketing strategies. As a result, TBN Connect has over 4,800 searches per year!</p>
