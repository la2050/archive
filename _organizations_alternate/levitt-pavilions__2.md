  <p>Levitt Pavilions has developed an innovative program model, leveraging
  public/private partnerships in cities across the country to transform
  neglected public spaces into welcoming destinations through the power of free,
  live music. While all performances are free, all Levitt artists are paid a
  competitive fee to perform, ensuring excellence. Levitt venues serve as
  catalysts for change in a community by reclaiming green spaces, activating
  underused public spaces, & breaking social & economic barriers that often
  preclude access to the arts.</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>There are now six state-of-the-art Levitt pavilions in places as diverse as Los Angeles & Pasadena; Memphis, Tenn.; Arlington, Texas; Westport, Conn.; & Bethlehem, Pa. Each Levitt Pavilion is a community destination. Levitt’s open lawn settings encourage people to mingle, strengthening social connections.</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>But it wasn’t always this way. Consider what Levitt locations used to be:
   
   
   the nation’s largest brownfield; a problematic landfill; crime-ridden & abandoned parks; & a dormant downtown with little economic activity.</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>Today, the Levitt network serves more than half a million people each year through 300+ free concerts nationwide. Pavilions are currently in development in Denver, Sioux Falls & Houston, & we are in conversations with nearly a dozen other cities across the country.</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>The L.A. region is home to two Levitt venues. Levitt Pasadena opened in 2003, reviving an abandoned, WPA-era band shell in the once troubled Memorial Park. The national Levitt organization approached city officials with the idea to renovate the pavilion & create an annual series of free performances featuring acclaimed, emerging talent to seasoned, award-winning artists, using the arts as a vehicle to transform the park. Ten years later, Levitt Pasadena is now a treasured community asset & the park is an active & thriving magnet for families.</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>In 2007, Levitt L.A. opened in MacArthur Park, transforming this once crime-ridden park into a welcoming destination. The band shell’s renovation served as the catalyst for the overall park’s renewal. Levitt L.A. is the only organization that provides consistent free performing arts programming each year in the Westlake District, one of L.A.’s most densely populated & underserved communities. With 40 percent of the Westlake community living at or below the poverty level, Levitt L.A.’s children’s series gives thousands of underprivileged youth access to exceptional arts programming that would otherwise be cost prohibitive to attend.</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>Both Levitt venues in Southern California have a proven track record of success, & every year audiences increase. In 2012, both Levitt L.A. & Levitt Pasadena were voted “Best Free Summer Concert Series” by LA Weekly, & Levitt Pasadena was voted “Best Live Music Venue” by Pasadena Weekly. The pavilions are both centrally located & accessible by car, bus, Metro & are in walking distance of neighborhoods.</p>
