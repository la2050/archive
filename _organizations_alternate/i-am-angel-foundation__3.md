  The i.am.angel Foundation seeks to transform lives through education,
  opportunity and inspiration. We have spearheaded several programs that are
  transforming lives in East LA, particularly the Boyle Heights community. Here
  are our biggest and most successful programs: ****** i.am College Track ******
  College Track is a national educational organization that empowers students
  from underserved communities to reach their dreams of a college degree.
  College Track actively engages students over the course of eight years, from
  the summer before high school through college graduation. 100% of College
  Track seniors graduate from high school, more than 90% are admitted to a
  four-year university, and 75% of College Track students are currently
  enrolled, or have graduated from, college. Over 85% of College Track students
  will be the first person in their family to earn a college degree. The i.am
  College Track program serves 50 ambitious new students from Roosevelt High
  School every year, and continues to work with them over an 8 year cycle.
  ****** i.am Home ****** In 2010, during the height of the foreclosure crisis,
  the i.am Home program was launched. The program works with effective partner
  organizations to promote financial literacy education and provide home owner
  assistance grants to support qualifying families in need. To date i.am Home
  has provided more than $400,000 in home owner assistance grants. ****** i.am
  Scholarship ****** The i.am Scholarship program was launched in 2009. The
  program works with effective partner organizations like Oprah Winfrey’s Angel
  Network, Scholastic America and College Track to identify qualifying students
  in need of financial support. i.am angel selects students with a proven record
  of accomplishment and gives them the opportunity to chase their dreams through
  scholarship. To date the i.am Scholarship program has directly invested more
  than $500,000 in America’s future.
