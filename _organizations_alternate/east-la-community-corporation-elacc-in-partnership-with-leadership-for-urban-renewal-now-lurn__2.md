  <p>ELACC has been serving the Eastside of Los Angeles since 1995. On an annual
  basis, we provide affordable housing, community services, community
  organizing, and wealth building services to over 2,000 residents. ELACC’s
  track record includes leveraging over $135 million of investment to the
  Eastside and housing over 1,000 residents in safe, habitable, and affordable
  housing throughout East Los Angeles. We mobilize a Community Organizing base
  of over 1,300 members annually, and have helped over 3,000 families to
  purchase their first homes, avoid foreclosure, establish savings, and build
  and sustain wealth.</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>ELACC, community residents, and partner organizations have now come together to form the “Los Angeles Street Vending Campaign” to push the Los Angeles City Council to implement a policy that will provide a licensing process for vendors to sell foods without the fear criminalization. The coalition has already conducted numerous town halls throughout Los Angeles neighborhoods where there is a high concentration of street vendors, in order to begin educating and engaging them on what the City’s first comprehensive vending policy could look like.</p>
