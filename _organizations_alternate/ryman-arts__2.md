  Having spearheaded The Big Draw LA since inception in Los Angeles in 2010 and
  participated in the international Big Draw Conference in London in 2009, Ryman
  Arts is excited to be in its fourth year presenting The Big Draw LA with the
  support of a two-year grant from the James Irvine Foundation. Ryman Arts
  executive director Diane Brigham and our staff have a strong commitment to the
  philosophical underpinnings of the initiative and gained unparalleled
  experience in both producing large scale public drawing events in complex
  collaborations, and coordinating the efforts of numerous and varied groups who
  produce their own BDLA events. Our organization has engaged over 65
  organizations in The Big Draw LA, leading to over a hundred public drawing
  events. Approximately 8,000 members of the community have participated in The
  Big Draw LA flagship events, “Make Your Mark in the Park”. The success of The
  Big Draw LA initiative mirrors the success of its presenter, Ryman Arts. 
   
   
   
   
   
   Recently named a National Program of Excellence by the President’s Committee on the Arts & Humanities, Ryman Arts harnesses the talent and promise of Southern California youth who would otherwise not have access to advanced art education to help these teens reach their high potential. Ryman Arts believes that through the arts, youth can learn essential skills for both creative expression and life. Ryman Arts fosters students’ artistic development and personal confidence, and provides the knowledge and resources they need to pursue higher education and careers in the arts. Ryman Arts offers free intensive studio classes taught by master teaching artists, college and career planning, field trips, support services, and community engagement opportunities--all free of charge. Beginning with a single drawing class for 12 students in 1990, Ryman Arts has grown to 30 classes for 450 students annually, engaged 4,500+ Southern California teens in its core program, and provided outreach activities to 7,500+ inner city students. Classes are held on Sundays at the studios of Otis College of Art & Design in Los Angeles, and as of January 2013, we have expanded to offer classes on Saturdays at a second location on the campus of California State University, Fullerton in Orange County.
   
   
   
   
   
   At our recent College Day, 23 universities and art schools met with students and reviewed portfolios of their work. The Spring Career program includes a panel for students and their parents, a “Packaging Yourself” workshop, and behind the scenes tours at studios including Disney and DreamWorks Animation. Since 2005, the annual Ryman Arts student exhibition and graduation has been held at the California African-American Museum. We ensure broad access to the program with specialized outreach to underserved, low-income neighborhoods, including workshops at Title 1 high schools. There were over 225 applications for the Spring 2013 semester—the highest number of applications in years.
