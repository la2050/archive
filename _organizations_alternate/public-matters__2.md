  Public Matters is a social enterprise that builds creative and social capital
  in communities. As a for-profit business, Public Matters designs and
  implements neighborhood-based new media, education and civic engagement
  projects for social change. It cultivates cross-sector partnerships between
  grass-roots organizations, academic institutions, neighborhood residents,
  youth and local municipalities. It builds relationships and develops future
  leaders. We have a track record of innovative, impactful projects. Our project
  timelines favor deep, long-term engagement, with work measured in years not
  months. Our most important achievements are those we accomplish through our
  programs:
   
   
   
   
   
   Market Makeovers, Proyecto MercadoFRESCO, UCLA-USC Center for Population Health and Health Disparities (CPHHD) — Funded by a five-year grant through the National Institutes of Health, we worked with Torres High School, Roosevelt High School, The Office of L.A. County Supervisor Gloria Molina (D-1), Volunteers of East L.A., other local organizations, and Nathan Cheng to transform two stores in East L.A.; two more are forthcoming in Boyle Heights.
   
   
   
   
   
   Market Makeovers, Healthy Eating Active Communities Initiative — Funded by the California Endowment, we worked with The Accelerated School, The Office of L.A. Councilwoman Jan Perry (CD-9), and Nathan Cheng to transform two stores in South Los Angeles and created a media-rich online resource, www.marketmakeovers.org.
   
   
   
   
   
   PDUB Productions — We worked with Pilipino Workers Center, HyperCities, UCLA REMAP, The Office of L.A. Councilman Eric Garcetti (CD-13), and local stakeholders to create an innovative youth media + civic engagement program through which local youth created digital content about Historic Filipinotown for distribution on multiple platforms: interactive Mobile Hi Fi Tours via mobile devices and a Pilipino Jeepney; and HyperCities, an online, map-based time-travel application. 
   
   
   
   
   
   Working with mostly low-income students of color, we have a strong track record of creating emerging adult leaders. Defying the odds of low college admission rates for East L.A. students, our entire class at ELARA was accepted into a four-year college. Past students have gone on to colleges and universities including Brown, NYU, Sarah Lawrence, UCLA, and UC-Berkeley. We have helped place youth leaders in local nonprofit jobs. We currently have four Proyecto MercadoFRESCO young adult leaders who are implementing Market Makeovers, training high school students, conducting cooking demos and social marketing campaigns. 
   
   
   
   
   
   Our work has received national and local recognition. Twice, we’ve been awarded the MacArthur Foundation’s Digital Media and Learning Award, as part of HyperCities and Out The Window. Our projects have been covered by NBC, CNN, BBC Latino, Associated Press, L.A. Times, KCET, Next American City, and MIT CoLab, among others and will be featured in a forthcoming Harvard University Press book about Digital Mapping.
