  Since programming activities began in 2003, LA Commons has developed
  grass-roots projects and initiatives in 10 low-income neighborhoods: MacArthur
  Park, Koreatown, Expo Park, Chinatown, Mid-City, Sylmar, East Hollywood,
  Palms, Leimert Park and Highland Park. These programs have brought together 70
  artists and 400 youth, along with 3825 community members in an innovative
  process of grass roots artistic and cultural discovery. 
   
   
   Now in our tenth year, we have grown from a small to a mid-size arts organization with one full time executive director and four part-time staff. Over the past several years, LA Commons has developed a robust neighborhood tour program, Trekking LA, to leverage the rich content generated in our community arts projects; received contracts with the MTA and Community Redevelopment Agency (CRA-LA) and funding from The California Endowment, James Irvine Foundation, and Annenberg Foundation; and created partnerships with UCLA Department of Urban Planning, City Council offices, GOOD Magazine, Sony, and dozens of community-based non-profits. In recognition of the important role played by the organization, Executive Director Karen Mack has been appointed to two city commissions and various boards.
