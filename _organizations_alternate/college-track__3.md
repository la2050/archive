      College Track's program and services are linked to a proven model of
      college preparation and completion. Today, our national strategy stems
      from sixteen years of outstanding program results: 100% percent of our
      seniors graduate high school, compared to an average of 50% in the
      districts we serve, 90% are admitted to a four-year college, compared to
      roughly 15% of students of the same demographic, 80% of students who
      complete our high school program have graduated from, or are still
      attending college. Over time, College Track increases the number of
      college-bound students of color in each community we serve. College Track
      students are often the first in their families to attend college, and with
      this example, their families, neighborhoods, schools, and peers adopt a
      mindset that a college degree is the expectation, not the exception.
