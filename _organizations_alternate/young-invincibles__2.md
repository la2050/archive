  Young Invincibles has had notable successes in its health coverage and access
  program, establishing itself as the national leader on promoting health care
  and coverage for young adults. In 2011 and 2012, YI led a coalition of over 50
  national and local partners around our “Getting Covered” health care education
  campaign that provided information to millions of young adults on and off-line
  about how to get covered up to age 26 under the new law. As part of this
  campaign, YI released and distributed online a health care education toolkit
  to educate young people on the importance of health coverage, timed around
  Valentine’s Day, with a reach of over 1.5 million young adults. Already, over
  3.1 million uninsured young adults have taken advantage of the dependent
  coverage provision and gained affordable insurance, far exceeding
  expectations. In fact, young adults are the only demographic to see
  uninsurance rates decline during the Recession.
   
   
   
   
   
   YI has also established expertise on coverage issues for young adults. YI successfully advocated for major improvements to student health plans following the ACA, changes that have helped over 3 million students on college plans see more comprehensive, better coverage. Similarly, YI has worked with the White House and congressional leadership to get national coverage of YI members benefiting from reform, and released the first comprehensive national report and poll on the economic and health challenges facing young adults since the Recession. YI has established itself as the go-to media source for information on young adults and health care, appearing in the LA Times, San Francisco Chronicle, NY Times, Wall Street Journal, NPR, MSNBC, Fox News, and CNN, among other outlets.
   
   
   
   
   
   Last March, YI launched our National Youth Bus Tour. YI staff visited 43 cities in 20 different states, including 43 campuses and hosted over 100 youth events and roundtables designed to hear the perspective of diverse young adults on the economic, educational and health challenges they face. At our events, we provided state-specific materials on health care needs of young adults and options for coverage. The tour was covered widely, including this feature in the New York Times. The tour expanded our youth networks across the country, and particularly in California.
   
   
   
   
   
   In LA, YI’s mobile app won LA Social Innovation Fast Pitch’s grand prize of $15,000. Tamika Butler, California Director, pitched at the competition and described plans to expand mobile app in low-income LA communities. Our policy expertise and experience with education campaigns will serve as a strong backbone to this project.
