  <p>Since opening our doors in 2005, 826LA has served more than 30,000 students
  from across Los Angeles County. Thanks to the hard work of over 3,000
  volunteers and countless supporters, 826LA has increased its reach
  substantially over the past few years. In 2008, 826LA opened a new center in
  Echo Park. This fall, 826LA moved its Westside operations to Mar Vista. This
  new Mar Vista center increases 826LA’s capacity significantly, providing 2,625
  square-feet of creative space for students as well as better visibility and
  accessibility for the organization. 826LA will have the capacity to serve 30%
  more students each day through After-School Tutoring in Mar Vista; to add a
  series of evening workshops targeted at middle and high school students; and
  to recruit and train up up to 35 volunteers per week.</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>Last year, 826LA served 10,105 students last year--a 23% increase from the previous year. We are not only serving more students, but we are increasing the benefits of our programs across the academic curriculum. Over six years of assessments and surveys demonstrate that 826LA’s programs build self-esteem, teach literacy skills, and improve educational outcomes. Last year:</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>- 93% of students reported that they understood their writing assignment better thanks to the help of 826LA volunteers;</p>
   
   
   <p>- 90% of students reported that working with an 826LA volunteer in their classroom increased their confidence about writing;</p>
   
   
   <p>- 95% of students reported that they were proud of what they created during an 826LA workshop;</p>
   
   
   <p>- 100% of students reported that their grades have improved since receiving tutoring at 826LA.</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>Other notable achievements include:</p>
   
   
   <p>* In 2006, 826LA received a Proclamation of Recognition from Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, and in honor of our 5th Anniversary in 2010, 826LA received an award from the Los Angeles City Council, acknowledging 826LA’s dedication to the community;</p>
   
   
   <p>* 826LA received a Proclamation of Recognition from Los Angeles Supervisor Eric Garcetti for our work in the Echo Park community in March 2010;</p>
   
   
   <p>* 826LA was named a “Nonprofit to Follow” by Philanthropy magazine in 2012;</p>
   
   
   <p>* On April 9, 2013, 826LA will be honored during the Mayors Day of Recognition for National Service at City Hall by Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa for our work with the Corporation for National and Community Service and Volunteers In Service To America (VISTA). </p><p>Thanks in part to recruitment, training, and retention practices strengthened by AmeriCorps VISTA members, hours contributed by volunteers at 826LA increased by 40% last year!</p>
