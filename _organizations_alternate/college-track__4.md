  College Track's program and services are linked to a proven model of college
  preparation and completion. Today, our national strategy stems from sixteen
  years of outstanding program results: 100% percent of our seniors graduate
  high school, compared to an average of 50% in the districts we serve, 90% are
  admitted to a four-year college, compared to roughly 15% of students of the
  same demographic, 80% of students who complete our high school program have
  graduated from, or are still attending college. Over time, College Track
  increases the number of college-bound students of color in each community we
  serve. College Track students are often the first in their families to attend
  college, and with this example, their families, neighborhoods, schools, and
  peers adopt a mindset that a college degree is the expectation, not the
  exception.
