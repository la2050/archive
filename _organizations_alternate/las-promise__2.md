  By transforming the culture at each of our schools, LA’s Promise has already
  demonstrated success across our metrics, including early and dramatic gains at
  both high schools.
   
   
   
   
   
   - API Scores have risen 10%, or 57 points, at Manual Arts High School in the two years LA’s Promise has managed the school and 21%, or an impressive 111 points, at West Adams High School in five years. In 2011-2012 alone, the most recent data year available, the overall API across LA’s Promise schools rose by 52 points. Manual Arts experienced a 21-point increase and John Muir a 31-point increase.
   
   
   - Four-year graduation rates increased by 6% over three years at Manual Arts and 11% over five years at West Adams. 
   
   
   - The important indicators of ELA and Math Proficiency have increased across the board. The percentage of students that passed at Proficient or Advanced on the ELA California Standardized Test jumped 43% (from 19.6% to 31.2%) at Manual Arts in the three years LAP has managed the school, and increased 36% in five years (from 15.5% to 24.1%) at West Adams. Meanwhile, the percentage of students that passed Proficient or Advanced on the Math California Standardized Test rose a very dramatic 66% (from 3.2% to 5.3%) at Manual Arts in three years and 77% (from 2.4% to 10.6%) at West Adams in five years. Proficient or Advanced scores at John Muir also increased, including ELA scores increasing by 19% (from 23% to 27.3%) and Math scores increasing by 33% (from 18% to 24%) since LAP management.
   
   
   - Over the last three years, the schools average 94% attendance rates. As of today, West Adams itself now has one of the highest attendance rates (nearly 92%) and lowest dropout rates (2.3%) in LAUSD. Manual Arts and John Muir also have LAUSD-topping attendance rates of 93% and 96%, respectively.
   
   
   - The number of instructional days lost to suspensions have dropped by 69.6% at Manual Arts, 59.8% at West Adams and 27.3% at John Muir since LAP management began.
   
   
   - Seniors at West Adams Prep accepted to a four-year college more than tripled from 9% to 39% over 5 years and seniors at Manual Arts accepted to a four-year college more than doubled, from 18% to 40% in only two years. A full 100% of the recent Manual Arts High School graduates were admitted to a two- or four-year college.
   
   
   
   
   
   Perhaps most importantly: we are proud to say that, as of this writing our graduates are attending four-year colleges and universities including California Institute of Tech (Cal Tech); Colgate University; Harvard; University of California, Berkeley; University of Southern California; California State University, Los Angeles; and many, many more.
