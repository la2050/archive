  <p>As a result of Urban Peace’s leadership of the Community Safety Partnership
  in Watts, violent crime has dropped by 53% to 75% within each of the three
  Watts housing developments over that past year. Law enforcement officials are
  thrilled by the reduced crime statistics, citing that there has not been a
  single homicide in the Watts housing developments since August 2011. Community
  members have reported that residents are now feeling more safe to travel and
  frequent stores within their community, and there have been notable decreases
  in youth gang membership and activity. While we are proud of our work in
  Watts, the Urban Peace program has also had a profound effect in improving
  community safety throughout Los Angeles.</p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>Over the past 12 years, Urban Peace has established unprecedented partnerships between gang intervention workers and law enforcement throughout Los Angeles, resulting in the lowest crime rates since the 1960’s. Since 2006, gang related crimes have been reduced by 32% and the number of shots fired within Los Angles has decreased from 3,288 to 1,723, representing a 52% reduction. Overall, the crime rate is at a historical low in both the City and the County of Los Angeles. Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) Chief Charlie Beck credits Urban Peace’s work with contributing to this historic decline. Former LAPD Chief William Bratton hails our success: “The Advancement Project has been a force of nature. They have changed the way things are done in Los Angeles on gangs.” </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>Similarly, Advancement Project’s Urban Peace Academy, the only publicly supported training program for gang intervention workers, has trained over 1,200 violence intervention workers and 500 police officers to work together towards violence reduction. Recently, our training of community intervention workers that operate the Los Angeles Summer Night Lights program contributed to a 35% drop in gang related homicides last summer in and around the parks where the program operates. Similarly, throughout Los Angeles’ GRYD zones, where our Urban Peace Academy law enforcement and gang intervention graduates operate, there has been a 30% reduction in gang related crime and 42% reduction in shots fired. As crime rates continue to drop, the Urban Peace program is gaining national attention and requests for our innovative technical assistance have come from Seattle, Memphis, and Sacramento.</p>
