  CHC: Since 1992 CHC has led coalitions in South LA and beyond to advocate for
  healthy communities. CHC utilizes data, experience and the expertise of
  community stakeholders to shape policy, systems and environmental change. This
  approach provides an exceptional opportunity for people of different
  backgrounds to build a shared understanding of the degree of health justice
  issues, allowing them to examine the root causes of health inequity. Among
  many accomplishments CHC has:
   
   
   -Trained hundreds of community members to conduct neighborhood level assessments to document food and physical activity inequities in South LA leading to local policy change.
   
   
   -Led the adoption of the Baldwin Hills Oilfield Community Standards District, South LA Fast Food Interim Control Ordinance and Fast Food Moratorium.
   
   
   -Convened the Re-Imagining Empty Space Tour and Summit: http://goo.gl/UOogw-
   
   
   -Negotiated a community benefits agreement in response to the removal of 253 trees due to the transport of the Space Shuttle Endeavor. The agreement creates a South LA Open Space & Tree Master Plan. 
   
   
   
   
   
   C-Lab, Columbia University Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation: C-Lab’s research focuses on techniques for communication about urban environments. Work has included a vision plan for an estuary in South Korea, awarded the first-prize by the South Korean Urban Design Institute and a masterplan for Chengdu, China. C-Lab’s projects use mapping as a means of uncovering hidden potentials in cities. A current project maps new, unacknowledged ‘neighborhoods’ of New York, based on commonalities and underlying networks of support. C-Lab’s project ‘Locating the Middle Class in New York City’ considers several possible criteria for defining the ‘middle class’ in the city, and uses GIS data to map their footprints. In researching aging urban populations, C-Lab has produced maps of NORCs (naturally occurring retirement communities) in NY, and is currently partnering with Tongji University in Shanghai to develop strategies and research for housing the aging middle class in China. 
   
   
   
   
   
   596 Acres: In 2011, 596 Acres launched an online interactive map of all the publicly owned vacant land in Brooklyn, NY. Since then they have expanded the map by compiling and releasing data for Manhattan, Queens, and the Bronx. Workshops and online networking tools have been created to help communities share knowledge with each other and build relationships with decision-makers. In the short time since the project launched, 8 new sites have been granted official status as community-run open spaces, and 6 additional sites have been pre-approved by city agencies who have jurisdiction over them. Currently 105 groups city-wide are in the process of campaigning for access to public land. With the recent release of vacant land data for the Bronx, the 596 Acres has mapped 1394 vacant lots in 4 of the 5 boroughs and is currently working on data for Staten Island. Spanish versions are also available.
