  * Working with adult and youth members in refinery communities to achieve
  precedent-setting standards to prevent chemical leaks from thousands of valves
  at oil refineries and mandating vapor controls on refinery tankers loading in
  California. This historic regulation is now a national standard. 
   
   
   
   
   
   * Working with adult and youth members to significantly strengthen the California South Coast Air Quality Management District’s Rule 1402 to reduce allowable cancer risks from air pollution from stationary sources of pollution by 75%. 
   
   
   
   
   
   * Working with adult and youth members in refinery communities in California to achieve the nation’s most stringent regulations of “flaring,” or burning of excess gases by refineries, at both the Bay Area and South Coast Air Quality Management Districts, now a national working model that can be put in place at all refineries. In the South Coast air shed alone, by December of 2012, this regulation has achieved an estimated reduction of 1.18 tons per day of SO2 (sulfur dioxide) and 1.44 tons per day of CO2 (carbon dioxide). 
   
   
   
   
   
   * Working in intergenerational settings to lead a successful campaign against construction of an unneeded and highly-polluting power plant in the City of Vernon, California. This prevented an annual emission of 1.8 million pounds of local and regional pollution and 5.5 billion pounds of greenhouse gases from entering the environment. It also created regional awareness about health impacts of pollution, energy planning, and contributed to exposing corruption in Vernon’s city governance. 
   
   
   
   
   
   * Working with Youth members to defeat an unnecessary polluting power plant proposal in the City of South Gate, California. This campaign is analyzed in Power Politics, a book written by UCLA social anthropologist, Karen Bodkin.
   
   
   
   
   
   * Working with youth and adult members along the Long Beach Freeway (I-710) corridor and in coalition with other environmental and community groups to create an unprecedented public participation framework in the I-710 freeway expansion project led by Caltrans and Metro. We used this strategic opportunity to elevate community demands for a cleaner, healthier project. 
   
   
   
   
   
   * Working with youth and adult members, allies and academic partners to introduce a novel policy initiative in the City of Los Angeles called Clean Up Green Up to address cumulative impacts from multiple pollution sources and environmental health and justice concerns in city planning. Relying on participatory action research methods and engaging community members in the Wilmington area from the early phases of policy formulation, CBE staff and community members engaged with experts, allies, city councilmembers and the Mayor’s office to win their support for this policy. 
   
   
   
   
   
   * Building one of the most successful and vibrant environmental justice youth programs in the country during the past 15 years in Southeast Los Angeles County.
