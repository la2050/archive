  The Council for Watershed Health has collaboration in its DNA. The Los Angeles
  Basin Water Augmentation Study, begun in 2000, assembled a technical and
  funding advisory committee of federal, state, and local agencies and
  nonprofits to investigate the challenges and solutions for capturing
  stormwater in an urban environment. Early findings showed that it is safe to
  use polluted water runoff to increase our underground water supplies. Our
  publication “Stormwater: Asset Not Liability” (2nd ed. 2010) changed the way
  the region thinks about stormwater as a source of local water supplies.
   
   
   
   
   
   In 2005 the Council brought together additional partners to design and build the Elmer Avenue Neighborhood Retrofit Project. With phase I completed in 2010, the award-winning project is the most comprehensive “green street” in Los Angeles, converting a disadvantaged street in Sun Valley into a model of urban sustainability. Elmer Avenue captures and cleans more water than is used annually by the 24 houses on the block. The project is a focal point in the community with its meandering sidewalks, solar street lights, and diverse native and drought-tolerant plants. In 2012 the second phase, a mid-block alley-way, Elmer Paseo, was completed. The formerly asphalted alley now is a visually pleasing connector between the block and schools nearby that also captures and infiltrates water. 
   
   
   
   
   
   In 2005, the Council began management of the first watershed monitoring program in the region for the San Gabriel River. In 2007 we began management of a similar research program on the Los Angeles River. In 2011 we produced an authoritative State of the San Gabriel River report and symposium; the State of the Los Angeles River report and symposium will be produced in 2013. Both programs operate with a workgroup of stakeholders that set the annual research and monitoring agenda. 
   
   
   
   
   
   In 2008 we began work on a framework of indicators of watershed health in urban regions, the first such project in California to focus on cities. Completed in 2010, the project included a report card-style analysis of the state of the Arroyo Seco watershed. We are now working with the Santa Ana Watershed Project Authority on indicators development and we have a US EPA grant for the Los Angeles River Watershed. Executive Director Nancy Steele focuses her 2012-2013 Stanton Fellowship on this topic and we will have a UCLA graduate fellow from the Luskin School of Public Policy for 2013-2014.
   
   
   
   
   
   We host a Watershed Symposium series in which we bring divergent viewpoints together around timely topics. Examples include “Restoration and Development Challenges of the Los Angeles River” (2013), “On Track? High Speed Rail and the Los Angeles River” (2010), and “Nature Needs Water, Too” (2009). In 2012, the Council convened a multi-day international conference, “The Mediterranean City: A Conference on Climate Change Adaptation” which kicked off the Mediterranean Cities Climate Change Consortium (mc-4.org).
