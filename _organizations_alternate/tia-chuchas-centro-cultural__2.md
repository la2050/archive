  The Northeast San Fernando Valley is a community of 500,000 — the size of the
  City of Oakland -- yet it had no bookstores, movie houses, art galleries, or
  full fledged cultural spaces until Tia Chucha's opened its doors twelve years
  ago. We now provide a bookstore, a deli/ artisan shop, arts workshops, an art
  gallery, film nights, weekly Open Mics, community dialogues, and author
  readings. In addition we host Young Warriors, a youth empowerment group, often
  working with troubled youth through mentors, rites of passage, and the arts as
  well as own poetry press, Tia Chucha Press, and the only outdoor annual
  literacy festival for the greater San Fernando Valley: “Celebrating Words:
  Written, Performed & Sung.” We have a Mexica (so-called Aztec) danza resident
  group, Temachtia Quetzalcoatl, officially sanctioned to teach and perform this
  art form from pre-conquest Mexico and Central America. Also since Tia Chucha's
  creation we've seen the birth of independent groups like El Hormiguero (the
  Anthill), Bikesanos Bike Club, the San Fernando Arts Collective, Youth Speak
  Collective's Sports, Mural, Gardening and Digital Arts projects, and the
  establishment of a new high school with academies in Social Justice and
  Humanities, the Arts as well as Engineering and Technology called the Cesar
  Chavez Learning Academies. Our presence in a mostly run-down strip mall with
  many uninhabited spaces has brought new small businesses and even a major
  market chain. Tia Chucha's has proven that the arts stimulates economic
  activity while helping reduce violence, apathy, and low school participation.
