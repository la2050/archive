  Move LA built the powerful business-labor-environmental coalition that worked
  with LA Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and LA Metro to get the Measure R half-cent
  sales tax for transportation on the ballot in 2008 and ensure its passage.
  Because of Measure R Los Angeles has embarked on this country’s most ambitious
  transit expansion — a virtual doubling of the size of LA County’s light rail,
  subway and bus way transit system from 120 miles and 103 stations to 236 miles
  and 200 stations. 
   
   
   
   
   
   Former Santa Monica Mayor Denny Zane recognized the opportunity created by the commitment of Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, then in his first term, to building a transit system. In January 2008, with the help of the Annenberg Foundation, Zane convened a “transportation conversation” with major stakeholders, including business, labor, and environmental leaders, agency leadership, elected officials, a pollster and a political consultant. It was decided on that fateful day to mount a campaign to get a county sales tax measure to build out a robust transit system on the ballot that November.
   
   
   
   
   
   Mayor Villaraigosa has proved an energetic and skillful champion, and this coalition succeeded in passing the 30-year Measure R sales tax to provide $25 billion for public transit — even as the Great Recession came howling down upon the nation. The Mayor, LA Metro and the Move LA coalition worked with the Obama Administration, Senator Barbara Boxer and Congress to secure funding and to create an ambitious new low-interest loan program, that is the largest transportation infrastructure financing fund in the history of the U.S. Department of Transportation. 
   
   
   
   
   
   Measure R construction is in full swing: Last year LA Metro opened the Expo Line to Culver City and the Orange Line extension to Chatsworth, construction began on Expo to Santa Monica and continued on the Foothill Extension of the Gold Line to Azusa. Utilities are being relocated so construction can begin on the Westside Subway and the Regional Connector, and Metro is showing off station designs for the Green Line extension to LAX and options for the Sepulveda corridor. Buoyed by this momentum this business-labor-environmental coalition went back to voters in November 2012 to extend Measure R and enable Metro to use the longer revenue stream to secure financing and accelerate construction — at a time when interest rates and construction costs are at historic lows. Measure J won an overwhelming 66.1% of the vote, proving voters enthusiastically support this transit revolution, but failed to pass because of a ‘technicality’ — only in California do such measures require 2/3 voter approval to become law.
   
   
   
   
   
   One clear measure of Move LA’s success is that the Measure R campaign secured $25 billion for transit capital and operations, an investment expected to result in 400,000 good jobs and a major boost to the local and regional economy.
