      Here in the Los Angeles region, the Red Cross responds on average to one
      emergency every day, ranging from single-home fires to wildfires affecting
      hundreds of families. This past fiscal year alone, we responded to 328
      emergencies and assisted 457 families, opening 10 shelters and activating
      feeding canteens more than 15 times. This is only possible through our
      dedicated staff and volunteers taking the required training, being
      on-call, and working as a team to support the communities we serve. It is
      this preparation that allows us not only to respond to emergencies here
      but also support national operations such as Superstorm Sandy. To date, we
      have deployed four Emergency Response Vehicles and more than 160 staff and
      volunteers from Los Angeles to the East Coast. In addition to supporting
      relief operations, deployment also helps our local volunteers to get the
      hands-on experience they will need when a large disaster occurs here at
      home.
       
       
       
       
       
       Additionally, the American Red Cross Los Angeles Region was very successful in launching the PrepareLA campaign last year. The combination of a public awareness campaign and new Community Ambassador and Faith-Based programs have already started to create a word-of-mouth, multiplying effect that has resulted in a 66% increase in the number of individuals participating in free preparedness education presentations. While two years ago our volunteers were cold calling community and faith-based organizations and schools to offer these free services and were being largely turned down, now we are facing the challenge of keeping up with the increased demand.
       
       
       
       
       
       Other major accomplishments during fiscal year 2012 include:
       
       
       
       
       
       o Conducting free Preparedness Education presentations to 24,871 individuals (almost half of these presentations were directed towards vulnerable populations including 34% youth and 6% seniors); 
       
       
       o Providing 27% of Preparedness Education presentations to individuals in languages other than English, including: Spanish, Chinese, Hebrew, Russian, Korean, Japanese, Tagalog, and Thai;
       
       
       o Making 321,411 impressions at community events;
       
       
       o Enlisting 14 Community Ambassadors to represent 23% of Los Angeles communities;
       
       
       o Securing 35 Faith-Based affiliates, whose partnerships drove over 15% of our Preparedness Education requests;
       
       
       o Engaging 1,595 Youth and Young Adult Volunteers via 52 Red Cross Youth Clubs;
       
       
       o Increasing the number of trained and ready-to-deploy Disaster Volunteers to 1,611;
       
       
       o Augmenting our sheltering capacity from 210,000 to 258,149 spaces;
       
       
       o Completing 144 new shelter surveys, which provide us with critical information regarding how many individuals will be allowed at each shelter site in an emergency; and
       
       
       o Adding the capacity to serve an additional 150,000 meals a day through new agreements, which will enable us to serve nearly 2 million meals a day in the event of a catastrophic disaster.
