  <p>LAANE was formed in 1993 to improve the quality of life and the environment
  in low-income communities in LA. Using research, organizing,
  coalition-building, policy advocacy and communications, LAANE has won programs
  that uplift job quality in local industries, provide health benefits for
  workers, and increase the number of and access to good jobs as well as
  training for them. Our work has won policies that link economic development to
  cleaning up the environment in low-income communities.</p>
   
   
   <p>LAANE helped to launch the Community Benefits movement in 2001 and built coalitions that won Community Benefits Agreements for major economic developments, guaranteeing a wide range of environmental, economic and other benefits for communities. Our groundbreaking work on the CBA for LAX Airport allocated $500 million to environmental studies and mitigations that have reduced noise and air pollution generated by the Airport.</p>
   
   
   <p>LAANE’s work on trucking at the Ports of LA and Long Beach established a “concession” program that has resulted in scrapping 16,000 polluting trucks and replacing them with trucks meeting the highest standards for low emissions—reducing truck-caused pollution by 80% to date.</p>
   
   
   <p>We have won approval of policies to uplift job quality and improve job access and training in construction, including developments at the Port of LA, work under the Department of Public Works, and, most recently, major transit projects planned by the County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. These Construction Careers Policies have already yielded training and employment for thousands of disadvantaged workers and will ultimately reach close to 90,000. One of our newest projects provides for training disadvantaged LA workers to carry out energy efficiency measures in buildings all over the City in partnership with the Department of Water and Power.</p>
   
   
   <p>Much of our work has been about job quality—beginning with our victory in the 1997 landmark LA Living Wage Ordinance. Since then, we have won other living wage policies and upgraded the original policy several times.</p>
   
   
   <p>We have produced the highest quality research reports on the industries that we have targeted and on poverty and jobs. We developed a communications program that rivals those of many much larger non-profit organizations.</p>
   
   
   <p>Isidore Electronics Recycling is in its second year collecting e-waste and training and employing the previously incarcerated. A staff of 6 operates out of a warehouse in northeast LA. Trainees learn to de-manufacture e-waste, repair and refurbish electronics for reuse, staff collection events and operate the e-commerce store. Isidore has collected and/or processed over 110,000 pounds of electronics and earned revenue through e-scrap sales and its Ebay store. Clients include American Apparel, Pitches County Detention Center, LA Car Guy, and Helms Bakery Properties. All employees make at least $10/hour with opportunities for advancement.</p>
