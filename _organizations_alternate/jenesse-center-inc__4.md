  Jenesse Center has long believed that in order to make a real and lasting
  change in how families and communities view and respond to domestic violence,
  we have to talk about it openly and honestly. Since their inception, Jenesse
  has successfully begun to change the conversation on domestic violence and
  remove a lot of the stigma unfairly associated with the issue.
   
   
   
   
   
   The “Conversations” events began in 1999 to bring together new and potential friends and supporters, in a relaxed environment to discuss new and exciting ways to support Jenesse. The events also provide an opportunity to discuss domestic violence without the stigma that is usually associated with this issue and remind people that victims of domestic violence should be applauded and supported in their efforts to stand tall, and ready, to improve their lives and the lives of their children.
