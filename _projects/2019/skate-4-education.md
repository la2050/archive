title: Skate-4-Education
project_summary: >-
  The inner-city is known to be a high crime rate area, with high levels of gang
  and drug activity. The public schools are notorious for being over-crowded and
  underfunded. The majority of the inner-city youth interested in skating come
  from low-income or poverty stricken families; many from broken homes. We saw
  the inner-city youth as vulnerable group with too many chances to go down the
  wrong path so have created a program called 'Skate-4-Education" that trades
  skateboarding for education.

Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.: []
Briefly tell us a story that demonstrates how your organization turns inspiration into impact.: >-
  We opened The Garage Board Shop with the intention of using skateboarding to
  help keep low-income, under-served kids off of the street. Soon after the
  opening of our retail location, we created the non-profit The Urban Warehouse
  to expand our reach and impact. Over the past 12 years, we have worked with
  other non-profits and organizations to allow our members to take part in
  projects and events that would otherwise be outside of their financial reach.
  Our primary mission and ultimate goal is to liberate our members from the
  chains of poverty and stereotypes that come with being a part of low-income
  communities like our own. We work hard to instill a desire for a higher
  education, getting our members past k-12 and into an institution of higher
  learning is just as important as getting them to master tricks on a
  skateboard. Everything we do, is for the community. All of our events, from
  weekly food banks, toy drives, and our after-school tutoring program are
  tailored to the benefit of every member of our community.
Which metrics will your submission impact?:
  - College matriculation rates
  - Proficiency in English and Language Arts and Math
  - Suspension and expulsion rates
Will your proposal impact any other LA2050 goal categories?: []
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - East LA
  - LAUSD
How will your project make LA the best place?: >-
  The goal of this project is to make sure that students are able to succeed
  through their academic life and ensure they pursue a higher education. Through
  this project we trade education for a variety of different extracurricular
  activities such as skateboarding, music, and art. We will let the youth use
  the resources in our facility which consist of an indoor skatepark, DJ room,
  and Silkscreening studio at no financial cost but with a cost of good grades
  proper sportsmanship. We will aim to serve the youth in the greater East Los
  Angeles area but we are welcome to work students from any area. East Los
  Angeles is know for the moderate to high crime rate, with high levels of drug
  infestation but more importantly the schools being over crowded and
  underfunded.
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects)
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Defining success means that our students are learning to activities such as
  music, art, and skateboarding. More importantly it means that our students are
  on top of their academic studies and on a path top college which is the
  ultimate goal.
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?: []
