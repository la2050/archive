title: Shared Harvest
project_summary: >-
  SHF curates flexible opportunities to leverage talent in the nonprofit sector
  while reducing student debt. LA has $51 billion in student debt with
  minorities and women being most impacted. We plan to reverse the brain drain
  in resource poor communities of LA with our approach to increase human capital
  by re-engaging professionals in social impact. Through partnerships with
  cities and businesses, we're changing this liability into a tremendous asset
  and a more diverse volunteer workforce.

Briefly tell us a story that demonstrates how your organization turns inspiration into impact.: >-
  Shared Harvest believes that talent and lived experiences are valuable
  currencies in today’s global market. 
   
   
   
   As the founder, my first job was as a water fetcher at age 4. Carrying buckets of water on my head taught me patience, efficiency and how little you can earn within a day of work. Fast forward to my family’s imigration to the USA, braiding hair and selling corn in downtown LA became my new hustle. These experiences cultivated my grit, creative resourcefulness which became invaluable as I navigated my career as a first-generation student. I’m now a solution-driven Emergency Medicine (EM)  doctor and Global Public Health practitioner who founded a platform that is disrupting the student debt crisis and helping people actualize their own self worth and value. 
   
   
   
   My co-founder, Briana, is also a first-generation EM doctor who is passionate about serving her community. With a father who always had several side hustles and a mother who went back to night school for professional advancement, she had a sense of responsibility instilled in her at a young age. While training for medicine was grueling, she prioritized finding the time to take care of those who helped take care of her. She is adept at wearing multiple hats: single mother, doctor, teacher, and a social entrepreneur. 
   
   
   
   We not only represent professionals with student loan debt, but the most marginalized and impacted population: black women. Women currently hold $900b in student debt with black women being the most adversely affected. Additionally, gender and racial wage gap disparities affect this population the most, even at the highest levels of education. 
   
   
   
   We have both been personally affected by the detrimental effect that student loans has on mental health. For myself, I had significant financial anxiety after complications with my first pregnancy despite being a doctor. Briana, lost her husband when he suddenly committed suicide after he struggled with the emotional weight of his achievements and feeling enough financial freedom to take the time to adequately address his mental health. His sudden death at 33 was jarring to all of us and spoke to the need for society to do better to support those who seek to better themselves.

Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Shared Harvest has a targeted goal of increasing the rate of volunteerism by
  5% percent in 1 year. We want to increase the number of nonprofits on our
  platform by a minimum of 12 in one year and aim to have 6 corporate clients
  with at least 20% of their workforce participating in skills-based
  volunteering through our platform. We will collect both quantitative and
  qualitative data from members of our volunteer, nonprofit, corporate, and
  government network so that we continually improve the level of connectedness.
   
   
   
   A major part of Shared Harvest’s initiative to improve connectivity between Los Angelenos, nonprofit organizations, and businesses is our web based platform. We aim to empower professionals to define skills in broader context using technology to help build resumes that include hard and soft skills and relationships that happen on and offline. 
   
   
   
   We have identified our business objectives/goals as follows: 
   
   
   
   1) Increased minority and women engagement - targeted campaigns and measured recruitment of women and minorities to the platform from all sources (employed and unemployed)
   
   
   
   2) Increased professional human resource capacity - our Speakerbox initiative for example provides higher level professional services for nonprofits while increasing professional skills of these volunteers in public speaking 
   
   
   
   3) Impact on criminal justice reform - in our first year our company has chosen a social impact focus directly measuring how many stipends are going toward projects related to social justice by monitoring volunteer activities with partners Homeboy Industries and Uncommon Law and potential future partners like the Bail Project and UnEARTH.
   
    
   
   4) Broaden civic engagement in LA area: directly measure number of completed projects and volunteer hours against previous years and social impact created from projects (ie money saved by nonprofits/social impact and survey nonprofits on the cost-savings of projects completed.
   
   
   
   In addition to our overarching goals, we plan to monitor the specific metrics: website metrics - site visitors, number of visitors, bounce rate, average page time, number of pages viewed per session, call to action/click through rate, user ages, geographic location, ethnicity, number of projects participated, amount of student loan debt, implementing student loan debt reduction meter on website for LA. implementing total calculated volunteer hours, amount of student debtcoins earned and stipends paid out, projects completed, degrees, lender affiliation and satisfaction, employment status, and social causes as defined by our five United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
