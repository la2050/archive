title: The Larchmont Model-Teacher Initiative
project_summary: >-
  The Larchmont Model Teacher Initiative codifies the social and emotional
  learning approach developed at Larchmont Charter School over its successful
  14-year history. Larchmont's diverse-by-design, constructivist educational
  model can reach more kids by defining it first amongst Los Angeles educators
  and then rolling it out nation-wide. We will train teachers to provide diverse
  learning environments, dignity in the classroom, and equal access to college
  education for all students.

What does your organization do?: >-
  The mission of Larchmont Charter School is to provide a socio-economically,
  culturally and racially diverse community of students with an exceptional
  public education.
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.: []
Briefly tell us a story that demonstrates how your organization turns inspiration into impact.: >-
  In 2005, Larchmont Charter School was founded by a group of parents who
  refused to stand by and allow their public schools to falter. They drew upon
  the professional and cultural resources of their diverse Los Angeles
  neighborhoods (primarily Hollywood, West Hollywood, Larchmont, and Koreatown)
  to build a community of engaged and committed families. Now in its 14th year,
  and successfully scaled up to serve students K-12, the school has responded to
  the academic needs of its community to become one of the leading public
  schools in the city (and state.) Further, Larchmont recognizes the importance
  of academics, social/emotional learning, and behavioral factors for all
  grades. The school’s constructivist philosophy dictates that every child has a
  right to build upon his/her/their strengths, and each classroom is a
  collective of individual learners, not a group that can be instructed to
  median standards. This requires intensive attention from our educators. In the
  younger grades, we developed tools to assist teachers in this effort, such as
  the Whole-Child Check In, where faculty can track student performance in
  academics and social-emotional learning based on factors beyond test
  scores--factors that may include learning differences related to cultural
  differences. This Whole-Child Check In has scaled to our 6th grade, but more
  work is needed to adapt it developmentally and culturally to the secondary
  campus.
   
   
   
   For the Whole-Child scaling to be successful, our educators must understand that their students’ cultural norms may be different from their own. We seek to educate our faculty about systemized classroom management plans and initiatives, such as eco-literacy and school-wide anti-bullying programs and then build and codify systems for our educators to be aware of how their own unconscious biases may create obstacles for equity in the classroom, and that their students’ awareness of such issues may vary widely.
   
   
   
   We have produced three graduating classes so far, and 95% of our students were accepted into college. Most of these students are the first in their families to attend college. We are inspired by the effectiveness of this model and the opportunities it allows our students.
Which metrics will your submission impact?:
  - College matriculation rates
  - Students’ perceived sense of safety at and on the way to school
  - Student education pipeline
Will your proposal impact any other LA2050 goal categories?: []
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - Our project has an LA beginning and will then reach teachers nationwide.
How will your project make LA the best place?: >-
  Larchmont Charter School has begun the strategic development of a multi-tier
  support system to reach each of the 1451 students currently enrolled in our
  K-12 school. We need to expand our program to fully turn the philosophy and
  protocols of this model into a codified, scalable, learning system. Educators,
  leaders, and board members of Larchmont Charter School believe that every
  child arrives with different cultural influences and deserves the right to
  progress with through systems of inclusion rather than systems that
  discriminate against minorities, those with learning differences, language
  barriers, or the effects of poverty. All students are met respectfully in our
  classrooms, with curriculum appropriate for their level, but the need for a
  strategic, articulated, codified system citing how educators assess each
  learner, at all grade levels and across four geographically and
  demographically different campuses and then how educators will offer each
  student the appropriate universal design for instruction are the core goals
  this grant will allow us to achieve. We seek to provide this tool not only to
  our own faculty but also to other educators of diverse groups of students who
  seek the success this model allows for their own learning communities.
   
   
   
   The Larchmont Model Teacher Initiative will develop the elements of the model and train current faculty. It will then further scale the model for success K-12. Once the model is fully documented, a plan to educate other teachers nationwide in how to implement the model will begin. We respectfully request funding from The Goldhirsh Foundation to embark on a 2-year plan to codify our system and educate as many teachers as possible, starting with those in Los Angeles. This plan allows both Larchmont Charter School and Los Angeles to be leaders in this field, and help define a progressive system of diverse-by-design education that succeeds, especially in assisting students from low-income families, students with learning differences and special needs, and English learners.
   
   
   
   Year 1 Timeline:
   
   -Deploy grade-level coordinators to collect best practices in The Larchmont Model (such as social and emotional training tools, eco-literacy, Whole-Child Check-in, and more.
   
   -Develop and codify the elements of The Larchmont Model at all grade levels
   
   -Write and edit the model as a publishable document
   
   -Plan, write, and execute survey system with metrics.
   
   -Train Larchmont Charter School faculty at all grade levels so competencies, expectations, and outcomes are clear.
   
   
   
   
   
   Year 2
   
   -Continue training (new) faculty and refining model
   
   -Plan and execute workshops and culminating symposium.
   
   -Plan and execute marketing plan to publicize workshops and symposia
   
   -Survey participants and modify/define documents.
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects)
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Techniques for measuring success will be built into the project. A survey
  system (before and after participation in our workshops, for instance) will
  help us track comprehension of The Larchmont Model and its benefits. We also
  survey stakeholders for their advice and assessments of the curriculum before
  it is executed.
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?: []
