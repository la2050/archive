title: Community Air Quality Monitoring
project_summary: >-
  Following on our previous air quality monitoring of Los Angeles, we are
  working to install next generation air sensors at public library branches
  throughout the city. In addition to the sensors and the real time data they
  will provide to communities, we are developing curriculum and workshops for
  neighborhoods and communities to better understand their environment.

What does your organization do?: >-
  Volunteer centered open environmental monitoring. More freely available open
  data is better for everyone. Our work is aimed at putting data & collection in
  the hands of people.
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.:
  - Los Angeles Public Library
  - Los Angeles Makerspace / Two Bit Circus
Briefly tell us a story that demonstrates how your organization turns inspiration into impact.: >-
  We launched Safecast immediately after the March 11, 2011 earthquake and
  tsunami which struck Japan and the subsequent meltdown of the Fukushima
  Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. Initially a reaction to the lack of data
  available, we quickly began monitoring, collecting, and openly sharing
  information on environmental radiation, growing quickly in size, scope, and
  geographical reach. After the publication of our data evacuation areas in
  Japan were changed and countless families used the data to decide if they
  should relocate or not.
   
   
   
   Today our radiation data set has reached well over 100 million measurements and is the largest ever of its kind. Safecast data is known to be of excellent quality due to its being unbiased and transparently collected by individual volunteers. Safecast radiation data has been used by individuals to make decisions around their own safety and potential radiation exposure, research scientists, governments, and even artists. In 2018 Popular Mechanics declared that "Safecast has revolutionized citizen science."
   
   
   
   Branching our from radiation, in 2017 we deployed our first air quality monitors in and around Los Angeles and have collected and published approximately 1.1 million discrete and verifiable measurements.
   
   
   
   Most importantly, Safecast has enabled people to easily monitor their own homes and environments, and to free themselves of dependence on government and other institutions for this kind of essential information. We are happy to be playing a major continuing role in the emergence of technically competent citizen efforts worldwide.
Which metrics will your submission impact?:
  - Exposure to air toxins
  - Prevalence of adverse childhood experiences
  - Resilient communities
Will your proposal impact any other LA2050 goal categories?: []
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
How will your project make LA the best place?: >-
  Accessible, reliable environmental data is vital for the health and safety of
  all people. Unfortunately, air quality data is limited: current public
  measurements are too generalized to give accurate information as sensors
  aren’t located where people live but at government facilities. Air quality
  data is normally not transparent enough for people to make informed personal
  health decisions. This proposal to expands our existing open source air
  quality data set through a network of connected environmental monitoring
  sensors based at each of the 73 branches of the LA Public Library with the
  following objectives:
   
   
   
   * Promote neighborhood science that empowers individuals and communities in their personal health decision making
   
   * Further develop a comprehensive data set showing trends in LA air quality by neighborhood
   
   * Document the effect open source environmental data collection and environmental data use has on individuals’ and communities’ abilities to access public services, interact with local governments, and positively affect an individual’s personal choices to address climate change
   
   
   
   LAPL branches are trusted community hubs serving more than 4 million Angelenos last year. LAPL’s goal is to serve all neighborhoods equally, however, poorer neighborhoods make use of library services to a much greater degree than affluent ones. LAPL reports that 32% of library patrons do not have connectivity outside of the library. 60% of the people using library-based STEAM programs serve are low income, 53% are Latinx, and 12% African American. 
   
   
   
   Watts, a predominantly Latinx neighborhood with a significant African American population, has two library branches serving two zip codes. The Mark Twain Branch is adjacent to the 110 freeway and the Alma Reaves Woods Branch is located near a park. By increasing air quality monitoring in these two locations, Watts residents will have real-time particulate matter readings at these two sites. With greater granularity we can see changing PM patterns and communicate findings immediately and directly. Safecast’s 24 hour and 30 day mapped visualizations allow residents to see how markedly air quality changes from one location to another and what emerging trends are occurring.
   
   
   
   Our partnership with LAPL means we can bring additional sensors to communities where people may not otherwise be able to afford the devices or do not have internet connections to access and use the Safecast air quality data set. Safecast will publicize real-time measurements to all library patrons and will provide data and environmental literacy modules supporting LAPL’s technology programs. These two activities will integrate the data into resident’s everyday lives.
   
   Since 2016 we’ve collected ~1.1 million measurements in LA County from 20 stationary devices. We have much yet to do in making LA the best place to LIVE. Thank you!
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects)
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  We push for open source standards and greater data transparency that enables
  communities to produce personally relevant environmental data. With 20 sensors
  Safecast has collected more than 1.1 million air quality measurements in Los
  Angeles in under 3 years. Success as part of LA2050 means improved access to
  neighborhood-level air quality readings. We’d like to reach 5 million air
  quality measurements in the first year - but more importantly success will be
  measured in how many people gained access to and use their data.
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?: []
