Briefly tell us a story that demonstrates how your organization turns inspiration into impact.: >-
  #HashtagLunchbag was spontaneously established on December 25, 2012. A group
  of friends in a Los Angeles apartment were struggling to find an innovative
  and synergistically meaning manner in which to support fellow Angelenos
  experiencing homelessness. After a few failed community outreach attempts, the
  groups of friends decided to create a unique giving experience.The group of
  friends went to their local grocery store and bought enough food to prepare
  100 lunches. The friends connected with each other on a different level, while
  having the time of their lives! Through this jovial and meaningful effort, the
  friends connected with their communities on a different level as well. The
  group’s first distribution was near the Santa Monica Pier and Venice
  Boardwalk; the group connected with various individuals experiencing
  homelessness and hunger. The friends shared the meals they prepared and
  received insight into the experiences of their homeless neighbors. After the
  initial experience, the friends sought to share this experience with more of
  their friends — by repeating and expanding their efforts. Through social media
  platforms, the group tagged photos of their experiences with #HashtagLunchbag
  as an ode to hashtags and their efforts. Thus, the advocacy campaign and
  outreach project that is #HashtagLunchbag was initiated. They decided to
  repeat their #HashtagLunchbag efforts in January 2013. As the impact
  increased, the scope and goal of #HashtagLunchbag expanded. Eventually,
  #HashtagLunchbag set a goal of making 1,000 meals. 100 people arrived to
  support the effort, and 1,000 meals were successfully made and distributed.
  Additionally, group members added love notes of encouragement to each meal to
  further acknowledge the fellow humans the group members were feeding and
  connecting with, to remind their fellow Angelenos that they were visible and
  important community members. 
   
   
   
   The efforts have exponentially expanded to include over 35 chapters across the US and Asia. The organization has also had one-time events in various countries in Europe and Africa. The model has garnered the attention and support of multiple media and news outlets, thereby furthering the organization’s awareness and reach.

How will your project make LA the best place?: >-
  #HashtagLunchbag would like support from the LA2050 initiative to expand the
  reach of their love, via a digital “love wall” installation, that will rotate
  through various communities within Los Angeles County. #HashtagLunchbag
  proposes that the “love wall” will remain in each community for a period of 3
  connective months. The Love Wall will be strategically installed in protected
  areas, for large projections on buildings and throughout neighborhoods across
  Los Angeles County. In the tradition of the “love notes” placed in lunchbags
  during our #HashtagLunchbag events, people across Los Angeles County, and
  beyond, can upload love notes to the digital wall via an app. The user is
  given the chance to purchase lunch for someone experiencing homelessness, from
  afar, while spreading their message far & wide, through the wall projection,
  for a fee of $3 per note.
   
   
   
   Phases:
   
   App & digital wall development (2 months)
   
   Community Partners & Business Collaboration
   
   Social Media Marketing
   
   
   
   Information about the population being served â€¨
   
   On any given day in Los Angeles County, there are approximately 53,000 people experiencing homelessness. The Love Wall strives to impact the mitigation of homelessness & serve a multitude of populations including, but not limited to, Angelenos experiencing homelessness; Angelenos looking to engage & connect with fellow community members, & serve fellow Angelenos experiencing homelessness; tourists visiting Los Angeles, who would like to further connect with & serve the Los Angeles community. The #HashtagLunchbag Love Wall lunch building experience will perpetuate further service driven activism & action oriented love, whether or not it is through the #HashtagLunchbag program. 
   
   
   
   A timeline of activities 
   
   The development of the application will be roughly 6 weeks, with the first installation to take place within 2 weeks following the completion of the application. We anticipate establishing locations for the wall to be temporarily installed, for three months at a time, beginning 6 months before the first official installation. We will be 18 months out for planning, so that locations have adequate time for preparation, and that the wall location calendar remains clear and organized.
   
   
   
   How the project will make measurable progress towards making LA the best place to â€¨CONNECT:
   
   The #HashtagLunchbag Love Wall is an extension of the Living Through Giving foundation’s mission to not only make a positive change, but to also promote and further a positive culture. Los Angeles will be the first city to house a moveable wall of love, connecting people via both technology and social media, providing organized acts of love. Through social media, the #HashtagLunchbag Love Wall will be able to gauge the impact and interest of users via their reactions, levels of participation, and sustained engagement, such as social media sharing, social media liking, repeat Love Wall visits to the same community rotation or to a different one.
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Research (identifying / understanding the problem)
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Through social media, we will be able to gauge the engagement of users.
  Additionally, we will be able to track how many lunches are donated, and how
  many messages of love are submitted, based on the data we will receive from
  the custom designed application.
   
   As an organization, we will be analyzing messages, as many will be inspired by the writers’ past, or life events they’ve experienced. The number of lunches purchased is a quantitative measure, while the content is qualitative.
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?: []
