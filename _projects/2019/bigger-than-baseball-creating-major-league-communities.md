title: 'BIGGER THAN BASEBALL: Creating Major League Communities'
project_summary: >-
  Through Dodgers Dreamfields, we create vibrant spaces for communities to play
  and provide ample opportunities for community involvement at these sites.
  Through Dodgers RBI program, we aim to increase participation in
  baseball/softball by utilizing fitness clinics, baseball/softball clinics,
  mini festivals and MORE! We are confident that we will create access for over
  310,000 youth this year alone, along with their families across 50 Dreamfields

Briefly tell us a story that demonstrates how your organization turns inspiration into impact.: |-
  A story from RBI Coach Clemente Arrizon from Lincoln Park Recreation Center:
   
   “I had a young man who played baseball here go through some hard times. During his baseball season, his mother passed away. I got the call from his grandma during one of his practices and she was coming to pick him up. I brought him to the office with his grandma and we were able to talk together. The young man was sad, obviously. He cried but before he left to go be with his grandma, I told them to come back to the practice and games. There’s a lot of gangs in our neighborhood, and I knew that this kid needed to stay involved. The team, the coach, and the structure helped him get through a hard time and stay safe. The park became his second home and it really, in my eyes, saved his life. I think that the Dodgers Foundation, the Dodgers Organization, all these sponsors.... they really need to know that. I know they cut a check and help communities, but they need to know that they are saving lives. I want to let them know that. You drive by from Monday to Saturday and the entire park is Dodger blue. The department of recreation and parks and management believe in me. With their support and Dodgers RBI we save lives, guide kids to college and make our community safer. But most importantly, Dodgers RBI gives us the opportunity to turn the T-Ball and Coach pitch players into responsible teens and it gives the minors, majors, junior baseball and girls softball players the opportunity to become responsible adults”.
Which metrics will your submission impact?:
  - Number of children enrolled in afterschool programs

Will your proposal impact any other LA2050 goal categories?: []
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
How will your project make LA the best place?: >-
  From 2014-2019, both Dreamfields and RBI programs have grown substantially
  within the LA community, from serving 2,700 RBI participants (2014) to 9,300
  participants (2018) and refurbishing 50 Dreamfields across LA. LADF promotes
  play to a level that has increased access to parks, enrollment of kids in
  after-school programs, and increased opportunities for inter-generational play
  in LA. LADF has responded to the lack of LA park space in large urban zones by
  completing 50 Dodgers Dreamfields in some of the most underserved communities
  across LA. By doing so, we have created access for over 300,000 youth. LADF
  will not stop and recently committed to completing 50 additional Dreamfields
  by 2033 which will significantly impact PLAY in LA and help commemorate the
  75th Anniversary of the Dodgers historic move to LA. This year, we will
  refurbish Dreamfields 51, 52, and 53. Our 51st Dreamfield will be designed for
  youth with special needs at Jack Bulik Park, located in the City of Fontana,
  an area in the Inland Empire that serves 3,000+ special needs children. This
  universally accessible field will meet the needs of individuals with both
  mental and physical disabilities. Dreamfields 52 and 53 will be located at
  Gonzales Park in Compton. With a 10,397-youth population and a poverty level
  of 26.60% refurbishing Gonzales Park can help increase park access and
  contribute to positively community outcomes. By refurbishing Jackie Robinson
  Stadium, this will help commemorate the 100th birthday of this remarkable
  baseball legend. 
   
    In 2019, LADF will serve over 10,500 youth in our RBI program, across 85 locations and in collaboration with 13 affiliate partners. This year, there will be significant growth in East Los Angeles and Long Beach and the City of Compton Parks and Recreation will join RBI with a total of 360 participants, ages 5-15 across 8 locations. We also anticipate growth in teams at additional locations throughout South Los Angeles. LADF has placed emphasis on growing girls’ participation in the sport by adding more softball teams throughout the program, creating more opportunities to play. On average, girls’ participation in RBI grows by a rate of 49% each year. In 2019, the RBI softball program will expand from 92 teams to 126 teams. This does not include the estimated 2,000 girls ages 5-12 that will play baseball in a co-ed format. Creating space for young women to play softball amongst their peers can be a valuable and empowering development zone, especially when coupled with a positive female coach/role model. Finally, RBI will partner with Up2Us Sports to implement trauma informed workshops to assist coaches positively engage with youth in low income communities who may experience stress and trauma. By providing these workshops LADF is attempting to help youth thrive in their environment regardless of the negative behaviors they may experience, ultimately ensuring that even the most vulnerable communities are ready to PLAY in LA.
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Lateral application (testing feasibility of a proven action/solution to a new
  issue or sector)
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  LADF administers a comprehensive evaluation system for both Dreamfields and
  RBI, which provide direct insight on participants’ experiences, program
  elements, and community needs. LADF gathers qualitative data by conducting pre
  and post interviews, surveys, and focus groups with program participants,
  partners, volunteers, and community members. By doing so, LADF evaluates their
  programs and activations. This year the Hello Insight Sports Tool will be
  fully implemented to youth ages 9-18 at all RBI locations in Los Angeles.
  Hello Insight Sports Tool, is a youth development tool designed to help
  organizations evaluate social and emotional learning (SEL) amongst their
  youth. Last year, the sports tool was administered to Dodgers RBI players ages
  9-18 at seven pilot locations. The tool focuses on development in the areas
  of: Academic Self-Efficacy, Contribution, Goal Orientation, Positive Identity,
  Self-Confidence, Self-Management, Social Capital, Social Connections, and
  Social Skills. The tool will allow Dodgers RBI staff to have instant access to
  the program’s aggregated data to make data informed decisions about resources
  and training interventions for coaches and staff that can positively affect
  youth development outcomes. 
   
   Additionally, LADF will continue to measure the impact of the Dodgers Dreamfields program by selecting Dreamfield sites based on the following criteria: High need for youth baseball/softball recreation space, racial diversity, high park need metric, amount of youth living in the surrounding community, and current baseball/softball popularity and participation rates.
