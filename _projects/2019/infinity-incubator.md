  The Infinity Incubator concept came to life through the insight that,
  "creative passion lies in the playground." And as the landscape shifted from
  analog to digital, how people communicate, consume, produce and create content
  has significantly shifted. The knowledge, the education and the resources
  needed to navigate this new landscape are often limited in-access to, or
  underfunded.

  * Over the past six years we have developed, curated, tested, measured and
  repeated smaller versions of this project in NYC, Austin and LA markets. We've
  focused on applying our combined knowledge from corporate careers, Rock and
  Roll Hall of Fame mentors, and personal experience into developing a
  multiplatform model that can help a young aspiring artist fulfil her or his
  dream of a commercially viable creative career. 
   
   
   
   * Our target is young independent artists on the path to a creative professional career. Our secondary target are tenured, successful, later generation artists looking to pass on their wisdom and experience. Our tertiary target are brands, businesses, organizations and foundations who support our mission to be the bridge connecting the rear guard to the new guard during these times of change.
   
   
   
   * To date, we've interviewed over 200 creators and continue to support four new guests a week on Trip Digital Radio, a platform with +100k avid-listeners. In the past 30 days, over 60k minutes were viewed and listened to on youtube, spotify and iTunes by over 4k people. We stream every Wednesday from 7-9 PM PDT on Dashradio.com/nativerhymes, a non-commercial / ad-free digital radio platform with 10m subscribers.
   
   
   
   * Past six months we've began to beta test the Infinity Incubator concept at a live / work studio space in an artist community. We've identified clear paths to collaboratively build and nurture relationships with each target audience. As a result we are actively curating a studio that is accessible to young creatives, students and independent professionals as a functional resource and network for a low accessible cost. 
   
   
   
   Timeline: 
   
   * Q2 APR-JUN: Round two of beta test recruitment and revenue model to determine the optimum pricing and operational variables. Adjust and tweek model based on past six-months of learnings. Explore new real estate locations with mixed use live/work, and commercial only raw spaces.
