Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.: []
Briefly tell us a story that demonstrates how your organization turns inspiration into impact.: >-
  The Grand Park Foundation is inspired by all that Grand Park has to offer
  families and seniors in L.A. County, and by providing access to free
  programming for children and families. 
   
   
   
   Many times children, seniors and adults have expressed how beautiful the park is, and how they have never been to a park such as Grand Park or to downtown L.A. Many times the youths and seniors arrive down and out -- but once they finish the warm-up exercises, begin the day with a new demeanor and are transformed on this day with smiles and laughter.
   
   
   
   A lady from the Downtown Women's Center once said, "We need to all finish the Expedition and finish exploring the Park -- we need to make it to the Fountain -- that is Grand Park's crown jewel!" She arrived sad, tired and with junk food and walking very slow off the bus -- at the end of the Expedition, she was a different person -- smelling the plant life and setting aside her walker. She motivated everyone in the group to make it to the finish line - to the Grand Park water fountain. 
   
   
   
   Children from Telfar Elementary School have joined in the Grand Park Rangers Expeditions -- a school with one of the highest homeless populations in LAUSD. The Salvation Army Day Care-Skid Row brought children of families who live in shelters and of the garment workers. Just as all the Grand Park Rangers participants, they immensely enjoyed the lunches provided during the "outdoor classrooms". Most of all, they enjoyed dipping their feet and splashing in the water -- this is "their urban beach" in downtown L.A.
   
   
   
   One 7-year old wrote in her journal from the moment she got on the bus from her community center in the Santa Clarita Valley to her departure from Grand Park -- ending her notes with a large "Thank You", "I want to come back to Grand Park". 
   
   
   
   A 6-year old arrived in his Sunday best- a black vest suit and blue shirt and completed the expedition in his shiny black shoes -- he and the kids from the Salvation Army Child Care Center had waited with anticipation to make their visit to Grand Park through the Grand Park Rangers program. 
   
   
   
   The idea for a walk club was inspired by the interest from the seniors who enjoy the exercises offered during the Grand Park Rangers Expeditions.

  The Grand Park Foundation looks forward to extending its outreach and to
  introducing the "The Feather Patrol", the program's mascots in time for Grand
  Park's 6th year anniversary October 2019. 
   
   
   
   Contributing to the quality of life for people of all ages, Grand Park Rangers™ is a free community-building and wellness program promoting outdoor play, healthy living, and protection of the eco-system. The program’s learning modules foster environmental stewardship, active/healthy lifestyles and outdoor play among children, families and senior citizens - many of the expeditions are inter-generational.
   
   
   
   During the Grand Park Rangers Expeditions, participants discover the landscape’s natural habitat and receive “tips for life” on wellness and environmental stewardship during the “outdoor classrooms” along the way. At the conclusion of the Expedition, participants take the Grand Park Rangers Oath. The "tips for life" are easy to remember tips that can be practiced and remembered for a lifetime; and the transportation points learned during the Expeditions will bring more families to discover Grand Park from throughout the county.
   
   
   
   In collaboration with community partners, parks, schools, service groups and public agencies, the program takes place at Grand Park, the “Park for Everyone”. The Grand Park Foundation provides transportation and lunch at no cost to schools, community groups, senior centers, parks and other public benefit organizations. 
   
   
   
   Promoting the program’s principles and representing the world’s six floristic kingdoms that make up Grand Park’s meridian gardens, is the “Feather Patrol”, the program’s mascots — connecting the Park to the world — and the world to the Park. An app will be developed to match the world’s distinct gardens as well as native plants, and will also provide the fun learning tips on wellness and environmental stewardship. The learning fun will also extend to the Grand Park Foundation’s web site.
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Post-pilot (testing an expansion of concept after initially successful pilot)
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  All that go through the Grand Park Rangers program discover the Park, learn
  that they can return via public transportation as well; and that they enjoy a
  day of play while learning easy "tips for life" on active and healthy living.
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?: []
