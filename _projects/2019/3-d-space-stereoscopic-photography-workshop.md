title: 3-D SPACE Stereoscopic Photography Workshop
project_summary: >-
  3-D SPACE will implement an ongoing program of public presentations, classes
  and workshops in stereoscopic 3-D content creation, from 3-D photography and
  filmmaking to immersive virtual reality. These programs will include outreach
  to LA's underserved communities, and also specialized educational initiatives
  for LA's creative youth and senior populations.

What does your organization do?: >-
  3-D SPACE: The Center For Stereoscopic Photography, Art, Cinema, and
  Education, is an LA based nonprofit organization and museum educating the
  public in the art, science, and history of 3-D images.
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.: []
Briefly tell us a story that demonstrates how your organization turns inspiration into impact.: >-
  Most people tend to take their own stereo vision for granted, have little idea
  of how 3-D images work or are made, and think of 3-D as a movie gimmick with a
  brief history that only goes back as far as Avatar, or perhaps Jaws 3-D.
  Clearly there is a gap in the public education about stereoscopic vision and
  our perception of the world around us.
   
   
   
   the inspiration for the 3-D SPACE organization began in 2012, when 3-D SPACE founder Eric Kurland and 3-D historian Ray Zone were able to rescue three truckloads of artifacts from the estate of the late 3-D expert and collector Dan Symmes. They were able to do this thanks to an angel benefactor who backed the purchase of the items on the condition that they do something positive with it. Ray and Eric discussed the possibility of someday finding a place to display these materials. Sadly, Ray passed away before they were able to move forward with any plans, but the idea continued to grow
   
   
   
   Eric developed the idea for 3-D SPACE into a plan of action and decided that starting a nonprofit would be the best route to move forward. 3-D SPACE was granted 501(c)3 nonprofit tax-exempt status in March, 2015. The museum collection grew when 3-D SPACE began receiving donations from private collectors and estates, portions of Ray Zoneâ€™s personal 3-D collection.
   
   
   
   For the first three years after its formation, we maintained a workshop and storage facility for the collections, but had no public space. 3-D SPACE operated as a museum without a permanent home, presenting movie screenings, educational workshops and outreach events in collaboration with other museums, organizations and nonprofits.
   
   
   
   At the beginning of 2018, 3-D SPACE was offered the opportunity to lease a brand new basement space. This new area was small, but had the potential to work as an exhibit gallery. Finally, in the Summer of 2018, 3-D SPACE opened the doors of its starter museum in the Echo Park neighborhood of Los Angeles. Affectionately nicknamed the "3-D Bunker," the center is a public space for stereoscopic art, science, and history. We are utilizing the gallery to rotate between exhibiting pieces from our museum collection, displaying contemporary works by 3-D image makers, and holding classes and presentations.
Which metrics will your submission impact?:
  - Employment in the creative industries
Will your proposal impact any other LA2050 goal categories?: []
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
How will your project make LA the best place?: >-
  Research has shown that students who study STEM (science, technology,
  engineering and math) become better problem solvers, innovators, inventors and
  logical thinkers. Studies also show that Students who study the arts are more
  likely to be academic achievers with strong skills in creativity and
  innovation, critical thinking and problem solving, and communication and
  collaboration. Arts specific education is on the decline, but arts conected to
  STEM (STEAM) through mutually-reinforcing objectives deepens learning in both
  areas.
   
   
   
   Additionally, the use of stereoscopic 3-D in the classroom has repeatedly proven to provide markedly higher rates of comprehension and retention of information by students, yet 3-D is not widely understood or implemented by educators or industries.
   
   
   
   Our initiative will provide a contextual and factual foundation for an increase in the creation and use of 3-D content by the Los Angeles population. This knowledge will benefit the growing numbers of LA residents who will pursue careers in the numerous fields that are rapidly implementing 3-D imagery, including entertainment, medicine, design, and education. Classes will be offered to multiple populations (i.e. youth classes, adult classes).
   
   
   
   Over the twelve month period, a new class on a will be offered each month and will meet periodically throughout that month. At the conclusion of the year-long program, twelve unique classes will be held. Students will be provided with all materials and equipment necessary to create their own stereoscopic imagery, and at the completion of each class, an exhibition of student work will be presented at a public venue.
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects)
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Our work will be directly evaluated by the public who engage in our
  activities. The people who attend our classes, workshops and presentation will
  be given the opportunity to provide feedback that will be used to shape future
  programs.
   
   
   
   The many works and media created by our students will be exhibited in various public venues including art galleries, film festivals, and online, where the Los Angeles community at large will be able to see, experience, and comment.
   
   
   
   Our internal evaluation will be based on measuring levels of continuing engagement with the public, growth of class and workshop sizes, attendance numbers at our events, and public demand for increased activities
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?: []
