title: Sense LA
project_summary: >-
  Sense LA is a work of Socially Engaged Art and Systems Thinking which uses
  deep thinking, design management and manufacturing, art, and technology to
  help people from all backgrounds and abilities, have a voice in their
  community, understand their city and their place within it, and create fresh
  perspectives, together. During the next year, we will be working with
  organizations across the City to maximize our creative potential, and
  ultimately help visualize and guide our communal decisions.

  intelligence so we can better connect our communities and our city.
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.: []
Briefly tell us a story that demonstrates how your organization turns inspiration into impact.: >-
  The methodology helps reveal people's daily issues through discussion,
  mapping, drawing, designing and manufacturing. We are working with government
  agencies who are responsive to the issues that show up through the work. 
   
   
   
   As an example of impact that the project is already having. The City of Watts will be using the method to bring together hispanics and african-americans to build a new, united City. This is the first time these two populations come together in this manner.
Which metrics will your submission impact?:
  - Government responsiveness to residentsâ€™ needs
  - Participation in neighborhood councils
  - Voting rates
Will your proposal impact any other LA2050 goal categories?: []
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
How will your project make LA the best place?: >-
  The program is being executed leveraging the network of Neighborhood Councils
  throughout Los Angeles and in partnership with the Department of Neighborhood
  Empowerment and the Berggruen Institute. Meetings are organized directly with
  each Neighborhood Council and the project is put to a vote. Dates and times
  are then arranged with the appropriate representatives. 
   
   
   
   The work is citywide and aims to have participation by as many voices as possible regardless of age, gender, occupation, race or religion. The participants to date have included recently released inmates, university professors, community organizers, Neighborhood Council Board Members, children, homeless people, religious leaders, government agency representatives, homemakers, etc. 
   
   
   
   Workshops are in various stages of execution, planning and scheduling through mid 2020. We are simultaneously working on the digitization and creation of open source portal.
   
   
   
   The project aims to connect all 99 neighborhood councils, including other organizations through a series of visualization tools that are co-created using the methodology. We aim to have a deep view of the city's interconnected problems and situations, creating a common language and new unexpected connections throughout the city's inhabitants.
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Post-pilot (testing an expansion of concept after initially successful pilot)
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: |-
  Creation of a platform that houses all workshop visualization tools 
   
   Amount of workshops given and organizations participating
   
   Quality and quantity of direct impact in communities through partnerships with local government agencies
