What does your organization do?: >-
  The International Visitors Council of L.A. designs exchange programs for
  international change-makers to foster understanding and cooperation between
  the L.A. and the world.
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.:
  - Cleveland Charter High School
Briefly tell us a story that demonstrates how your organization turns inspiration into impact.: >-
  IVCLA wholeheartedly believes in the power of people affecting real change by
  coming together across borders, breaking down stereotypes and sharing
  innovative ideas. Throughout the year, we bring international change-makers to
  Los Angeles to discuss pressing global issues with local innovators and
  community leaders and build personal relationships with Angelenos. We are
  inspired when we see mindsets and opinions change because of our international
  exchange programs. 
   
   Now, we want to bring these experiences into the classroom to help middle school students gain an appreciation for the diversity in their own communities, understand the value of global perspectives and develop critical skills that will help them succeed in an interconnected world. We have a bold vision for a program that will make Los Angeles the best place for global education.
Which metrics will your submission impact?:
  - District-wide graduation rates
  - Proficiency in English and Language Arts and Math
  - Student education pipeline
Will your proposal impact any other LA2050 goal categories?: []
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - San Fernando Valley
  - LAUSD
How will your project make LA the best place?: >-
  The majority of LAUSD students have limited access to opportunities that
  provide global perspectives. Every student can benefit from a broader world
  perspective that nourishes their potential to become adaptable innovators and
  global citizens. We have an obligation to effectively equip students with the
  skills to succeed in our interconnected world. The students who will thrive in
  the future will be global-ready students. Every student has a right to reap
  the benefits that a global education provides. The Go Global Classroom seeks
  to give all students, regardless of their race, abilities, or socioeconomic
  status, the opportunity to succeed in school and in their communities through
  global education.
   
   The Go Global Classroom pilot program will serve middle school students in LAUSD's Northwest District. The program will complement each class’s existing curriculum with organized visits from international volunteers (Go Global Ambassadors), cultural activities in the classroom, collaboration with peers in other countries and global media projects. 
   
   
   
   Go Global Ambassadors: Students will interact with Go Global Ambassadors (International Fulbright Students, IVCLA International Visitors and members of the L.A. Consular Corps). 
   
   
   
   Cultural Activities: Cultural activities will include sampling international cuisine, learning languages and more.
   
   
   
   Global Media Projects: Students will work with mentors from Cleveland Charter High School to create video projects and take action on global issues. 
   
   
   
   Virtual Collaboration with International Peers: Students will share experiences with peers in another country in real-time.

Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-

  attitudes, curiosity and knowledge about global facts, cultures and events.
  Success will be defined by a change in attitudes, and increased knowledge and
  curiosity about global facts, cultures and events. 
   
   
   
   Success will be measured by the following tools:
   
   * Student preliminary questionnaire to establish a baseline and final questionnaire to assess results of program
   
   * Student and teacher evaluations to collect qualitative feedback on experiences
   
   * IVCLA staff person will conduct in-person observation and assessments based on evaluation metrics determined by teachers and a volunteer expert
