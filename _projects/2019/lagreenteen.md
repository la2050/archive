title: '#LAGREENTEEN'
project_summary: >-
  Our #LAGREENTEEN program teaches inner-city Angeleno youth about
  environmentalism and reduction of single-use plastics through a 4 part
  workshop. LA HIGH is the first school we are working with (March & April
  2019). We seek to install clean water filtration units throughout LA High
  school and plan to repeat this with other LAUSD schools as well. Without these
  units students are forced to buy plastic water bottles as their source of
  water as their school water is unsafe to drink.

  For nine years, Crayon Collection has been dedicated to breaking a cycle of
  waste while at the same time supporting teachers and children in classrooms
  around LA and beyond our city. The idea was born when seeing like-new crayons
  be discarded by restaurant staff at kid-friendly restaurants at a rate of 150
  million crayons/year. Crayons do not decompose as they are made of paraffin
  wax. In addition, the norm of tossing still good crayons worsened the
  "throw-away society" Americans are known for and kids were watching this
  happen over and over again. We had to re-think trash as our landfills were
  overfilled and trash had to be transported miles away from Los Angeles via
  train. We started to pair local underserved Title 1 schools with participating
  restaurants who agreed to collect the still good crayons for us. Local schools
  would pick up over 2500 crayons per month for homework and a variety of art
  projects. Crayon Collection broke a cycle of waste that was longstanding and
  many people never considered and instilled a new mindset. Next, we challenged
  LA based artists to create projects ideas using just crayons so students could
  have robust art education curriculum, another program that was cut in public
  schools. The Crayon Collection model was an example of how we can do better
  but thinking of solutions. It was at these very same restaurants that we
  noticed full glasses of water with plastic straws in them that no one ordered.
  We realized that this was a "habit of waste" that needed to be changed as
  ewll. We spearheaded the ban on plastic straws and cutlery in the iconic City
  of Malibu, which ignited worldwide change against single-use plastics. We
  launched a new program called Habits of Waste to address more environmental
  issues including plastics and many other things. Then #LAGREENTEEN allows us
  to reduce dependency on plastic water bottles in LAUSD schools by providing
  another solution - filtered water units. Creating a new “eco-normal”
  consciousness that focuses on stewardship of the environment and support of
  nearby communities in need. Now, we are inspiring environmental action &
  career building for low-income students who have less access to environmental
  opportunities than their affluent counterparts.

  #LAGREENTEEN camapaign is a part of HabitsofWaste.org (a program of Crayon
  Collection). #LAGREENTEEN consists of four, 90 min workshops to teach students
  how to use social media to create positive change for the environment and for
  their own school with an end goal of installing 4 water filtration stations
  with bottle filling options. We have curated the workshops to address 1). the
  problem single-use plastic , 2.)why clean drinking water (64 ounces per person
  per day) is so necessary and so crucial for ALL people to have access to, 3.)
  how the students can become "active agents" in their home, school and
  community. 4.) Students will learn how to raise awareness and funds by
  reaching out through social media and local businesses. The students will
  learn that no matter where you live, your voice matters and that clean water
  is a basic right. A large portion uses social media as the tool to create
  social change. High school students "speak" social media so we know there are
  huge metrics we can discover through their work. Habits of Waste will ensure
  that the students are successful in installing the clean water filters but we
  want the students to also work with us to reach out to the community and
  receive funds. Our timeline is as follows: Week 1 Dr. Tim Pershing from
  Assemblymember Richard Bloom’s will teach the workshop called "The Problem
  with Single-Use Plastics" in addition to screening documentary film, "STRAWS".
  Week 2 Dr. Angelica Hernandez from UCLA will focus on successful grassroots
  movements, Week 3 will be led by experts in social media explaining powerful
  social media strategy, Week 4 will be the culmination project where students
  will learn how to reach out to their community to find support for an
  important cause like access to clean water. Habits of Waste will help them
  create a GoFundMe page as well so that the students can see how they are
  progressing. The population we are serving: students and faculty of Los
  Angeles Senior High which is located mid-city, on Olympic Blvd. It has 1,544
  students with 92.74% classified as low-income, 78% Hispanic and 13% black, and
  ranks in the bottom 16% of the district with a Pupil/Teacher ratio of 20.58.
  Auditing student consumption levels of single-use plastics and making strides
  to cut those levels is an integral part of the program. We will provide
  surveys to all students at the beginning of the program and at the end. This
  project will provide students with access to free CLEAN water so they no
  longer need to use limited resources to purchase water. It will also divert
  them from purchasing sodas or sugary drinks as this option is free and
  delicious. ALL LAUSD schools should have these filtered drinking station as
  this will change the trajectory of those living in the inner city to have
  healthier lives and through the #LAGREENTEEN progam, students will also
  understand how to create change and use their voice. This will help make
  measurable progress in making LA the best place to live.
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project (testing a new idea on a small scale to prove feasibility)
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  We have surveys to asses student behavior and dependency on single-use
  plastics at the beginning and at the end of the program. We anticipate a drop
  in usage once they learn more about the harm single use plastics have on the
  environment. Also, we know how many plastic water bottles and sodas are being
  purchased each day, prior to the installation of the 5 water filtration
  stations. We will reassess after the students have the option of free clean
  water to see how many plastic water bottles are being sold per day.
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?: []
