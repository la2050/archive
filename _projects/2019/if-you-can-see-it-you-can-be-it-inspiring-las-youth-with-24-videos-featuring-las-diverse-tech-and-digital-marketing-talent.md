What does your organization do?: >-
  Gladeo is dedicated to bridging the belief, information, and network gaps that
  often prevent historically underrepresented and underserved youth from
  accessing and thriving in careers.
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.:
  - Bixel Exchange of the LA Chamber of Commerce
  - Dentsu Aegis Network
Briefly tell us a story that demonstrates how your organization turns inspiration into impact.: >-
  Not only does Gladeo.org help the students that directly use the platform
  online but it is also a resource for youth development and community-based
  nonprofits in LA County and around the country to supplement and amplify their
  impact. Here’s a testimonial from one of our partners: 
   
   
   
   “The reason Gladeo is so important to us is because through Gladeo’s career exploration workshop and free “Virtual Career Day”platform, they are able to paint a picture of what it means to dream boldly and never let circumstances hinder their career and education aspirations. Many of our students come from a low socioeconomic background. Their parents’ English is minimal. There aren’t too many books in the house. Both parents (if living with both parents) work full time. They relocate frequently because of income instability. These factors justify their way of having “survival mentality” and with that mindset, education or the future isn’t something they often think about. “That’s for the other kids from the suburbs.” Gladeo sets the tone for CLH in that these kids are instilled within them the confidence to dream big and to step out of their fears. Gladeo’s workshop and free online career platform which provide very practical tools to achieving specific career dreams helps our students step out of the ambiguity of "it’s too much work", to the practicalities of “I can do it one step at a time”. Every student who graduated from our first year cohort is now attending college. CLH and Gladeo played a HUGE role in that.” Steven Yu, Executive Director, Connect Lincoln Heights (CLH)
   
    
   
   Connect Lincoln Heights (CLH) is a youth development non-profit that connects Lincoln Heights HS students with mentors who are living out their career aspirations, provide the platform for mentorship to take place through monthly personal development workshops, develop a community service project that addresses a need in their community utilizing the profession of their mentor.

  Project Execution and Timeline
   
   - Gladeo League Recruitment (4 weeks): Work with the career services department of LA’s community colleges to select 12 interns to join our Gladeo League: 8 Video Producers, 4 Reporters 
   
   - Gladeo League Training (3-4 weeks): They will be mentored by LA professionals working in broadcast journalism and film/video production. From Spectrum News 1, Twentieth Century Fox/Disney, KTLA and Dentsu Aegis Network. 
   
   - Content to be created: 24 Inspirational Career videos, 24 Accompanying Comprehensive Career Profiles
   
   - Pre-Production (4-6 weeks): Our partner, LA Chamber of Commerce Bixel Exchange will recruit, vet, and coordinate the 24 interviewees for the videos and career profiles we are producing. To prepare the interviewees, Gladeo will send out pre-interview questionnaires and schedule pre-interview calls in advance of interview day. 
   
   - Production (3 months): Gladeo League interns with our staff will shoot and conduct on-camera interviews of four professionals in various roles at each of the six companies.
   
   - Post-Production (3 months): Gladeo League members will edit the videos and profiles with the help of Gladeo’s professional staff and mentors. 
   
   - Distribution to LA/OC college and high school students: Gladeo and our collaborative partner, the LA Chamber of Commerce Bixel Exchange, will present the new videos and online resources to the school partners (19 community colleges, 30 high schools) through their email newsletter, social media, and workshops.
   
   - We also hope to work with LA2050 to distribute our free resources to the youth non-profit partners in their network. 
   
   
   
   A 2014 report from the Public Policy Institute of California predicts that by 2025, California will have an estimated 2.5 million unfilled jobs that will require at least some postsecondary education, with Information Technology slated to be the fastest growing sector. In addition, African American and Hispanic tech workers combined make up just 5% of the tech workforce. Students of increased socio-economic status are many times gifted with career orientation early in their youth. Students of lower economic means fail to benefit from career orientation from their parents or community. So how do they aspire to and pursue careers they’ve never heard of? Our project aims to bridge the following gaps at scale: 
   
   
   
   - Information gap: What careers exist? What do they entail and what are the education and steps necessary to get your foot in the door? 
   
   - Belief gap: How many underrepresented minorities are not pursuing careers in the technology sector because they don’t see or know anyone who looks like them doing it or because they’ve been told they are not as capable? 
   
   
   
   We are working to create a world where hope and opportunity are not limited by the lack of career role models, awareness, or information. LA is a city of full of diversity, in both its people and its industry. Now, let’s see our diverse people work in all of our diverse industries!
