title: Turnaround Arts LA
project_summary: >-
  Turnaround Arts California (TACA) supports and guides communities in
  reexamining their approach to improving chronically underperforming schools by
  using the arts as a core element of intervention. TACA seeks funding for a
  second year in partnership with two schools: Garfield Elementary in Alhambra,
  and McKinley Elementary in Compton. We will leverage the arts in these schools
  to increase teacher capacity, improve school culture and climate, and increase
  student and family engagement.

What does your organization do?: >-
  Turnaround Arts: California harnesses the power of the arts to engage,
  empower, and transform high-need schools and communities.
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.:
  - P.S. Arts
Briefly tell us a story that demonstrates how your organization turns inspiration into impact.: >-
  “All of the research points to the success of schools that are “arts-rich” -
  in which students who may have fallen by the wayside find themselves
  re-engaged in learning when their enthusiasm for film, design, theater, or
  even hip-hop is tapped into by their teachers.”
   
   -Reinvesting in Arts Education, Winning America’s Future Through Creative Schools; President’s Committee on the Arts and the Humanities, May 2011
   
   
   
   Turnaround Arts: CA was born out of a dual recognition by President Obama and his President’s Committee on the Arts and Humanities (PCAH): our education system is in crisis, and reinvesting in arts education, which has been on the decline, is perhaps our most promising solution. Began as a pilot of PCAH, Turnaround Arts truly turns inspiration into impact.
   
   
   
   One of our program partners, Get Lit, brings poetry to our students. A sixth-grade student at one of our partner schools found his voice through their poetry-spoken word curriculum. What follows is his powerful response poem to Langston Hughes’s Dream Variations:
   
   
   
   The Dream and the Highest Peak, By: Erik Lopez
   
   
   
   Racism feels like looking at a box of colored pencils without every color, full of emptiness
   
   And it tastes like all the bitterness of the world put in one lemon
   
   Racism is an on-going nightmare that has not yet ended
   
   Racism is the train that’s been going since 1807 that only carries depression
   
   It's just like numbers, it doesn’t seem to end.
   
   
   
   Langston Hughes’ unfulfilled dream will hopefully one day become a reality.
   
   
   
   So that anyone can fling their arms wide
   
   Enjoying the vibrant sun’s smile
   
   And being allowed to dance
   
   Till the wonderful day is done
   
   As they watch the beautiful stars come on lightly like a warm blanket
   
   Then sleeping without worries and only comforting dreams.
   
   
   
   THAT IS THE DREAM!
   
   
   
   And the highest peak
   
   The peak that all civil rights activist want to reach
   
   But if they want to make the dream a reality,
   
   Then they have to pick up the pace to pass the point of the peak in stopping the painfulness of the racist to re-paint the picture of the passionate world with more colors than just white.
Which metrics will your submission impact?:
  - Proficiency in English and Language Arts and Math
  - Truancy rates in elementary and middle schools
  - Student education pipeline
Will your proposal impact any other LA2050 goal categories?: []
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - San Gabriel Valley
  - South LA
How will your project make LA the best place?: >-
  The “Turnaround Arts Los Angeles” project will build the capacity of two
  local, high-need schools, Garfield Elementary and McKinley Elementary, to use
  the arts to fuel school community change. Through a process of reflection and
  creative envisioning, each school will create a Strategic Arts Plan which
  identifies challenges to be addressed through the arts, and outlines an action
  plan for implementation through partnerships with local and national arts
  organizations. 
   
    
   
   Resulting activities will include training and coaching for teachers on how to integrate creative movement, drama, and visual arts into the classroom in order to spark student curiosity and learning, enhance family engagement, and increase students' readiness to learn. We will provide opportunities for school and teacher leaders to meet and exchange with their peers in other Turnaround Arts schools across the state, to build a sense of community and shared advocacy for using the arts to provide a well-rounded, high quality education for all students.
   
    
   
   In addition, through the Turnaround Arts Los Angeles project, we will support our partner schools with: financial grants to support whole-school staff training in a primary arts integration strategy, as well as Strategic Arts Plan projects; School support through a dedicated regional coach partner, P.S. Arts, providing weekly coaching and support in creating arts-integrate curriculum and hosting a Family Art Night; and a visit by a high-profile Turnaround Artist to to raise visibility and foster intergenerational exchange around creativity, the arts and resilience.
   
   Our school partners for the Turnaround Los Angeles project are in disparate parts of our community, with unique demographics and distinct community challenges. Both have been identified as priority underperforming schools. Garfield Elementary School is located in Alhambra. The student population is majority Latino and Asian. Nearly 70% of the students are eligible for Free or Reduced Lunch, and another 17% are English Language Learners. McKinley Elementary School is based in Compton. The student population is Latino and African American. 100% of the students are eligible for Free and Reduced Lunch and 20% are English Language Learners.
   
   This project will make measurable progress toward making LA the best place to LEARN by increasing teacher collaboration, leadership and arts integration in order to provide all students with creative ways to access learning. This will contribute towards improving the student education pipeline, increasing proficiency in Language Arts and Math, and reducing truancy, suspension and expulsion rates in our partner schools.
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Post-pilot (testing an expansion of concept after initially successful pilot)
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Turnaround Arts Los Angeles will focus on five key indicators of success with
  our partner schools:
   
   
   
   -Evidence of discrete arts education at every grade level;
   
   -Implementation of arts-based instructional strategies in the core subjects; 
   
   -Successful launch of a school musical or showcase;
   
   -Improved school culture and climate celebrating creativity, as evidenced by a year end survey; and
   
   -Increased family engagement through attendance of school events (e.g. family art nights), volunteerism with the arts or otherwise.
   
   
   
   The above key indicators are foundations upon which the following success measures are built: attendance and suspension rates, and changes in student proficiency in math and language arts. Turnaround Arts LA will also assess these measures, which we would not expect to change dramatically in one year, but more likely over a two-three year period.
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?: []
