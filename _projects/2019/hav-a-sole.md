title: HAV A SOLE
project_summary: >-
  We aspire to connect and give 10,000 men, women and children comfortable and
  properly fitting shoes. We restore dignity by learning each person’s name
  while personally fitting them with a quality footwear. Our work increases the
  sense of social responsibility with donors and volunteers offering them viral
  ways to become involved. Funds will enable us to build the infrastructure and
  expand our outreach to impact at-risk Californians who use their feet as an
  average mode of transportation.

Briefly tell us a story that demonstrates how your organization turns inspiration into impact.: >-
  Hav a Sole is an organization truly inspired by one young man’s personal
  experience and on the premise of virally paying it forward! As a young boy,
  Hav A Sole founder, Rikki Mendias spent years in a shelter with his mother.
  During that challenging time they couldn’t even afford to buy a pair of shoes.
  One day a former resident noticed he had holes in the bottom of his sneakers
  and took him to buy two new pairs. Rikki never forgot her kindness, but the
  feeling he got from having new kicks, spawned an insatiable need in him to
  collect shoes. 
   
   Fast forward, to 2014, Rikki had over one hundred and fifty pair of shoes, when he suddenly realized there were people out there who had none. That’s when he loaded the back of his car and drove the streets until he found someone who could benefit from a newer pair of shoes. With their permission, Rikki took a before and after photo and posted it on social media. Inspired, many of his followers started sending in tennis shoes from all over the country, and that’s how Hav A Sole was born.
   
   Rikki sees homelessness as a big equity issue given that individuals experiencing homelessness are some of the most marginalized and disadvantaged people in our society. Focusing resources and investments on youth and homeless communities that have been left behind will produce the greatest returns. Accordingly we have developed this program to address one of the major inequities in the communities we serve.
   
   Hav A Sole Wheels has touched thousands of lives through, social activism, volunteering and building community. In four years we've given out over 13,000 pairs of shoes in 20 cities while touching thousands of lives.
   
   Our efforts included an emergency fundraiser held in Los Angeles for the Hurricane Harvey victims. This event took place over an entire weekend at Horace Mann Junior High bringing together individuals and grass root organizations from local communities which produced 1,500 pairs of shoes and carloads of supplies fitting a 53-foot semi-truck which transported these supplies to Houston by the Hav A Sole team. 
   
   Recently, Hav A Sole relocated its offices and storage space directly in the Downtown Los Angeles’ Skid Row area where many of these programs take place.

  Our mission is to restore confidence through our services to homeless, youth
  and individuals in need of footwear. With partners and generous donors, we
  bring a retail experience offering choice of quality footwear to those in
  need. 
   
   Our movement affects individuals who receives the shoes while increasing a sense of responsibility for donors and volunteers offering them a way connect. Hav A Sole’s goal for 2019 is to double our efforts so we can increase the amount of shoes given out, our programs and outreach includes:
   
   1. Hav A Sole Direct Outreach (local daily) — Through our daily outreach we ensure anytime we see a need we can fill that need for reliable footwear. On a daily basis our team identify, fit, and donates shoes to those in need —yes, that means if we cross paths with a homeless person in need of shoes, we offer help on the spot! 
   
   2. Hav A Sole Partnerships Local Distribution Events— partnership with various footwear companies we organize donation events to encourage shoe lovers to donate their unwanted shoes. We then organize volunteer days to distribute the footwear. Each outreach day is a chance to foster partnerships, encourage community service, and make a real connection within the community. 
   
   3. #havAsolefultrip — In collaboration with various NBA team owners, players, coaches and fans, we organize 2-3 nationwide outreaches per year to bring attention to the national crisis of homelessness. These successful outreach allow us to collect shoes and other donations, while viral connections are made both on and off-line 
   
   4. Disaster Relief — In the past 2 years, Hav A Sole has had the opportunity and resources to organize and mobilize outreach teams during several heartbreaking natural disasters. With a surplus in shoes and a warehouse to keep them, we aim to be the number one distributor of footwear during natural disasters. 
   
   5. Hav A Sole Kids — through our partnership with NBA to provide shoes and other resources to children participating in NBA children and youth programs we organize and distribute shoe donations to school aged children. 
   
   This project will make measurable progress towards making LA the best place to LIVE using the LA2050 our programs will support the following metrics: 
   
   1. Walk/bike/transit - through viral campaigns we will use this platform to inform and include all donors and receivers in our walking campaigns including an annual Sock Walk.
   
   2. Homelessness - as we connect with these individuals we seek to explore ways to connect them with basic needs resources. 
   
   3. Obesity - Our campaigns encourage walking, hiking, and other activity related group recreation as well as a focus on promoting healthier lifestyles. 
   
   4. Rates of Volunteerism - We have a high rate of volunteers ranging from donors, social media followers, as well as NBA and other high profile supporters as we focus on recruiting all donors to become volunteers.
