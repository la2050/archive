title: Rocketeer Club
project_summary: >-
  The Rocketeer Club is a free onsite after-school educational program for the
  residents of affordable housing complexes in LA County. The program offers
  high-quality experiences to transform young people’s engagement, interest, and
  understanding of STEM. The year-long program engages resident youth in
  two-hour hands-on STEM activities, twice per week. Through activities ranging
  from robotics to 3-D printing and rocketry, youth explore the world of STEM in
  an inquiry-based learning environment.

What does your organization do?: >-
  HCA is a social service provider that coordinates onsite informal education
  programs in STEM and arts enrichment at over eighty affordable housing
  communities.
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.:
  - The Columbia Memorial Space Center
Briefly tell us a story that demonstrates how your organization turns inspiration into impact.: >-
  At a small property in Van Nuys, there was a community room that was being
  frequented by six tweens afterschool. Initially we wanted to offer homework
  help followed by a photography program but the tweens at this property had a
  hard time following a structured curriculum. Like most 12 year olds, they
  usually wanted to purchase the occasional snow cone and plow through our art
  supplies-doodling and painting quickly with no commitment to a long term art
  piece. So we were not sure the Rocketeer Club would be a huge success at this
  site. At first these same six kids-three boys and three girls-showed interest.
  Especially the boys when we started to teach robotics with LEGOs. Still as
  time progressed we noticed the boys were more prone to speed through a project
  and leave to go skateboard outside. The girls however stayed behind. The three
  of them eagerly sat through two-hour science days three times a week. They
  ultimately became friends and they held each other accountable. If someone
  didn't show up for class, then one would go knock on their door and remind
  them. They started to ask for even more chemistry experiments outside of the
  regular curriculum. The three girls formed a team, each taking on a different
  STEM persona- Genesis the doctor, Lotara the engineer, and Angel the
  biologist. In the end this trio were the only three to attend the field trip
  from their property. They stuck together on the bus, at lunch, and smoothly
  worked together in the Mission Control simulation at the Space Center. It
  would be endearing enough to say that this program created friends within an
  apartment community, but the true value of the Rocketeer Club was that it
  influenced the career possibilities for these girls. Together they empowered
  one another to role play what a life in a STEM profession would be. They
  imagined a world in which working with other females in a laboratory would be
  the norm. This program reminded them that together and with our facilitation
  they could create a safe supportive environment just a few feet from their
  front doors.
Which metrics will your submission impact?:
  - Proficiency in English and Language Arts and Math
  - 'Students’ immersion in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math content'
  - Student education pipeline
Will your proposal impact any other LA2050 goal categories?: []
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - San Gabriel Valley
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South LA
  - South Bay
  - Antelope Valley
How will your project make LA the best place?: >-
  A growing body of research is illustrating the positive impact that informal
  science education (ISE) opportunities, such as museums and science clubs, have
  on young people as well as the importance of ISE as a conduit of science
  knowledge to learners of all ages. Additionally, research in education has
  shown that relationships built in informal educational programs have a very
  powerful influence on young people’s envisioning of their future, in some ways
  more than the activities of formal schooling. The primary goal of our
  nonprofit is establishing solid, ongoing, and consistent connections between
  the adult facilitators and mentors and the children within each community,
  using STEM activities as an anchor to gather youth together. The programs
  located at key HCA sites will leverage the rich, learner-centered curriculum
  developed by the Columbia Memorial Space Center, as well as our expertise in
  delivering this programming in affordable housing communities. The mission is
  to create a continual presence in the community and the young people’s lives,
  providing different career paths in some of the fastest growing fields in the
  United States. Using science as a springboard, this project will make
  measurable progress towards making Los Angeles communities the best place to
  LEARN.
   
   Our key goals aim to broaden the reach and scope of advanced, enriching courses which are not otherwise attainable to under-resourced people outside of their homes. Goal 1: To increase weekly class size in programs at our 25 sites with current ongoing programs. Goal 2: To increase the number of properties in our portfolio participating in the Rocketeer Club program in partnership with Columbia Memorial Space Center (CMSC) from six in the 2017 program up to 10 for the following. Goal 3: To
   
   establish evaluation systems which measure program effectiveness and impact of increased promotion across HCA’s portfolio.
   
   
   
   Timeline of Program:
   
   Jul.: Recruitment and hiring of instructors
   
   Aug.: Training at Space Center and supply purchases/community room organization
   
   Sept.: Open House events in each community room to sign up residents, promotion of club, and classroom set up by instructors. Early evaluation of student’s self-esteem and comfort with STEM.
   
   Oct.-Dec.: Curriculum focuses on 3D printing, Rocketry, and Robotics.
   
   <Mid Dec. Evaluations and town hall for residents to see progress of students>
   
   Jan.-April: Curriculum focuses on Aerospace, Biology, and Career pathways.
   
   May: Field Trip to Space Center and final evaluations. 
   
   Jun.-Jul: Evaluation reports and budget finalization.
   
   The population being served in with this program are A). Economically disadvantaged, B.) Historically disenfranchised, C.) Los Angeles County residents. An approximate demographic breakdown of residents served in this program previously:
   
   Men/Boys (%): 40%
   
   Women/Girls (%): 60%
   
   African American (%): 45%
   
   Asian American (%): 5%
   
   Hispanic (%): 45%
   
   Native American (%): 1%
   
   No Distinction (%): 4%
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Post-pilot (testing an expansion of concept after initially successful pilot)
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Our main metric of success for this program is participation rates of youth
  and their parents, informal evaluation of emotional and self-esteem growth
  within STEM as carried out by our AEA certified evaluator Kate Cavijo who
  previously evaluated our program under a Disney Foundation grant. In our pilot
  program we conducted "mid-season" surveys with follow up from the evaluation
  team at the end of the program which utilized surveys, in person interviews,
  and phone calls to the parents of participants. In synthesizing this
  information, we discovered that parental involvement was paramount in success
  rates as well as insight into the growth of self-esteem among participants.
  Are focus in the following program will be to interview community members
  including property managers, parents, and participants both at the beginning,
  middle, and end of the program through phone calls in person interviews and
  town hall events that will serve as focus groups.
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?: []
