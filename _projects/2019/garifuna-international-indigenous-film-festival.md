Briefly tell us a story that demonstrates how your organization turns inspiration into impact.: >-
  Founded by Freda Sideroff, an indigene of the Garifuna people, in 2012 the
  Garifuna International Indigenous Film Festival’s (GIIFF) mission is to
  support the preservation of all indigenous cultures in the world through art
  and film. Upon its launching Garifuna International Indigenous Film Festival
  was recognized by Former Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa who signed a proclamation
  declaring May 26th, Garifuna International Film Day in the City of Los Angeles
  and state of California.
   
   
   
   The Garifuna people’s origins can be traced to West Africa. Brought to Central America by the Spanish, the epic story of the Garinagu begins in the early 1600’s on the Caribbean island of St. Vincent when two Spanish ships carrying West Africans sank off the coast of the Caribbean island of St. Vincent in 1635.
   
   The survivors swimming ashore found shelter in the Carib Indian settlements on St. Vincent Island and in other regions of the Caribbean and coastal Central America. They intermixed, intermarried and fused together becoming a single Black Carib culture, called the Garinagu. Afro-Caribbean, the “Garinagu” culture and language are called “Garifuna.” 
   
   Migration has fostered a strong sense of identity. Garifuna celebrate their own unique heritage and language through music, which is characterized by guitar and drums, as well as religion and food, including Hudut, a coconut-based shellfish stew served with mashed plantains. Garifuna traditions, customs, and beliefs reflect the bond of community and respect for elders, both living and dead. UNESCO’S Proclamation Masterpieces of Oral an intangible Heritage of Humanity issued to Garifuna Language, Music and Dance on May 18th 2001 due to an urgent need of preservation. The Garifuna International Indigenous Film Festival is expanding its vision to preserve, support, and share the culture of Garifuna around the world with our storytelling and film festivals.
