title: Creative Play After School Programming
project_summary: >-
  Our after-school program would serve Title 1 schools in LAUSD. Many children
  do not have access to after school care. We seek to implement Crayon
  Collection teachers inside the schools to work on creating PLAY with the
  would-have-been-trashed crayons we have collected from local LA restaurants to
  benefit vulnerable students in Los Angeles. The projects we offer students are
  created in partnership with professional artists offering deep learning
  experiences that are fun and developmentally rich.

What does your organization do?: >-
  The Crayon Collection mission is to inspire a commitment to environmental
  consciousness and the infusion of art education in underfunded schools.
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.: []
Briefly tell us a story that demonstrates how your organization turns inspiration into impact.: >-
  The birth of Crayon Collection is very unique as it originated from solving a
  systemic problem of wastefulness in America. We noticed that restaurants in
  America were throwing away over 150 million crayons per year. These crayons
  are made of paraffin wax and never decompose, damaging our precious
  environment. At the same time budget cuts in education left art programs to be
  only in well-served schools despite proof that children with access to the
  arts performed better in all subjects. Additionally, teachers were forced to
  spend their personal earnings to outfit their classroom with the most basic
  school supplies. The Crayon Collection was born after we asked restaurants to
  collect the still good crayons kid-diners left behind. Each restaurant was
  then paired with a local Title 1 or Head Start school who picked up an average
  of 2,500 per month. The schools and the restaurants were never over 5 miles
  apart so it was a community effort to find a new home for the crayons versus
  tossing them in the trash. This program then evolved in order to solve the
  lack of art education in schools as well because we felt that the arts should
  not only be for affluent children. All children have a right to use their left
  and right brain to learn. We began to challenge local LA artists who had a
  masters degree in fine arts and were represented by LA based galleries. The
  parameters we asked them to abide by simply to create deep art projects that
  were fun and interesting for children using JUST crayons as the main tool. We
  asked them to avoid coloring projects that were about staying "inside the
  lines" and the results were powerful. The art projects were taught during
  class time in LAUSD schools by the artists themselves. We won an award for our
  work inside the classroom by the LAUSD school board. Now, we seek to support
  schools in their after school programming so that we can fill in a huge void
  that they desperately need help with. We are most proud when we hear that the
  Crayon Collection crayons we provide children are actually the first pack of
  crayons they have ever had to call their own.
Which metrics will your submission impact?:
  - Number (and quality) of informal spaces for play
  - Number of children enrolled in afterschool programs
Will your proposal impact any other LA2050 goal categories?: []
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - LAUSD
How will your project make LA the best place?: >-
  We seek to support children attending LAUSD schools who are in need of after
  school programming at their schools. They are in need of a safe place to play
  and create while their parents are at work. We will work with the schools that
  are in the bottom 5% of LAUSD. The student population we will served ranges
  from 5 years of age to 11 and are kindergarten - 5th grade. Seventy-eight
  percent are of Latino descent and 8 % are African American. One-hundred
  percent are living under the poverty line and are on the free meal programs at
  their schools. There are homeless families included in this population who we
  will also serve. The schools we will serve will be on a 1 month rotation with
  1 after school class per day. We will work with 5 schools at a time and serve
  at total of 45 schools in the 2019-2020 school year. Each teacher will serve 1
  school for the month and then move onto the next school and repeat the
  curriculum. The classes will be about creative play and opening the children's
  minds to art and creative expression. The artists we are currently working
  with will be providing the new art projects. LA will be the best place to play
  because we plan to also bring the local artists inside the classrooms as often
  as possible. This collaboration between key artists and restaurants (who
  donate the crayons) to help underserved schools is a synergy like no other.
  The change we will make in the childrens lives has already been seen as we
  piloted the program. Each class begins with a game that varies from Simon
  Says, or a riddle or a color challenge. Then the project begins and the kids
  are able to express themselves in ways that are most unique as the project is
  created by an artist who has high education and ability to create. For
  example, one artist conceived Crayon Collection project uses crayons to teach
  a technique called "Blind Contour Line Drawings" through a Basquiat-esque
  project. Another project teaches various shading techniques by Rembrandt. Each
  day the students will work on a new project and have the chance to hone in on
  their abilities with their own pack of crayons that were donated to them but
  Crayon Collection. We will survey the children about their interest in the
  arts and their knowledge of the various techniques and artists. At the end of
  the month we plan to survey the students again to see what knowledge they
  gained from the program and whether they enjoyed it. After the project is
  complete the students are able to benefit from the teacher for homework
  assistance as well.
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Post-pilot (testing an expansion of concept after initially successful pilot)
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Currently, we are post pilot for our after school program test, which
  consisted of 6 lessons 1x a week for 6 weeks at a Boys and Girls Club in South
  LA. Each lesson was 60 minutes and started with a game the teacher would play
  with the students about colors. Next, the artist conceived project ideas were
  taught and the students had a great time. It was a huge success to teach our
  program to the students. The students and the faculty appreciated the extra
  curricular art lessons that included much play and creativity for the
  children. The director of this facility expressed how calm the children were
  after each of our lessons and have already asked us to come back and continue
  with more programming. We are currently working with 14 artists to create more
  project ideas in addition to the artists we currently work with who are
  creating their second or third project idea. We will measure success by
  surveying the students prior to the program at the beginning of the month as
  well as at the end of the month.
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?: []
