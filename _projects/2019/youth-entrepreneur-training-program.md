  Brendan Thompson, at only 17 years old participated in our first Youth
  Entrepreneur Training Program in the Summer of 2016. During the Youth
  Entrepreneur Training Program, Brendan learned about entrepreneurship, career
  development and leadership. By the end of the program Brendan Thompson had
  completed his own business plan, had an up-to-date professional resume and
  gained the leadership skills needed to be a successful business owner in the
  City of Los Angeles. Brendan is now 20 years old and is the owner of his own
  business Guild of Arts Los Angeles (GALA) to promote the arts in Los Angeles.
  By participating in ICON CDC's Youth Entrepreneur Training Program, Brendan
  was able to further developed his screen printing business called Freek
  Designs and began to flesh out the idea for GALA. For years, Brendan wanted to
  start a community arts center and at the Youth Entrepreneur Training Program,
  he got to think about it a lot more. After the Youth Entrepreneur Training
  Program, Brendan had the idea to start throwing art shows to get his arts
  center idea off the ground. Since completing the Youth Entrepreneur Training
  Program, Brendan has hosted many art shows with many vendors and activities
  for everyone under his GALA business. Brendan continues to grow both his
  business by utilizing the services that ICON CDC provides to all Youth
  Entrepreneur Training Program participants.

  The project begins with a creative youth entrepreneur training program
  encompassing activity-based leadership, marketing, financial, career
  development workshops and youth mentoring. The program starts off by
  empowering youth ages 16-21 to draw out their vision for the program. The
  entrepreneur training program will be teaching the key elements of starting
  and operating a small business and steps on how to start a business in the LA
  area. Youth will complete a personalized business plan based on their personal
  creative interests. The youth will learn how to be a leader by taking part in
  engaging activities that focus on: multicultural communication, critical
  thinking skills, and emotional intelligence. The three part program builds
  upon entrepreneurship, leadership, and career development skills needed in
  LAâ€™s new economy. In entrepreneurship, youth will learn the steps on how to
  start a business in the LA area and will complete a personalized business plan
  based on their personal creative interests. In leadership, youth will learn
  how to be a leader by taking part in engaging activities that focus on three
  components: communication, emotional intelligence and mental abilities. The
  social component focuses on learning advanced communication skills in group
  communication, cross-cultural communication, global communication, and
  professional networking. A diversity workshop is focused on creating empathy
  for the many cultures and rich diversity races, religions, socioeconomic
  status, language abilities, people with a criminal justice background,
  immigration status, age, sexual orientation, etc, which exist in Los Angeles.
  The second component is emotional awareness focusing on providing youth with
  critical thinking skills, and the appreciation of non-traditional forms of
  success including the arts, innovation, outside-the-box thinking, fostering of
  new ideas without the fear of failure, and focus on the flexibility of
  universal skills. In career, youth will focus on career development by
  learning how to personally brand themselves, social media etiquette,
  networking, create a resume, partaking in career assessments, mock interviews
  and learning how to turn internships into full time jobs to start their
  career. Our Youth Entrepreneurship Training will help promote social and
  cultural identity, build a stronger sense of community, and give youth,
  especially at-risk youth, a sense of meaning and belonging. Recruiting and
  retention rates for local higher education institutions will increase thanks
  to our program as we will partner with local higher education institutes to
  have representatives come and make presentations and engage our youth about
  their respective institutions and programs. Youth that participate in this
  program are innovative, creative, community oriented, and hardworking. This
  program will help youth unleash their potential by connecting youth to
  resources and programs will create long-term Angeleno entrepreneurs in our
  great city.
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Post-pilot (testing an expansion of concept after initially successful pilot)
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Our success will be determined by evaluating entrance and exit interviews for
  each youth participant. Also, confidential feedback surveys will be handed out
  after each entrepreneur training workshop to evaluate workshop material,
  speaker and instructor. In addition, our program evaluation includes setting
  goals for all the metrics we are proposing to effect and tracking the outcomes
  for each post program. At the end of the Youth Entrepreneur Training Program,
  each youth participant that successfully completes the program is assigned to
  an ICON CDC Business Coach that will meet with them and follow up with them on
  a monthly basis to assist them with ongoing business, career, financial
  literacy and leadership development.An action plan will be created to access
  their needs and guide them through their next steps.
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?: []
