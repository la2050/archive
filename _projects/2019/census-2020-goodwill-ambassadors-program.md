title: Census 2020 Goodwill Ambassadors Program
project_summary: >-
  The Census Goodwill Ambassadors (CGA) program is the City of Los Angeles’
  effort to recruit, train, and deploy volunteers to assist with informing,
  educating and motivating hard-to-count populations in Los Angeles to respond
  to the 2020 census questionnaire. CGAs will effectively be the face and voice
  of Census 2020 on-the-ground outreach efforts. Obtaining this grant will allow
  us to provide micro-grants to CGA volunteers to carry out education and
  outreach activities.

What does your organization do?: >-
  The mission of Mayor Eric Garcetti’s Census 2020 Initiative is to facilitate a
  fair and accurate decennial count in Los Angeles through education, outreach
  and engagement of hard-to-count populations.
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.: []
Briefly tell us a story that demonstrates how your organization turns inspiration into impact.: >-
  The Office of Mayor Eric Garcetti’s Census 2020 Initiative was established
  because the Mayor recognizes that it is more important than ever to make sure
  that all Angelenos are counted. Mayor Garcetti issued Executive Directive 21
  to direct City departments to assign liaisons to work with our office, develop
  Census outreach plans, and has invested $1.2 million to-date for Census 2020.
  Still, the potential addition of a citizenship question has caused fear and
  anxiety around Census 2020 during a time when overall trust in the federal
  government is eroding, namely among our immigrant communities. With more than
  1.5 million immigrants living in the City of Los Angeles, comprising over 38%
  of our population, the story of Los Angeles is fundamentally tied to the
  stories of our immigrant residents. The Mayor’s Office has been deeply engaged
  in efforts to integrate immigrants into the City’s social, economic, and
  political fabric through the Office of Immigrant Affairs. To date, the Office
  has actively engaged more than 150,000 Angelenos through its work to
  coordinate city services, develop programs and initiatives that promote
  citizenship, civic engagement and advocate on local, state, and national
  legislation and policy. From the Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs to the
  incredible programs provided by local community organizations, Los Angeles
  comes together to support our immigrant neighbors and the 2020 Census is no
  different. We need to ensure that our immigrant populations are included in
  the nation’s headcount, or the full story of Los Angeles will not be told in
  2020. By recruiting and training members of our own hard-to-count
  communities--like immigrants--to serve as CGA’s the Mayor’s Office will
  leverage trusted relationships and promote a sense of safety and confidence
  among our hardest-to-count.
Which metrics will your submission impact?:
  - Government responsiveness to residents’ needs
  - Rates of volunteerism
  - Total number of local social media friends and connections Angelenos have
Will your proposal impact any other LA2050 goal categories?: []
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
How will your project make LA the best place?: >-
  The Census Goodwill Ambassadors (CGA) program will make measurable progress in
  the way Angelenos connect. Most directly, the CGA program will likely increase
  the rates of volunteerism across LA in 2020, and hopefully beyond.
  Additionally, the program will be responsive to residents’ needs by seeking to
  understand the variety of barriers to completing the survey and then
  recruiting and training trusted messengers to address those barriers. Since
  the CGA program will promote civic engagement, we hope it will increase voting
  rates in hard-to-count (HTC) communities by familiarizing them with government
  processes. Since CGAs will be encouraged to utilize social media for posting
  events and content, the program will foster local social media friends and
  connections. From distributing the funds that provide healthcare services and
  maintain our infrastructure, monitoring discrimination and enforcing civil
  rights laws, and informing businesses on where to build new locations, the
  2020 Census count will influence life in LA.
   
   We are leading a pilot version of the CGA program in the Summer of 2019 designed to solicit feedback from the community, test its effectiveness, and iterate an improved version for 2020. We are seeking to engage the HTC populations in this program in order to improve their likelihood of response, and thus, the likelihood that they will be represented in the distribution of over $883 billion in federal funds, as well as political reapportionment and redistricting at all levels of government. Communities that are typically HTC include racial and ethnic minorities, renters, immigrants, residents living in poverty, children under 5, seniors, residents experiencing homelessness and English language learners. About 57% of residents in the City of Los Angeles live in hard or very hard-to-count census block groups.
   
   Recruitment for the pilot program will begin in April 2019, and by June 2019 we will begin training and commence early deployment. Our team is working with community partners to identify recruits. We are seeking approximately 80 CGAs over the span of 4 training sessions in HTC communities in South LA, Boyle Heights, Pacoima, and Harbor/Wilmington. In July and August 2019, all CGA participants will be responsible for hosting a minimum of 1 census community event.
   
   The results of the pilot will determine how we proceed with the rest of the program. September and October 2019 will be spent refining the program. From November 2019 through February 2020 we will host trainings and begin deployment. Once the online self-response tool is released by the Census Bureau in late March 2020, we will prioritize using CGAs to staff Census Action Kiosks, provide language assistance on-site, and share social media messaging. The Census Bureau will also provide live response data that we will utilize in real-time to deploy CGAs to areas that have a higher need. The CGA program will remain active until the end of the self-response period in July 2020.
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project (testing a new idea on a small scale to prove feasibility)
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  We are defining and measuring the success of the overall Census 2020
  Initiative by the accuracy of the count of Los Angeles in 2020. The 2020
  Census data will be released in March 2021 to the states (for redistricting)
  and in December 2021 to the public. The State of California is intending to
  conduct its own California Housing and Population Sample Enumeration to assess
  the accuracy of the federal count. Community organizations and research
  institutions will also conduct assessments of the accuracy of the decennial
  count. We will be able to properly measure the success of our Census 2020
  Initiative upon the release and assessment of this data. 
   
   For the Census Goodwill Ambassadors program, we are defining success by the program’s ability to recruit enough CGAs to replicate the linguistic, ethnic, cultural, and geographic diversity of Los Angeles and by how well we staff Census Action Kiosks (CAKs) throughout the self-response period. One key metric for how well the CGAs serve the diversity of Los Angeles is by the languages they speak. We hope to have CGAs who can translate into as many languages as possible, prioritizing the languages that will not have full translation support from the Census Bureau. The presence of CGAs at our CAKs will be a central goal of this program. The kiosks will be where CGAs can provide direct assistance to residents who want to respond to the survey. This assistance will be in the form of digital literacy guidance by helping residents navigate the CAK webpage, translation services for informational resources and/or the survey itself, and providing additional information in-language and in-culture.
