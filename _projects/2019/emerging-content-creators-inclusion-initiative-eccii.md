What does your organization do?: >-
  NALIP is a nonprofit whose mission is to discover, promote and inspire Latinx
  content creators and diverse voices across all media platforms.
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.: []
Briefly tell us a story that demonstrates how your organization turns inspiration into impact.: >-
  NALIP works to turn inspiration into impact by providing creators with the
  resources and support they need to get their projects off the ground and
  advance their careers in this entertainment industry. Over last 20 years,
  NALIP has proudly equipped Latinx and diverse voices with the proper tools to
  enter the industry including funding for projects. 
   
   
   
   One example of how NALIP has impacted the industry and creatives is through our Latino Lens Incubator program. Through partnerships with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the Time Warner Foundation we have been able to fund short content projects for diverse filmmakers in the industry. 
   
   
   
   One of our most recent participants is Kase Pena, who was a finalist, screened her short film at our Media Fest, and is in the process of selling that film and distributing it to a major network. Through our mentorship process, we recommended her for a TV show that was staffing and looking for women, people of color, and Trans writers. Kase is currently a staffed writer on this show, earning writing credits from a major network.
   
   
   
   Another NALIP member who has also been a part of our programs is Nancy C. Mejia: she was a semifinalist for one of our Latino Lens Incubators. Through our programs, she was able to achieve her 3-5 year goal of being a writer into 18 months. She has most recently been staffed on a critically acclaimed TV series, VIDA on STARZ and was brought back for the second season to direct two episodes.
   
   
   
   NALIP strongly feels that the mentorship component of our programs is crucial to their success. It is through this, that creatives receive guidance to fortify their skills and obtain the necessary tools to advance in the industry. The NALIP Board of Directors, Executive Director, and staff all work together to connect with Latinx and diverse storytellers in need of hands-on support in order to develop strong careers in a very competitive industry that is slow to embrace Latinx and diverse creators, stories or content. This village, this concerted effort and proactive approach, allows for a continuous cycle of support and a strong foundation to ensure the longevity of inclusive voices and stories to this incredible industry.

  NALIP’s Emerging Content Creators Inclusion Initiative aims to provide support
  for the next generation of creatives through a variety of programs and events:
   
   
   
   Educational Forums/Panels
   
   
   
   Networking Sessions
   
   
   
   Mentorship Opportunities
   
   
   
   Summer Programs
   
   
   
   Workshops
   
   
   
   Funding Opportunities for College-Entry Projects
   
   
   
   The Emerging Content Creators Inclusion Initiative (ECCII) will serve college-aged youth, particularly women, minorities, and members of the LGBTQ community. The initiative will be an informative, step-by-step guide for young content creators to be integrated into the entertainment industry. These young creators, primarily between 18-24 years of age, will possess a demonstrated interest in pursuing a career in media. Through the physical and digital platforms NALIP will provide, the Emerging Content Creators Inclusion Initiative will reach over 100,000 Angelenos and promote the advancement of emerging talent.
   
   
   
   NALIP aims to host a variety of events for participants of the Emerging Content Creators Inclusion Initiative throughout the year. 
   
   
   
   Summer: Participants of this initiative will be able to further realize their passion for creating through special workshops during the NALIP Media Summit. They will also have a scheduled agenda to attend the best panel sessions geared toward their career goals. During this time, there will also be participants that can be part of the volunteer/internship opportunities that NALIP has to offer.
   
   
   
   Fall: Participants will attend a workshop or mentorship session that coincides with the Media Fest, a two-day festival featuring content by Latinx creatives. They will be able to take a look at the careers of seasoned professionals as well as break into intimate groups where they can have more one-on-one mentorship sessions with these industry experts. 
   
   
   
   Winter: the initiative will coincide with the Diverse Women in Media Forum, where NALIP provides an intimate setting for Women of Color to network and build community. 
   
   
   
   Between the months of January and June: NALIP will host a series of workshops and events for participants to continue the facilitation of their careers. 
   
   
   
   NALIP will also create the submission process for emerging creatives involved in the initiative to submit a concept and garner funding for projects that will grant them entry into an accredited institution for higher education. 
   
   
   
   This project will make measurable progress towards making LA the best place to create by increasing the resources available to emerging creatives in order for them to succeed in this industry and continue to advance their creative platform. This program will be offered throughout Los Angeles and its extremities to create an accessible point of entry for emerging creators. The Emerging Content Creators Inclusion Initiative will become a focal point within NALIP’s annual events, social media, newsletter, and beyond to enhance, engage, and advance the initiative’s mission.
