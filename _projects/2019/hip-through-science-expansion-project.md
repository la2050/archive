title: HIP Through Science Expansion Project
project_summary: >-
  We have a truly amazing, inspiring, grassroots STEM program, "H.I.P through
  Science". We are seeking to expand countywide to educate more youth in
  underserved communities. We will do this by adding additional programming and
  collaborating with existing afterschool programs. 5,000+ additional youth will
  be served with top notch quality education in the next three years. As we
  continue to grow, we will hire a volunteer manager and program assistant to
  sustain and expand the growth of the program.

What does your organization do?: >-
  The People of Change offers programs to promote advancement opportunities for
  community members through community-based initiatives in areas of Education
  Economic Empowerment and Cultural Awareness.
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.:
  - The East Side Riders Bike Club
  - Ted Watkins Park
  - Nickerson gardens resident advisory committie
  - Gonsaque courts resident advisory committie
Briefly tell us a story that demonstrates how your organization turns inspiration into impact.: >-
  As for myself growing up in a inner city where there were no STEM educational
  pipeline programs. Of course you had your pick of sports programs and teams to
  pick from but, when it came to any educational STEM programs to harness the
  skills of any kids interested the choices were obsolete. I thank my mother for
  purchasing small science kits as a child for me to experiment and be a mad
  scientist in my makeshift bath room laboratory. One big inspiration or mentor
  of sorts to many kids growing up in my generation is Bill Nye the Science guy
  his witty comedy and Science experiments furthered inspired a generation of
  science enthusiast. 
   
   Attending a University that lacked diversity was a complete shell shock especially when it came to STEM classes, being in classes with people from cultures I've only seen on tv was quite the experience. It became a burden when in our STEM labs (As a pre-med then geology then major at the time) no one wanted to partner up with me even in some instances some would triple up with a duo instead of partnering with me often times I'd partner with the professor or do a lab by myself. I ended switching after 3 years out of the STEM field major as a whole and graduated with African American Studies and Sociology.
   
   After moving to California from the East Coast my first job was as a Community Organizer in South LA (SPA 6) as a grassroots organizer for 3 years I noticed one of the obvious figures in poverty was education and lack of programs that provide quality relatable education. I started a small pilot STEM program watts which was well received and it allowed me to see first hand just how bad the educational problem is the community I was serving. I reached out to a few other local community leaders and we started a non profit focused on education, income, cultural awareness and health. This is where HIP Through Science was birthed. Out of the need for quality relatable STEM education in South LA, since its inception we have served the community and are inspiring 1,000's yearly. We will continue to upgrade our methods and tools and we hope that with your help we can deliver to and help cater to the children that wasn't to learn STEM!
Which metrics will your submission impact?:
  - District-wide graduation rates
  - 'Students’ immersion in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math content'
  - Student education pipeline
Will your proposal impact any other LA2050 goal categories?: []
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South LA
  - South Bay
  - Antelope Valley
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
How will your project make LA the best place?: >-
  To date the math and science proficiency rates for youth in South Los Angeles,
  Watts, and Compton areas are dismal. In Watts, students that achieve a score
  at or above proficiency on state-wide math exams for elementary is 17% average
  35% middle school is 6% average is 34% high school is 8% while the average is
  33%. In an increasingly complex, technologically-based society, students need
  at least a fundamental understanding of STEM education to lead productive
  lives. Currently African-American students have the lowest rate of
  mathematically proficient students at 15%, compared to 66% of Asian students,
  52% of white students, and 19% of Latino students. According to CAASPP there
  are currently 31 schools that have 0% 5th graders who meet proficiency
  standards.
   
   
   
    HIP Through Science has engaged 1,000’s of South LA residents and students with your support we will continue to provide STEM education through community education events, Annual Science Fairs, and on-going weekly and summer HIP Through Science sessions. The time for positive change is now. We need additional funding and resources to build on this strong foundation. The HIP Through Science program can continue creating relatable education platforms for the children of South Los Angeles with your help.
   
   
   
   With this project we will identify 20 new locations county wide which qualify as low income and under represented and will partner with local afterschool and summer programs. Locations will provide space to learn and children, We will provide the structured STEM learning tools. Each site will meet twice a week for an hour and classes will include special guest, hands on teaching and a safe fun learning environment.
   
   
   
   The project will measure progress on this particular project by a series or select focus groups beginning and end of project. We will have progress surveys, end of session exams and subject quizzes. Also our annual pinnacle event the HIP Through Science fair will be used as a measurable tool by way of new ideas and new participation from local community students we've had some amazing ones in the pastvz.
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects)
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  The measures of our success will be measured through a variety of methods. We
  will have quarterly quizzes that will be assigned and given out to each site
  to find out what educational points need to be improved on. We will track the
  improvements and our goal will be to have each child improve test scores and
  be STEM ready to meet state-wide testing requirements. HIP Through Science
  surveys will be given out also quarterly to determine and measure the interest
  gained while attending sessions. Information will be provided on such topics
  as what are the STEM field careers that they are familiar with before and
  after, what type of STEM careers relate to what they would like to do in life.
  Our Annual HIP Through Science Fair has a community pillar for some years now;
  we have doubled our number of participants each year and community attendance
  since our first. We will continue to measure the attendance of our future
  science fairs. Our success will also be measured by our youths’ willingness to
  participate in sessions and having the confidence to read in front of other
  peers in each session. We will continue to track our 8th graders from this
  project to see how many in 3 years will be applying to s STEM related major in
  college.
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?: []
