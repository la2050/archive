  C5LA will offer leadership development, mentoring, college preparatory, and
  service learning programs to 300 students in grades eight to twelve over one
  year. With the goal of helping youth: 1) graduate high school; 2) navigate the
  process of applying and enrolling in college; and 3) pursue a career path of
  their choosing, the C5LA program is structured as follows:
   
   Year One—Learning to Take the Lead: Eighth graders begin with a team building program that prepares them for the adventures that lie ahead. During the school year, youth participate in a two-day high ropes challenge course where they learn the importance of leadership and teamwork. In the summer, students travel to Hyattville, Wyoming for four weeks for Camp Paintrock–Leadership U. At camp, they learn about themselves and others, developing fundamental leadership skills while participating in adventure activities.
   
   Year Two—Leadership in Practice: Students apply newly developed leadership skills in challenging real world settings. Throughout the year, youth prepare for their upcoming summer experience through a variety of planning programs and a three-day camping trip. Year two culminates in the 12-day C5LA Bridges/Paintrock Leadership Challenge—a backcountry leadership adventure in Montana and Wyoming, where youth make decisions, solve problems, and learn to work together effectively.
   
   Year Three—Exploring My Future: Participants explore choices for post-secondary education and careers through The Road to College, a 7-10 day college campus tour. While on the tour, teens engage in a volunteer service project in one of the communities they visit. 
   
   Year Four—Visionary Leadership: Students spend a week on a college campus where they identify the needs of community members, create potential solutions to the unique problems faced by the community, meet people who are making a difference in the community, develop a multimedia presentation about their experience, and teach others about the importance of giving back. Youth continue their college preparation through seminars and attendance at college fairs.
   
   Year Five—Looking Ahead and Giving Back: In their final year, youth develop and host the C5 A.C.T. Now Summit. This culminating day-long college access event is presented to their peers—students who share similar life experiences but lack the resources, skills, and preparation that our C5LA students have obtained through their years with the program.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  According to recent studies, only 45% of all LAUSD freshmen ultimately receive
  a high school diploma. For ethnic minorities, the graduation rate is even
  lower. Nationwide, African-Americans drop out of school at almost twice the
  rate of Caucasians, and Hispanics at over three times the rate of their
  Caucasian peers.
   
   A lack of education impacts a person’s whole life. High school dropouts are 72% more likely to be unemployed, three times more likely to be arrested over their lifetimes, and the less formal education one has, the worse one’s health tends to be. Ultimately, low graduation rates impact entire communities, as historically under-served populations lose potential talent, leadership, income, and access to credit and capital—all of which could otherwise invigorate local economies.
   
   Key to the future success of all youth is a high school degree. Research clearly demonstrates that teens with successful role models earn higher grades and have greater self-esteem. Unfortunately, C5LA students lack such role models, as they become the first people in their families to attend college. 
   
   C5LA makes Los Angeles a better place to learn by providing education and supports to under-served youth and encouraging and facilitating high school graduation and college matriculation. The impact of our program on today’s youth is clear: for the past two years, 100% of our students have graduated from high school and gone on to college.
   
   C5LA is also helping make Los Angeles the best place to learn in 2050 by preparing program graduates to be leaders in the community and to take their education and leadership skills into their neighborhoods, schools, and places of work to perpetuate a cycle of improvement for others. These benefits are particularly important in Los Angeles’ low-income neighborhoods, where there are too few examples of success with which youth can identify. 
   
   Giving back to the community is essential and all youth are required to spend at least 30 hours per year engaged in community service activities. The program also cultivates continued service through its Counselor in Training in Program (“CIT”). CIT provides C5LA graduates an opportunity to further develop the skills they obtained through their five years in the program. “C5ers” participate in either the Leadership Camp in Wyoming or the Road to College Tour and the ACT NOW Summit. Students build skills that help create well-prepared and high-quality counselors and prepare them for the future.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  C5LA’s Leadership Development and College Preparatory Program serves Los
  Angeles students who are at high risk for school dropout based on family
  poverty, single or no-parent homes, precarious living circumstances, and
  prevalence of gangs in their neighborhoods. 
   
   C5LA participants are Latino (56%), African American (22%), Asian/Pacific Islander (11%), Caucasian (7%), and other backgrounds (4%). One hundred percent come from low-income, working poor backgrounds and most live in homes where the annual income is less than $10,000 per family member. The average student in our program comes from a family of five members with a total annual income of $21,000. One hundred percent of C5LA youth participate in the federal free lunch program and over 90% are the first in their families to attend college. 
   
   More broadly, C5LA benefits the community by developing college-ready youth who have self-confidence and positive self-esteem, value diversity, and function effectively in a multicultural environment. The success of our youth as first-to-college family members, peer mentors, and community leaders also directly impacts the lives of their families, friends, and community: siblings/friends gain a positive role model and the community gains an engaged citizen. Successive generations will be more likely to attend college and their futures will change dramatically. Financial stability, better health, less violence and incarceration, and greater opportunities for advancement and retirement security are all likely outcomes of a college education.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  C5LA works with organizations such as Educare, the Posse Foundation,
  Champions, Impact, and UCLA Uni-Camp to collaborate on serving more youth
  through our leadership programs. We are also partnered with the Fulfillment
  Fund and Princeton Review to enrich our college preparatory programming,
  including our youth participating in their standardized test taking prep
  classes and the Fulfillment Fund’s Destination College fair. 
   
   C5LA also partners with 18 schools in the LAUSD through the Beyond the Bell Program, an initiative that provides after-school enrichment opportunities for underserved youth. Because C5LA aims to prepare youth for college through programs like the Road to College, the agency has developed extensive partnerships with dozens of colleges and universities, including throughout California and into Oregon and Washington for the Road to College and across the country as students have explored and entered universities around the country for more than 10 years. In addition to the Road to College, the A.C.T. Now Summit enables students to spend a week on a local college campus designing and developing a day-long college access and awareness event for other at-risk students. Each year, A.C.T. Now impacts not just the lives of our program youth, but 500 others as well in the culmination of the program when C5 youth deliver the fall college preparatory program to hundreds of peers. 
   
   As a result of our participation in the Los Angeles Social Venture Partners's “Fast Pitch” program, C5LA partnered with South Central Scholars in the creation of the “College Access Brain Trust,” which now includes leadership from several key organizations, including the National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship and the former Magic Johnson Foundation. 
   
   We ensure our collaborations are successful by:
   • Working closely with existing collaborative partners to further develop our program;
   • Seeking out relationships with college preparatory programs that have been proven effective; and
   • Constantly exploring how we can partner with new organizations that serve a similar youth demographic.
