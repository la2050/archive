Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Ignite has teamed up with experienced educators in LA and across the nation to
  build the best collaborative digital creation tool made specifically for the
  classroom. From their own device, students create beautiful digital projects
  with help from members of their group. The types of creations that were once
  only possible through tools with steep learning curves like Photoshop.
  Students leverage text, images and videos from around the web with tools built
  into Ignite’s editor. Projects can be edited in real time by other members of
  the group.
   
   In addition to the rich creation experience, we will build a wide range of teacher tools. We know that teachers don’t have enough time as it is so things like creating an account, classes, assignments is built directly into our workflow. We track individual student contributions and a produce progress report for teachers that clearly identifies what each student contributed. Individual responsibility can finally be fairly assessed in the group project environment with Ignite.
   
   Nick Sithi, a core member of our founding team is a full-time teacher with over 9 years of experience educating the youth of LA. He not only provides crucial product feedback but also runs Ignite’s private alpha which is deployed to a group of K12 educators. During this alpha phase we are receiving crucial, real-time feedback from teachers across the nation.
   
   Right now we’re all heads-down preparing the iPad app for our beta launch in September. Soon after we will focus on the following four areas;
   
   1. Cross Platform
   Although we initially launched with the iPad we plan to have cross platform support by Q1 2015. This means that Ignite will run on any tablet, PC, and across all major browsers. We will make sure any school can use Ignite regardless of their previous technology decisions (Chromebooks, iPads, etc).
   
   2. Teacher Tools
   It’s paramount that teachers have the ability to assess individual contributions to the project, check for plagiarism, and manage student workflow. Teachers will be provided with clear reports that provide this key information.
   
   3. Primary school use cases
   Once 1 and 2 are achieved, we will focus on making Ignite malleable for primary school use cases. The earlier we can get kids to create, the better. However, the ability of a 3rd grader is very different than that of a 7th grader. Teachers will have the ability to customize the Ignite’s creation process to take into account the varying skills levels.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  According to Creating Minds*, “At age 5 we use 80% of our creative potential
  but by age 12 we drop to as low as 2% and stay there for the rest of our
  lives.”
   
   Today, LA has roughly 640,000 students in K12 among its 1000+ schools spread over 720 square miles. We believe a majority of those kids would not consider themselves creative because they aren’t labeled as artists or musicians. These are the same kids who are or going to be subject to an increased focus on collaboration in the classroom through the new Common Core Standards**. This is especially true in the subjects of English Language Arts & Literacy in History/Social Studies, Science, and Technical Subjects.
   
   Through Ignite’s blend of creativity, collaboration, and confidence building we are empowering teachers all over LA to give their students the critical experiences they need be better citizens of LA and the world. They learn how to CREATE, leverage technology to further their own understanding of subjects, explore new ideas, define their own interpretation of theories, contemplate subjects from different angles, and articulate things in their own personal way. They learn to COLLABORATE, how to communicate, how to navigate disagreements, how to voice their opinion, how to use other’s opinion to shape new ideas, understand how their individual efforts impact the success or failure of the group. They understand the importance of RECOGNITION of their own hard work as well as the hard work of others.
   
   We believe all these skills must be learned in the most crucial time in their lives when they are most malleable, that is,starting from kindergarten all the way up to high school. This is why Ignite is important TODAY.
   
   TODAY, there are the 640,000 students in LA trying to find out who they are, navigate adolescence, young adulthood, trying to form their own opinions, make friends etc. In 2050, they will be LA. They will be our inventors, creators, makers, entrepreneurs, educators, inspirers and leaders. The future Elon Musks, Barack Obamas, Sheryl Sandbergs of the world. And why? Because LA believed in a kind of 2014 that valued creativity, collaboration and technology in the classroom.

What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Any student from kindergarten to high school. The younger they start Igniting,
  the better, because the sooner you explore creativity and collaboration, the
  more time you have to sharpen those skills. We want to make creativity a habit
  we learn as soon as we can start to read and write. By LA2050, we believe no
  one should be saying, “I’m not creative enough to do [something]”. They _will_
  do it because of initiatives like Ignite that taught them how to think
  creatively especially with other collaborators. Students will take the skills
  they’ve learned using Ignite with them into the world, long after their formal
  education careers are over and pay off in dividends in every single aspect of
  their life.
   
   Teachers will also benefit from Ignite through its assessment features. Ignite generates a progress report for each group, detailing the efforts of each student involved. Concrete data will allow teachers to fairly assess and acknowledge contributions made by each group member, creating equity during assessment. Teachers can trust their students to become more responsible, knowing that they are held accountable for their actions. 
   
   And where and when did it all begin? LA2014
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Dr. S K Ramesh is Dean, College of Engineering and Computer Science, and
  Professor of ECE at CSUN. He is on the IEEE Ed Activities Board, the IEEE-HKN
  Board of Governors, and the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology
  Board of Directors. Coupled with over 20 years of academic leadership as dean
  and department head at 2 different CSU campuses he has extensive experience
  working with orgs, non-profit boards and is the PI of $5.5mil US DOE grant to
  support and graduate minorities in CECS.
   
   He is Chair of the IEEE Pre-University Ed Coordinating Committee responsible for global programs to encourage youth to pursue careers in CECS. Together, we will find synergies between Ignite and his programs. In addition to product feedback, we also draw upon his expertise in implementing successful outreach programs to promote CECS using external grants.
   
   Dr. Michael Spagna is Dean, College of Education and Dir of the Math and Science Teacher Initiative at CSUN.
   
   His Institute for STEM Education (ISTE) is a cross-college initiative to advance learning, teaching, scholarship, research and innovations in STEM. This will occur through collaborative partnerships with different orgs including businesses such as Ignite. Other projects include Computer Supported Collaborative Science (funded by HP) and the creation of a math app for 8th graders (funded by Lockheed Martin). CSUN is 1 of 11 universities to take part of Carnegie’s “Teachers for a New Era” initiative to re-envision the nation’s teacher education programs for urban classrooms and to develop evidence-based models that can be widely disseminated. As a result, CSUN is positioned at the forefront of empirically based practices nationally.​ This will help Ignite realize our long term potential using pragmatic methods.
   
   Dr. Anthony Galla is 20 year educator and current Elementary Assistant Superintendent in the LA Archdiocese. A former principal of St. Francis de Sales with classroom experience from K through college, with a majority as a Jr. high school history teacher. He also writes grants, assists with school finance policy, and contributing EdTech resources. His vast experience has helped shape Ignite during alpha. He regularly provides the group with commentary regarding EdTech and how he's seen it evolve from his various perspectives as an educator and admin. His use of Ignite will extend to its beta phase, where he will use the app to develop classroom and faculty functions.
   
   All confirmed.
