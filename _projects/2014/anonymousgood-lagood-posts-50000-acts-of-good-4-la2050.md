Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Imagine a city where people actually look for ways to help one another. It’s a
  happier, healthier, more connected, safer feeling place. A place you’d be
  proud to live. AnonymousGood.org helps make that a reality. We have the
  Compassion Technology & the brain science behind serotonin. 
   Our project is a cornerstone of a major campaign to aggregate, celebrate & share stories of Good in LA. It’s guaranteed to make participants happier, healthier, better students & better employees.
   First, we build an app to make it easier to share acts of good, then we work with existing & new partners to reach a broad spectrum of Angelenos. Between non-profits, media, faith communities, youth programs, & business- Angelenos will share 50k stories of LAGood

  AG launches LAGood posts 50K Acts of Good 4 LA2050 
   1- AG will work with existing and new partners to create a grassroots campaign that seeds and shares the story of Good in LA creating a ripple effect of good throughout LA. 
   2- AG will build an app to make it easier for users to post. 
   3- AG will work with individuals & organizations to use our ‘Compassion Technology’ in ways that work for them; to reach out to their constituents & customers, to build employee engagement, use the stories of good in their community while gathering great metrics. AG has a low bar of entry and its equally available and beneficial to anyone. 
   4- AG will get the Acts of Good sponsored so anyone who posts becomes an instant philanthropist. We want all of us to feel connected to people in our own communities & to the global community.
   LAGood will be a collaborative effort (specific partner details in partner section) 
   1. Months 1-3: Build a mobile app and strengthen the website to make it even easier for people to post. 
   2. Work with current partners (signed up and ready to hit the ground running) to amplify Good & inspire more Angelenos to volunteer formally & informally as they post Acts of Good.

   • Examples:

What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  What better way to connect than around doing Good for one another? Scientific
  research is clear - doing Good impacts individuals & communities in expected &
  unexpected ways. Imagine what happens when people all over the city really
  learn that in helping others there is an added benefit of helping yourself!
   This is the critical beginning of LAGood. We will continue with more partnerships so that story of LA Good will be celebrated everywhere – in schools, faith communities, businesses & on billboards or busses. The work of great non-profits will be amplified as the Good they do is told & shared.
   LA is the largest microphone & most powerful trendsetter in the world. Let’s use it to inspire local & global Good. 
   This is just the first step in LAGood. AG will continue to grow and iterate with scientific studies of impact in the workplace, the classroom, prisons & other populations often invisible to the general public.
   OVERALL: Empirical research shows:
   • Committing conscious acts of kindness makes people happy. ‘200 studies on nearly 275,000 people found that happiness leads to success in nearly every domain of our lives, including marriage, health, friendship, community involvement, creativity, and in particular, our jobs, careers and businesses’. Happy people even have better peripheral vision.
   Shawn Achor [Harvard],
   • Consciously recalling & writing a good memory fools the brain into dropping more serotonin. Overall, this leads to greater life satisfaction and meaning. Fun fact: Studies have shown that women who wrote about positive experiences were 40 percent more likely to live to age 94 than their negative peers. Shawn Achor [Harvard]. So for every act you do & post you get a double dose of happiness.
   • The ‘helper’s high’ experienced when doing good for others boosts the immune system, enhances our feelings of joyfulness, emotional resilience, vigor, and can reduce the unhealthy sense of isolation. 
   • Feeling ‘connected’ or part of a community is the single biggest factor on longevity. AG makes it easy for people to create & build their own communities.
   • The practice of caring for strangers or establishing an “affinitive connection”– friendship, love, or positive bonding – those emotions translate to immense healing benefits. 
   • AG captures altruism that is already in action. The US Department of Labor reports Americans increasingly describe their sense of responsibility to help those in need. In 2009, 27% or 64 million Americans volunteered.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Anonymous Good is based on science and common sense – it works for everyone,
  if they work it. So the universal applications are endless although this may
  sound overly ambitious, there is even more data to demonstrate who can benefit
  from AG. We will do strategic outreach to non-profits, youth organizations,
  faith communities, neighborhood councils, businesses.
   
   General Population: 
   • Doing good, even watching movies of others doing good helps reduce stress. In one study, students were simply asked to watch a film of Mother Teresa's work with the poor in Calcutta. They had significant increases in antibodies associated with improved immunity -- and antibody levels remained high for an hour afterward. AG is getting similar reports of well-being after users read goods posted on the site. [Post. Bioethicist, Case Western Reserve]
   • Ripple effect – Human behavior is contagious. Our actions extend to people within three degrees. Each of us can ‘infect’ 1,000 people with our acts of good. [Connection, Christakis & Fowler]
   Youth
   • In one study, children who did 3 acts of kindness per day for a month were not only happier but became more popular, gaining an average 1.5 friends. 
   • US students, ages 8 to 22, spend 7.5 to 9.5 hrs/day on tech gadgets. AG meets them on the screen where they live, helps them feel good & connected with service & global awareness. 
   • GenY searches for meaning by helping others. They volunteer more than any previous generation. 
   • Social Emotional Learning: Two of the core competencies of SEL are Social Awareness & Relationship Skills. Practicing acts of good off-line then coming on-line to share can create a virtuous cycle that supports SEL.
   Business | Govt
   • “Halo Effect” – According to a study by Cone Communications & Echo Research, 82 percent of U.S. consumers consider corporate social responsibility when deciding which products or services to buy & where to shop.
   • Employee Engagement - Gallup research shows that engaged employees are more productive, profitable, safer, create stronger customer relationships, & stay longer with their company. Doing service projects & good acts for each other increased employee engagement. 
   • A report by Harris Interactive, found that the No. 1 factor that young adults ages 21 to 31 wanted in a successful career was a sense of meaning.
   • We will strategize with local gov’t officials to implement AG in their offices. Angelenos could read authentic stories of gov’t actually responding to citizens.
