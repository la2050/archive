Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Through our work we know that sharing leads to more connected, resilient and
  sustainable communities. As part of Shareable’s Sharing Cities Network, we
  seek to make LA a model sharing city by 2050 with a Sharing City Blueprint and
  a ShareFest kick-off event. Featuring sharing strategies and solutions at
  every level of civic life - from neighbor to community, local government,
  education, business and finance, this open source guide will demonstrate how
  to enrich our social fabric through sharing. Our ShareFest will promote the
  blueprint’s completion and offer hands-on programming, workshops, panels,
  skillshares, vendors and entertainment designed to galvanize community leaders
  around a shared vision of a more connected LA.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  To draft a blueprint of this scale, we will work closely with our partner
  Shareable and the Sharing Cities Network, as well as community collaborators,
  experts and consultants. We will research, conduct interviews, hold focus
  groups and brainstorm with the community. We will include what has been
  successful from our own work and can be expanded. We will champion best
  practices from other innovators, solicit diverse interests and input, and look
  for opportunities to connect with other groups that are aligned with our
  vision. We will pay close attention to the unique opportunities in Los Angeles
  and look for the most agile and effective tools. Finally we will work with a
  creative team to produce an accessible and transformative document that offers
  a community-based strategy for helping LA evolve into a sharing city model. We
  will then work with Shareable to promote the blueprint internationally as an
  open source guide.
   
   We will also plan a one-day ShareFest drawing on the social capital of our existing community of changemakers, sharing economy pioneers and local emerging leaders. We will design programming that offers something for the novice, the inducted and the devotee with sharing strategies that are affordable, do-able and effective. We will coordinate educators, speakers, entertainment, vendors, volunteers and security. We will secure the appropriate event permits and insurance. Will will invite everyone in the community to participate, including our local elected officials. 
   
   We will secure the necessary administration to support both arms of the project, as well as develop the partnerships critical for blueprint research, ShareFest planning and programming. We will work with city and neighborhood officials to grow time banking in the city in our continued effort to empower the local community leaders who will carry forward this ambitious but achievable vision.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Several recently published studies and articles highlight the importance of
  social connections in regards to health and happiness. The basis for any form
  of social connection is sharing: sharing a moment, sharing a meal, sharing a
  purpose. But according to The Atlantic, as a society, “We volunteer less. We
  entertain guests at our homes less...And we have fewer and fewer close friends
  with whom we’d share the intimate details of our lives.” 
   
   It is increasingly more difficult to form the relationships that lead to meaningful connections in our over-scheduled, high stress urban lives, or to create the trust needed to ask for help or share with another person. Too often we struggle with financial pressures; the high cost of housing, food, and transportation in LA can overshadow our basic human need for social connection and can lead to great isolation. 
   
   For the past 6 years, we have actively worked to build the relationships that lead to deep and meaningful social connections through sharing time, resources, and knowledge. Through time banking we increase connectedness as well as access to resources in creative ways:
   ● Neighborhood Fruit Harvest
   ● Garden Groups and Barnraisings
   ● Metro Group (that promotes mass transit)
   ● Craft Club
   ● Cookbook Club 
   ● Dog Cooperative
   ● Community Revolving Loan Fund 
   ● Local Economy Incubator
   ● Parent Support Network
   ● Film Screenings
   ● Dance Parties
   ● Monthly Neighborhood Potlucks
   ● Salons and Lectures
   
   The basis of our work is already trying to make LA the best place to connect. Our blueprint is the roadmap for achieving this goal. 
   
   Our project will expand the reach of our successful sharing strategies, grow our network of time banks and strengthen communities where our programs already exist. It will teach communities how to create meaningful work, share helpful resources that increase quality of life and pathways to civic engagement. With our Sharefest as a welcoming party we will create a place for all Angelenos to embrace the city we envision by 2050: a more connected and collaborative place, with equal opportunities for shared housing, food, transportation, work, education, and finance. By cultivating inspiration and nurturing emerging leaders at this event we are investing in the renewable resources needed to power our movement for years to come. And as more people understand and come to value the effects of sharing as they learn how to connect the dots, they will in turn seek even more opportunities to connect.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Our project has the potential to benefit each and every community in Los
  Angeles and this is our long term goal. 
   
   In six years we have grown from a handful of neighborhoods to 21, organically and at the consistent request of community members who are disillusioned with business as usual. Because sharing strategies of this nature are often informal, require very little infrastructure for impact and can be implemented by average men, women and children, we see enormous opportunities to transform the fabric of LA one neighborhood at a time. 
   
   We want this blueprint to offer solutions for neighborhoods struggling with access to food and employment, communities that have historically been told they do not have a place at the social decision making table, for the kids who need meaningful after school activities to avoid delinquency, for the small businesses that benefit from a strong local economy, for the nonprofit organizations that desperately need volunteers to serve their clients, for our local elected officials who need innovative solutions to persistent community problems, for visitors who come to this great city with the preconceived notion that we move too fast, care only about money and have no soul. 
   
   This blueprint will address a lion share of the complex social issues our city faces through incredibly organic and simple strategies and help guide “the powers that be” towards them so we can effectively move this vision forward together.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  Our confirmed collaborators are the Arroyo Seco Network of Time Banks members
  (www.asntb.com), Shareable (www.shareable.net), The Sharing Cities Network
  (www.shareable.net/sharing-cities), and Cooperative Development consultant and
  expert, Sarah Manski (www.PosiPair.com).
   
   The ASNTB is the foundation of our work and infuses everything we do with social capital. Drawing on our 1,300 individual members and over 40 organizational and nonprofit members for expertise, experience and manpower, we will leverage thousands of volunteer hours for time credits. We will call on them heavily as stakeholders during the blueprint process and as volunteers, vendors, speakers, panelists and leaders at ShareFest. 
   
   Shareable provides us with inspiration and network support from other experienced sharing advocates. We have worked with them on map jams, ShareFests, and a series of workshops for our Local Economy Incubator. We will work closely with them and the Sharing Cities Network for blueprint development so our framework is flexible enough to serve cities everywhere. They will help us promote the blueprint and ShareFest.
   
   Sarah Manski brings years of activism, research and implementation to our project. She will lead the development of a cooperative strategy for Los Angeles, incorporating both grassroots and high-level partnership models such as the Cleveland Model to our blueprint as a means of democratizing wealth and greater access to more sustaining work for Angelenos. 
   
   We also hope to consult with the Sustainable Economies Legal Center (www.theselc.org) in our continued work with them to making sharing economy solutions available to all who want them. Critical to the success of our 501c3 paperwork, SELC is currently working on an economic blueprint for the Bay Area. They will help us navigate sharing law. 
   
   We will also reach out to local community leaders and our network of sharing economy pioneers, consultants and experts for input on the blueprint.
   
   The factors critical to our collaborative success are: shared vision, respect and reciprocity. Shared vision ensures we are pulling in the same direction - towards an interconnected, livable city where people from all walks of life can thrive. Respect allows for us to share our diverse perspectives, ideas and solutions. Reciprocity allows us to focus on community, not individual betterment, and meaningful exchange rather than service or charity.
