Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): |-
  “Electricity is really just organized lightning.” - George Carlin
   
   This is the crux of our approach for a cohesive, coordinated, community-based after school program. In an organized collaboration to create an electric and dynamic after school program, we will harness the lightning power of established groups who are experts in each of their fields and have a track record of providing enrichment classes in LA schools.
   
   We will implement this project in the second semester of the 2014-2015 school year. The first pod will begin on Jan 12th and the second will run till April 10th. With structured 6 week pods, we will work with students for 3 hours everyday after the bell rings. Two cohorts of 3 groups of 20 will rotate every hour, participating in each module. So while one group is in the water safety program, the second will be learning the four emotions through improv, and the third would be practicing yoga and mindfulness exercises. Another day, they would rotate between creative writing, learning the components of competitive swimming, and preparing a meal with produce from farmers markets. Several times a week, the students will also tend to the community garden.
   
   Parent volunteers will be recruited not only to assist instructors, but to participate in the activities themselves. They will help with the garden, learn a dance routine, and become informed about water safety. 
   
   While we believe that the process is the product, that learning is a lifestyle and has no finish line, we also believe in the empowerment of students to share their experience with their local community. Parents will help host a culmination festival in the week of April 13th. Students will present work-in-progress artistic pieces, serve healthy food they have prepared, and engage in a dialogue of their experience in the program. Open to the local community, we will also live stream the event in order to share it with the global community.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Young bodies especially need active PLAY time! A Cornell University study
  found that an additional 1 hour/week of PE reduces obesity probability of a
  fifth-grader by 4.8%. Everyday for one hour, students will either be in a
  water safety class, or participating in the Mustang Swim Team practice. In
  addition to these daily one hour sessions, they will also participate in yoga
  classes.
   
   To have the energy and desire for active PLAY, children need to make better food choices. UC Davis and UC Berkeley cost-benefit analysis showed for every $1 spent on nutrition education, between $3.67-$8.34 is saved in health care costs. Nutrition education will be disseminated through improv exercises and through hands-on cooking classes.
   
   Cooperation and conflict-resolution is essential for individuals to PLAY together. The US Departments of Education and Justice Report shows students in after school programs have fewer behavioral problems, more self-confidence and can handle conflicts better than non-involved students. Instructors will be trained in how to work cooperatively with their students, how to use positive reinforcement, and use any conflicts as teachable moments.
   
   We see these goals as a reality for one school within the next year. By 2050, we aspire to have Arts & Fitness After School implemented county wide in Los Angeles.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The neighborhood of Florence in South LA is under 3 square miles yet has a
  population of over 44,000, ranking among the highest density areas in LA
  County. The population is comprised of mostly Latinos at 70% and
  African-Americans at 28%. The median age is 23, the median household income is
  $29,447, 40% are living below the poverty line, and 60% of adults hold less
  than a high school diploma.
   
   Approximately 2,500 families are headed by single parents. In an average week, the residents of Florence will experience 13 violent crimes and 23 property crimes.
   
   Mary McLeod Bethune Middle School on West 69th Street will be the recipient school for this project. A Title 1 school, Bethune has an an enrollment of approximately 2,500 6th - 8th Grade students. In 2013 CA State Tests, 71.7% of Bethune’s students scored below proficiency in Language Arts and 72.1% below proficiency in Mathematics. According to the CA State Department of Education, Bethune’s Academic Performance Index is 1/10 with 10 being the highest.
   
   Bethune is identified by the Community Coalition as the number one Highest Need middle school in all of LAUSD. Students in High Need schools are almost 5 times as likely to be exposed to gun violence, have 3.5 times the number of students in foster care, and nearly 4 times the number of drop-outs as compared to Low Need schools.
   
   This program will benefit the students of Bethune Middle School, their families and their community.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  With 25 years of presenting assemblies, workshops and residencies, we will
  provide the performing arts module. We have confirmed the organizations and
  companies below as our collaborators. 
   
   The Trojan Swim Club consists of USC graduates and world class athletes from 15 different nations, representing five of the world's continents. Their Outreach Program is aimed at empowering disadvantaged youth in the Los Angeles area and neighboring communities of USC. A benefit of this partnership is that they are already working with Bethune Middle School by reviving the Mustang Swim Team in an otherwise dormant pool facility on their campus. This will be our first time working together.
   
   SC Fitness is a minority female owned and operated small business whose mission is to improve the life of their community through enjoyable exercise with a strong dance influence. SC Fitness was our main collaborator when creating the pilot program of Arts & Fitness After School for Elementary, and was able to underwrite the costs through a Lululemon Athletica Metta Grant. As our collaborator, SC Fitness brings a staff certified by AAFA Youth Fitness, AFTA Group Fitness and dance instructors in Zumba and Ballet.
   
   youTHink is an innovative education program of the Zimmer Children’s Museum which uses the power of art to foster critical thinking, engage diverse learners, promote literacy and serve as a tool for social change. They provide art/education lessons in LA area public schools along with professional development opportunities for teachers. Youth Services provide meaningful art, leadership and community involvement opportunities for middle and high school youth beyond the classroom. This will be our first time working with youTHink.
   
   Happy Healthy Yummy provides bilingual Spanish-English classes rooted in an experiential and experimental hands-on cooking and tasting process. Through continued exposure, and not force, students are introduced to new foods, see others enjoy them, and eventually make their own decision to try new things. Students cook vegetarian seasonal dishes based on available produce to promote seasonal eating. What is most beneficial to working with HHY for the first time is that these classes can be taught without the need of a traditional kitchen.
   
   The three factors critical to our success:
   -Shared methodology of teaching approach 
   -Curriculum & lesson plans that intersperse with each module
   -Weekly check-ins of key leaders for each group
