Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  A city-wide, community-based urban trails authoring platform. This web-based
  tool enables community organizations, interest groups, and the public to
  create a network of connected trails revealing new perspectives on LA and its
  people. Accessible as a mobile website the resulting web of walking paths and
  site specific content enable engagement with the city’s past, present, and
  future.
    
   Creation of this community-supplied, location-based content experienced when walking stimulates discovery and promote new forms of collaborative, self-reflexive, space-oriented storytelling.
    
   The city becomes an open walkable book, an exploratory public space archive, a playful gallery about itself. Let’s fill it with content and narratives that connect us
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Employing participatory design approaches, our experienced UCLA-based creative
  team will build a web-based trail creation tool utilizing an iterative process
  that includes an ongoing dialogue with a core set of diverse community
  stakeholders. Participants will design trails while the technology is being
  developed, using prototypes, while outlining the features that will best
  enable them to construct meaningful urban walking experiences. Our confirmed
  community collaborators (LA Commons, CityLife-LA, and Franklin High School’s
  Arroyo Seco Academy) represent a diversity of perspectives and geographies in
  the city. To ground and enrich the development experience, each group will be
  tasked with creating a neighborhood-based interactive trail expressive of
  their own collective identity. Each group will also be asked to consider the
  possible thematic interconnections with the other groups and connect to each
  others' trails.
   
   A strong foundation for Trail City LA exists through our recent project at the Los Angeles State Historic Park (LASHP). Inspired by the work of students from Franklin High School in Highland Park and through collaboration with institutions based in Northeast Downtown LA, the predecessor LASHP Trails project consists of a mobile website experience featuring three loop trails emanating from LASHP. We will draw on this experience and the technology created for the LASHP Trails project to develop an open source toolset allowing for other community organizations and interest groups to generate and interconnect their own trails. In addition, we will expand the successfully designed and tested LASHP Trails user experience to include social media capabilities that enable personalization, annotation, and dialog between users.
   
   In the one year period of LA2050 funding we expect to engage in three cycles of development, community authoring, and navigation experience. This participatory, dialogic process will permit the development of a tool which integrates the real interests and experiences of each layer of future users.
   
   While LASHP Trails focuses on a centralized content archive and a set of predefined paths, Trail City LA will expand the possibilities to an open content/dynamic pathways approach. Each community group will be able to upload their own site-specific media and connect it to related hotspots in the city. Hotspots will initially be able to contain sequences of images and text, but eventually sounds and videos as well.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  A “trail” is a rough path worn through woods, mountains, or other geographies.
  It is also a stream of things--dust, light, people, ideas, memories,
  stories--that flows behind something moving. We embrace both of these
  meanings, asking Angelenos to blaze new trails by examining the flow of
  history and experience that surrounds us all. By sharpening our sensory
  experience, opening ourselves to our surroundings, and unearthing the stories
  embedded in the world around us, we can learn to be present, engaged, and
  connected with our communities. Trail City LA encourages users to break with
  their everyday relationship to space, challenging them to open their minds and
  bodies to the wealth of culture hidden in plain sight.
   
   We are building a platform through which Angelenos can connect to each other through the medium of place. To author a trail is to embed stories and ideas in space, transforming the seemingly mundane into material for dialogue and creative thinking.
   
   Our proposal is an opportunity to invite new members, youth in particular, into existing community groups, sustain their interest, scaffold their participation, and support the development of a critical understanding of community issues and relate them to larger political and institutional arrangements. Our collaborative work with diverse community groups on the creation of a trail authoring platform ensures a truly user-generated and user-friendly tool which will allow community groups to creatively express their perspective on Los Angeles, furthering their understanding of the world around them and their agency within it. Users will emerge as neighborhood advocates, rooted in their communities and empowered by the interactive public demonstration of their research and their creativity.
   
   Through Trail City, Los Angeles will be a living laboratory, vibrating with the voices and forms of its past, present, and potential future. Our dream outcome of Angelenos’ collective use of the trail authoring platform is the entire city connected through a web of community-authored content. It is a dynamic network of nodal content dancing within Los Angeles, turning any walk into a trail. A trail that is not static, but alive and awaiting your input or augmentation. We believe the best way to connect with the city is on two feet, Trail City LA will be a powerful tool for encouraging walking as an exploratory activity and enhancing our connection to place through engagement and creativity.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  We are building a tool that will benefit all Angelenos. Once built, the trail
  authoring platform could be used by high school history teachers as part of
  class assignments: “let’s build trails that encourage our fellow students to
  walk to school while exposing them to the unique stories of our neighborhood’s
  past” or “lets interview our community elders and build trails connecting
  their stories”. Urban planners could broaden community participation in the
  planning process by asking stakeholders to build trails that reveal the
  aspects they love about their neighborhood, but also its challenges. The
  planners themselves could build trails which explain their priorities and
  expertise. The trail authoring platform is a way to connect ideas and dialogue
  with movement through physical space. It is a tool that, once built, can be
  appropriated for an endless array of uses, all of which will contribute to the
  making of Trail City.
   
   Trail City LA is an open toolset. By embracing the power of place and encouraging engagement with the here and now, the platform allows a dynamic and flexible authoring environment that can serve many different purposes and simultaneously enable connectivity among an amazing diversity of interests and approaches. Just about any community organization, interest group, cultural institution, or educational project will be able to use Trail City in its own unique, self-empowering, and engaging way.
   
   During the next year of development, our collaborating community groups and the communities they represent will benefit the most from our project. These groups will be integral members of the team that is creating the technology; their ideas and experience building trails will be integrated into the design/structure of the technology itself. Through the collective process of building trails, participants will deeply consider their connections to place in Los Angeles. They will closely investigate their surroundings and their identity within them. All trails will be publicly available, providing an empowering venue for expressing the groups’ unique perspectives.
   
   We are building a tool for the active creation of trails, but our project also benefits all physically present Angelenos who would like to experience the urban walks created by others. By encouraging Angelenos to walk and exposing them to hidden, place-based content and narratives we are benefiting all Angelenos who want to live in a livable, connected, and socially just city.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  Successful collaboration with our partners requires a genuine participatory
  design process, of which we identify three critical factors:
   1) A dynamic and consistent participation, not only by the leadership of each collaborating group, but most importantly by their target neighborhood constituency.
   2) Facilitation of creativity that our collaborators find to be significant and truly reflective of their communities' unique identities. 
   3) Production of a tool that is broad and inclusive, reflecting the amazing diversity of our city.
   
   We are collaborating with a select group of community organizations that share our passion for creating a more walkable, civically engaged, and equitable Los Angeles. All of the collaborators identified have confirmed their participation.
   
   LA Commons works to enhance Angelenos’ connection to place through highly visible public art projects that tell dynamic neighborhood stories. In a previous project with LA Commons we engaged a group of high school students from Highland Park to explore unfamiliar neighborhoods, collect images, and create interactive maps sharing their findings. LA Commons brings experience leading walking tours and connections to many different communities around the city such as Leimert Park, MacArthur Park, and East Hollywood.
   
   CityLife works with young people from diverse backgrounds, utilizing the arts to explore culture, history, and politics in Los Angeles. In the Spring of 2013 we collaborated with CityLife, then based at Lincoln High School, in a National Science Foundation funded project that employed participatory design to build a tool for authoring “CyberMurals”: physically interactive digital murals that change based on conceptual parameters. CityLife brings an expertise in working with youth to explore urban issues and deep ties to the neighborhood of Lincoln Heights and Downtown more broadly.
   
   We are particularly excited to be continuing our collaboration with Franklin High School’s Arroyo Seco Academy, because it was the work of their students in 2010 that inspired the Trail City LA concept. Assisted by staff from the National Parks Service, Franklin students designed 30 unique trails that required them to conduct in-depth and on-site research. The trail program has continued each year since then and our trail authoring platform will enhance the process they have already developed and enable the trails they create to contain dynamic media content and reach a wide audience.
