    Peer Health Exchange (PHE) recruits, selects, and trains college student
    volunteers to teach thirteen skills-based workshops to teens in Los Angeles
    on topics including Reflection, Accessing Resources, Decision-Making, and
    Communication & Advocacy. Our workshops build the skills of the teens we
    serve while engaging them in discussions and activities about sexual health,
    mental health, interpersonal violence, and substance use. As slightly older
    peers, PHE volunteers deliver our curriculum to teenagers in a language and
    context that is relevant to their everyday lives while modeling healthy
    behavior. In 2014-15, our 250 LA volunteers (from USC, CSUN and Occidental)
    will teach over 2,200 9th graders across nearly 20 high schools within
    LAUSD.
  implement: "1.\tPHE partners with high schools that lack skills-based health education and in which the majority of the students come from low-income households. These students experience a disproportionate number of serious health risks including unplanned pregnancy, substance abuse, and untreated mental illness. Volunteers teach the PHE curriculum in a required, non-academic class period so that PHE does not interfere with the students’ academic requirements.\r\n\r\n2.\tPHE recruits, selects, and rigorously trains college student volunteers to teach thirteen skills-based workshops on topics including Reflection, Accessing Resources, Decision-Making, and Communication & Advocacy. Our workshops build the skills of the teens we serve while engaging teens on issues related to sexual health, mental health, interpersonal violence, and substance use. PHE maintains a high level of selectivity through our rigorous volunteer recruitment process, securing a minimum of 150% applications to volunteer positions available. This standard allows us to ensure a high level of teaching quality across our cohort.\r\n\r\n3.\tPHE empowers teenagers to make healthy decisions. In the classroom, PHE high school students reflect on and contextualize influences that shape their health-related attitudes and actions; articulate their values and goals; learn basic, accurate health information; practice making and communicating healthy decisions through interactive role-plays; discuss barriers to healthy behaviors and strategies to overcome them; and identify and learn how to use the health resources in their communities.\r\n\r\n4.\tPHE fosters a commitment to public service in college students, many of whom go on to become leaders dedicated to addressing the needs of low-income, urban communities."
  impact_live: "PHE LA was founded to address a growing crisis: our teens are navigating difficult decisions and exhibiting risky behaviors on a daily basis, many of which threaten their bodies, well-being, and futures.  According to data from the 2013 CDC Youth Risk Behavior Survey: \r\n\r\n• 19% of LA teenagers are currently sexually active, and 37% of these teens did not use a condom the last time they had sex\r\n• 28% of LA teenagers currently drink alcohol \r\n• 13% of LA teenagers have seriously considered attempting suicide\r\n\r\nThese issues directly impact high school students' progress to graduation. 30% of young women who drop out of school cite pregnancy or parenthood as a key reason. Heavy alcohol use by age 16 is also strongly associated with high school dropout, particularly for young men. Finally, untreated mental illnesses affect teens’ ability to stay and excel in school. Studies of the associations between psychiatric disorders and high school dropout found a positive correlation between all disorders investigated and high school dropouts. A recent study of LAUSD middle and high school students\r\nfound 40% of adolescents within the district display symptoms of trauma at a level requiring mental health services.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, public schools’ increased focus on academic testing, budget cuts and staffing shortages have exacerbated this crisis by eliminating health courses, leaving teens unprepared to protect themselves against these serious health risks. \r\n\r\nPeer Health Exchange directly addresses this crisis by using relatable and knowledgeable college students to give teens medically accurate, critical facts about their mental, physical and sexual health. Moreover, our volunteers engage teens in real-life role play scenarios and equip them with the skills to make decisions, communicate those choices and access health resources with confidence. \r\n\r\nInvesting in teen health today can impact the overall health of LA County by 2050 by directly decreasing teen pregnancy, STI rates, substance abuse rates, and rates of untreated mental illness, while indirectly increasing high school graduation rates. PHE teens can pass their health knowledge on to their families and friends, today and in the future. And by engaging LA college students in some of the most high-need and underserved schools and communities, we encourage volunteerism and civic participation for years to come. Many PHE teens also report they are inspired by PHE volunteers to engage in community service themselves."
  who_benefit: "During the 2011-2012 program year, 92% of the PHE Los Angeles high school students qualified as low-income and received free or reduced lunch and 90% were Latino or Black. \r\n\r\nThrough our program, PHE high school students will gain:\r\n1.\tThe knowledge and skills they need to make healthy decisions. Teenagers who make healthy decisions now and in the future will be more likely to stay and excel in school, join and remain part of the workforce, improving opportunities for a future life of quality.\r\n\r\n2.\tThe knowledge and tools to access the health resources in their communities. In the Accessing Resources workshops, students identify valid services available from home, school, and in the community, learn how to locate these services, and prepare to access resources and services that are customized to their needs.\r\n\r\n3.\tRole Models. Over the course of thirteen workshops, undergraduate volunteers act as slightly older peers who can respectfully address students’ questions and concerns in a language and context that is relevant to their everyday lives while modeling healthy behavior and the successful transition from high school to college.\r\n\r\nWe have 250 LA volunteers, 68 from CSUN, 90 from Occidental and 90 from USC.\r\nThey will gain:\r\n1.\tHealth knowledge and skills. Several studies demonstrate that peer health educators benefit from their training and teaching roles, particularly by gaining increased knowledge about the health topics they teach. In addition to increased knowledge, several studies show that peer health educators demonstrate an increased ability to communicate with friends, partners, and parents, and make positive changes in their own health behavior, attitudes and goal-setting. This growth in skills and knowledge enables PHE college students to make healthy decisions that will help them complete college, find and retain jobs, and become healthy, happy, and productive adults capable of having healthy families.\r\n\r\n2.\tPublic speaking, teaching, and leadership skills. In PHE training sessions, PHE Health Educators learn how to manage a classroom of high school students and communicate effectively with them, learning skills that are useful in the job market. PHE student leaders also learn to manage a group of their peers. \r\n\r\n3.\tA commitment to public service. Many PHE volunteers are inspired by their experience and go on to become teachers, doctors, public interest lawyers, and policymakers, who will continue to serve their communities throughout their lives. "
  partners_collaboration: "All of the following partnerships are confirmed for the 2014-15 school year:\r\nUniversity of Southern CA\r\nCal State Northridge\r\nOccidental College\r\nLA Alliance College-Ready Schools\r\nPartnerships to Uplift Communities (PUC) Schools\r\nGreen Dot Schools\r\nNew Village Girls Academy\r\nEnvironmental Charter HS\r\n\r\nWe have worked with each of the above partners in past years, with great success. \r\n\r\nOn the college side, each campus has demonstrated a commitment to serving our communities and a student culture invested in volunteerism. Occidental students are especially committed to social justice, as per the mission of their school. CSUN students are especially relatable to our teens, as most come from the communities we serve in the San Fernando Valley (some are even alumni of our high school partners). USC students live in South LA, one of the communities with the greatest need for our program. \r\n\r\nWe must meet a recruitment goal of 150% more applications than we have space for in our cohort to maintain a high degree of volunteer selectivity. College volunteers must also commit to attending weekly trainings led by our staff, and must teach at least 7 times each by the end of the academic year.\r\n\r\nOn the high school side, each of these schools and networks has demonstrated the willingness to provide time and space for our program during the school day, supported by host teachers who are invested in the program's success. PUC Schools and LA Alliance Schools, for the first time, are now sharing the costs of our program.\r\n\r\nOur program must have a 40-60 minute time slot during the school day, be able to reach the entire 9th grade in the school, and have a committed and supportive host teacher in the classroom at all times in order to achieve success."

  evaluate: "1.\tPre- and Post-Test (High School Students): A survey administered to PHE high school students before and after the program to assess their knowledge of the health topics we address. In 2012-13, PHE Los Angeles students made statistically significant increases in their health knowledge, with a 19 percentage point growth from Pre-Test to Post-Test.  \r\n\r\n2.\tProgram Evaluation (High School Students and Partners): A questionnaire completed by PHE high school students, teachers, and principals. In 2012-2013, 92% of PHE Los Angeles high school students said they will use something they learned from PHE workshops to make a healthy decision in the future, and 71% said they had already used something they learned to make a healthy decision. Moreover, 97% of partner high school principals would recommend PHE to other schools.\r\n\r\n3.\tProgram Evaluation (Volunteers): A questionnaire completed by PHE college student volunteers to assess whether their experience in the program has affected their future plans. In 2012-2013, 90% of Los Angeles volunteers reported that their experience with PHE influenced their career plans and 85% of volunteers reported that they were likely to seek opportunities related to PHE’s mission after college. Specifically, 66% of our volunteers are considering a teaching career thanks to their experience with PHE.\r\n\r\nWe have also recently invested in a national evaluation of our impact regarding teen behavior change, with an external evaluation firm leading a control group-based analysis over two years at our Chicago and New York City sites. We are proud to be a learning organization, and will incorporate changes to our curriculum and program structure implied by our evaluation results to achieve the deepest impact possible on the teens we serve. "
  two_lessons: "1. We have seen great results from our Cal State Northridge volunteers in terms of \"relatability,\" given the shared demographics in terms of socioeconomic status and race of a majority of our CSUN students to the teens we serve. In volunteer surveys this past year, 85% of CSUN volunteers reported a strong sense of community with their PHE workshop cohort, in contrast to 53% at Occidental and 42% at USC. Out of all 25 PHE colleges across the country, CSUN volunteers reported the strongest “sense of community” with both their campus chapter and their city chapter of PHE, a significant achievement considering CSUN is one of our newest college partners. Given these results, we are seeking to strengthen and expand our work with Cal State volunteers. \r\n\r\n2. We did not have an Executive Director or more than 1-2 LA Board members for the entirety of our 3rd year of LA operations (FY12). With an LA Executive Director now moving into her third year and an LA Board of 6 (soon to be 7) in place, we can see the path to local financial sustainability, and are focusing our Executive Director and national external affairs staff in service of achieving this goal. We have also committed to recruiting 1-2 National Board members based in LA in the coming year. "
  achievable_goal: >-
    We have refined our core program model over the past decade nationwide and
    over the past five years in Los Angeles. We are confident that we can reach
    at least 2,200 teens in LA County in the 2014-15 school year with a
    volunteer corps of 250 college students, and have a proven track record of
    achieving impact through this model. 
  major_challenges: "1. Need for increased visibility in the LA community to build our network of support\r\n\r\nWe are launching a new communications plan, in conjunction with our national office, and are poised to hire a National Communications Director for the first time in PHE history. As we plan to celebrate our 10th anniversary nationally and our 5th anniversary in LA, we are poised to increase our visibility through new media strategies such as online videos, Giving Tuesday, and a series of celebratory events in LA and beyond. We will also send a quarterly newsletter to our LA donors to stay in close touch with our new and expanding network of supporters in between in-person touchpoints.\r\n\r\n2. Need for strengthened volunteer training as we roll out a brand new curriculum\r\n\r\nWe have key supports in place as we launch our new skills-based curriculum, including an LA Program Director and Program Manager entering their second year, and funding for our national program team members to travel to LA quarterly to provide technical assistance. We have also revised our volunteer training model, including our annual health educator retreat, to focus less on content memorization and more on advanced teaching and facilitation skills, with the goal of a more interactive and engaging curriculum and PHE experience in mind for our teens."
  competition: "Planned Parenthood LA - they train adult volunteers to teach a sexual health curriculum in partner high schools, often through afterschool/weekend programs.  \r\n\r\nPeace Over Violence - they train adult volunteers to teach a teen dating violence/sexual violence curriculum in partner high schools, often through afterschool/weekend programs. \r\n\r\nLA Trust for Children's Health - oversees school-based wellness centers in large LAUSD campuses. Students must opt-in to services.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, we use college student volunteers who are easy for teens to relate to (as age peers), our curriculum is skills-based, and in addition to sexual health, teen dating violence and sexual assault, also includes mental health, substance use, and skills instruction on decision making, communication, advocacy and accessing reliable health resources in teens' own communities. We do not provide direct services such as STI/HIV testing or mental health counseling, but retain strong partnerships and provide referrals to community organizations that provide such services. Our program is during the school day, reaching every 9th grader in each of our partner high schools. "
  cost: "Our total operating cost in LA for FY15 (July 1, 2014-June 30, 2015) is $608,258. Of that, $158,258 will be provided by our national office, to sustain our efforts while we continue to build our LA board and network of supporters. \r\n\r\nWe plan to raise a total of $450,000 in LA during FY15. If we were to get the LA2050 grant, we would raise the remaining $350,000 as follows:\r\n$70,500: Contributions from our high school partners (PUC Schools and LA Alliance Schools)\r\n$122,000: Contributions from our LA Board members and their networks\r\n$20,000: Pricewaterhouse Coopers\r\n$37,500: Events (ex: cooking demo, PHE LA 5th Anniversary party, PHE Alumni bowling tournament, poker tournament)\r\n$100,000: Foundation Grants + Major Donors (pending)"

  impact_metrics: "We directly provide instruction on where and how teens can access healthcare resources in their communities, and on understanding the signs of mental illness, addressing the stigma against naming mental illness, and understanding the seriousness of mental health and the impact it can have on a young person, a family and a community. We expect to see more teens accessing mental health services thanks to our program. \r\n\r\nOur skills-based instruction also builds the confidence and strengthens the agency of young people, factors directly connected to increasing their resilience. As young people become more resilient, so do LA's communities, now and in the future. \r\n\r\nWe also have a secondary impact on teens' progress to high school graduation, and on college students' level of civic engagement in low-income communities throughout LA County."
Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  I have contacted community organizations & subject matter experts that have
  agreed to partner with our organization to "Green The Block" in a West Long
  Beach neighborhood most impacted by GHG emissions and from local pollution
  sources. 
   
   We will launch with outreach and education to community members in an effort to create awareness/acceptance around environmental health, energy-efficient homes, growing food locally, drought tolerant landscaping and gray water systems, and living more sustainable, green-focused lifestyles. 
   
   The next step will be to identify homeowners within a block radius that will participate and support Green The Block efforts. We will identify homeowners via local community groups, churches, neighborhood associations and school groups. Once we have homeowners identified, we will determine home & yard improvements via energy audits, soil tests and urban farming potential evaluations.
   
   Funders will be encouraged to sponsor particular areas of interest to their organization (Victory Farm, Energy Efficiency audits…) and homeowners will be encouraged to provide sweat equity to ensure engagement in the initiative. Local government officials will also be asked to support and promote the initiative as well.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Imagine an entire block of homes in a residential neighborhood retrofitted to
  ensure healthy indoor air quality, helping to reduce the number of
  asthma/upper respiratory cases experienced by children and adults each year.
  Picture the front and back yard of these homes landscaped with either drought
  tolerant vegetation or food producing plants, being watered with recycled
  water from gray water systems. And picture neighbors engaged and working with
  other neighbors to grow fresh food, trade their harvest with other neighbors
  and help grow a community garden nearby.
   
   We will accomplish this goal block by block, family by family, and in one underserved community after the next, until entire LA neighborhoods are transformed into "Green The Block" communities.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Low-income families/homeowners not able to complete energy & health related
  improvements to their homes
   Children and adults suffering from asthma/upper respiratory diseases
   Families living in food desert areas and/or unable to afford quality food choices.
   Long term unemployed workers, including veterans, working mothers, displaced workers, youth at risk, foster youth and re-entry communities.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: |-
  Long Beach Fresh - confirmed
   Foodscape - confirmed
   Building Healthy Communities - confirmed
   Spring St. Farm - confirmed
   Long Beach Office of Sustainability - confirmed
   Grant & Associates Energy Audits- confirmed
   
   Green Education Inc has worked with all of the above partners on outreach programs via Building Healthy Communities (BHC) Neighborhood Workgroup for the past 3-4 years. We have implemented education programs re: energy efficiency, renewable energy, urban/community farming in the BHC service area in an effort to engage and educate low-income community members about the benefits of green & sustainable lifestyles.
   
   3 factors critical to success:
   Joint outreach and education effort in target neighborhood to ensure Green The Block initiative is clearly described, behavioral change is achieved, new behaviors are established, reinforced, rewarded and sustainable within each family household.
   Clear expectations established for each partner organization re: roles, tasks, deliverables, timelines/due dates, goals and budget.
   Ongoing communication & reporting process is established for project members to ensure all project components are planned, designed, launched and evaluated on a regular basis.
