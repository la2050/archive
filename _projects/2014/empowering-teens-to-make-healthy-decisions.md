Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  I have contacted community organizations & subject matter experts that have
  agreed to partner with our organization to "Green The Block" in a West Long
  Beach neighborhood most impacted by GHG emissions and from local pollution
  sources. 
   
   We will launch with outreach and education to community members in an effort to create awareness/acceptance around environmental health, energy-efficient homes, growing food locally, drought tolerant landscaping and gray water systems, and living more sustainable, green-focused lifestyles. 
   
   The next step will be to identify homeowners within a block radius that will participate and support Green The Block efforts. We will identify homeowners via local community groups, churches, neighborhood associations and school groups. Once we have homeowners identified, we will determine home & yard improvements via energy audits, soil tests and urban farming potential evaluations.
   
   Funders will be encouraged to sponsor particular areas of interest to their organization (Victory Farm, Energy Efficiency auditsâ€¦) and homeowners will be encouraged to provide sweat equity to ensure engagement in the initiative. Local government officials will also be asked to support and promote the initiative as well.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Imagine an entire block of homes in a residential neighborhood retrofitted to
  ensure healthy indoor air quality, helping to reduce the number of
  asthma/upper respiratory cases experienced by children and adults each year.
  Picture the front and back yard of these homes landscaped with either drought
  tolerant vegetation or food producing plants, being watered with recycled
  water from gray water systems. And picture neighbors engaged and working with
  other neighbors to grow fresh food, trade their harvest with other neighbors
  and help grow a community garden nearby.
   
   We will accomplish this goal block by block, family by family, and in one underserved community after the next, until entire LA neighborhoods are transformed into "Green The Block" communities.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Low-income families/homeowners not able to complete energy & health related
  improvements to their homes
   Children and adults suffering from asthma/upper respiratory diseases
   Families living in food desert areas and/or unable to afford quality food choices.
   Long term unemployed workers, including veterans, working mothers, displaced workers, youth at risk, foster youth and re-entry communities.

   Green Education Inc has worked with all of the above partners on outreach programs via Building Healthy Communities (BHC) Neighborhood Workgroup for the past 3-4 years. We have implemented education programs re: energy efficiency, renewable energy, urban/community farming in the BHC service area in an effort to engage and educate low-income community members about the benefits of green & sustainable lifestyles.
   
   3 factors critical to success:
   Joint outreach and education effort in target neighborhood to ensure Green The Block initiative is clearly described, behavioral change is achieved, new behaviors are established, reinforced, rewarded and sustainable within each family household.
   Clear expectations established for each partner organization re: roles, tasks, deliverables, timelines/due dates, goals and budget.
   Ongoing communication & reporting process is established for project members to ensure all project components are planned, designed, launched and evaluated on a regular basis.
