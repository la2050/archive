Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Resilient South LA nonprofits will become local capacity builders and earn
  income as community-based consulting firms. Organizations that have shown
  expertise over decades, increased resources and moved key policy will assist
  newer nonprofits and leaders to strengthen their organizations and achieve
  their missions. Local veteran nonprofits could earn millions over time through
  quality consulting and organizational development services. SoACT will
  coordinate, train and support these nonprofits to develop their consulting
  practices and expand indigenous knowledge. With consolidated marketing using
  social media and effective strategic planning, we will collaborate to keep
  consulting dollars in South LA and build a robust nonprofit scaffold.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  1) Train and support 9 South LA partners to provide local capacity building
  services
   
   SoACT is partnering with South LA nonprofits led by people of color that are committed to cultivating a strong nonprofit infrastructure in South LA and ready to become capacity builders in this project. Our founding partners who have shaped this project with us are Community Coalition, Jenesse Center, and Strategic Concepts in Organizing and Policy Education (SCOPE). We are reaching out to additional organizations that have: 1) a track record of providing effective peer learning and consulting; 2) organizational capacity and designated staff to become capacity builders; 3) sound fiscal and organizational health; and 4) board and leadership commitment to develop their capacity building program.
   
   2) Connect 100 South LA nonprofits that want to receive capacity building services from their peers to provide these services
   
   To identify these organizations, we are reaching out to South LA nonprofits that demonstrate: 1) readiness to be an active partner in the consulting process and accountable for implementation; 2) investment in developing staff capacity to meet outcomes; 3) pursuit of consulting topics driven by organizational priorities and strategic plan; and 4) commitment to move beyond a transactional model and build lasting organizational capacity.
   
   3) Provide the infrastructure to sustain and strengthen the project
   
   SoACT will be responsible for fund and resource development, business planning and evaluation of the project. We aim to demonstrate that peer learning and consulting for and by South LA nonprofits is both financially sustainable and organizationally impactful. We will expand use of social media and work to improve network density among organizations focused on earned income, developing expertise and improving capacity.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Our project will help make LA the best place to connect today with a website
  that POPS with engaging content on capacity building; a blog on what we are
  learning and how it is being used to improve our community; “TA Cafes” with
  technical assistance on thorny topics where folks need face-to-face
  inspiration; and webinars that reach those who work to engage voters, improve
  transit and green spaces, find better food and connect with youth and emerging
  leaders. By 2050, we will have a critical mass of well-trained leaders and
  managers to move agendas of equity and justice and sustain revitalized and
  innovative nonprofits. Nonprofits will have easier access to technical
  assistance to improve systems and make better use of volunteers. With
  stronger, more collaborative and strategic community organizations, South LA
  residents will receive better services, play a larger role in the governance
  of local organizations, and find new pathways to engage in community. 
   
   We will help make LA the best place to connect by:
   
   1) Developing the capacity and leadership of people of color-led organizations in South LA, reflecting our population 
   
   2) Mining peer networks and peer learning (Sharing expertise, valuing local knowledge and voices, and exercising a deep commitment to collaboration, coordination and leveraging organizational strengths)
   
   3) Strengthening social change and movement building in South LA (Prioritizing work that is rooted in community organizing and the empowerment of South LA residents, and amplifying the collective work of local organizations and individuals)
   
   4) Improving outcomes for organizations and residents in South LA, including quality of life and economic indicators
   
   5) Developing culturally responsive curricula that builds capacity (We define capacity as our partner SCOPE does: the lasting skills, tools and expertise an organization needs to succeed)
   
   6) Supporting the sustainability of capacity building partners with scaffolds of tools and resources to support and sustain innovation at the community level
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Our project will benefit the leadership, staff, members and clients of the 100
  South LA nonprofits who will receive capacity building services – including
  the 20 who receive individualized consulting – the 9 South LA nonprofits who
  will provide these services, and the communities that these organizations
  serve. We are particularly committed to working with nonprofits invested in
  civic engagement, local community building and grassroots organizing,
  including social service agencies that seek to understand and engage their
  clients as a constituency. 
   
   This project will benefit South LA organizations working on each of LA2050’s goals. We believe that the LA2050 goals can be met in South LA if the nonprofits tasked with meeting them are strong and if the community infrastructure that they are a part of has the tools to support innovation. In a 2013 report on the state of nonprofits in LA County, UCLA’s Luskin School of Public Affairs found an extreme service gap in low-income communities: nonprofits exist in the lowest numbers in poor neighborhoods [http://civilsociety.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/publication-pdf/2013%20Report-web_copy.pdf]. This means that, right now, the people in Los Angeles who have the least support are those who essentially need it the most. Our project’s focus on South LA represents a desire to reverse this service gap and a long-term commitment to communities of color. We believe that our project the first step in designing a model that can be replicated citywide.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  We are thrilled to report that Community Coalition [www.cocosouthla.org],
  Jenesse Center [www.jenesse.org], and Strategic Concepts in Organizing and
  Policy Education [www.scopela.org] came on in 2013 and have developed the
  project with SoACT. Each brings 21-34 years of organizing and/or providing
  services as a people of color-led nonprofit in South LA, a history of positive
  outcomes in South LA, and experience providing technical assistance and
  training to other nonprofits. Through Community Coalition’s Prevention
  Network, clients and staff from local social service agencies get trained in
  organizational development, sustainability and strategic planning, and connect
  with funders. In the Peer Learning Collaborative on Cultural Competency,
  Jenesse Center mentors and provides technical assistance to domestic violence
  organizations in CA improving how they serve the Black community. At SCOPE,
  trainings on topics like civic participation, fund development and coalition
  building build the capacity of campaigns that impact low-income communities of
  color nationwide.
   
   SoACT intends to add 6 additional South LA nonprofits as capacity building partners in 2015. We are also eager to connect with collaborators through this grant challenge and excited by ideas generated at the #LA2050Collaborates meetings, including “investing in grant readiness for communities that need it to secure more funding, e.g., South LA” (Goal Notes: LIVE) and “create a coalition, or at least some sort of support group, where these different LA orgs can continually share challenges, opportunities, needs” (Goal Notes: LEARN).
   
   CompassPoint Nonprofit Services [http://www.compasspoint.org/] is an additional committed partner, assisting in training, coaching and curriculum development. While based in the Bay Area, they literally have written the textbooks on consulting, coaching, facilitation and other tools and techniques. With their commitment and expertise, CompassPoint will benefit us by expediting the facilitator process and by providing coaching to the SoACT capacity building team. 
   
   Three factors critical to the success of our project include: maintaining credible and responsive relationships with SLA nonprofits; maximizing the use of social network tools to engage and make more readily available capacity building knowledge; and cultural competence and responsiveness to the unique needs of diverse organizations.
