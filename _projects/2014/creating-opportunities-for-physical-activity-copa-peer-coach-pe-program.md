Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Prototypes’ Pomona Women’s Center has been in operation since 1988, providing
  residential treatment to women and their children. Our LA2050 project will
  further the capacity of our Pomona Women’s Center to provide fully integrated
  healthcare to help women and their families create a foundation for a healthy,
  independent and successful future. Specifically, it will add critical staff
  that will help families with their health care needs during and after
  treatment, focuses on building women’s self-sufficiency to make sure
  homelessness is no longer an inevitable fate and bolsters our mental health
  services. 
   
   Our project will add a Health Care Navigator to the team providing case management to families and ensuring that all of their health needs are met. This includes enrolling in health insurance, ensuring that mothers and children receive comprehensive assessments, identifying any resources in the community and following up to make sure treatment and care is being received and moving families toward their goal of self-sufficiency. In addition, this project will support a Vocational Counselor to provide women with the opportunities to gain skills to search and apply for employment. Opportunities and resources are provided on-site to build each client’s resume, ensuring gainful employment once they complete treatment. The project will also help to fund a Mental Health Clinician to provide mental health assessments to women and children. This position will also provide individual, group and family therapy. And finally, the project will also include a vehicle lease for a van that will ensure that transportation is not an issue in accessing care such as bringing a client’s family to the facility for therapy and assisting women and children with doctor’s appointments.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Among the 18.9 million adults with a substance use disorder in the past year,
  almost half had a co-occurring mental illness. However, only 7.4% of
  individuals receive treatment for both conditions and 55.8% receive no
  treatment at all. Due to the Affordable Care Act, 640,000 people in Los
  Angeles County are estimated to be eligible for Medi-Cal and 10% of them will
  need treatment for substance use disorders. This impacts Los Angeles as
  untreated addiction and mental illness can lead to unemployment,
  incarceration, child abuse or neglect, homelessness and a cycle of poverty for
  many families.
   
   We can change that. Prototypes’ residential treatment is often the last hope for women with such complex issues because they have nowhere else to go. Through partnerships with local medical providers, social services agencies and the justice system, we remove barriers to access with a “whatever it takes” approach to ensure women receive addiction and mental health treatment. 
   
   Research has shown that women with substance use disorders also have high rates posttraumatic stress disorder; not surprising then is that more than 87% of the women in Prototypes’ residential treatment have been victims of sexual and/or physical abuse as well as domestic violence. Trauma is then a key focus as staff help clients understand the underlying causes of their addiction and provides them tools to successfully get through difficult situations without the use of drugs and alcohol. 
   
   Furthermore, over two-thirds of women with co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders are mothers, yet most programs do not support a woman’s role as a mother or will not accommodate pregnant and postpartum women. We encourage women to bring their children with them, so they don’t have to choose between their health and their children. Keeping families together not only improves a mother’s success in her recovery, but also impacts future generations in Los Angeles.
   
   Prototypes’ residential treatment aims to fill the gap in service delivery by taking a holistic viewpoint on health and identifying everything from therapy to housing as necessary treatment for our most vulnerable. Not only to help families get access to healthcare, but we also provided the tools and resources to women become self-sufficient through housing, employment, parenting and education. The program also impacts a second generation who receive care and support to prevent future adverse experiences for children.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Hundreds of women- those with children, those without, those who are expecting
  and those who have recently given birth- are brought down by addiction and its
  myriad challenges. Their issues are often so complex; they have nowhere else
  to go since many traditional programs may only offer one type of treatment. 
   
   Prototypes’ Pomona Women’s Center will benefit low-income women and their children in Los Angeles County who face barriers in accessing vital behavioral treatment. We also include a client’s family in their recovery progress, providing family therapy and support. 
   
   Based on our services over the years, the project is estimated to serve a client population that consists of the following: 43% Latina/o, 28% white, 27% African-American, 1% Asian/Pacific Islander and 1% American Indian. The project will serve women who struggle with the disease of addiction and may also be victims of domestic violence, have mental illness, be homeless and/or involved with the criminal justice system. They often face difficulties such as poverty due to insufficient skills and employment, language barriers, lack of access to public benefits and/or may have lost custody of their children.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Over the years, Prototypes has developed a deep network of government and
  social services that help us meet the needs of our clients. This includes Los
  Angeles County agencies such as the Department of Mental Health and Department
  of Children and Family Services that provide referrals and resources to serve
  clients. We also collaborate with the criminal justice system including the
  Public Defender’s Office, California Department of Corrections and County
  Probation Department to ensure we can serve those who are incarcerated.
  Partnerships with local entities such as Pomona Unified School District and
  the Pomona Housing Authority ensure education and housing resources. We also
  work with East Valley Community Health Centers to provide medical care.
   
   These partnerships are long-standing and contribute to the success of our residential program. Three critical factors that have help ensure our successful collaboration is open communication on project status through reports and meetings, effective partnership agreements and mutual support on projects.
