Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Launched with bootstrap funding in 2012, Would-Works has spent the past two
  years proving the validity of the concept of empowering individuals to improve
  their situation. Would-Works has tested and refined an approach that is now
  ready to grow. With funding from LA2050 Would-Works will secure permanent
  space in which to hold workshops, hold them more often, develop a marketing
  approach that will keep product sales robust, establish partnerships with
  relevant groups and enterprises and continue to develop products.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Would-Works CREATES opportunities. Would-Works CREATES quality products
  through collaboration. Would-Works CREATES a vibrant program highlighting a
  forward-thinking environment present in Los Angeles which can be a role-model
  for the rest of the country. We are proud of what we have achieved as a small
  organization so far, but we are ready to grow and have a larger influence. 
   
   In 2050 we see Would-Works continuing to empower some of the most disenfranchised and chronically unemployed individuals in Los Angeles to CREATE hand-made products. Would-Works anticipates being a part of the movement to greatly reduce homelessness in Los Angeles. Would-Works plans to continue to provide the opportunity for women and men to CREATE their own opportunities out of homelessness through the dignity of working for one’s own need.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  In Los Angeles, 254,000 men, women and children experience homelessness during
  some part of the year and approximately 82,000 are homeless on any given
  night, according to the Institute for the Study of Homelessness and Poverty
  (Weingart Center, 2014). In the Skid Row area of downtown Los Angeles, over
  5,000 are homeless. Further, 65% of the adults in Skid Row live on less than
  $10,000 a year. This is the population that Would-Works seeks to help.
  Would-Works addresses both the causes and the impacts of poverty and
  homelessness by helping people overcome barriers to employment and permanent
  housing by working to meet their own needs while becoming more employable in
  the process. With funding from LA2050, Would-Works will be able to focus on
  expanding the model. More workshops will be held; not only in Skid Row but
  also in additional areas and serving additional population groups. Would-Works
  has explored growth within several population groups. For example; the young
  adult population that has aged out of the foster system is a specific group
  that is in need of resources. By identifying specific groups, Would-Works can
  tailor the model to maximize impact on population segments.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  We understand that to end an individual’s homelessness, we need to work with a
  number of partners. In addition, our products reflect collaboration and
  partnership for design and resources. With this in mind, we seek to establish
  partnerships on all sides of our business.
   
   Work Session Partners:
   
   Our work sessions have agency partners before and after the work is completed. Our Charter model has social services agency partners who refer men and women to the workshops. These social services are working with the individuals and help to identify the immediate need for which a person needs to work. We have currently partnered with Central City Outreach Center to refer men and women to the program and have informal agreements with permanent supportive housing providers as well. We have had inquiries for partnership from numerous social service agencies, schools, and training programs. However, before we can establish new partnerships we are focused on developing a permanent workshop to accommodate the large volume of referrals.
   
   Design Partners: 
   
   In addition to partners for our work sessions, we are also committed to partnering for design. We strive to create high-quality, hand-crafted products in downtown Los Angeles. To accomplish this, we have partnered with some designers to create products and plan to expand our design partnerships. We partnered with the Department of Design at Cal State Long Beach to create future products. We also collaborated with style blogger, Almanac of Style, on a limited edition product.
