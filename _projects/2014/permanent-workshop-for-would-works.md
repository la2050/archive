Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Launched with bootstrap funding in 2012, Would-Works has spent the past two
  years proving the validity of the concept of empowering individuals to improve
  their situation. Would-Works has tested and refined an approach that is now
  ready to grow. With funding from LA2050 Would-Works will secure permanent
  space in which to hold workshops, hold them more often, develop a marketing
  approach that will keep product sales robust, establish partnerships with
  relevant groups and enterprises and continue to develop products.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Would-Works CREATES opportunities. Would-Works CREATES quality products
  through collaboration. Would-Works CREATES a vibrant program highlighting a
  forward-thinking environment present in Los Angeles which can be a role-model
  for the rest of the country. We are proud of what we have achieved as a small
  organization so far, but we are ready to grow and have a larger influence. 
   
   In 2050 we see Would-Works continuing to empower some of the most disenfranchised and chronically unemployed individuals in Los Angeles to CREATE hand-made products. Would-Works anticipates being a part of the movement to greatly reduce homelessness in Los Angeles. Would-Works plans to continue to provide the opportunity for women and men to CREATE their own opportunities out of homelessness through the dignity of working for one’s own need.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  In Los Angeles, 254,000 men, women and children experience homelessness during
  some part of the year and approximately 82,000 are homeless on any given
  night, according to the Institute for the Study of Homelessness and Poverty
  (Weingart Center, 2014). In the Skid Row area of downtown Los Angeles, over
  5,000 are homeless. Further, 65% of the adults in Skid Row live on less than
  $10,000 a year. This is the population that Would-Works seeks to help.
  Would-Works addresses both the causes and the impacts of poverty and
  homelessness by helping people overcome barriers to employment and permanent
  housing by working to meet their own needs while becoming more employable in
  the process. With funding from LA2050, Would-Works will be able to focus on
  expanding the model. More workshops will be held; not only in Skid Row but
  also in additional areas and serving additional population groups. Would-Works
  has explored growth within several population groups. For example; the young
  adult population that has aged out of the foster system is a specific group
  that is in need of resources. By identifying specific groups, Would-Works can
  tailor the model to maximize impact on population segments.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  We understand that to end an individual’s homelessness, we need to work with a
  number of partners. In addition, our products reflect collaboration and
  partnership for design and resources. With this in mind, we seek to establish
  partnerships on all sides of our business.
   
   Work Session Partners:
   
   Our work sessions have agency partners before and after the work is completed. Our Charter model has social services agency partners who refer men and women to the workshops. These social services are working with the individuals and help to identify the immediate need for which a person needs to work. We have currently partnered with Central City Outreach Center to refer men and women to the program and have informal agreements with permanent supportive housing providers as well. We have had inquiries for partnership from numerous social service agencies, schools, and training programs. However, before we can establish new partnerships we are focused on developing a permanent workshop to accommodate the large volume of referrals.
   
   Design Partners: 
   
   In addition to partners for our work sessions, we are also committed to partnering for design. We strive to create high-quality, hand-crafted products in downtown Los Angeles. To accomplish this, we have partnered with some designers to create products and plan to expand our design partnerships. We partnered with the Department of Design at Cal State Long Beach to create future products. We also collaborated with style blogger, Almanac of Style, on a limited edition product.

    Employment opportunities for individuals who are homeless or chronically

  impact_metrics: >-
    Focusing on small manufacturing, Would-Works is committed to increasing job
    opportunities for individuals who are homeless or chronically unemployed in
    Los Angeles. A disproportionately high number of individuals who are
    homeless have also been incarcerated and Would-Works provides an opportunity
    for these individuals as well. Would-Works plans to grow from a small,
    bootstrapped start-up and sell products nationally. We see our organization
    covering many LA2050 categories such as LIVE and LEARN and PLAY, but we are
    most focused how we can CREATE opportunities.

  evaluate: "Because of the structure of the Would-Works model, evaluation is simple.  By reporting the number of Artisans who enter the program and the number of goals completed, Would-Works can track outcomes and social impact of the program.  Further, Would-Works is working on a tracking system that will follow up with Artisans after they leave the program to ascertain how many have secured employment and/or permanent housing. This follow-up will determine the effectiveness of the program in each segment and help determine where Would-Works should concentrate.  Through partnering with service agencies, Would-Works will be an integral part of lessening the negative effects of poverty in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nWe are also working to establish employment partners who will employ men and women who have worked for Would-Works and are interested in seeking part-time or full time employment. We will work to establish a streamlined process for our employment partners to hire Would-Works Artisans.\r\n"
  two_lessons: "Simply stated, the two most important lessons have been:\r\n-Seeing the need\r\n-Seeing the response to the Would-Works solution \r\n\r\nWhile working in Skid Row beginning in 2009, Would-Works co-founder, Connor Johnson saw the need for a new form of ‘assistance’ and decided something needed to change.  Johnson heard over and over that those living on the streets of LA “would work” if they could.  Johnson saw the need to dignify the circumstances in which so many were living.  By offering a “hand up vs. a hand out” the Would-Works model addresses the immediate need while providing a sense of dignity and goal-setting with individuals living in Skid Row. Because money management can often a barrier to success, the credit system created by Would-Works enables Artisans to participate in improving their circumstances.  \r\n\r\nThe response to the Would-Works model has been overwhelming, both within the community it serves and with the public.  Men and women in Los Angeles who have specific needs have come to know Would-Works and refer others to the Pop-Up Workshops.  Both retail and online sales have proven that more products will be well received. Would-Works has been delighted to learn that people are interested in working for Would-Works and that consumers want to engage in this process by purchasing products that make a positive impact in the community.  These two lessons have been invaluable.\r\n"
  achievable_goal: >-
    Because Would-Works was started and has grown modestly through bootstrap
    funding over the last two years, the time is right for significant growth. 
    All systems and processes are in place and ready for the infusion of funds
    necessary to take the tiny program to a much larger audience.  With funding
    from LA2050 Would-Works will begin immediately to put its growth plan in
    place. Moving from an average of 45 individuals achieving goals per year,
    Would-Works will move toward a goal of 450 Artisan goals achieved in a year,
    or ten-fold growth.  
  major_challenges: "Two major barriers to Would-Works growth have been:\r\n-Having permanent workspace\r\n-Developing new products\r\n\r\nBecause of its bootstrapped beginnings, Would-Works has been holding Pop-Up Workshops in an on-demand basis at donated space in Skid Row.  Though this has been effective, the lack of structure and permanence has been a frustration for founders and occasional confusion for Artisans who already deal with a significant amount of impermanence.  With dedicated space Would-Works will be a better-known part of the community.  Artisans and potential Artisans can stop by and learn of scheduled workshops.  Dedicated space will also help with publicity and funding, as those interested in the concept will know where to find Would-Works. \r\n\r\nProduct development and sales is a constant need for Would-Works.  Current products include:\r\n-Three different sizes of cutting boards\r\n-Kubb lawn game\r\n-Bottle openers\r\n\r\nFuture products, including door openers (door stops), clipboards and bike crates are all in development.  An aggressive national sales campaign will make products available to a large audience. Additionally working with a designer to create new products for Would-Works will be integral to our growth. \r\n"
  competition: "No person in Los Angeles should be homeless. Would-Works believes this fact and focuses on providing an opportunity for individuals to work out of homelessness in a dignified way. Would-Works is one part of the larger context that it takes for an individual to end his/her homelessness. There is a large spectrum of assistance from shelters and basic service providers to permanent-supportive housing and employment providers. Would-Works is an essential part of the large fabric of providers; a bridge to larger goals involving housing and employment. By providing a work opportunity for an individual’s need then that person can work on larger goals around housing and potentially employment.\r\n\r\nThere are programs that hire formerly incarcerated individuals or former gang-members such as Chrysalis and Homeboy Industries, but Would-Works is a bridge to that sort of employment. Most of the men and women we work with have been unemployed or employed informally for many years, so have a formal job is a large step.\r\n\r\nWould-Works is taking a different approach than most other organizations. It is not assumed that it is known what every individual living in poverty needs; rather, each person tells Would-Works what they need. Would-Works helps identify goals and has Artisans state what they are working toward. At Would-Works, the individual Artisans are the ones who do the work of meeting their own needs, not the staff.\r\n"
  cost: >-
    The $100,000 will cover the costs to scale our operation and increase
    revenue for sustained operations in the future.  Last year’s operating
    budget was $7,000 and total revenue was $9,500. This reflects having Pop-Up
    Workshops twice a month and selling products to local retail stores and
    online. The LA2050 grant will allow operations to grow with more work
    sessions and more products, which will allow us to work with more
    individuals and have more Artisans achieve their goals. The $100,000 will
    cover costs to scale for the next year, while working on increasing revenue
    through sales and fundraising to sustain operations and grow. Staff
    salaries, Artisan payments and other costs over the $100,000 will come from
    increased product sales and fundraising. 
  budget: "In order to increase the amount of men and women for whom Would-Works provides a work opportunity, it is necessary to focus on growth. Having a permanent workshop and increasing product offerings will offer great strides in achieving that growth.  A permanent workshop space will allow operations to be more efficient and have more Artisans working at any given time. This has a direct effect in an increase in the amount of products produced and sold, meaning more men and women hired. Our second focus will also be on creating new products with quality design.\r\n\r\nBudget Items  \r\n                                 \r\nPermanent Work Space-$30,000\r\n• $12/sq. ft. for a year/500 sq. ft. for 5 years\r\n• Rent a small manufacturing space in downtown/Central City East\r\n\r\nWork Session Tools-$1,700\r\n• Many tools have been donated to Would-Works, but some additional tools are needed.\r\n• Sanders-$150 x 3= $450, air filtration system-$750, workbenches-$250 x 2=$500\r\n\r\nWork Space Build-Out-$4,000\r\n• Renovate and prepare permanent workspace\r\n• One-time renovation\r\n\r\nDesign Consultant-$20,000\r\n• Hire a product designer to design 5 new products\r\n• Payment: $100 per hour x 200 hours\r\n\r\nLos Angeles Manufacturing Director (part-time)-$9,600\r\n• Hire a woodworker to create the unfinished precuts for work sessions.\r\n• Train a current Artisan into the position\r\n• Payment: $20 per hour/10 hours per week for the first year\r\n\r\nWork Session Supervisor (part-time)-$7,200\r\n• Hire and train a current Artisan to become a supervisor during the works sessions and co-facilitate the sessions\r\n• Payment: $15 per hour x 10 hour per week for the first year\r\n\r\nSales Interns-$10,080\r\n• Hire sales interns to serve as brand ambassadors and increase store presence and sales.\r\n• Payment: $14 per hour x 20 hours per month each x 3 interns\r\n\r\nMarketing-$3,000\r\n• Increase and update marketing materials\r\n\r\nSales Expenses-$10,000\r\n• Sales expenses to increase national retail presence\r\n• Expenses for trade shows and a retail rep\r\n• Expense: $2,500 for trade shows x 2 shows, Sales rep $5,000\r\n\r\nOther Expenses-$4,420\r\n• Additional administrative expenses.\r\n\r\n\r\nTotal: $100,000\r\n\r\n"

    answer: >-
      In Los Angeles, 254,000 men, women and children experience homelessness
      during some part of the year and approximately 82,000 are homeless on any
      given night, according to the Institute for the Study of Homelessness and
      Poverty (Weingart Center, 2014).  In the Skid Row area of downtown Los
      Angeles, over 5,000 are homeless.  Further, 65% of the adults in Skid Row
      live on less than $10,000 a year.  This is the population that Would-Works
      seeks to help.   Would-Works addresses both the causes and the impacts of
      poverty and homelessness by helping people overcome barriers to employment
      and permanent housing by working to meet their own needs while becoming
      more employable in the process.  With funding from LA2050, Would-Works
      will be able to focus on expanding the model. More workshops will be held;
      not only in Skid Row but also in additional areas and serving additional
      population groups.  Would-Works has explored growth within several
      population groups.  For example; the young adult population that has aged
      out of the foster system is a specific group that is in need of
      resources.   By identifying specific groups, Would-Works can tailor the
      model to maximize impact on population segments.

      We strongly support collaboration, please tell us a little more about your
      partnership.
    answer: "We understand that to end an individual’s homelessness, we need to work with a number of partners. In addition, our products reflect collaboration and partnership for design and resources. With this in mind, we seek to establish partnerships on all sides of our business.\r\n\r\nWork Session Partners:\r\n\r\nOur work sessions have agency partners before and after the work is completed. Our Charter model has social services agency partners who refer men and women to the workshops. These social services are working with the individuals and help to identify the immediate need for which a person needs to work. We have currently partnered with Central City Outreach Center to refer men and women to the program and have informal agreements with permanent supportive housing providers as well. We have had inquiries for partnership from numerous social service agencies, schools, and training programs. However, before we can establish new partnerships we are focused on developing a permanent workshop to accommodate the large volume of referrals.\r\n\r\nDesign Partners: \r\n\r\nIn addition to partners for our work sessions, we are also committed to partnering for design. We strive to create high-quality, hand-crafted products in downtown Los Angeles. To accomplish this, we have partnered with some designers to create products and plan to expand our design partnerships. We partnered with the Department of Design at Cal State Long Beach to create future products. We also collaborated with style blogger, Almanac of Style, on a limited edition product. \r\n"

      Focusing on small manufacturing, Would-Works is committed to increasing
      job opportunities for individuals who are homeless or chronically
      unemployed in Los Angeles. A disproportionately high number of individuals
      who are homeless have also been incarcerated and Would-Works provides an
      opportunity for these individuals as well. Would-Works plans to grow from
      a small, bootstrapped start-up and sell products nationally. We see our
      organization covering many LA2050 categories such as LIVE and LEARN and
      PLAY, but we are most focused how we can CREATE opportunities.

    answer: "Because of the structure of the Would-Works model, evaluation is simple.  By reporting the number of Artisans who enter the program and the number of goals completed, Would-Works can track outcomes and social impact of the program.  Further, Would-Works is working on a tracking system that will follow up with Artisans after they leave the program to ascertain how many have secured employment and/or permanent housing. This follow-up will determine the effectiveness of the program in each segment and help determine where Would-Works should concentrate.  Through partnering with service agencies, Would-Works will be an integral part of lessening the negative effects of poverty in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nWe are also working to establish employment partners who will employ men and women who have worked for Would-Works and are interested in seeking part-time or full time employment. We will work to establish a streamlined process for our employment partners to hire Would-Works Artisans.\r\n"
  - name: two_lessons
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Simply stated, the two most important lessons have been:\r\n-Seeing the need\r\n-Seeing the response to the Would-Works solution \r\n\r\nWhile working in Skid Row beginning in 2009, Would-Works co-founder, Connor Johnson saw the need for a new form of ‘assistance’ and decided something needed to change.  Johnson heard over and over that those living on the streets of LA “would work” if they could.  Johnson saw the need to dignify the circumstances in which so many were living.  By offering a “hand up vs. a hand out” the Would-Works model addresses the immediate need while providing a sense of dignity and goal-setting with individuals living in Skid Row. Because money management can often a barrier to success, the credit system created by Would-Works enables Artisans to participate in improving their circumstances.  \r\n\r\nThe response to the Would-Works model has been overwhelming, both within the community it serves and with the public.  Men and women in Los Angeles who have specific needs have come to know Would-Works and refer others to the Pop-Up Workshops.  Both retail and online sales have proven that more products will be well received. Would-Works has been delighted to learn that people are interested in working for Would-Works and that consumers want to engage in this process by purchasing products that make a positive impact in the community.  These two lessons have been invaluable.\r\n"

    answer: >-
      Because Would-Works was started and has grown modestly through bootstrap
      funding over the last two years, the time is right for significant
      growth.  All systems and processes are in place and ready for the infusion
      of funds necessary to take the tiny program to a much larger audience. 
      With funding from LA2050 Would-Works will begin immediately to put its
      growth plan in place. Moving from an average of 45 individuals achieving
      goals per year, Would-Works will move toward a goal of 450 Artisan goals
      achieved in a year, or ten-fold growth.  
  - name: major_challenges
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Two major barriers to Would-Works growth have been:\r\n-Having permanent workspace\r\n-Developing new products\r\n\r\nBecause of its bootstrapped beginnings, Would-Works has been holding Pop-Up Workshops in an on-demand basis at donated space in Skid Row.  Though this has been effective, the lack of structure and permanence has been a frustration for founders and occasional confusion for Artisans who already deal with a significant amount of impermanence.  With dedicated space Would-Works will be a better-known part of the community.  Artisans and potential Artisans can stop by and learn of scheduled workshops.  Dedicated space will also help with publicity and funding, as those interested in the concept will know where to find Would-Works. \r\n\r\nProduct development and sales is a constant need for Would-Works.  Current products include:\r\n-Three different sizes of cutting boards\r\n-Kubb lawn game\r\n-Bottle openers\r\n\r\nFuture products, including door openers (door stops), clipboards and bike crates are all in development.  An aggressive national sales campaign will make products available to a large audience. Additionally working with a designer to create new products for Would-Works will be integral to our growth. \r\n"
  - name: competition
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "No person in Los Angeles should be homeless. Would-Works believes this fact and focuses on providing an opportunity for individuals to work out of homelessness in a dignified way. Would-Works is one part of the larger context that it takes for an individual to end his/her homelessness. There is a large spectrum of assistance from shelters and basic service providers to permanent-supportive housing and employment providers. Would-Works is an essential part of the large fabric of providers; a bridge to larger goals involving housing and employment. By providing a work opportunity for an individual’s need then that person can work on larger goals around housing and potentially employment.\r\n\r\nThere are programs that hire formerly incarcerated individuals or former gang-members such as Chrysalis and Homeboy Industries, but Would-Works is a bridge to that sort of employment. Most of the men and women we work with have been unemployed or employed informally for many years, so have a formal job is a large step.\r\n\r\nWould-Works is taking a different approach than most other organizations. It is not assumed that it is known what every individual living in poverty needs; rather, each person tells Would-Works what they need. Would-Works helps identify goals and has Artisans state what they are working toward. At Would-Works, the individual Artisans are the ones who do the work of meeting their own needs, not the staff.\r\n"

      The $100,000 will cover the costs to scale our operation and increase
      revenue for sustained operations in the future.  Last year’s operating
      budget was $7,000 and total revenue was $9,500. This reflects having
      Pop-Up Workshops twice a month and selling products to local retail stores
      and online. The LA2050 grant will allow operations to grow with more work
      sessions and more products, which will allow us to work with more
      individuals and have more Artisans achieve their goals. The $100,000 will
      cover costs to scale for the next year, while working on increasing
      revenue through sales and fundraising to sustain operations and grow.
      Staff salaries, Artisan payments and other costs over the $100,000 will
      come from increased product sales and fundraising. 
  - name: budget
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "In order to increase the amount of men and women for whom Would-Works provides a work opportunity, it is necessary to focus on growth. Having a permanent workshop and increasing product offerings will offer great strides in achieving that growth.  A permanent workshop space will allow operations to be more efficient and have more Artisans working at any given time. This has a direct effect in an increase in the amount of products produced and sold, meaning more men and women hired. Our second focus will also be on creating new products with quality design.\r\n\r\nBudget Items  \r\n                                 \r\nPermanent Work Space-$30,000\r\n• $12/sq. ft. for a year/500 sq. ft. for 5 years\r\n• Rent a small manufacturing space in downtown/Central City East\r\n\r\nWork Session Tools-$1,700\r\n• Many tools have been donated to Would-Works, but some additional tools are needed.\r\n• Sanders-$150 x 3= $450, air filtration system-$750, workbenches-$250 x 2=$500\r\n\r\nWork Space Build-Out-$4,000\r\n• Renovate and prepare permanent workspace\r\n• One-time renovation\r\n\r\nDesign Consultant-$20,000\r\n• Hire a product designer to design 5 new products\r\n• Payment: $100 per hour x 200 hours\r\n\r\nLos Angeles Manufacturing Director (part-time)-$9,600\r\n• Hire a woodworker to create the unfinished precuts for work sessions.\r\n• Train a current Artisan into the position\r\n• Payment: $20 per hour/10 hours per week for the first year\r\n\r\nWork Session Supervisor (part-time)-$7,200\r\n• Hire and train a current Artisan to become a supervisor during the works sessions and co-facilitate the sessions\r\n• Payment: $15 per hour x 10 hour per week for the first year\r\n\r\nSales Interns-$10,080\r\n• Hire sales interns to serve as brand ambassadors and increase store presence and sales.\r\n• Payment: $14 per hour x 20 hours per month each x 3 interns\r\n\r\nMarketing-$3,000\r\n• Increase and update marketing materials\r\n\r\nSales Expenses-$10,000\r\n• Sales expenses to increase national retail presence\r\n• Expenses for trade shows and a retail rep\r\n• Expense: $2,500 for trade shows x 2 shows, Sales rep $5,000\r\n\r\nOther Expenses-$4,420\r\n• Additional administrative expenses.\r\n\r\n\r\nTotal: $100,000\r\n\r\n"
