  Western Center will help the County of Los Angeles and the State of California
  develop and implement specific and sweeping policy solutions to ensure health
  care access for the remaining uninsured. 
   
   For nearly five decades, Western Center has successfully blended effective policy advocacy and strategic impact litigation to achieve major system-wide victories for poor Californians. With offices in Los Angeles, Sacramento and Oakland, we are able to work with state and local governments and stakeholders throughout the state to achieve policy changes on behalf of millions of poor families and individuals.
   
   To address the eligible but unenrolled, we will engage in a collaborative process to create pathways that make it easier for LA residents to enroll in coverage. We will conduct detailed program analysis of Medi-Cal and Covered CA; identify procedural enrollment obstacles and inefficiencies; review enabling regulations, All County Welfare Directors Letters, notices to consumers, website designs, training materials and marketing materials; deliver detailed recommendations to policymakers and advocate for their adoption. Beyond internal systems, we will work with stakeholders who are developing media savvy messaging aimed at persuading “young invincibles” to enroll in affordable health care programs . 
   
   We will engage in local, state and national advocacy to address and resolve the family glitch issue. The most likely “fix” involves a reasonable and simple change in the definition of affordability within the Affordable Care Act to permit family members who can’t obtain affordable employer sponsored insurance coverage to access subsidies in the Exchange (Covered CA). 
   
   We will educate policymakers about the remaining uninsured, including undocumented people. We will develop helpful tips informing advocates and consumers of how to maximize underutilized resources for the remaining uninsured including county indigent care mandates under Section 17000 of the CA Welfare & Institutions the Ability to Pay program, Healthy Way LA Unmatched, Medi-Cal for DACA eligible youth, the Kaiser Permanente Child Health Program, selected Medi-Cal services, community health clinics and emergency rooms, and the Hospital Fair Pricing Act. We will simultaneously seek a system-wide solution to ensure coverage for all Angelenos, regardless of immigration status.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Healthy communities offer quality, affordable and available health care to all
  of its residents. Families and individuals can take advantage of preventative
  and primary care, rather than relying on costly emergency rooms. People have
  health insurance and patients don’t “fall through the cracks." The entire
  community is broadly committed to expanding access and improving the quality
  of health care services and systems.
   
   Quite simply, Los Angeles falls short. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which ranks counties within states by the quality of the clinical care available to residents reported that in 2014 Los Angeles ranked 49th among California’s 58 counties. The Foundation cites access to care as one of the principal pathways to improve health outcomes. 
   
   By helping the state and county expand health care access, Western Center will have a direct positive effect on 1 million people in Los Angeles and simultaneously improve the health of the community at large.
   
   Expanding coverage and access makes also sound financial sense. The UCLA Center for Health Policy Research notes in their May 2014 study, A Little Investment Goes a Long Way: Modest Cost to Expand Preventive and Routine Health Services to All Low-Income Californians, that expanding coverage to those who are uninsured would cost about 2% of the state’s Medi-Cal spending and would be substantially offset by increased sales tax revenue and reduced county spending.
   
   The expansion of health care to all Los Angeles residents will not simply help people today but will establish the programs and systems that will be able to deliver high quality health care services to our community for years to come.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The project will directly benefit the 1 million people who do not currently
  have health care coverage. For these families and individuals, it will improve
  their health; limit preventable, early deaths; and reduce financial and
  emotional stress. As noted above they include:
   
   1. Undocumented residents (≈40%) who are not eligible for coverage under the Affordable Care Act.
   2. Families caught in the family “glitch,” that makes family coverage unaffordable for low wage workers (≈30%-40%). This means families with one or both parents working at low paid jobs and receiving individual, but not family health insurance through their employment. The current Affordable Care Act regulations provide that even if the uncovered spouse and children are financially eligible for ACA insurance and subsidies, they may not take advantage of that opportunity. Their only choice is to pay for prohibitively expensive family coverage through the employed parent’s work.
   3. Individuals eligible for but not enrolled in Medi-Cal or Covered CA (≈20%-30%). These people fall into two sub-categories: those who are eligible for free care via Medi-Cal or subsidized care through Covered CA and those who simply refuse to purchase health insurance, often believing that they don’t need it. The latter group has been dubbed “the young invincibles”, young healthy people who don’t believe they will get sick or need medical care.
   
   The project will also benefit the broader community. It will minimize uncompensated care; reduce reliance on overstretched emergency rooms, increase the health care system delivery capacity; strengthen the local economy; and improve public health.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Western Center’s partnerships with California’s 95 legal aid organizations,
  including 20 in Los Angeles, are well known. We deliver in-depth legal
  support, including technical assistance by email and phone, on-site trainings,
  conferences, webinars, publications and litigation support to 700 legal aid
  attorneys in the state. 
   
   Equally important are our longstanding, working partnerships with virtually every significant policy organization working on health care issues. This includes organizations such as Health Access, Consumers Union, California Pan-Ethnic Health Network, California Immigrant Policy Center, Insure the Uninsured, Tenants Together, Los Angeles Community Action Network, and CA Partnership. Our work is recognized and supported by the California Endowment, the California Wellness Foundation and other philanthropic organizations dedicated to improving the health of Californians.
   
   In addition, we maintain strong relationships with local, state and federal public sector stakeholders, including Covered California; the California Departments of Health Care Services, Managed Health Care, Housing and Community Development, and Social Services; County Welfare Directors Association, California State Association of Counties along with legislators and legislative staff. We are a unique highly effective voice in Sacramento representing the health care needs of low-income Californians, and collaboration is part of the fabric of our work.
   
   Three factors critical to Western Center's collaborative success are:
   1) This is a winnable but immensely complicated project with many moving parts.
   2) There are distinct yet intertwined roles for each of the partners that must be appropriately woven together.
   3) The partners will need to maintain a nimble and flexible strategy that fluidly adjusts to shifting policy currents.
