  The mission of Big Citizen HUB is to build a community of Big Citizens,
  expanding the social capital of youth through curiosity, gratitude, team, and
  adventure. Big Citizen HUB, a project of Community Partners, will bring
  together young people, ages 8-24, outside of school, from all over Los Angeles
  to learn a common civic language, engage in dialogue, and build community to
  investigate local and global challenges ranging from poverty to environmental
  issues. We will convene on Saturdays between January and August. Big Citizens
  (ages 8-18) will form diverse teams, serve a minimum of 100 hours, and
  complete team-based projects while learning from Youth Workers (near-peer
  mentors and team leaders, ages 19-24), trained by Big Citizen HUB.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Big Citizens will work through issues in monthly modules that incorporate
  interactive learning, active service, and individual and team reflection. 
   
   What does that look like? Here’s a "month in the life" of a Big Citizen, exploring the issue of homelessness:
   
   - Saturday #1: Curiosity (Interactive Learning)
   Big Citizens come together to learn about homelessness, sharing their own understanding of the issue and personal experiences, and hearing the perspectives of others. Teams travel to different locations across the city (Skid Row, South LA, Santa Monica) to learn from organizations addressing homelessness.
   
   - Saturday #2: Adventure (Service)
   The day begins with a community dialogue, sharing thoughts about the issue they explored the prior Saturday, including any new experiences or perspectives that were gained during the week. Teams travel to various service sites (possibly the Downtown Women’s Shelter or the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank) and spend the day engaging in active service to address homelessness.
   
   - Saturday #3: Gratitude (Reflection)
   The day begins with a group dialogue, reflecting on last week’s service projects and the organizations they learned about earlier in the month. Youth Workers lead Big Citizens in public speaking workshop. Teams prepare presentations documenting details of the service and organizations they learned from. Homelessness month concludes with a Community Meeting of Big Citizens, parents, and community partners, where Big Citizens present to the larger group.
   
   During the final months of the program, teams work together to explore a topic of their choosing, developing service projects to address their issue. Upon completion of the program, Big Citizens graduate earning the President’s Volunteer Service Award and Youth Workers earn Big Citizen HUB’s Youth Development Professional Certification. 
   
   In January 2015 Big Citizen HUB will launch with 75 middle school participants (Big Citizens) and 14 team leaders (Youth Workers). Big Citizen HUB will grow to almost 450 participants annually within five years, increasing the amount of middle schoolers and adding teams of high school aged and elementary participants. In fiscal year 2020, a total of 1,300 Big Citizens will have experienced the program.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Today, Big Citizen HUB brings together youth from different neighborhoods,
  providing a common culture with which to relate, common experience with which
  to connect, opportunity for dialogue that explores differences in experience
  and perspective – all while learning important life skills and leadership
  skills that are necessary for success in school and the workforce. This type
  of opportunity currently does not exist in our city, where young people can
  come together from all over and meet new people through positive experiences.
   
   In addition, the success of our program is based on partnerships with organizations that serve and address our most pressing community issues. We aim to meaningfully engage with at least 30 external partners in 2015. Aside from learning from, serving with, and connecting on the issues these organizations address, there is one very important outcome that we expect from this type of engagement: Adults begin to see youth as thoughtful, engaged, and valued participants in our communities. In turn, this change in perception allows youth to gain motivation to succeed in school, participate in their community, and feel optimistic about the future. 
   
   In 2020, 1300 youth will have participated in Big Citizen HUB, so imagine how many youth, community leaders, and parents will be involved by 2050. Imagine what the middle school students who were Big Citizens in 2015 will be doing by 2050. They’ll be voters, business leaders, social entrepreneurs, public officials, teachers, and possibly parents of the 36th cohort of Big Citizens. They’ll support public transportation, utilize social media in new and powerful ways, and will regularly connect with others outside of their neighborhood. Big Citizen HUB will be the best place for youth in Los Angeles to learn about issues that affect our local and global communities, to practice the skills needed to solve problems, and to connect with and feel comfortable with people of different backgrounds.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  In 2015, Big Citizen HUB will engage 75 middle school students as Big
  Citizens, 14 near peer mentors as Youth Workers (19-24 year olds), and 30
  community organizations. In this first year we anticipate about 80% of Big
  Citizens coming from low income families, with a racial breakdown as follows:
  70% Latino, 15% Asian, 5% African American, 5% Caucasian, and 5% multiracial.
  We will utilize existing partnerships to recruit Big Citizens from the
  following areas: Boyle Heights, West LA, South LA, Watts, and Pico Union. We
  will work to create new partnerships in additional areas of L.A. to ensure
  diversity of our youth. Diversity is a key component of our program and a
  large factor in how beneficial the program will be. 
   
   Our Youth Workers benefit from a rigorous training that we provide, focused on positive youth development practices, curriculum design, workshop facilitation, team building, conflict resolution, and asset mapping. Our Youth Development Professional Certification will be valuable as our Youth Workers move on, looking for full-time positions with other youth development organizations.
   
   The community organizations we partner with benefit in a couple ways. First, many will have the opportunity to receive 75 young and enthusiastic volunteers for a full day of Saturday service. Second, they get the opportunity to share what they do with a number of new faces – Big Citizens, Youth Workers, parents, and other community members being engaged. They can share the problem they address, how they address it, what kind of impact they have on the community, and how others can get involved. It’s an amazing opportunity to connect with people who may not have come across their organization outside of Big Citizen HUB.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  While we are a “solo actor” on this application, we would not be here without
  the insight from our supporters and partnerships with local organizations.
  Here we’d like to highlight two partnerships that are helping to ensure our
  success:
   - The City Year Inc. Western Region is supporting our work to recruit qualified Youth Workers. Our program is dependent upon bringing in committed near peer mentors to lead teams of Big Citizens. Our partnership with City Year allows us access to a large pool of 19-24 year olds who have interest in youth development and service, who have been vetted by a team of people with the expertise of recruiting people with the skill set we need.
   - The Red Shield Youth and Community Center is providing us with the facilities with which to run our office. In return, we provide the Red Shield’s staff with youth development training and coaching. In addition, all Big Citizens will become members of the center.
