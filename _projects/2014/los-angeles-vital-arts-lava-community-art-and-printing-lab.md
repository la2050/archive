Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  We have built an incredible art space in North East LA out of a love for the
  arts and as a catalyst for communal co creativity. The space is large enough
  to hold classes, workshops, events and gallery shows. We have wanted to find a
  way to share the space with as many who wish to participate. To activate this
  space as a community arts lab will require experienced staff, additional
  equipment and supplies. 
    We need experienced guides and lab assistants as well as a budget for guest instructors and speakers. We need support staff for the development and coordination of workshops, classes and lab time. We need a key support person to help with the strategy, marketing and promotion of the learning programs as well as develop relationships with contributors in the community, so as to grow, develop and self sustain as a thriving and vital arts center.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  In this hyper digital, social media environment we find ourselves heavily
  reliant on our technology and grow further and further away from hand skills
  and tactile experiences. Our friendships, work and even leisure time need the
  screen to exist. We spend entirely too much time in this digital realm and so
  our focus is to provide balance. Co- creativity and experienced based learning
  help us to get out of our heads and into our physical bodies. Hands on
  learning and analog print processes stimulate creativity and new ideas. An
  emphasis on balance within our digital lives becomes more and more of a luxury
  as opposed to a normal learning experience. By activating the instinctive
  parts of our nature to make, create, learn and grow, we preserve and develop
  our fundamental human skills and connect us to our physical world, each other
  and our communities. 
    Teaching people to make art and use the resources they have around them, including their culture and community, will enrich the individual the community and Los Angeles as an arts center.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Our programs will benefit youth and adults in the community, through a
  cooperative forum that makes available a collaberative, creative workspace and
  exhibition space that would typically not be accesible and/or affordable to
  many individuals. Our programs will help advance the public understanding and
  appreciation for the arts and the practical applications of making, reusing
  and the importance of hand made arts and analog processes. The specific and
  primary purpose of our studio is to promote the arts, as both a much needed
  form of expression and the practical application of these skills to develop
  and support art and design as a profession. A space where individuals can not
  only benefit from the practice of experienced based learning, but develop
  their interests and abilities into a way to make their art support them.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  We will work closely with professional artists, writers and musicians in the
  community. Making the space available for guest speakers, workshops and
  classes. We have relationships with neighborhood schools (Allesandro
  Elementary, Dorris Place Elementary, Eagle Rock Elementary, Gabriella Charter
  School, Art Lab High School), LA River Revitalization Corp, Elysian Valley
  Arts Collective, Frogtown Artwalk, Bookshow (Independent artisan book store),
  Mitch O'Farrell, NELA art Organization, ArtCenter college.
