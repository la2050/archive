  more_detail: "To open our printmaking studio to the community as a co-creative art space with a focus on traditional hand arts and non digital media an often too digitized environment. As public school art programs disappear and kids spend more time in the digital realm, we feel it vitally important to preserve and explore traditional hand made arts.\r\nScreen-printing, letterpress, etching and woodblock printing are process oriented, they connect the heart and the mind, through the hand and the eye. And by using recycled and existing materials to create art we challenge ourselves to be thoughtful and resourceful makers, artists and designers, with an emphasis on the sustainable,longevity of a community arts environment."
  implement: "We have built an incredible art space in North East LA out of a love for the arts and as a catalyst for communal co creativity. The space is large enough to hold classes, workshops, events and gallery shows. We have wanted to find a way to share the space with as many who wish to participate. To activate this space as a community arts lab will require experienced staff, additional equipment and supplies. \r\n      We need experienced guides and lab assistants as well as a budget for guest instructors and speakers. We need support staff for the development and coordination of workshops, classes and lab time. We need a key support person to help with the strategy, marketing and promotion of the learning programs as well as develop relationships with contributors in the community, so as to grow, develop and self sustain as a thriving and vital arts center."
  impact_create: "In this hyper digital, social media environment we find ourselves heavily reliant on our technology and grow further and further away from  hand skills and tactile experiences. Our friendships, work and even leisure time need the screen to exist. We spend entirely too much time in this digital realm and so our focus is to provide balance. Co- creativity and experienced based learning help us to get out of our heads and into our physical bodies. Hands on learning and analog print processes stimulate creativity and new ideas. An emphasis on balance within our digital lives becomes more and more of a luxury as opposed to a normal learning experience. By activating the instinctive parts of our nature to make, create, learn and grow, we preserve and develop our fundamental human skills and connect us to our physical world, each other and our communities. \r\n     Teaching people to make art and use the resources they have around them, including their culture and community, will enrich the individual the community and Los Angeles as an arts center. "
  who_benefit: >-
    Our programs will benefit youth and adults in the community, through a
    cooperative forum that makes available a collaberative, creative workspace
    and exhibition space that would typically not be accesible and/or affordable
    to many individuals. Our programs will help advance the public understanding
    and appreciation for the arts and the practical applications of making,
    reusing and the importance of hand made arts and analog processes. The
    specific and primary purpose of our studio is to promote the arts, as both a
    much needed form of expression and the practical application of these skills
    to develop and support art and design as a profession. A space where
    individuals can not only benefit from the practice of experienced based
    learning, but develop their interests and abilities into a way to make their
    art support them.
  partners_collaboration: >-
    We will work closely with professional artists, writers and musicians in the
    community. Making the space available for guest speakers, workshops and
    classes. We have relationships with neighborhood schools (Allesandro
    Elementary, Dorris Place Elementary, Eagle Rock Elementary, Gabriella
    Charter School, Art Lab High School), LA River Revitalization Corp, Elysian
    Valley Arts Collective, Frogtown Artwalk, Bookshow (Independent artisan book
    store), Mitch O'Farrell, NELA art Organization, ArtCenter college.

  evaluate: "Success for this project would be regular classes and workshops with active participation from the community and local schools. Success would also include visible implementation of the skills and tools out in the community through offsite workshops and outreach, for example bringing workshops to the schools not just bringing students into the workspace. \r\nMetrics are:\r\n1) confirmed collaboration and commitment from contributors\r\n2) learning programs that are thoughtful, structured, scheduled, staffed and filled with participants\r\n3) youth experiencing art as a profession and pathway to being self-sufficient"
  two_lessons: "In my youth I didn't have the support and guidance towards understanding that my art could sustain me. Seeing individuals that followed their own unique commitment to their art...helped me to realize I could create a path for myself...and not simply prescribe to someone elses idea of what that path should be. Providing a model for self sufficiency is as vital an education as any. Utilizing the visual arts as a form of expression and a way to support oneself spiritually and financially is especially important to the individual as well as the community as we strive to save and preserve these lost arts.\r\n\r\nI have always imagined a place where people could come and create and celebrate their art and the art and experiences of others. Teaching kids and adults has brought me to the understanding that\r\nwe need more than access to the web....we need exposure to tools and processes, to individuals and groups that support and cultivate independent art and thought. There are more and more computer labs and free wi-fi coffee shops...but professional art studios, tools and equipment, as well as the experienced professional instruction to utilize them are not accessible especially for free. Having a place to learn and grow as an artist should not be a luxury."
  achievable_goal: "We have built the space out of our own belief in the commitment to artistic expression and instinct. The tools are in place the presses are restored and the space is operational....we could start tomorrow if we had the resources for human capital required to manage the learning programs and workshops.\r\nOur project is a bit unique in that the Heavy lifting is done. We have existed the vital community of North East LA for more than 6 years.\r\nThe ship is built we just need help sailing. We have built a dynamic, creative space and have a complete print studio, wood shop, gallery/event space, communal art space and music rehearsal space.\r\nSimply put...we need funding in order to offer free and discounted printmaking classes, workshops and studio time to individuals within our community that wouldn't normally have access to what we believe is the most important part of any education...\r\na place to create and the people to help."
  major_challenges: "Coordinating with established educational programs in within the school year and common CORE guidelines\r\n\r\nCommitment from contributors as well as individuals .\r\n\r\nI am always inspired by programs that seek to service at risk youth.\r\nI would welcome the challenge to provide a unique and stimulating creative work enviroment for at risk youth in our community and to be able to work with kids entangled in the correctional system. "
  competition: >-
    3rd Ward in NYC original concept was to offer skillshare classes and
    multidisciplinary facilities, including gallery space, a wood and metal
    shop, dance studio, photo studio, recording studio, and office space. The
    business was a means of cost-effectively providing access to the creative
    community and facilities while allowing members the space needed to do work.
    This is also our vision but the focus is on community enrichment not
    profit. 
  cost: "The success of the project is based in a sustainable business model which requires the initial infusion of capital and if additional costs are incurred the project is not sustainable. Part of the development and sustainable plan is an artist membership for those professional artists needing the facilities. They are also required to contribute their expertise to the project which add value and offset cost. \r\nWe will be able to host our own fundraising events as well as activate the community gallery as a means of creating income for new independent artists as well as help support the space itself."
  budget: "Human capital: $70,000 (program development, implementation, systems and program management, facility maintenance, marketing and promotion)\r\n\r\nSpecifically: staff to run evening and weekend workshops\r\nwork exchang intern programs.\r\n\r\nEquipment: $12,000 maintenence and upkeep of silkscreen presses,\r\n2 antique presses, exposure unit, inks, recycled papers and materials and supplies.\r\n\r\nUtilities: $18,000"

As technology advances and we get more and more digital we lose the ability to create...its no longer required we can access anything from our phones, we can drive fast and kill people in virtual game environments, new apps keep us staring down at the screen.\r\nWe want to look up...away from the screen and towards our communities, friends and especially toward the artist within us all.\r\nHelping communities to support the arts, in turn helps the arts to support the community. We strive to support the local economy of the community as well as the artistic culture. "
Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  We have built an incredible art space in North East LA out of a love for the
  arts and as a catalyst for communal co creativity. The space is large enough
  to hold classes, workshops, events and gallery shows. We have wanted to find a
  way to share the space with as many who wish to participate. To activate this
  space as a community arts lab will require experienced staff, additional
  equipment and supplies. 
    We need experienced guides and lab assistants as well as a budget for guest instructors and speakers. We need support staff for the development and coordination of workshops, classes and lab time. We need a key support person to help with the strategy, marketing and promotion of the learning programs as well as develop relationships with contributors in the community, so as to grow, develop and self sustain as a thriving and vital arts center.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  In this hyper digital, social media environment we find ourselves heavily
  reliant on our technology and grow further and further away from hand skills
  and tactile experiences. Our friendships, work and even leisure time need the
  screen to exist. We spend entirely too much time in this digital realm and so
  our focus is to provide balance. Co- creativity and experienced based learning
  help us to get out of our heads and into our physical bodies. Hands on
  learning and analog print processes stimulate creativity and new ideas. An
  emphasis on balance within our digital lives becomes more and more of a luxury
  as opposed to a normal learning experience. By activating the instinctive
  parts of our nature to make, create, learn and grow, we preserve and develop
  our fundamental human skills and connect us to our physical world, each other
  and our communities. 
    Teaching people to make art and use the resources they have around them, including their culture and community, will enrich the individual the community and Los Angeles as an arts center.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Our programs will benefit youth and adults in the community, through a
  cooperative forum that makes available a collaberative, creative workspace and
  exhibition space that would typically not be accesible and/or affordable to
  many individuals. Our programs will help advance the public understanding and
  appreciation for the arts and the practical applications of making, reusing

  and support art and design as a profession. A space where individuals can not
  only benefit from the practice of experienced based learning, but develop
  their interests and abilities into a way to make their art support them.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  We will work closely with professional artists, writers and musicians in the
  community. Making the space available for guest speakers, workshops and
  classes. We have relationships with neighborhood schools (Allesandro

    answer: "Success for this project would be regular classes and workshops with active participation from the community and local schools. Success would also include visible implementation of the skills and tools out in the community through offsite workshops and outreach, for example bringing workshops to the schools not just bringing students into the workspace. \r\nMetrics are:\r\n1) confirmed collaboration and commitment from contributors\r\n2) learning programs that are thoughtful, structured, scheduled, staffed and filled with participants\r\n3) youth experiencing art as a profession and pathway to being self-sufficient"

    answer: "In my youth I didn't have the support and guidance towards understanding that my art could sustain me. Seeing individuals that followed their own unique commitment to their art...helped me to realize I could create a path for myself...and not simply prescribe to someone elses idea of what that path should be. Providing a model for self sufficiency is as vital an education as any. Utilizing the visual arts as a form of expression and a way to support oneself spiritually and financially is especially important to the individual as well as the community as we strive to save and preserve these lost arts.\r\n\r\nI have always imagined a place where people could come and create and celebrate their art and the art and experiences of others. Teaching kids and adults has brought me to the understanding that\r\nwe need more than access to the web....we need exposure to tools and processes, to individuals and groups that support and cultivate independent art and thought. There are more and more computer labs and free wi-fi coffee shops...but professional art studios, tools and equipment, as well as the experienced professional instruction to utilize them are not accessible especially for free. Having a place to learn and grow as an artist should not be a luxury."

    answer: "We have built the space out of our own belief in the commitment to artistic expression and instinct. The tools are in place the presses are restored and the space is operational....we could start tomorrow if we had the resources for human capital required to manage the learning programs and workshops.\r\nOur project is a bit unique in that the Heavy lifting is done. We have existed the vital community of North East LA for more than 6 years.\r\nThe ship is built we just need help sailing. We have built a dynamic, creative space and have a complete print studio, wood shop, gallery/event space, communal art space and music rehearsal space.\r\nSimply put...we need funding in order to offer free and discounted printmaking classes, workshops and studio time to individuals within our community that wouldn't normally have access to what we believe is the most important part of any education...\r\na place to create and the people to help."

      3rd Ward in NYC original concept was to offer skillshare classes and
      multidisciplinary facilities, including gallery space, a wood and metal
      shop, dance studio, photo studio, recording studio, and office space. The
      business was a means of cost-effectively providing access to the creative
      community and facilities while allowing members the space needed to do
      work. This is also our vision but the focus is on community enrichment not
      profit.

    answer: "The success of the project is based in a sustainable business model which requires the initial infusion of capital and if additional costs are incurred the project is not sustainable. Part of the development and sustainable plan is an artist membership for those professional artists needing the facilities. They are also required to contribute their expertise to the project which add value and offset cost. \r\nWe will be able to host our own fundraising events as well as activate the community gallery as a means of creating income for new independent artists as well as help support the space itself."
