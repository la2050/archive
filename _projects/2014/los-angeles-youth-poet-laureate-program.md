  who_benefit: >-
    Most specifically, this program will benefit teen writers in Los Angeles
    counties. Additionally, this program will benefit the numerous communities
    across Los Angeles that will provide audience to celebrate these teen
    voices, as well as teachers, educators, parents and supporters of youth and
    literary arts. Furthermore, because this program seeks to galvanize the many
    powerful youth-serving orgs across LA, we will serve the diverse programs
    and constituents of LA literary arts orgs across the county, including Get
    Lit, Say Word, 826LA, WriteGirl, Street Poets, and LA Arts and Athletics
    Alliance.

  evaluate: "This project serves as a platform 1) to engage youth writers of Los Angeles and inspire them to develop the tools to cultivate art that inspires change, and 2) to showcase these young voices to diverse audiences across Los Angeles County.\r\n\r\nIn evaluating the success of the program we measure:\r\na) Impact that our partner orgs and outreach has to sharing these powerful opportunities to young writers, which includes monitoring and tracking students who participate in workshops, submit their contest materials and attend live events.\r\nb) Audience engagement across Los Angeles County for support and celebration of our youth through the myriad performances and events that this project produces.\r\nc) Impact of LA Youth Poet Laureate and Youth Poet Ambassadors to promote the values of this program, prioritizing civic and community engagement, and excellence in the arts."
  two_lessons: "As a nonprofit leader in literary arts, a poet, and an educator, I have seen first hand the power of programs like this one. The most important lessons that I have learned is that:\r\n1: Young people will rise to the occasion when asked to make their work \"mean\" something, to develop critical reflection through their writing, and to share their opinion with diverse audience. Youth are denied these platforms time and time again, and therefore creating a program and platform like this is not only necessary but imperative.\r\n2: Poetry does not have to live on the page, in a coffee shop or in a community center only, but CAN and should occupy places of power and governance. This project takes young writers out of the spaces they usually convene to provide \"official\" support and validation with their city, places of governance, and council districts behind them."
  achievable_goal: "The Los Angeles Youth Poet Laureate program/initiative is a program of Urban Word, an award-winning youth literary arts and youth development organization, in collaboration with local youth literary arts organizations (YOU) across the country; and championed by the leading national literary organizations, including the Academy of American Poets and the PEN Center USA. The local partner-organizations represent leadership from a broad and diverse national network, including the Brave New Voices network and the Louder than a Bomb network. \r\n\r\nIn 2008, Urban Word, launched the nation’s first-ever Youth Poet Laureate program, in partnership with the NYC Voters Assistance Commission and the NYC Mayor’s Office. Since then, Urban Word has honored 5 Youth Poet Laureates in New York City, each having released their own debut collections of poetry from Penmanship Books. This year, Urban Word will partner with six of the top youth literary arts organizations in Los Angeles to launch the first-ever LA Youth Poet Laureate program, and announce the inaugural Los Angeles Youth Poet Laureate. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, with key partnerships with Los Angeles Public Library, and the LA County Commission on Human Relations, we are poised to set up a full schedule of workshops and events, and ensure that the promotional needs and reach of this program are met."
  major_challenges: >-
    For contest based programs, that engage multiple platforms for performance
    and workshops, the biggest obstacles are spreading the word, and finding
    space. Because of our highly strategic partnerships with county commissions,
    the public library system, and the leading literary arts organization in Los
    Angeles County, we are able to ensure that we secure all of these needs
    prior to launching the program. 
  competition: >-
    Urban Word is the creator and national leader in Youth Poet Laureate
    programming, and has partnerships with the leading literary arts
    organizations in the U.S. to support this important work.
  cost: >-
    This project will costs $85,000 to provide free creative writing workshops,
    as well as free county-wide Youth Poet Laureate and Ambassador performances.

    Our program situates young people in poetry and performance in spaces that

  In the months preceding the program launch, PEN USA and Urban Word LA will

  powerful opportunity.

      Our program situates young people in poetry and performance in spaces that
      attract diverse audiences and services. We provide free after school
      programs in these spaces, and cultivate a culture that prioritizes youth
      voice in these spaces, and most of all, celebrates them.

    answer: "This project serves as a platform 1) to engage youth writers of Los Angeles and inspire them to develop the tools to cultivate art that inspires change, and 2) to showcase these young voices to diverse audiences across Los Angeles County.\r\n\r\nIn evaluating the success of the program we measure:\r\na) Impact that our partner orgs and outreach has to sharing these powerful opportunities to young writers, which includes monitoring and tracking students who participate in workshops, submit their contest materials and attend live events.\r\nb) Audience engagement across Los Angeles County for support and celebration of our youth through the myriad performances and events that this project produces.\r\nc) Impact of LA Youth Poet Laureate and Youth Poet Ambassadors to promote the values of this program, prioritizing civic and community engagement, and excellence in the arts."

    answer: "As a nonprofit leader in literary arts, a poet, and an educator, I have seen first hand the power of programs like this one. The most important lessons that I have learned is that:\r\n1: Young people will rise to the occasion when asked to make their work \"mean\" something, to develop critical reflection through their writing, and to share their opinion with diverse audience. Youth are denied these platforms time and time again, and therefore creating a program and platform like this is not only necessary but imperative.\r\n2: Poetry does not have to live on the page, in a coffee shop or in a community center only, but CAN and should occupy places of power and governance. This project takes young writers out of the spaces they usually convene to provide \"official\" support and validation with their city, places of governance, and council districts behind them."

    answer: "The Los Angeles Youth Poet Laureate program/initiative is a program of Urban Word, an award-winning youth literary arts and youth development organization, in collaboration with local youth literary arts organizations (YOU) across the country; and championed by the leading national literary organizations, including the Academy of American Poets and the PEN Center USA. The local partner-organizations represent leadership from a broad and diverse national network, including the Brave New Voices network and the Louder than a Bomb network. \r\n\r\nIn 2008, Urban Word, launched the nation’s first-ever Youth Poet Laureate program, in partnership with the NYC Voters Assistance Commission and the NYC Mayor’s Office. Since then, Urban Word has honored 5 Youth Poet Laureates in New York City, each having released their own debut collections of poetry from Penmanship Books. This year, Urban Word will partner with six of the top youth literary arts organizations in Los Angeles to launch the first-ever LA Youth Poet Laureate program, and announce the inaugural Los Angeles Youth Poet Laureate. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, with key partnerships with Los Angeles Public Library, and the LA County Commission on Human Relations, we are poised to set up a full schedule of workshops and events, and ensure that the promotional needs and reach of this program are met."

    answer: >-
      For contest based programs, that engage multiple platforms for performance
      and workshops, the biggest obstacles are spreading the word, and finding
      space. Because of our highly strategic partnerships with county
      commissions, the public library system, and the leading literary arts
      organization in Los Angeles County, we are able to ensure that we secure
      all of these needs prior to launching the program.
