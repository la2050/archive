Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  In the months preceding the program launch, PEN USA and Urban Word LA will
  provide free writing workshops at 12 LA Public Library branches across LA
  County for young poets and writers to put together their poetry portfolios,
  create resumes, CVs and all other contest materials. Furthermore, we will host
  showcase performances of top youth poets to spread the word about this
  powerful opportunity.
   
   During the month of April (National Poetry Month), we will accept submissions from young poets, writers, leaders and activists ages 13-19 from across Los Angeles County who are interested in representing Los Angeles as the inaugural LA Youth Poet Laureate. A group of esteemed judges (including California Poet Laureate Juan Felipe Herrera) will chose 12 Finalists, all given the distinction of LA Poet Ambassador, and we will select one youth to be honored with the title of LA Youth Poet Laureate at the Poet Laureate Commencement Performance at LA Public Libraryâ€™s Mark Taper Auditorium.
   
   Along with winning the prestigious title of LA Youth Poet Laureate, the winning poet will also win a book deal from Penmanship Books to publish their first collection of poems, as well as a library tour. The LA Youth Poet Laureate and the LA Poet Ambassadors will have numerous opportunities and platforms to share their powerful voices, their leadership, and love of Los Angeles at numerous events across the county. Urban Word Los Angeles and our many partners recognize that youth voice and community engagement are vital for empowering young people to effect positive changes in their communities and beyond. Local partners also include Get Lit, Say Word, 826LA, Write Girl and Street Poets.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  This project will be an historic one, as it will be one of the first places
  nationally to recognize and honor a Youth Poet Laureate, and cultivate LA
  Youth Poet Ambassadors across the city. 
   
   Along with the free creative writing resources that this program will provide for teens across the county, as well as the numerous live performances, this program will help to develop and cultivate a culture that prioritizes youth voice, literary arts and poetry, and an aesthetic of 21st century artist that are socially and civically engaged. The mission of this program is to not only value art/poetry for art's sake, but also to engage social justice, diversity, and the powerful stories of our incredible city.
   
   Each year, the winners (LA Youth Poet Ambassadors) and the LA Youth Poet Laureate, will promote the values of this program, and perform across the city. These performances will be free opportunities for LA Country residents to hear what is on the minds and hearts of our city's youth. The performances and workshops will take place in libraries, theaters, parks, and community spaces and theaters.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Most specifically, this program will benefit teen writers in Los Angeles
  counties. Additionally, this program will benefit the numerous communities
  across Los Angeles that will provide audience to celebrate these teen voices,
  as well as teachers, educators, parents and supporters of youth and literary
  arts. Furthermore, because this program seeks to galvanize the many powerful
  youth-serving orgs across LA, we will serve the diverse programs and
  constituents of LA literary arts orgs across the county, including Get Lit,
  Say Word, 826LA, WriteGirl, Street Poets, and LA Arts and Athletics Alliance.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  We have confirmed and worked successfully with all of our project partners
  including: Los Angeles Public Library, Central branch's Mark Taper Auditorium,
  LA County Commission on Human Relations, Academy of American Poets, Penmanship
  Books, Get Lit Words Ignite, Say Word (Pomona), 826LA, WriteGirl, Street
  Poets, and LA Arts and Athletics Alliance.
   
   Each partner brings an incredible community and history of powerful programming, reach, and powerful youth development work with teens. We are able to utilize the LA Public Library system, and the LA County Commission on Human Relations, to provide the institutional support to promote the program and provide platforms for writing and performance.
   
   We are critically committed to:
   1: Providing safe spaces for LA youth to share their important and powerful voices.
   2: Honoring the young poet-leaders in meaningful and important ways through the creation of LA Youth Poet Laureate program and LA Youth Poet Ambassadors.
   3: Galvanizing various organizations across Los Angeles country that do this life-changing work.
