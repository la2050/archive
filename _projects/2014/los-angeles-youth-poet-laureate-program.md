  more_detail: "The Los Angeles Youth Poet Laureate will be a joint program of PEN Center USA and Urban Word LA, supported by LA Public Library, the LA County Commission on Human Relations, Penmanship Books and the Academy of American Poets. The Los Angeles Youth Poet Laureate program aims to identify young writers and leaders who are committed to civic and community engagement, poetry and performance, and Human Relations, Diversity & Social Justice across Los Angeles.\r\n"
  implement: "In the months preceding the program launch, PEN USA and Urban Word LA will provide free writing workshops at 12 LA Public Library branches across LA County for young poets and writers to put together their poetry portfolios, create resumes, CVs and all other contest materials. Furthermore, we will host showcase performances of top youth poets to spread the word about this powerful opportunity.\r\n\r\nDuring the month of April (National Poetry Month), we will accept submissions from young poets, writers, leaders and activists ages 13-19 from across Los Angeles County who are interested in representing Los Angeles as the inaugural LA Youth Poet Laureate. A group of esteemed judges (including California Poet Laureate Juan Felipe Herrera) will chose 12 Finalists, all given the distinction of LA Poet Ambassador, and we will select one youth to be honored with the title of LA Youth Poet Laureate at the Poet Laureate Commencement Performance at LA Public Library’s Mark Taper Auditorium.\r\n\r\nAlong with winning the prestigious title of LA Youth Poet Laureate, the winning poet will also win a book deal from Penmanship Books to publish their first collection of poems, as well as a library tour. The LA Youth Poet Laureate and the LA Poet Ambassadors will have numerous opportunities and platforms to share their powerful voices, their leadership, and love of Los Angeles at numerous events across the county. Urban Word Los Angeles and our many partners recognize that youth voice and community engagement are vital for empowering young people to effect positive changes in their communities and beyond. Local partners also include Get Lit, Say Word, 826LA, Write Girl and Street Poets."
  impact_play: "This project will be an historic one, as it will be one of the first places nationally to recognize and honor a Youth Poet Laureate, and cultivate LA Youth Poet Ambassadors across the city. \r\n\r\nAlong with the free creative writing resources that this program will provide for teens across the county, as well as the numerous live performances, this program will help to develop and cultivate a  culture that prioritizes youth voice, literary arts and poetry, and an aesthetic of 21st century artist that are socially and civically engaged. The mission of this program is to not only value art/poetry for art's sake, but also to engage social justice, diversity, and the powerful stories of our incredible city.\r\n\r\nEach year, the winners (LA Youth Poet Ambassadors) and the LA Youth Poet Laureate, will promote the values of this program, and perform across the city. These performances will be free opportunities for LA Country residents to hear what is on the minds and hearts of our city's youth.

  who_benefit: >-
    Most specifically, this program will benefit teen writers in Los Angeles
    counties. Additionally, this program will benefit the numerous communities
    across Los Angeles that will provide audience to celebrate these teen
    voices, as well as teachers, educators, parents and supporters of youth and
    literary arts. Furthermore, because this program seeks to galvanize the many
    powerful youth-serving orgs across LA, we will serve the diverse programs
    and constituents of LA literary arts orgs across the county, including Get
    Lit, Say Word, 826LA, WriteGirl, Street Poets, and LA Arts and Athletics
    Alliance.

  evaluate: "This project serves as a platform 1) to engage youth writers of Los Angeles and inspire them to develop the tools to cultivate art that inspires change, and 2) to showcase these young voices to diverse audiences across Los Angeles County.\r\n\r\nIn evaluating the success of the program we measure:\r\na) Impact that our partner orgs and outreach has to sharing these powerful opportunities to young writers, which includes monitoring and tracking students who participate in workshops, submit their contest materials and attend live events.\r\nb) Audience engagement across Los Angeles County for support and celebration of our youth through the myriad performances and events that this project produces.\r\nc) Impact of LA Youth Poet Laureate and Youth Poet Ambassadors to promote the values of this program, prioritizing civic and community engagement, and excellence in the arts."
  two_lessons: "As a nonprofit leader in literary arts, a poet, and an educator, I have seen first hand the power of programs like this one. The most important lessons that I have learned is that:\r\n1: Young people will rise to the occasion when asked to make their work \"mean\" something, to develop critical reflection through their writing, and to share their opinion with diverse audience. Youth are denied these platforms time and time again, and therefore creating a program and platform like this is not only necessary but imperative.\r\n2: Poetry does not have to live on the page, in a coffee shop or in a community center only, but CAN and should occupy places of power and governance. This project takes young writers out of the spaces they usually convene to provide \"official\" support and validation with their city, places of governance, and council districts behind them."
  achievable_goal: "The Los Angeles Youth Poet Laureate program/initiative is a program of Urban Word, an award-winning youth literary arts and youth development organization, in collaboration with local youth literary arts organizations (YOU) across the country; and championed by the leading national literary organizations, including the Academy of American Poets and the PEN Center USA. The local partner-organizations represent leadership from a broad and diverse national network, including the Brave New Voices network and the Louder than a Bomb network. \r\n\r\nIn 2008, Urban Word, launched the nation’s first-ever Youth Poet Laureate program, in partnership with the NYC Voters Assistance Commission and the NYC Mayor’s Office. Since then, Urban Word has honored 5 Youth Poet Laureates in New York City, each having released their own debut collections of poetry from Penmanship Books. This year, Urban Word will partner with six of the top youth literary arts organizations in Los Angeles to launch the first-ever LA Youth Poet Laureate program, and announce the inaugural Los Angeles Youth Poet Laureate. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, with key partnerships with Los Angeles Public Library, and the LA County Commission on Human Relations, we are poised to set up a full schedule of workshops and events, and ensure that the promotional needs and reach of this program are met."
  major_challenges: >-
    For contest based programs, that engage multiple platforms for performance
    and workshops, the biggest obstacles are spreading the word, and finding
    space. Because of our highly strategic partnerships with county commissions,

    Angeles County, we are able to ensure that we secure all of these needs
    prior to launching the program.
