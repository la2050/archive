  The game BLOCK could be adapted to any environment, it would constitute a
  framework for the study of urban health.
Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  We have already developed an initial prototype, as can be seen in the
  accompanying video. The prototype allows us to already start working with
  players and communities as we develop and add real data and features to the
  game. Local communities within LA have already approached us to use the game
  in the teaching of architecture and urban development. 
   
   To implement this project, we need to build a team that will support the current development team, primarily by going into the community, and connecting with people in education, design, and urban planning, and also to source real data to create accurate simulations. 
   
   The game prototype that we have already developed works as a proof of concept; Players can easily simulate urban environments and come to understand the interdependencies of different elements. The game encourages the player to improve the quality of urban space and learn the needs of other actors in the city.
   
   Games such as Simcity and Minecraft allow players to engage with city simulations or digital design, but we currently do not have an accessible game that can connect players with the real implications of products, of architecture and the city. BLOCK will breach the digital with the physical and allow anyone to become an active participant in the LA of 2050. The current Gamescapes research led by Jose Sanchez at USC School of Architecture, has been developed over the past 2 years, to create the tools and the framework to make this game possible.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  LA is a city that has been built by its inhabitants. Is in in their power to
  make a significant new change. The LA of 2050 will be shaped by a generation
  that is currently very young. It requires a ‘massive design medium’ to expand
  the imagination of the current generation. Video games have the reach to
  affect a larger community. They also offer the possibility to simulate
  systems; Systems thinking is one of the fundamental challenges of the 21st
  century. If we have engaging video games that can simulate the quality of the
  air, the health of the city and the interdependences of businesses, we can
  allow individuals and organizations to see how their own ideas are
  intertwined.
   
   BLOCK aims to be a medium for 21st century city participation where we could crowd-source the models for the LA of 2050. 
   
   However, BLOCK can also have a direct impact very quickly. One of the stages of the project is to model a series of case studies of cities and neighbourhoods that work with ideas of ecology, generating patterns of sustainability. These patterns will be included in the game as examples, and would enable anyone to learn how to implement already working solutions. Think of it as an interactive recipe book for a healthy Los Angeles.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Change takes time, and the beneficiaries of this project will truly be near
  future generations. In it’s initial phase, the game’s primary educational
  purpose, will be to support educational institutions to find and model urban
  problems, and build simulations that could provide alternative patterns for
  the urban conditions of today.
   
   In it’s second phase, the game will build a catalogue of case studies of established urban problems and possible solutions. The game will show that it can model existing and envisioned city configurations, and also demonstrate how they could operate. This will connect a gamer community with architects and city planners.
   
   Whilst the internet can provide a forum to enable hundreds of people to play and suggest great ideas to a particular problem, is can be difficult to know if the ideas are feasible or if they are missing other information that render them irrelevant. By developing BLOCK, citizens will be armed with the tools to create city simulations themselves, and ideas will be in a format that any authority could implement. The challenge of the project is to go ‘from Gaming to Making’.
   
   In a similar way in which the game FOLD-IT (http://fold.it/) works with a community of players to advance the science of protein folding and cure diseases, BLOCK will bring the problem of urban health and ecological urbanism to a massive community of players that can collectively be smarter than a state of the art algorithm.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: |-
  USC School of Architecture has already secured two partners:
   USC Game Innovation Lab
   http://www.gameinnovationlab.com/
   5D Institute
   http://5dinstitute.org/
   
   The project is also trying to collaborate with:
   Unity3D (TBC)
   http://unity3d.com/
   The Plant Chicago (TBC)
   http://www.plantchicago.com/
   
   The experience in developing video games at the USC Game Innovation Lab led by Tracy Fullerton, will be a critical assessment to the work developed. They posses a fundamental expertise in all areas of game development and will certainly push the game to be meaningful and accomplish its goals.
   
   The 5D Institute, led by Alex McDowell, is recognised for innovation in narrative structures. They will be a key collaborator to define the rhetoric of the project to generate player engagement. The ecological narrative of the game needs to be strong and accessible and the 5D Institute will support us to achieve this goal.
   
   The two other collaborations currently being pursued will add a deeper expertise to the game: 
   
   Unity3D is the company that develops Unity, the game engine used so far for the development of BLOCK. We are in conversation with them for technical support for this project.
   
   The Plant Chicago is an Urban Farming initiative that has pioneered an ecological urban farm concept that eliminates the idea of waste by establishing the interdependence of productive units. They posses a unique expertise and have been a great inspiration to the project. In collaborating with The Plant Chicago, we hope to use them as a case study and implement several other concepts similar to theirs within the game.
