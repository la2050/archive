Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  In many ways the Women’s Center for Creative Work is well underway! We have a
  strong community of women makers who are already attending Women’s Dinners,
  going to and leading workshops, taking part in our “Workers in Residence”
  program at our residencies, and in general giving their support to the WCCW in
  real life and online.
   
   Women often have multi-faceted practices, balancing their time as producers, makers, workers, mothers and partners. The WCCW is a proposed answer to this challenge, offering a collective workspace to provide an environment of solidarity and community, a sanctuary where women with all sorts of small businesses, artistic practices, and personal projects can come get some work done within a supportive atmosphere.
   
   To implement the next phase of the WCCW –a permanent physical location, we would need to find that right location, do the appropriate build-out and remodeling, activate our community to find women to be in residence in the studios in the space, and continue to grow our network. The LA2050 grant would make this all possible in one fell swoop, but we also have plans in place for fundraising. 
   
   If receiving this grant, The Women’s Center for Creative Work would continue to host workshops, events, and exhibitions and the like as we have already been doing throughout our research and development year. The crucial difference would be that we’d have a permanent location to hold our communal workspace and activities. Space is important in Los Angeles. Having a permanent location would allow us to foster community in a physical way and build the foundational support necessary to gr
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Los Angeles is a collection of nodal centers, some very spread out from each
  other. In order to cultivate community in this rhizomatic city one has to be
  very deliberate–most of us get in our cars and drive somewhere rather than
  walking along the street. This lack of street culture leads to a brevity of
  the sort of chance interactions that can be very generative, creatively and
  otherwise. With a permanent physical space, the WCCW could function as a
  gathering place and foster an environment which allows for chance meetings and
  conversations as well as more formalized events, exhibitions, and workshops.
   
   We believe the best places for creation have a built in community to discuss ideas, help out with big projects, support makers physically, emotionally, intellectually, spiritually, financially, etc…. We value both craft and high art, but are not into the hierarchy that separates them. We’re into constantly learning, sharing ideas and skills, and making it easier for women to get work done (whether this means a child care co-op, a tutorial offered on web design, or someone to help build a shipping crate). We endeavor to make visible the invisible labor that makes up a community: stacking chairs, creating spreadsheets, cooking a group meal, managing a facebook page. 
   
   We are feminists and we believe all these things, from administration to organization building, can be done from a feminist perspective. WCCW already embodies these visions and principles in its nomadic form and they would translate naturally to the physical space, making it an excellent place for women to create, foster relationships personal and professional, and participate in the cultivation of our ever-growing community.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Creative women of all kinds will benefit from the space, especially those
  whose jobs/projects are of a more freelance nature, which is so common in this
  city: screenwriters, graphic designers, small business owners, stylists,
  comedians, landscape architects, etc... would have a place to come work within
  a supportive environment, proving a welcome alternative to having to take
  meetings at Starbucks. Through our varied activities and interests, we
  endeavor to make the WCCW as open and welcoming to all women as we possibly
  can and are particularly committed to intergenerational and cross-cultural
  conversations around women's creative work. 
   
   Events, exhibitions, and educational projects would also offer anyone interested in creative production in Los Angeles, the chance to engage with the WCCW and it's members.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  We constantly work with collaborators and partners, and inevitably there would
  be many involved in this project, but none that have been specifically
  identified yet.
