What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  ART CITY LA is an open invitation to a multi-sector coalition of creative
  workers, venues, partners, neighborhoods, cultures, and sponsors to come
  together to champion the value of LA’s creative economy and take action to
  foster this important force of societal advancement. 
   
   ART CITY LA offers the LA creative community and general public a welcoming platform for more of the expression and recognition it deserves by connecting the widest possible mix of artists, partners, venues, neighborhoods, and cultures in a participatory activation involving LA’s vast number and disciplinary array of creatives and the broad range of industries and communities in which they work.
   
   ART CITY LA will help stimulate the creative economy, cultural tourism, and an international reputation by increasing awareness and support the numerous and diverse industries and creative workers that comprise LA's creative economy, inspiring a citywide activation for the advancement of the arts and economy, and ultimately, helping stimulate innovation and create jobs, as well as social and cultural benefits, by way of creative education and professions.
   
   Shining a light on LA’s vibrant arts community to both locals and national and international visitors, ART CITY LA will recognize Los Angeles’ status as America’s Artist Super City in a way that amplifies the financial and social impact of its creative industries and practitioners and promotes creativity as fundamental to economic growth and prosperity.
   
   ART CITY LA will market “Art City” as a slogan/motto that identifies LA as The Creative Capital of California and the Nation, one that says LA is a dynamic place to create, live, work, learn, and connect and speaks volumes about it as a great, livable, thriving center of art, creativity, and culture.
   
   ART CITY LA will act as an educationally-oriented opportunity for all cultures and communities to access and gain entry into the full range of creative industries as a vocation, one that promotes the premise that creativity is an essential ingredient to a successful workforce and justifies increased emphasis on creative economy career paths through technical and university institutions. 
   
   ART CITY LA will provide a much-needed voice for young and emerging artists and their constituents to gain additional exposure outside of more traditional methods and help them build careers and livelihoods across for-profit, nonprofit, public and community arenas.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Furthering the work of institutions such as LA 2050, LA Economic Development
  Corporation, LA Department of Cultural Affairs, LA County Arts Commission, LA
  N’Sync, LA Coalition for the Economy & Jobs, and others, ART CITY LA will
  involve LA’s vast number and disciplinary array of creatives and the broad
  range of industries and communities in which they work. 
   
   A big-picture solution with exponential potential, ART CITY LA constitutes the ultimate mash-up of artists, entrepreneurs, brands, venues, neighborhoods, cultures, companies, investors, and institutions–all connected by a common goal of making LA a globally recognized center of creative excellence.
   
   ART CITY LA embodies the very attributes of urbanism and the very nature of art and creativity. The arts have a special role in providing inspiration to all people. Therefore, ART CITY LA recognizes that it is not only artists and those involved in the creative economy that are creative but that creativity can come from anyone who addresses issues in an inventive way. Grounded in the philosophy that we can all make the extraordinary happen if given the chance, ART CITY LA is a place where everyone can express their potential which is harnessed and promoted for the common good. When these expressions combine, they create an innovation ecosystem–a synergistic relationship between people and place that facilitates idea generation and accelerates commercialization.
   
   ART CITY LA specifically presents a special opportunity for 50 Ambassadors and Venues to further their work as thought-leaders dedicated to strengthening LA’s creative brand. Being chosen is recognition of individual creativity and support of the local creative community. Not only is this a chance to spotlight their unique talents, ideas and contributions, it is also where they can help shape the things that make LA such a desirable place to be. For LA, this is a way to publicly thank and promote those entrepreneurs who are helping it move up the value chain of global competitiveness by growing the jobs, firms and networks that drive broad-based prosperity.
   
   Altogether, ART CITY LA is an inclusive bridge-building and networking platform that encourages the broad cross-sector partnerships that are crucial to generating momentum and support for the creative economy, one that engenders the kind of open innovation that can forge new and more extensive relationships and collaborations and strengthen LA’s position as America's Artist SuperCity.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  In the collaborative spirit of the LA2050 Grant Challenge, ART CITY LA has
  been designed to support the shared mission of the CREATE Category through a
  true “Crowdsourced LA” production enabling all those dedicated to enhancing
  LA’s status as world leader in media, arts, and the creative industries to
  work cooperatively to achieve a common goal. 
   
   This kind of collaboration goes to the heart of what creativity is all about. Like jazz, often heralded as the epitome of complex collaborative practice, ART CITY LA is a synergistic, wise, resonant, and connected way to share ideas, pool resources, mobilize assets, and tap greater sources of intelligence to spur productive, inclusive, and sustainable economic development.
   
   With this in mind, ART CITY LA has initiated conversations with key players such as LA's Cultural Affairs Department, LAEDC, and Center for Cultural Innovation to invite their involvement in this strategic alliance, communicating how ART CITY LA supports their work and that we are all on the same team. The response has been positive:
   
   “I am thrilled to see what you have produced. You have our total support on what you are doing as this is exactly what we want to see happen here in LA.” -Amy Amsterdam, Innovate in Los Angeles
   
   “Your proposal looks very strong and shows clearly the details of the program. I'm sorry we could not participate as a direct partner in the application, but the project is a wonderful idea. Our new GM who started yesterday very much likes it, and as you note, we should discuss this further and see how we can assist." -Andrew Kasdin, DCA
   
   “You have a great idea to excite LA's community through showcasing local artists. As you astutely observed, this is also one of the aims of CCI. Unfortunately, with such short lead time, it would be difficult to get involved on our end. I wish you success in finding an institutional partner and hope you'll keep us updated on your progress. If your project is awarded, let me know as that may provide another opportunity for partnership in promoting your program far and wide.” -Angie Kim, Center for Cultural Innovation
   
   These encouraging comments attest to a strong interest in the value of a global program such as ART CITY LA, which if chosen as an LA2050 Grant Challenge winner will offer these institutions and others full opportunity to participate in empowering LA County residents to harness their creativity by fostering entrepreneurship, cultural diversity, and inclusivity.
