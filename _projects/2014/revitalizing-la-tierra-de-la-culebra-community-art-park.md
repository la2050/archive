  more_detail: "We are a grassroots community of artists, thinkers, teachers, builders, gardeners, scientists and creative minds who are embarking on a mission to bring new life to a 22 year old community art park, La Tierra de la Culebra, by collectively designing and creating an alternative space to explore urban permaculture concepts through a process of culturally relevant community outreach programming, hands-on learning, and the involvement of at-risk youth through a restorative justice approach.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please visit our facebook page.\r\n\r\n"
  implement: "We will begin to implement this project by establishing a solid community networking platform through social media, initiating a construction project at the park of an urban permaculture exploration and learning center, simultaneously developing effective and creative expression workshops for the community taught by accountable community members, and then facilitating access to the use of this space for purposeful creative endeavors to promote a sense of community and accountability to the park.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please visit our facebook page.\r\n\r\n"
  impact_live: "There are many interpretations of what living in a healthy place means. To us, it is an integration of all of the different concepts in a way that they overlap and flow seamlessly to support one aspect that also supports the next one. A holistic approach. Our project is aimed at facilitating access to a space in which we can integrate  all of our different ideas about the notion of living healthy lives and scaffold a conscious awareness amongst community members of how to apply them to their own lives by experiencing them here at the park. We will make Los Angeles the healthiest place to live by promoting a connection and appreciation for healthy foods, disseminating information about how to access these foods either through feasible outlets or growing them at home (even without significant access to space or resources), increasing canopy cover (reducing air toxins) at the park and beyond using fruit bearing trees,  hosting physical engagement activities to fight obesity (and improve the bike/transit score through mobility), combating violent acts through restorative justice programming (guiding responsibility for actions that have hurt or harmed someone else rather than focusing on punishment and isolation from the community), exemplifying conscientious use of water resources and ways of reducing polluted waterways (through water diversion methods, reducing run-off, and and reducing use of harmful chemicals), while simultaneously engaging people’s need for interaction and creativity to sustain a healthy approach to life in the face of adversity and the prevalent socio-economic disparities that are rampant in Los Angeles. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
  who_benefit: "The project will benefit young children in the vicinity with access to an open park space, it will benefit high school and college students who need an outlet for civic engagement to build skillsets for their future, low-income families seeking access to healthy food and preventive health information, families looking for a place to spend time together and enjoy cultural events, everyone in Los Angeles wanting to explore urban permaculture in a hands-on setting, community members seeking involvement in  sustainable living issues, at-risk youth in the area needing  mentoring and financial support, as well as creative and professional community members needing a supportive space (as well as stipends and materials) in which to share their expertise with others.\r\n"

  two_lessons: "From the LA2050 Report:\r\n\r\n1.) A 2002 study foundthat heavily Latino neighborhoods have only 0.6 park acres per 1,000 people; African American communities have 1.7 park acres per 1,000 people, and largely Caucasian communities have 31.8 park ares per 1,000 residents. (p.28)\r\n\r\n2.) Los Angeles devotes 7.9 pecent (23,798 acres) of ts total land area to parks and open space, which is on par with the national median figure of 8.3 percent. However, access to the city's park infrastructure lags behind much of the nation. (p. 28)"
  achievable_goal: >-
    This will be achievable by designating a time of thorough planning for the
    organization of the construction process and workshop integration,
    accomodating the budget availability as is needed.
  major_challenges: "1.) Having a widespread access to the community for involvement and awareness of the opportunities.\r\n\r\n2. Graffiti, vandalism, and gang-violence.\r\n\r\nTo address the first, we will invest in creating a solid public comunication platform through social media and a strong interactive website.\r\n\r\nThe second will be addressed through a restorative justice approach and providing funding opportunities to at-risk youth."
  competition: >-
    Other organizations are seeking to either improve walk ways for public land
    use and activity, creating gardens, and facilitating access to food. We are
    unique in that we want to actively engage the community through exploration
    to inspire them to take these sustainable approaches home to share with
    friends and family. Providing access to exploration, knowledge, and
    self-empowerment through activity versus just free giveaways.
  cost: >-
    We are projecting that this project will cost $100,000. How can we be so
    certain? The flexibility of the project plan allows us to use all the funds
    while not having to exceed their limit. A fraction will be used for park
    maintenace (utility bills, park lease, rent for headquarters, insurance),
    about a quarter will be used for administrative purposes (yes, only that
    much out from this fund for two main directors), we are projecting half will
    be used to the major builing project (shipping containers and refurbishing),
    and the rest will be paid out as needed for workshop materials, volunteer
    stipends, and cultural events. We already have the land and human resources
    (many many volunteers acquired through 22 years of networking. By the
    community, for the community, eliminating middleman fees as much as
    possible.

Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Hunger Action Los Angeles will complete the following activities to expand
  Market Match throughout more portions of Los Angeles County:
   1. Expanding Market Match to 8 additional markets, with 4 located in areas Hunger Action Los Angeles does not currently serve, especially the San Fernando Valley
   2. Training current market operators; recruiting volunteers; continuing administration of program at 18 markets; conducting meetings to coordinate promotion of Market Match activities with current and future Market Match partners; 
   3. Creating specific outreach materials for seniors, families, and persons with disabilities
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Market Match makes Los Angeles a better place to live by producing the
  following benefits:
   
   1. Reduces hunger as vulnerable individuals and families acquire additional resources to obtain more food. 
   2. Improves health as Market Match coupons can only be used on healthy items such as fresh apples, asparagus, beets and broccoli, rather than prepared foods that may be high in fat, salt and sugar. 
   3. Builds community by facilitating interaction between people in an open community space.
   4. Stimulates the local economy, as participating local farmers gain revenue generated by increased sales at the farmers’ market, rather than the money being sent out of state through the purchase of non-Californian produce. 
   5. Expands the local sustainable agriculture sector, improving the environment in the process.
   6. Creates connections with other nonprofit organizations working on similar issues, developing a network of readily available resources that participants can conveniently access.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The project specifically benefits the following populations: Families with
  children aged 5 and under: Seniors: Persons with physical or mental
  disabilities: Families and individuals using the CalFresh ("food stamp")
  program: and persons with diabetes receiving Medi-Cal, who have been advised
  to adjust their diet to include more vegetables.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Currently participating partners include The Ecology Center, which is
  coordinating several Market Match programs statewide: SEE-LA, who operate 7
  farmers markets in Los Angeles and also administer the program: and our
  partner farmers market organizations who host the program at their markets,
  including: Certified Farmers Market Management (Gardena and Adams/Vermont):
  Harbor Area Farmers Markets (Huntington Park and Long Beach): The Greener Good
  (2 other Long Beach Markets): Model Neighborhood Program (La Cienega and
  Kaiser South Bay markets): VELA (East LA and Valinda markets): Inland Valley
  Hope Partners (Pomona), Sprouts of Promise (Monterey Park), Thai CDC (East
  Hollywood), Altadena Farmers Market, City of Compton, City of Santa Monica,
  and Mar Vista Farmers Market. We also train volunteers to help with the
  program including many obtained through partnership with Cal State LA, Cal
  State Northridge, and Cal Poly Pomona. Partners in outreach to let low income
  people know about the program include Public Health Foundation Enterprises WIC
  Program, Project Angel Food, and SOVA Jewish Food Pantry Market

      We are projecting that this project will cost $100,000. How can we be so
      certain? The flexibility of the project plan allows us to use all the
      funds while not having to exceed their limit. A fraction will be used for
      park maintenace (utility bills, park lease, rent for headquarters,
      insurance), about a quarter will be used for administrative purposes (yes,
      only that much out from this fund for two main directors), we are
      projecting half will be used to the major builing project (shipping
      containers and refurbishing), and the rest will be paid out as needed for
      workshop materials, volunteer stipends, and cultural events. We already
      have the land and human resources (many many volunteers acquired through
      22 years of networking. By the community, for the community, eliminating
      middleman fees as much as possible.
