Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Hunger Action Los Angeles will complete the following activities to expand
  Market Match throughout more portions of Los Angeles County:
   1. Expanding Market Match to 8 additional markets, with 4 located in areas Hunger Action Los Angeles does not currently serve, especially the San Fernando Valley
   2. Training current market operators; recruiting volunteers; continuing administration of program at 18 markets; conducting meetings to coordinate promotion of Market Match activities with current and future Market Match partners; 
   3. Creating specific outreach materials for seniors, families, and persons with disabilities
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Market Match makes Los Angeles a better place to live by producing the
  following benefits:
   
   1. Reduces hunger as vulnerable individuals and families acquire additional resources to obtain more food. 
   2. Improves health as Market Match coupons can only be used on healthy items such as fresh apples, asparagus, beets and broccoli, rather than prepared foods that may be high in fat, salt and sugar. 
   3. Builds community by facilitating interaction between people in an open community space.
   4. Stimulates the local economy, as participating local farmers gain revenue generated by increased sales at the farmersâ€™ market, rather than the money being sent out of state through the purchase of non-Californian produce. 
   5. Expands the local sustainable agriculture sector, improving the environment in the process.
   6. Creates connections with other nonprofit organizations working on similar issues, developing a network of readily available resources that participants can conveniently access.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The project specifically benefits the following populations: Families with
  children aged 5 and under: Seniors: Persons with physical or mental
  disabilities: Families and individuals using the CalFresh ("food stamp")
  program: and persons with diabetes receiving Medi-Cal, who have been advised
  to adjust their diet to include more vegetables.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Currently participating partners include The Ecology Center, which is
  coordinating several Market Match programs statewide: SEE-LA, who operate 7
  farmers markets in Los Angeles and also administer the program: and our
  partner farmers market organizations who host the program at their markets,

  State Northridge, and Cal Poly Pomona. Partners in outreach to let low income

  Program, Project Angel Food, and SOVA Jewish Food Pantry Market
