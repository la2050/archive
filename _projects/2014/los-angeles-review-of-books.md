title: Los Angeles Review of Books
project_summary: >-
  We have already partially succeeded in bringing a sense of community to the
  cultural life of L.A. in a new way. We are training a new generation in the
  lost art of editing. We have built something the literary, artistic, &
  intellectual community is proud to be associated with, & proud to have
  represent them. We have received extravagant praise from the larger literary
  community. The New Yorker called us “an instant jewel of the internet,” Pico
  Iyer said we are “like 1000 angels descending,” Salman Rushdie claims ours was
  the best piece of criticism written about his work, & writers Jon Robin Baitz
  & Michael Tolkin call LARB “the best literary magazine in the country.” But
  more importantly the best writers in the country want to write for us, &
  continue to come to us not only from all over L.A. County, but also from New
  York, Boston, the Midwest, the West, & overseas. We have achieved the status
  of a major voice in the cultural conversation in a remarkably short time. We
  have been recognized by the publishing industry in Publisher’s Weekly, the
  business community in Forbes, & the academic community in Chronicle of Higher
  Education, & many other venues. The accolades are based on our daily
  achievements in bringing forth smart, dynamic, beautifully written, carefully
  curated, edited, & fact-checked essays, reviews and interviews and the
  conversations that develop about them on the website. Primarily, in other
  words, our site is our achievement, an ever-growing, intelligently interlinked
  conversation on literature, art, music, film, TV, politics, new media, & the
  rest of our shared culture. We have succeeded in bringing together writers
  from around the world, bringing together new writers with top professionals,
  writers from a wide variety of different cultural worlds: literary fiction,
  SF, fantasy, mystery, thriller & other genres; the commercial publishing world
  & the nonprofit & academic worlds; the big presses and the small and the
  self-published; artists, architects, sociologists, medical researchers,
  musicians, filmmakers, scientists, & TV writers; & all of these from across a
  broad array of the immigrant communities that define L.A. We cover a much
  wider range of texts, genres, media, & topics than the traditional periodicals
  in this field, reflective of the less hierarchical, less tradition-bound
  culture of Los Angeles. While the other arts have enjoyed national prominence,
  literature & criticism have lagged. We feel we have succeeded in making people
  (including the New York publishing world) understand the importance,
  diversity, and vibrancy of the literary culture of this, the largest book
  market in the world, & in making the perspective of L.A. writers we provide
  part of the necessary reading for publishing professionals around the world.
  Our pieces are reprinted by Salon, Daily Beast, & publications in Brazil,
  Germany & elsewhere. And we have managed to begin working toward
  sustainability, increasing our income significantly.

Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  With the help of this LA2050 grant, we hope to distribute our free tabloid
  magazine to all of Los Angeles & produce a weekly half hour radio show.
   
   LA-based & LA-focused, LARB is the communal product of many hands & minds. We produce a main website (lareviewofbooks.org), updated 3 to 5 times a day with essays, reviews, & interviews, short videos, & streaming & downloadable podcasts. We also produce a quarterly journal of original content; a series of LARB Channels—associated websites sharing our mission; an intensive summer internship/educational experience; a series of live events featuring significant writers, musicians, scientists, scholars, & film & TV makers.
   
   Our tabloid magazine, published on recycled newsprint here in LA, is the size of an alternative weekly. The content ranges from fun, quick interviews with writers, artists, musicians, & filmmakers to longform literary essays to short stories & poetry by the best writers in the city, established & emerging, to features & news. We have published a number of editions for our members & have experimented with dropping at a hundred locations around the city. At small print runs of a few thousand, they were gone in an hour, to great reviews. In order to expand the literary conversation across the city’s many communities, we propose printing 20,000 copies of the tabloid each month & delivering it to 500 drops around the city & the county. We plan to build the advertising base for the tabloid over the year so that we can sustain it & make it grow.
   
   We also have begun to plan & produce a weekly half-hour radio program, with the same aim. The LARB Radio Half Hour is design to be a very new kind of book show, something that has not been done before. We have commitments from Adrian Todd Zuniga (Literary Death Match), Seth Greenland (Big Love), Maria Bustillos (journalist), Steph Cha (noir novelist), Michelle Huneven (novelist), Reza Aslan (writer), Juan Felipe Herrera (poet), & many others. The show is a variety show (rather than purely interview-based, like most books shows), & is designed to be fun as well as serious, entertaining as well as enlightening. The idea is to use this year, with the help of the LA2050 grant, to hone our format & performance, & then to continue to support it by syndicating the show nationally.
   
   The result will be an invigorated civic discourse, as the varied content of the tabloid & the radio show make their way into the daily lives of people in all parts of the city.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  LARB helps make LA the best place to create by (1) fostering the community
  from which that creativity springs, by (2) providing an ongoing conversation
  about what creativity means, & (3) by publicizing the results of that
  creativity.
   
   Arts criticism is an integral part of any balanced artistic ecology. Art doesn’t happen in a vacuum, it happens in the context of the conversations engaging viewers, audiences, & participants, conversations that are always part of any successful art world.
   
   Since everyone can now be a desktop publisher, recording artist, or film producer, criticism & conversation become even more important. The late 1970s saw some 50,000 titles published a year; now there are over three million. So more than ever criticism is necessary to help art find its audience. It is true that we have crowd sources—the web has made a torrent of information available, & a torrent of opinion, too. But on amazon or Rotten Tomatoes, many still trust the ‘editorial reviews,’ & for good reason—expertise is a real thing; curated content is a gift an editorial group can give its audience. 
   
   It is also a gift that is given to writers & artists, because the art & writing that we discuss is what our hundreds of thousands of readers learn about, pay attention to, & are more likely to purchase. This isn’t just shopping advice, though—intelligent, engaged conversation about culture is something people crave, as our worldwide success on the web has proven. In an information- & opinion-saturated world, the kind of considered, well-argued, fact-checked, vetted, & proofread work the LARB community produces is of greater value than ever.
   
   And that conversation then becomes the context in which new creative work happens. Major television producers have given our articles to their writing staffs to read—we sometimes have that direct an impact. But usually it is indirect: art happens within a conversation, & the better the conversation, often, the better the art, & the better the art is known.
   
   In 2050, LARB will have evolved in myriad ways, but LARB will still be a platform for the smartest, best conversation around, with an ongoing impact on the full range of the arts, across an even wider set of audiences. We will have continued to embrace new technologies, & our global impact will help ensure that LA can nurture and sustain its creative community.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  We work hard to bring the worlds of books, academia, film & television, the
  arts, & the common reader together, with a series of interlocking goals: to
  expand the breadth & depth of cultural discussion, give a wider part of the
  community access to arts criticism & literary production, increase cultural
  engagement, increase employment in creative industries, keep creative talent
  remain in the city, & increase the national and global "soft power" of the
  full breadth of LA's creative class.
   
   But we especially benefit writers and readers. The world has come to recognize LA’s preeminence in music, film, television, fine art, and opera. But New York continues to exercise hegemony over publishing and the literary conversation, something that has irked Western writers for a century. LARB is an important corrective, and by making LA a recognized center of literary excellence, helps all writers who call it home.
   
   It also benefits writers in material ways—for writers (& artists of other kinds) who are discussed, it provides exposure not just in Los Angeles, but around the world; LARB has millions of different readers each year, readers in all 50 states & in 150 countries around the world, more than all but two or three similar outlets in the world.
   
   The project benefits readers, of course, as a forum for lifelong learning, & in the way mentioned above. Unlike the stuffier culture reviews, we aren’t afraid to have a little fun, we aren’t averse to disagreement, we love pop culture as well as high culture, we’re interested in primetime TV as much as neuroscience, in graphic & classic & experimental novels, in YA & SF & noir & the other outré genres. We represent Los Angeles, or perhaps it is more true that we help LA represent itself. This, as discussed above, in turn helps foster creative work in many ways, & encourages its consumption.
   
   It benefits students and teachers at our local institutions of higher education by giving them access to a global forum for their work, and in fostering conversations across disciplines and across town.
   
   So far, we have spread through academic circles, & through the wealthier neighborhoods in LA. These new projects bring LARB to a wider, broader, more diverse set of communities, where we will also recruit new writers and contributors, & have these new communities bring their LA to LARB, & thereby to the rest of the city and the world.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  LARB has brought the best known & most established figures on the LA cultural
  scene together with emerging writers, thinkers, & practitioners in the fields
  of literature, art, music, politics, & cultural studies in pursuing an active
  conversation with readers all over the city, the county, the state, & beyond.
   
   For the radio show we are partnering with KPFK, which has confirmed our day and time slot, and their help as engineers. Our editor in chief has worked with KPFK several times in the past. For us, KPFK brings expertise and broadcast capacity and some audience. For KPFK, LARB brings additional audience and superb content.
   
   The three factors critical to our success are the (1) the efficient use of KPFK's resources on LARB's part, (2) the marketing efforts of both entities, and (3) making the show available for podcasting, the audience for which may end up being larger than the broadcast audience.
   
   We have partnered in the past (and in most cases are still partnered with) many organizations. The following websites are now LARB Channels: Boom, Avidly, Marginalia, Swink, The Philosopher's Plant, and The Levatine Review. We have also partnered with KCRW, KPCC, the Library Foundation, UC Riverside, USC, PEN USA, CalArts, SoHo House, Skylight Books, Tia Chucho Centro Cultural, and the Los Angeles Institute for the Humanities, as well as with a number of other literary and arts magazines, including LA Magazine, The American Reader, n+1, Flaunt, The New Inquiry, Slake, Black Clock, Triple Canopy, and others.

  Organization Name: Los Angeles Review of Books
  website: 'http://lareviewofbooks.org'
  Indicator: Arts & Cultural Vitality
  brief: >-
    We are trying to establish a major institution for cultural exchange and
    conversation, centered on an online review of arts and culture. Los
    Angeles-based and Los Angeles-focused, the Los Angeles Review of Books
    (LARB) is the communal product of many minds, including some of the best
    know and most established figures on the L.A. cultural scene, along with
    emerging L.A. writers in the fields of literature, art, music, politics, and
    cultural studies, enhanced and enlarged by the active conversation of
    readers all over the city, the county, the state, and beyond. We work hard
    to bring the worlds of publishing, academia, film and television, new media,
    art, and music together with the common reader in a fruitful, productive,
    and engaging conversation. --- In a feudal world, there is no criticism;
    only the king's taste matters. Given the cosmopolitan collection of diverse
    cultures here in Los Angeles, literature, the arts, and culture need a
    critical conversation, need to have spokespeople and champions and
    translators and critics to help cultural work find its audience, to build
    bridges among communities, and to disseminate the best that is being
    thought, written, and produced here in Los Angeles to the full range of
    local audiences and out into the larger world. --- Cultural criticism has a
    long and important history, and for the last 150 years it has taken place
    largely in a print world supported by advertising and subscription. That
    world is dying, as seen as the shuttering of book review supplements in
    almost every city in the country, and the shrinking of book and arts
    coverage elsewhere. LARB aims not just to replace these lost venues, which
    have been central to the vibrancy of American culture over the last century
    and more, but to rethink them, reinvent them using all of the new media
    tools at our disposal, making the cultural conversation more diverse, more
    interactive, and more wide-ranging, less hemmed in by traditional models. By
    merging the worlds of traditional literary publishing, academia, small
    presses, online writing, film and television, and the explosion of desktop
    production of all kinds, LARB hopes to build a big cultural tent, creating a
    space for very fragmented communities to interact and learn from each other.
    --- LARB is a daily online publication that has already, in a small way,
    begun this transformation. We are a largely volunteer organization that has
    managed to post over 1300 in-depth reviews, essays, and interviews, produced
    by a wide variety of contributors, from first-time writers to some of the
    most esteemed figures in literature, art, music, film, television, politics,
    and culture. We have already seen the impact on the morale of writers and
    readers in L.A., and we hope to increase our presence and impact, bringing
    our work to a larger audience, and a wider array of audiences, as described
    below. We also will impact the arts and culture scene through innovative
    public programming around the city, and through developing innovative
    curricula for our schools. --- In sharing culture and cultures, communities
    thrive. We are not interested in art for art's sake, or criticism for
    criticism's sake. We think that literature, art, and culture are central
    ways that a society understands itself, incubates its own progress, and
    forges its bonds across what might otherwise be divides. We hope to be a
    major partner in helping Los Angeles arts and culture continue to
    significantly enhance human development. --- We believe that all art and
    culture is both local and (at least potentially) global at the same time,
    and that a central way to ensure the continuing vitality of the L.A. arts
    and culture scene is to disseminate its work nationally and globally. We
    also believe that while the world has taken notice of L.A.'s excellence in
    classical music and art, as well as, of course film and television, it has
    been slower to recognize L.A.'s literary and critical strengths. We have
    started to have a real impact in that area and hope to do much more.
    Criticism and conversation are necessary to incubation, to nurturing, and to
    bringing literature, the arts, and culture to their largest possible
    audience, and thus to have their greatest impact, to realize their greatest
    potential.
  budget explanation: "We have an aspirational budget of $900,000/year, of which we managed to raise $125,000 our first year and $225,000 our second. Our staff is a mixture of volunteers and people on minimal consulting stipends, and although we will continue to rely on volunteers, some professional staff is necessary to insure sustainability. The budget is divided into six areas: Editorial staff: $300,000 -- Managerial, production, and technical staff: $200,000 -- Contributor payments: $250,000 -- Rent and operating expenses: $75,000 -- Development expenses: $75,000.  --- Our income includes sponsorships from universities, publishers, and other institutions, voluntary memberships at different levels; and other gifts and grants, each projected to account for roughly one-third of our total budget. The sponsorship and membership efforts have only just become, so to date, sponsorship income has accounted for 20% of income, membership 5% and gifts and grants 75% (our grantwriting is also just underway, so most of that last figure is from gifts). We are glad to provide an spreadsheet with our financial data to date and our projections for the next several years, with detailed income and expenditures.\r\n\r\nThe $100,000 grant from GOOD would be spent in the following manner: $30,000 for contributor payments, directly benefiting Los Angeles writers (this will pay for 150 to 200 reviews, essays, or interviews at $150 to $200 a piece); $15,000 to help pay for our consulting art director, directly benefiting a local artist; $35,000 to help pay editorial staff stipends, again directly benefiting Los Angeles culture workers; $20,000 for multimedia production, directly benefiting local filmmakers.  All of these workers cobble together livings from multiple sources and have an art practice of their own that these stipends help support. The Editor-in-Chief and many of the section editors and contributors who have full-time professional jobs work as volunteers and will continue to work as volunteers."
  description: >-
    LARB will provide, for the people of Los Angeles, a source of lifetime
    learning, global in scope and yet local in its perspective and in many of
    its concerns. Our website will be a meeting place for everyone interested in
    culture in all its various guises, an open forum for anyone to participate
    in. --- Our presence in local media, as in our current collaboration with
    KCRW and our work with KCET in development, will help more people become
    engaged with the literary, artistic, and intellectual life of the city.  Our
    public programming, like our current collaborations with The Broad Stage,
    LiveTalksLA, and LAPL’s ALOUD series, will continue to increase in breadth
    and frequency, bringing a series of newly conceived, multigenre performances
    to a variety of audiences, building on the work being done on our website.
    And, in turn, our national and global presence will help bring readers
    elsewhere an appreciation for L.A.’s contributions to culture; that is, we
    will post podcasts and video digests of these events on our website and our
    YouTube channel.  Our public programming will enhance the offerings the city
    already has, and our partnerships with the arts and culture organizations
    listed below, along with, we hope, partnerships with many more, will help
    integrate our famously fragmented city. --- We bring the most recondite and
    specialized research from our major universities, art schools, and colleges
    and make it accessible to anyone in the city. --- By placing the writers in
    the worlds of film and television, the literary writers, the popular genre
    writers, the academic writers, and the newspaper and magazine writers, we
    build bridges among tribes that have long kept their distance from one
    another, with benefits in all directions. --- Our work with high schools
    will help engage students with culture in many different ways. --- We will
    be a new and vigorous and innovative partner with all of the arts and
    culture organizations in town in the project of bringing the world to Los
    Angeles and Los Angeles to the world. We will help recruit, train, and
    retain the writers and critics required to keep Los Angeles the most
    important city for arts and culture in the country.
  collaborators: >-
    We collaborate, first and foremost, with the 100s of contributors and our
    100s of contributing editors, the majority of whom are L.A.-based. We are
    collaborating with our readers, whose comments are an increasingly important
    part of the site. We collaborate with a number of local arts and culture
    institutions, including the L.A. Public Library, KCRW, KCET, Broad Stage, UC
    Riverside, UC Irvine, USC, CalArts, UCHRI, Los Angeles Institute for the
    Humanities, LiveTalksLA, and PEN USA. We collaborate with publications,
    universities, and literary groups around the country, co-sponsoring events,
    doing cross-promotion on our sites and in social media. We have also started
    to work with LAUSD, a pilot program at Animo Pat Brown Charter H.S.
  success: >-
    There are 5 central measurements we use to assess how we are doing. (1) We
    will measure our readership. Although our most engaged readers are in L.A.,
    we now have readers in 150 countries and in all 50 states reading almost a
    half million pieces a month. We hope to double that each year for the next
    two years. Reaching those numbers would constitute success in this area. (2)
    We will measure the diversity of our contributors. We successfully attracted
    a wider range of writers & reviewers than any of the other most important
    reviews of books and culture; in the VIDA survey of women’s participation in
    book reviewing, for instance, our numbers are better, sometimes by a factor
    of two or three, than all the major outlets except the Women’s Review of
    Books. But we want to have much more robust representation of African
    American, Latino/a, Asian American, Persian, and other communities. We would
    measure our success by the rise in those numbers. (3) We will monitor our
    influence. Already we see publishers featuring our reviews on book covers
    and in advertisements, and see references to our pieces in NY Times, New
    Yorker, Slate, Salon, and many other newspapers, magazines, and websites. To
    see that increase would be a measure of our ability to impact the national
    cultural conversation, as would higher Google rankings of our pieces, and
    mentioned in other highly-ranked pieces. (4) We will gauge our success by
    the support we receive. Our success so far has been made possible by
    people’s willingness to support the project financially (as well as by their
    willingness to volunteer their time as editors, & by their willingness to
    donate their writing or write for a very nominal sum). Our success going
    forward can be measured by the willingness of people to financially support
    our project, making the other two less necessary. We have roughly doubled
    our contributions from our 1st year to our 2nd, & we would like to double
    again this year and next. We are starting a membership program, & the level
    of participation in the program will be an important measure of our success,
    as will the total dollars raised. (5) We will measure our success in terms
    of the support we can give to others. We believe strongly that writers
    should get paid for their work, & aim to help to reverse the damage done to
    writers’ livelihood by the decline of print periodicals. We will consider it
    a major success if we raise enough through gifts, grants, & auxiliary income
    to pay writers the rates that print book reviews have traditionally paid. We
    also would measure our success by whether we can expand our outreach in
    community programming & educational services. We hope to produce more in the
    way of radio programming, for instance, to bring our curriculum project to
    more schools, & to bring the intensive editing workshops we provide our
    interns to other high school, college students & recent graduates. If we are
    serving a broad range of L.A. communities we will consider ourselves a
    success.
  description1: >-
    We have already partially succeeded in bringing a sense of community to the
    cultural life of L.A. in a new way. We are training a new generation in the
    lost art of editing. We have built something the literary, artistic, &
    intellectual community is proud to be associated with, & proud to have
    represent them. We have received extravagant praise from the larger literary
    community. The New Yorker called us “an instant jewel of the internet,” Pico
    Iyer said we are “like 1000 angels descending,” Salman Rushdie claims ours
    was the best piece of criticism written about his work, & writers Jon Robin
    Baitz & Michael Tolkin call LARB “the best literary magazine in the
    country.” But more importantly the best writers in the country want to write
    for us, & continue to come to us not only from all over L.A. County, but
    also from New York, Boston, the Midwest, the West, & overseas. We have
    achieved the status of a major voice in the cultural conversation in a
    remarkably short time. We have been recognized by the publishing industry in
    Publisher’s Weekly, the business community in Forbes, & the academic
    community in Chronicle of Higher Education, & many other venues. The
    accolades are based on our daily achievements in bringing forth smart,
    dynamic, beautifully written, carefully curated, edited, & fact-checked
    essays, reviews and interviews and the conversations that develop about them
    on the website. Primarily, in other words, our site is our achievement, an
    ever-growing, intelligently interlinked conversation on literature, art,
    music, film, TV, politics, new media, & the rest of our shared culture. We
    have succeeded in bringing together writers from around the world, bringing
    together new writers with top professionals, writers from a wide variety of
    different cultural worlds: literary fiction, SF, fantasy, mystery, thriller
    & other genres; the commercial publishing world & the nonprofit & academic
    worlds; the big presses and the small and the self-published; artists,
    architects, sociologists, medical researchers, musicians, filmmakers,
    scientists, & TV writers; & all of these from across a broad array of the
    immigrant communities that define L.A. We cover a much wider range of texts,
    genres, media, & topics than the traditional periodicals in this field,
    reflective of the less hierarchical, less tradition-bound culture of Los
    Angeles. While the other arts have enjoyed national prominence, literature &
    criticism have lagged. We feel we have succeeded in making people (including
    the New York publishing world) understand the importance, diversity, and
    vibrancy of the literary culture of this, the largest book market in the
    world, & in making the perspective of L.A. writers we provide part of the
    necessary reading for publishing professionals around the world. Our pieces
    are reprinted by Salon, Daily Beast, & publications in Brazil, Germany &
    elsewhere. And we have managed to begin working toward sustainability,
    increasing our income significantly. 
  description3: >-
    We don't feel we are in competition with any other groups; although
    individual artists may be in competition for grants or audience, and
    although we may hope to someday be recognized as a more influential review
    of books and culture than those traditionally recognized as having the
    greatest cultural impact, these competitive moments are secondary. Art,
    literature, and culture are fundamentally communal, cooperative activities,
    and criticism even more so.  We work together with, rather than compete
    against, other literary, arts, and culture organizations, as outlined in the
    discussion of collaborators above. We think of the reviews in other outlets,
    for instance, as being not in competition with ours, but in conversation
    with them. --- In terms of our competition for this grant, we feel we are
    particularly worthy of support because what we do has a positive impact on
    virtually every other potential grantee. Publicizing their work is a central
    part of what we do. We also feel that, although we chose Arts & Cultural
    Vitality as our prime indicator, we also have impact in the fields of
    Education, Social Connectedness, and Income and Employment, and through all
    four of these, Health.  
  vision: >-
    Los Angeles would be a city with a more vibrant, a more inclusive, a more
    intelligently discussed and more widely, globally appreciated cultural
    scene. The different literary communities, from the graphic novel readers
    and writers, the electronic culture producers and consumers, to the TV,
    film, and new media writers and users, to the academic researchers in all
    fields of the humanities and sciences, across all races and ethnic groups,
    and across all of the arts, would have at their disposal a responsive,
    innovative, interactive forum, a "publication" that would bridge the
    academic and popular, the local and the global, and the traditional and the
    new. LARB will have kept on the cutting edge of any new technologies useful
    to its mission and its readers. LARB will have helped keep alive the fine
    arts of editing, proofreading, and fact-checking, and will continue training
    new generations in them. LARB will have developed multiple platforms for use
    in instruction from the early grades through graduate colleges. The best
    that is being thought and written and produced in 2050 would be finding its
    maximum audience. LARB will have established itself as among the very few
    leading forums for arts and culture in the world. And instead of losing
    ground, as predicted in the GOOD report, Los Angeles, through the vitality
    of its literature, arts, and culture, will have increased its ability to
    enhance human development, both in the city and county, and far beyond.

    answer: Arts & Cultural Vitality

    answer: >-
      We are trying to establish a major institution for cultural exchange and
      conversation, centered on an online review of arts and culture. Los
      Angeles-based and Los Angeles-focused, the Los Angeles Review of Books
      (LARB) is the communal product of many minds, including some of the best
      know and most established figures on the L.A. cultural scene, along with
      emerging L.A. writers in the fields of literature, art, music, politics,
      and cultural studies, enhanced and enlarged by the active conversation of
      readers all over the city, the county, the state, and beyond. We work hard
      to bring the worlds of publishing, academia, film and television, new
      media, art, and music together with the common reader in a fruitful,
      productive, and engaging conversation. --- In a feudal world, there is no
      criticism; only the king's taste matters. Given the cosmopolitan
      collection of diverse cultures here in Los Angeles, literature, the arts,
      and culture need a critical conversation, need to have spokespeople and
      champions and translators and critics to help cultural work find its
      audience, to build bridges among communities, and to disseminate the best
      that is being thought, written, and produced here in Los Angeles to the
      full range of local audiences and out into the larger world. --- Cultural
      criticism has a long and important history, and for the last 150 years it
      has taken place largely in a print world supported by advertising and
      subscription. That world is dying, as seen as the shuttering of book
      review supplements in almost every city in the country, and the shrinking
      of book and arts coverage elsewhere. LARB aims not just to replace these
      lost venues, which have been central to the vibrancy of American culture
      over the last century and more, but to rethink them, reinvent them using
      all of the new media tools at our disposal, making the cultural
      conversation more diverse, more interactive, and more wide-ranging, less
      hemmed in by traditional models. By merging the worlds of traditional
      literary publishing, academia, small presses, online writing, film and
      television, and the explosion of desktop production of all kinds, LARB
      hopes to build a big cultural tent, creating a space for very fragmented
      communities to interact and learn from each other. --- LARB is a daily
      online publication that has already, in a small way, begun this
      transformation. We are a largely volunteer organization that has managed
      to post over 1300 in-depth reviews, essays, and interviews, produced by a
      wide variety of contributors, from first-time writers to some of the most
      esteemed figures in literature, art, music, film, television, politics,
      and culture. We have already seen the impact on the morale of writers and
      readers in L.A., and we hope to increase our presence and impact, bringing
      our work to a larger audience, and a wider array of audiences, as
      described below. We also will impact the arts and culture scene through
      innovative public programming around the city, and through developing
      innovative curricula for our schools. --- In sharing culture and cultures,
      communities thrive. We are not interested in art for art's sake, or
      criticism for criticism's sake. We think that literature, art, and culture
      are central ways that a society understands itself, incubates its own
      progress, and forges its bonds across what might otherwise be divides. We
      hope to be a major partner in helping Los Angeles arts and culture
      continue to significantly enhance human development. --- We believe that
      all art and culture is both local and (at least potentially) global at the
      same time, and that a central way to ensure the continuing vitality of the
      L.A. arts and culture scene is to disseminate its work nationally and
      globally. We also believe that while the world has taken notice of L.A.'s
      excellence in classical music and art, as well as, of course film and
      television, it has been slower to recognize L.A.'s literary and critical
      strengths. We have started to have a real impact in that area and hope to
      do much more. Criticism and conversation are necessary to incubation, to
      nurturing, and to bringing literature, the arts, and culture to their
      largest possible audience, and thus to have their greatest impact, to
      realize their greatest potential.

    answer: "We have an aspirational budget of $900,000/year, of which we managed to raise $125,000 our first year and $225,000 our second. Our staff is a mixture of volunteers and people on minimal consulting stipends, and although we will continue to rely on volunteers, some professional staff is necessary to insure sustainability. The budget is divided into six areas: Editorial staff: $300,000 -- Managerial, production, and technical staff: $200,000 -- Contributor payments: $250,000 -- Rent and operating expenses: $75,000 -- Development expenses: $75,000.  --- Our income includes sponsorships from universities, publishers, and other institutions, voluntary memberships at different levels; and other gifts and grants, each projected to account for roughly one-third of our total budget. The sponsorship and membership efforts have only just become, so to date, sponsorship income has accounted for 20% of income, membership 5% and gifts and grants 75% (our grantwriting is also just underway, so most of that last figure is from gifts). We are glad to provide an spreadsheet with our financial data to date and our projections for the next several years, with detailed income and expenditures.\r\n\r\nThe $100,000 grant from GOOD would be spent in the following manner: $30,000 for contributor payments, directly benefiting Los Angeles writers (this will pay for 150 to 200 reviews, essays, or interviews at $150 to $200 a piece); $15,000 to help pay for our consulting art director, directly benefiting a local artist; $35,000 to help pay editorial staff stipends, again directly benefiting Los Angeles culture workers; $20,000 for multimedia production, directly benefiting local filmmakers.  All of these workers cobble together livings from multiple sources and have an art practice of their own that these stipends help support. The Editor-in-Chief and many of the section editors and contributors who have full-time professional jobs work as volunteers and will continue to work as volunteers."

      LARB will provide, for the people of Los Angeles, a source of lifetime
      learning, global in scope and yet local in its perspective and in many of
      its concerns. Our website will be a meeting place for everyone interested
      in culture in all its various guises, an open forum for anyone to
      participate in. --- Our presence in local media, as in our current
      collaboration with KCRW and our work with KCET in development, will help
      more people become engaged with the literary, artistic, and intellectual
      life of the city.  Our public programming, like our current collaborations
      with The Broad Stage, LiveTalksLA, and LAPL’s ALOUD series, will continue
      to increase in breadth and frequency, bringing a series of newly
      conceived, multigenre performances to a variety of audiences, building on
      the work being done on our website. And, in turn, our national and global
      presence will help bring readers elsewhere an appreciation for L.A.’s
      contributions to culture; that is, we will post podcasts and video digests
      of these events on our website and our YouTube channel.  Our public
      programming will enhance the offerings the city already has, and our
      partnerships with the arts and culture organizations listed below, along
      with, we hope, partnerships with many more, will help integrate our
      famously fragmented city. --- We bring the most recondite and specialized
      research from our major universities, art schools, and colleges and make
      it accessible to anyone in the city. --- By placing the writers in the
      worlds of film and television, the literary writers, the popular genre
      writers, the academic writers, and the newspaper and magazine writers, we
      build bridges among tribes that have long kept their distance from one
      another, with benefits in all directions. --- Our work with high schools
      will help engage students with culture in many different ways. --- We will
      be a new and vigorous and innovative partner with all of the arts and
      culture organizations in town in the project of bringing the world to Los
      Angeles and Los Angeles to the world. We will help recruit, train, and
      retain the writers and critics required to keep Los Angeles the most
      important city for arts and culture in the country.

      We collaborate, first and foremost, with the 100s of contributors and our
      100s of contributing editors, the majority of whom are L.A.-based. We are
      collaborating with our readers, whose comments are an increasingly
      important part of the site. We collaborate with a number of local arts and
      culture institutions, including the L.A. Public Library, KCRW, KCET, Broad
      Stage, UC Riverside, UC Irvine, USC, CalArts, UCHRI, Los Angeles Institute
      for the Humanities, LiveTalksLA, and PEN USA. We collaborate with
      publications, universities, and literary groups around the country,
      co-sponsoring events, doing cross-promotion on our sites and in social
      media. We have also started to work with LAUSD, a pilot program at Animo
      Pat Brown Charter H.S.

      There are 5 central measurements we use to assess how we are doing. (1) We
      will measure our readership. Although our most engaged readers are in
      L.A., we now have readers in 150 countries and in all 50 states reading
      almost a half million pieces a month. We hope to double that each year for
      the next two years. Reaching those numbers would constitute success in
      this area. (2) We will measure the diversity of our contributors. We
      successfully attracted a wider range of writers & reviewers than any of
      the other most important reviews of books and culture; in the VIDA survey
      of women’s participation in book reviewing, for instance, our numbers are
      better, sometimes by a factor of two or three, than all the major outlets
      except the Women’s Review of Books. But we want to have much more robust
      representation of African American, Latino/a, Asian American, Persian, and
      other communities. We would measure our success by the rise in those
      numbers. (3) We will monitor our influence. Already we see publishers
      featuring our reviews on book covers and in advertisements, and see
      references to our pieces in NY Times, New Yorker, Slate, Salon, and many
      other newspapers, magazines, and websites. To see that increase would be a
      measure of our ability to impact the national cultural conversation, as
      would higher Google rankings of our pieces, and mentioned in other
      highly-ranked pieces. (4) We will gauge our success by the support we
      receive. Our success so far has been made possible by people’s willingness
      to support the project financially (as well as by their willingness to
      volunteer their time as editors, & by their willingness to donate their
      writing or write for a very nominal sum). Our success going forward can be
      measured by the willingness of people to financially support our project,
      making the other two less necessary. We have roughly doubled our
      contributions from our 1st year to our 2nd, & we would like to double
      again this year and next. We are starting a membership program, & the
      level of participation in the program will be an important measure of our
      success, as will the total dollars raised. (5) We will measure our success
      in terms of the support we can give to others. We believe strongly that
      writers should get paid for their work, & aim to help to reverse the
      damage done to writers’ livelihood by the decline of print periodicals. We
      will consider it a major success if we raise enough through gifts, grants,
      & auxiliary income to pay writers the rates that print book reviews have
      traditionally paid. We also would measure our success by whether we can
      expand our outreach in community programming & educational services. We
      hope to produce more in the way of radio programming, for instance, to
      bring our curriculum project to more schools, & to bring the intensive
      editing workshops we provide our interns to other high school, college
      students & recent graduates. If we are serving a broad range of L.A.
      communities we will consider ourselves a success.

      We have already partially succeeded in bringing a sense of community to
      the cultural life of L.A. in a new way. We are training a new generation
      in the lost art of editing. We have built something the literary,
      artistic, & intellectual community is proud to be associated with, & proud
      to have represent them. We have received extravagant praise from the
      larger literary community. The New Yorker called us “an instant jewel of
      the internet,” Pico Iyer said we are “like 1000 angels descending,” Salman
      Rushdie claims ours was the best piece of criticism written about his
      work, & writers Jon Robin Baitz & Michael Tolkin call LARB “the best
      literary magazine in the country.” But more importantly the best writers
      in the country want to write for us, & continue to come to us not only
      from all over L.A. County, but also from New York, Boston, the Midwest,
      the West, & overseas. We have achieved the status of a major voice in the
      cultural conversation in a remarkably short time. We have been recognized
      by the publishing industry in Publisher’s Weekly, the business community
      in Forbes, & the academic community in Chronicle of Higher Education, &
      many other venues. The accolades are based on our daily achievements in
      bringing forth smart, dynamic, beautifully written, carefully curated,
      edited, & fact-checked essays, reviews and interviews and the
      conversations that develop about them on the website. Primarily, in other
      words, our site is our achievement, an ever-growing, intelligently
      interlinked conversation on literature, art, music, film, TV, politics,
      new media, & the rest of our shared culture. We have succeeded in bringing
      together writers from around the world, bringing together new writers with
      top professionals, writers from a wide variety of different cultural
      worlds: literary fiction, SF, fantasy, mystery, thriller & other genres;
      the commercial publishing world & the nonprofit & academic worlds; the big
      presses and the small and the self-published; artists, architects,
      sociologists, medical researchers, musicians, filmmakers, scientists, & TV
      writers; & all of these from across a broad array of the immigrant
      communities that define L.A. We cover a much wider range of texts, genres,
      media, & topics than the traditional periodicals in this field, reflective
      of the less hierarchical, less tradition-bound culture of Los Angeles.
      While the other arts have enjoyed national prominence, literature &
      criticism have lagged. We feel we have succeeded in making people
      (including the New York publishing world) understand the importance,
      diversity, and vibrancy of the literary culture of this, the largest book
      market in the world, & in making the perspective of L.A. writers we
      provide part of the necessary reading for publishing professionals around
      the world. Our pieces are reprinted by Salon, Daily Beast, & publications
      in Brazil, Germany & elsewhere. And we have managed to begin working
      toward sustainability, increasing our income significantly.

      We don't feel we are in competition with any other groups; although
      individual artists may be in competition for grants or audience, and
      although we may hope to someday be recognized as a more influential review
      of books and culture than those traditionally recognized as having the
      greatest cultural impact, these competitive moments are secondary. Art,
      literature, and culture are fundamentally communal, cooperative
      activities, and criticism even more so.  We work together with, rather
      than compete against, other literary, arts, and culture organizations, as
      outlined in the discussion of collaborators above. We think of the reviews
      in other outlets, for instance, as being not in competition with ours, but
      in conversation with them. --- In terms of our competition for this grant,
      we feel we are particularly worthy of support because what we do has a
      positive impact on virtually every other potential grantee. Publicizing
      their work is a central part of what we do. We also feel that, although we
      chose Arts & Cultural Vitality as our prime indicator, we also have impact
      in the fields of Education, Social Connectedness, and Income and
      Employment, and through all four of these, Health.

      Los Angeles would be a city with a more vibrant, a more inclusive, a more
      intelligently discussed and more widely, globally appreciated cultural
      scene. The different literary communities, from the graphic novel readers
      and writers, the electronic culture producers and consumers, to the TV,
      film, and new media writers and users, to the academic researchers in all
      fields of the humanities and sciences, across all races and ethnic groups,
      and across all of the arts, would have at their disposal a responsive,
      innovative, interactive forum, a "publication" that would bridge the
      academic and popular, the local and the global, and the traditional and
      the new. LARB will have kept on the cutting edge of any new technologies
      useful to its mission and its readers. LARB will have helped keep alive
      the fine arts of editing, proofreading, and fact-checking, and will
      continue training new generations in them. LARB will have developed
      multiple platforms for use in instruction from the early grades through
      graduate colleges. The best that is being thought and written and produced
      in 2050 would be finding its maximum audience. LARB will have established
      itself as among the very few leading forums for arts and culture in the
      world. And instead of losing ground, as predicted in the GOOD report, Los
      Angeles, through the vitality of its literature, arts, and culture, will
      have increased its ability to enhance human development, both in the city
      and county, and far beyond.
