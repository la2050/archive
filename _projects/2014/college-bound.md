  who_benefit: >-
    We currently provides support services and case management to over 1400
    students in grades six through twelve.  College Bound staff work closely
    with and advocate for Club members to ensure that students are enrolled in
    the correct courses for high school graduation and college acceptance.  This
    is a much-needed resource when almost half of the graduates in these
    communities do not have the required courses.  Program staff works with
    students individually to identify educational and career goals.  Each
    student receives assistance throughout the search and application processes
    related to college admission and scholarships.

    College Bound’s current goals are to increase the high school graduation and
    college acceptance rates of youth in Los Angeles Harbor communities.
    Objectives are to: (1) serve a minimum of 1,500 youth (4th to 12th grade)
    each year; (2) maintain a 90% graduation rate of participants; and (3) have
    90% of graduates accepted into colleges and universities.
  two_lessons: "One, our success in the program in its 12 years of existence.\r\nTwo, the success of program participants in attending and graduating from college and becoming successful members of the work force."
  achievable_goal: "The major factor preventing further expansion of the College Bound project is a lack of resources that would enable further replication of the program beyond our current boundaries. Specifically we need additional staff to reach out to other organizations, provide the initial training required to implement the program, and monitor the remote\r\nlocation and assist as needed."
  major_challenges: "The first challenge is obtaining a commitment from other organizations to take the step to provide the program for their members. Fortunately the success of the program has created a demand for the College Bound program. We will further recruit other organizations with the additional resources available from the grant.\r\n\r\nThe second potential challenge is that of supporting the ongoing program at other locations. Again, additional resources will enable us to provide the necessary support."
  competition: >-
    There are other college pathway services available to youth today, but none
    provide the comprehensive support College Bound offers, not have others
    achieved the same level of success.
  cost: "Our total budget for our College Bound program is $1,422,470. To add two additional College Bound Outreach Coordinators (@$40,000ea) and one Outreach Coordinator Assistant (@$35,000)\r\nwill cost us an additional $115,000. We will provide additional $15,000\r\nfrom the College Bound operating budget should we receive the $100,000 grant."
  budget: "2- Outreach Coordinators                  $80,000\r\n1- Outreach Coordinator Assistant   $35,000 \r\n            Total                                               $115,000"

    Just 12 years ago, half of our teen Club members were not graduating – in
    June 2013, 98% graduated on time and 97% of those are going onto 4-year
    universities or community colleges.  “College Bound” operates Monday –
    Saturday to provide the comprehensive activities and services necessary to
    fully engage these most at-risk youth.  The Boys & Girls Clubs of the Los
    Angeles Harbor is committed to providing these future college graduates with
    the skills, tools, support and experiences they need to succeed in high
    school and beyond.
