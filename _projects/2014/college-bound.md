Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  We currently support 14 other boys and girls clubs in Los Angeles County in
  their efforts to implement our College Bound program, Further, we support 41
  other organizations across the US. By adding additional resources we will help
  implement and support College Bound in the other Clubs in the Los Angeles area
  and
   other interested organizations.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Since we created and implemented the College Bound program in 2002, we have
  seen the high school graduation rates of our members
   improve from less than 50% to 98% in 2013. Of these graduates, 97%
   enrolled in a 2 or 4 year college/university this past fall.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  We currently provides support services and case management to over 1400
  students in grades six through twelve. College Bound staff work closely with
  and advocate for Club members to ensure that students are enrolled in the
  correct courses for high school graduation and college acceptance. This is a
  much-needed resource when almost half of the graduates in these communities do
  not have the required courses. Program staff works with students individually
  to identify educational and career goals. Each student receives assistance
  throughout the search and application processes related to college admission
  and scholarships.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Our primarily partnership is with other Boys & Girls Clubs, although we also
  partner with the Los Angeles Unified School District and currently serve youth
  on eleven LAUSD school sites.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: ''

    Just 12 years ago, half of our teen Club members were not graduating – in
    June 2013, 98% graduated on time and 97% of those are going onto 4-year
    universities or community colleges.  “College Bound” operates Monday –
    Saturday to provide the comprehensive activities and services necessary to
    fully engage these most at-risk youth.  The Boys & Girls Clubs of the Los
    Angeles Harbor is committed to providing these future college graduates with
    the skills, tools, support and experiences they need to succeed in high
    school and beyond.

    College Bound’s current goals are to increase the high school graduation and
    college acceptance rates of youth in Los Angeles Harbor communities.
    Objectives are to: (1) serve a minimum of 1,500 youth (4th to 12th grade)
    each year; (2) maintain a 90% graduation rate of participants; and (3) have
    90% of graduates accepted into colleges and universities.
  two_lessons: "One, our success in the program in its 12 years of existence.\r\nTwo, the success of program participants in attending and graduating from college and becoming successful members of the work force."
  achievable_goal: "The major factor preventing further expansion of the College Bound project is a lack of resources that would enable further replication of the program beyond our current boundaries. Specifically we need additional staff to reach out to other organizations, provide the initial training required to implement the program, and monitor the remote\r\nlocation and assist as needed."
  major_challenges: "The first challenge is obtaining a commitment from other organizations to take the step to provide the program for their members. Fortunately the success of the program has created a demand for the College Bound program. We will further recruit other organizations with the additional resources available from the grant.\r\n\r\nThe second potential challenge is that of supporting the ongoing program at other locations. Again, additional resources will enable us to provide the necessary support."
