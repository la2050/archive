Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  We currently support 14 other boys and girls clubs in Los Angeles County in
  their efforts to implement our College Bound program, Further, we support 41
  other organizations across the US. By adding additional resources we will help
  implement and support College Bound in the other Clubs in the Los Angeles area
  and
   other interested organizations.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Since we created and implemented the College Bound program in 2002, we have
  seen the high school graduation rates of our members
   improve from less than 50% to 98% in 2013. Of these graduates, 97%
   enrolled in a 2 or 4 year college/university this past fall.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  We currently provides support services and case management to over 1400
  students in grades six through twelve. College Bound staff work closely with
  and advocate for Club members to ensure that students are enrolled in the
  correct courses for high school graduation and college acceptance. This is a
  much-needed resource when almost half of the graduates in these communities do
  not have the required courses. Program staff works with students individually
  to identify educational and career goals. Each student receives assistance
  throughout the search and application processes related to college admission
  and scholarships.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Our primarily partnership is with other Boys & Girls Clubs, although we also
  partner with the Los Angeles Unified School District and currently serve youth
  on eleven LAUSD school sites.
