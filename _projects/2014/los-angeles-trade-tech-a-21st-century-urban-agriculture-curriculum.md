    This project touches upon many localized quality of life virtues including
    education, health, social connectivity, creativity, cultural vitality, and
    microeconomics. This workforce development initiative is tasked to design
    and build four site-specific constructs for growing food in South LA. It
    includes hands-on teaching, internships, small business accounting, and
    incubation support to culinary students working with restaurants.  The
    curriculum will assess various logistics including economic potential,
    environmental factoring, and collective social impact, while determining the
    feasibility of urban ag applications on rooftops and on vacant lots. The
    information gathered from this process will be made available to the public
    for free.
  implement: "The implementation strategy involves a year-round semester-based curriculum program, made fiscally sustainable by generating revenue by selling produce through local food vendors including farmers markets, schools, and restaurants.  \r\nThe LATTC Urban Farming Project will build and retrofit four sites that will include the District 9 Central Avenue Field Office rooftop, LATTC campus “Magnolia” Farm at ground level, and a mezzanine level LATTC “Terrance” Farm. In addition, students will also build four experimental yet functional art constructs to grow food, selected based on feasibility from twelve digitized, virtual art constructs. The art constructs to grow food incorporate both hydroponics and soil-based planters: vertical walls, movable green towers, raised beds, and a green house. The goal is to challenge the students’ creativity, while simultaneously creating something functional and unique.\r\nPlan of Action-\r\n-Expand training and outreach to the community\r\n-Provide direct community support by providing project templates \r\n-Engage local drivers and forces by integrating their resources, i.e. Plan for Healthy LA, Green Streets LA, Food Policy Council, etc.\r\n-Advance the urban farming design build field by providing virtualization and templates ready to use\r\n-Introduce and integrate to existing practices at LATTC\r\n-Support a new interdisciplinary LATTC ASO Club for Sustainability\r\n-Explore the possibility and implementation to design and build innovative solutions for community's to grow food on their own\r\n-Analyze interdisciplinary capabilities and relationships between multiple departments and disciplines to grow local food using innovative design strategies for food productivity, products, tools, green house shelters and energy/water calculations.  \r\n-Use high-end tools to virtualize, simulate, verify and locally manufacture design build solutions; digital fabrication, geospatial tools, enterprise solutions, social media and others.\r\n-Develop a business model to implement urban farming and education with quantifiable outcomes.\r\n-Develop and implement multiple design templates drawings to build prototype\r\n-Develop and implement an online platform for collaboration, hybrid learning and frictionless participation by all stakeholders\r\n-Show return of investment for low water, high productivity and small space for multiple design solutions and techniques; aquaponics, hydroponics, vertical walls, etc.\r\n-Build prototypes on sites physically and digitally"

    LATTC Urban Farming program will design, build and teach innovative Urban
    Farming applications in colleges, homes, communities, businesses, and
    restaurants. This program will explore the interdepartmental potential and
    capabilities of the college to better serve our communities. This program
    will use digital, parametric virtualization for visualization, strategic
    planning, communication and green solutions for the use of water, sun, air
    and soil. The program will work close with local drivers, stakeholders and
    forces in the city to facilitate scalable and duplicable solutions in the
    local and global ‘green economy’.  This program will explore local
    manufacturing by using digital fabrication and biomimicry design. As the
    program grows, the design and build templates will be available for the
    community via iTUNES University, YouTube and interfaces. This new classroom
    material will be user friendly and easily implemented locally and in other
    parts of the world. LATTC Urban Farming projects will show return on
    investment with high productivity, small spaces, low water usage and a
    community that thrives. It will support lesson plans for existing courses in
    Architecture, Drafting, Sustainable Landscaping, Plumbing, Photovoltaics,
    Manufacturing, Culinary Courses and others. It will also ultimately seek
    transferability status to programs like UCLA, USC, CalPoly, and others.
  who_benefit: "Many urban areas in Central and South Los Angeles do not have sufficient access to groceries stores, yet are overrun with fast food eateries and convenience/liquor stores.  Their choices of diet are limited and it is difficult, costly, and time consuming to obtain wholesome fruits and vegetables. There is a growing plague of obesity and diabetes in America and other countries that have adopted the habit of relying on the dominance of pre-prepared foods.  Overworked mothers often do not have the choice of feeding their families plant, fruit, enzyme and mineral rich, traditional meals. Half the nutrition in vegetables is lost within a day of being picked. Urban agriculture would provide these families with choices, develop a deeper understanding of health, and offer the joy of a living and growing relationship to our source of nutrition, in these concrete landscape environments. Additionally, the potential for personal and public savings on healthcare, a community that encourages better decisions through hands on lessons in cultivating life, and the possibility of entrepreneurial endeavors would only serve to benefit us all. \r\nLos Angeles is a 21st century mega-city with over 4 million citizens (10 million in LA County), the food shed of which extends 200 miles. Astonishingly enough, rooftops amount to 20% of the land mass occupying exposed space in Los Angeles. Many of these spaces are functionally dormant, and serve as heat islands in a city burdened with enough environmental challenges as it is. Additionally, there are ten thousand vacant parcels that benefit no one except absentee landlords or developers not from the community. All these spaces are primed for agricultural activation, and upcoming legislative packages are finally beginning to incentivize the involvement of micro-enterprise to do so.\r\n"
  partners_collaboration: "Confirmed Partners/Collaborators-\r\n\r\nCouncilmember Curren Price, 9th District\r\nCouncilmember Price has been very supportive of this endeavor by giving us the roof of his field office headquarters to grow food on, and by consistently championing equitable urban ag policy.\r\n\r\nLos Angeles Open Acres\r\nThe LA Open Acres project is launching soon, and a relationship is in place whereby Trade Tech lends its built-environment infrastructure support to increase the capacity and breadth of upcoming parcel activations.\r\n\r\nEvoFarm\r\nA consulting partnership has been developed with David Rosenstein, who recently gave a presentation on his innovative homemade aquaponics program at Trade Tech.\r\n\r\nLA Conservation Corps\r\nBruce Saito's remarkable organization is a curriculum partner.\r\n\r\nSocial Justice Learning Institute\r\nAnother joint-curriculum partner.\r\n\r\nRivera Restaurant / Museum Tamal\r\nCulinary students will learn to grow food hydroponically, and in top-level settings, come to understand how to best use it.\r\n\r\nMetabolic Studio\r\nAn in-kind partner, the Studio has been supportive by providing materials and offering resources.\r\n\r\n\r\nNon-Confirmed Partners/Collaborators-\r\n\r\nToo many to list... really.\r\n\r\n\r\nThree factors critical to collaborative success-\r\n1-Site locations (done)\r\n2-Mutually beneficial resource exchange (agreed)\r\n3-Funding (Hmm...)\r\n"

  evaluate: "One of the methods to evaluate success of this project is to compare on a yearly basis health indicators for example the rate of obesity or the number of heart disease. If these are decreasing then this project, (although this project may not be the only factor contributing to this improvement in people’s health), can be consider to be successful.\r\n\r\nAlso if the number of urban farms keeps growing and there are more and more stories of people speaking about the positive contribution of their farms to their health, then it can be said that this is also a metric that indicates success. \r\n\r\nThe other measure that will indicate success of this project is the therapeutic nature of growing plants, people are healthier when they are close to plants and nature. It is our expectation that this project will contribute to decrease in violence and quite possibly a reduction on homicides and this can be tracked by comparing the numbers on a yearly basis.\r\n"
  two_lessons: "The first lesson which has informed our project is that the production of food and the way we deal with food through processed foods and fast food restaurants is not sustainable and has led to unhealthy communities, as seen in the increased rates of obesity, and needs to be addressed in a lifestyle change. \r\n\r\nThe second  lesson which has informed our project is that solutions to community needs can only come from within the community and through their own efforts, our projects plants a seed but the community will adopt and make their own and care for it to really make a change in the community.\r\n"
  achievable_goal: >-
    Implementing our project within the next twelve month is an achievable goal
    because of thorough strategic planning, coalition building, and because it’s
    based on a four-semester cycle. We have broad moral and operational support
    from the community, college administrators, policymakers, and LA’s urban
    farmers.
  major_challenges: >-
    The biggest challenges are to institutionalize the program and to provide an
    easily accessible and understandable transparent allocation of funds. The
    good news is that our College and District are moving towards open
    government and transparency in all their procedures, and our new President
    Larry Frank is very supportive of innovative thinking, local workforces, and
    improving students' quality of life.
  competition: >-
    Although there are agriculture curriculums throughout the country, there
    aren’t any that address the multitude of specific challenges to growing food
    in a harsh, urban environment such as Los Angeles. In addition to
    conventional ag instruction like soil science, the Trade Tech Urban Ag
    Curriculum will explore other facets just as crucial to growing food in LA.
    These explorations will include site-specific hydroponics (i.e. rooftop
    aquaponics), rain-water harvesting and water collection, which edible plants
    most reduce air particulate matter or mitigate heat-island effect, and how
    to affordably construct a rooftop solar greenhouse that can withstand 70-80
    mph winds. These aforementioned objectives collectively address the unique
    nature of growing food here in LA along with its challenges.
  cost: >-
    We estimate that what's been proposed will cost $100k, give or take $5k.
    There are vast in-kind resources that we have available which would normally
    make it a significantly higher figure. 
  budget: "-Student Interns $45,000\r\n-Curriculum Leaders $25,000\r\n-Supplies $25,000\r\n-Administration $5,000\r\n"

    Our chosen goal is ushering life into a healthier LA, by promoting “food
    economy that promotes wellness and health” by converting existing sites into
    chemical-free urban farms that serve as agricultural and culinary learning
    centers as well as activity space. Community stakeholders will have
    increased access to localized organic food sources while engaging with
    others whom enjoy growing and creating as much as they do.

  Seafood for the Future (SFF) works at all levels of the supply chain to bring
  about change, generates public awareness of ocean issues, and helps consumers
  make responsible choices about seafood that support family budgets, local
  economies, and our ocean ecosystem. We have successful partnerships with
  chefs, restaurants, fisheries, and distributors, and while we will continue to
  grow the business advisory aspect of our program, our focus now is on
  generating tools for the consumer. 
   
   Ultimately, the consumer controls the demand for seafood. By empowering the public with the knowledge and tools they need to make healthy, responsible seafood choices, we can shift the demand in favor of sustainable seafood options, healthier communities, and abundant ocean ecosystems.
   
   To do this, we need to educate the public about the health and economic benefits of eating a variety of seafood. Our consumer platform will create a number of new digital resources, our community’s preferred source of educational and consumer information, in collaboration with a nutrition expert and local chefs. 
   
   1. Instructional cooking videos and easy recipes for healthy seafood meals for busy, budget conscious families.
   2. A podcast series that discusses the future of seafood and how our food choices are affecting the ocean and local L.A. seafood communities from fisherman, to restaurants, to consumers.
   3. A social media campaign that catalogs recipes for healthy, affordable seafood meals contributed and reviewed by the public.
   4. An expanded web tool that showcases local restaurants and businesses providing seafood from responsible sources. Participating businesses will label responsible seafood items with the SFF California Local icon.
   
   Videos will be produced by the Aquarium's award-winning audio visual production team, which has won 14 international Telly awards. We will use existing relationships within the seafood industry in Southern California (chefs, fishermen, aquaculture farmers, scientists, and government and non-government organizations) to provide content for podcasts. The Aquarium's marketing department will inform and promote the social media campaign and digital resources to 1.5 million onsite visitors and 3 million visitors to the website annually.
   
   Seafood for the Future is a non-profit seafood advisory program based at the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, the second most-visited cultural destination in Los Angeles County.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  In Los Angeles, the urban ocean is one-of-a-kind. Its beauty attracts people
  from around the world in search of inspiration, adventure, and rejuvenation.
  It offers an uncharacteristically forgiving oceanography, and the
  second-largest port system in the world, supporting local, national, and
  global economies. The ocean regulates our weather, supplies our food and
  medicines, and sustains all life on the planet. 
   
   But the ocean is in a state of duress–overfishing, bycatch, and habitat damage are threatening the health of our ocean and seafood supply. We have the opportunity and the responsibility, especially in Los Angeles, a coastal metropolis and one of the largest economies in the world, to model a balanced approach to seafood consumption that is healthy for people, communities, and the planet.
   
   The United States has the largest Exclusive Economic Zone (the area extending from the coastline out 200 miles) of any nation on Earth. And, the United States is a global leader in sustainable fishing—our fisheries are some of the best managed in the world. Yet 91% of our seafood is imported, (mostly farmed tilapia and shrimp that provide fewer nutrients), while we export a third of our heart healthy, omega-rich, sustainably-fished and farmed seafood. 
   
   Seafood is an important part of a healthy diet and Americans do not eat enough. With easy-to-use digital tools and access to educational resources, the public can make affordable, nutrient-rich, local sustainable seafood choices today. Consumers have the power to influence sourcing with our wallets, and Seafood for the Future’s new tools will guide consumer decision-making all the way from the grocery store to the dinner table.
   
   In 2050, we envision a new relationship between humans and the ocean–one that sustains healthy, abundant ecosystems and economies. Our ocean is resilient, and given the chance, marine species can recover from over-fishing. Since 1999, with a stringent U.S. protection plan and international cooperation, the swordfish population has nearly fully recovered from a state of severe depletion to healthy levels. By 2050, with low consumer demand, better management of fisheries, and conservation efforts in place, we can rebuild the population of many more threatened species while supporting a rapidly growing population (expected to be 9 billion by 2050) with access to healthy, nutrient-rich, and affordable seafood options.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Eating the right types of seafood is healthy for people and the planet. It
  will require a balanced approach that includes seafood from well-managed
  fisheries, responsible aquaculture, and imports from sustainable sources. This
  approach to seafood consumption will reduce pressure on wild stocks, promote
  ecologically responsible aquaculture, and reduce our climate impacts by
  balancing imports with local seafood sources. 
   
   Consumers: Seafood is a healthy source of heart-healthy Omega-3 fatty acids, low-fat protein, and a variety of vitamins and minerals. The U.S. FDA and EPA recently released updated advice that recommends pregnant women and young children to eat two to three servings of a variety of low-mercury fish per week to promote healthy brain development. This project will provide tools and resources for families on the go to enjoy quick, healthy, and responsibly-sourced seafood meals that balance our nutritional needs with our impact on the ocean. 
   
   Restaurants and Businesses: Heightened consumer awareness will strengthen SFF and other organizations' efforts to promote restaurants and businesses that are working to source responsibly. In addition, the education and outreach programs will offer information on where to buy local seafood and delicious recipes to inspire chefs and restaurants to diversify their menus to incorporate local seafood items such as sablefish, sardines, and rockfish. 
   
   Local Fishermen and Coastal Communities: Most of the seafood harvested in Southern California is shipped to international markets. The outreach tools developed by the project will make buying local easy and affordable. By supporting local seafood consumption, consumers will be connected to local fishing communities and committed to revitalizing our working waterfront to support fishermen, our coastal communities, and other projects such as environmentally-sound aquaculture.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  LA Kitchen (confirmed): LA Kitchen is a nonprofit providing youth aging out of
  foster care and older adults in the prison system hands-on training for
  careers in the food service and health care industries. SFF works with LA
  Kitchen to teach participants about healthy seafood choices in the food
  service industry. Affordable options, exciting recipes, and the opportunity to
  promote the efforts of LA Kitchen participants are critical to a successful
  collaboration.
   
   Trace and Trust (confirmed): Trace and Trust is building a community of food professionals dedicated to celebrating the farmers and fishermen behind our food. Using the Trace and Trust platform, restaurants trace their menu items directly to the farmers and fishermen responsible for the food and share these stories with their patrons. Trace and Trust members include restaurants, distributors, fishermen, farmers, and ranchers in Southern California and other locations, as well as aquaculture farms. SFF is the first aquarium partner working with Trace and Trust to support local seafood communities and promote responsible seafood from the boat or the farm to the plate. This successful collaboration will include promotion to Aquarium audiences, diverse avenues to share stories from social media to onsite festivals, and connecting our partners with Trace and Trust's project and mission.
   
   Local Fishermen and Producers (confirmed): SFF works closely with local fishermen and aquaculture producers to promote healthy and responsible seafood choices. Our new tools will include education and outreach materials that feature local fishermen, directories of local fish markets where consumers can buy direct, and a local seasonality chart for chefs and consumers. These new tools will help bridge the gap between consumers and the source of their seafood.
   
   SFF Restaurant and Business Partners (confirmed): SFF has established a network of restaurant, distribution, and retail partners working together to promote responsible seafood sourcing. Our partner chefs will star in the video demonstration series, provide seafood for cooking demonstration and educational purposes, and host cooking demonstrations at outreach events.
