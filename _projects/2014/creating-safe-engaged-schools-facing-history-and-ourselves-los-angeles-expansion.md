  Facing History reaches students through their teachers, providing professional
  development (PD) to help middle and high school educators explore issues such
  as discrimination, stereotyping, and the importance of civic participation
  through curriculum-based critical analysis of historical case studies. Facing
  History’s PD includes workshops, seminars, classroom resources, and on-going
  follow-up services. In-depth training introduces teachers to topics such as
  the steps that led to the Holocaust, race and membership in American history,
  the Armenian Genocide, and the 1992 Los Angeles riots. This training, paired
  with individualized coaching and follow-up support, prepares educators to use
  these case studies to engage students around the importance of civic
  participation. 
   
   Through their Facing History classes, students at these schools learn to make connections (not simple comparisons) to self, society, and other events in history. They make meaning of history by examining primary and secondary sources; apply lessons they have learned to current issues and think deeply about what they are reading, hearing, and seeing, all within the emerging civic space of their classroom. Students often reflect on their Facing History experience as the first time that school was relevant to their lives. By connecting the dots, they begin to understand that their choices matter.
   
   Through Facing History’s unique school partnership model, Facing History staff members work closely with faculty throughout the year to integrate our program across grade levels and disciplines, and to create school community events to address school climate, including strong student and parent participation. Facing History conducts three events per year for the Partnership Network, to which each school sends a cohort of students, teachers, administrators and parents to share best practices, discuss issues in urban education, and continue learning about Facing History’s resources. This model brings multiple stakeholders together from different schools on a regular basis to foster community-wide engagement in a local context.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  The educator’s most important task—to shape a humane, well-educated citizenry—
  has never been more vital to sustain civil society, democratic values, and
  human rights than it is today. Yet education on the whole seems to be failing
  in this task; the reality for urban schools is particularly bleak: 
   
   • High school graduation rates In Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) hover around 66%.
   • More than half of all new teachers in the U.S. leave the profession during their first five years. This high turnover undermines the educational system, as teaching expertise is developed over years of practice and improvement.
   • Teachers find themselves ill-equipped to foster safe environments that support learning.
   
   The Los Angeles Partnership Schools Network draws upon innovative research in the key areas of urban education: closing the achievement gap; creating safe, inclusive classrooms; and structuring sustainable, supportive networks for teachers and schools.
   Facing History revitalizes teachers, and helps them integrate social emotional learning within rigorous academic coursework that aligns with Common Core State Standards. Facing History increases students’ motivation and engagement, because our resources and approach link academic content to students’ lives. Facing History trusts young people to wrestle with complex moments in human history, and help them understand the range of human behavior.
   
   Students understand the danger of prejudice and discrimination, the experience of vulnerable groups in society, and the importance of solving differences through discussion and dialogue, not violence. Students learn that their choices matter and that they can be agents of positive change. As they explore the complexities of history and human behavior, students consider how they can make a difference today and in the future.
   
   Facing History’s impact occurs on multiple levels and is leveraged over time. As students become more engaged in their learning, they are more likely to have greater academic success and to graduate. They impact the people around them, including family and peers. As teachers become revitalized, they’re more likely to stay in the field. Facing History teachers continue to use the program every year they remain in the classroom, reaching new groups of students annually. Many Facing History educators become school leaders, shaping the vision and academic goals of their school for years to come.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The Los Angeles Partnership Schools Network will provide training and support
  for approximately 500 teachers in 31 middle and high schools this year. These
  educators will then reach an estimated 12,000 students across Los Angeles
  annually with the tools and lessons to participate positively in their school
  communities, and to succeed in school, career, and civic life. Current
  partnership network schools are located in East Los Angeles, South Los
  Angeles, downtown, and the San Fernando Valley. All schools are Title I, high
  poverty schools and all are either public or charter schools within Los
  Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD). Seven middle schools joined the
  network this past year through a pilot project focused on school-wide
  anti-bullying practices.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  We launched the LA Partnership Schools Network in response to a need from
  teachers to collaborate and build bridges among the diverse communities that
  make up Los Angeles. Our primary partnership is with each individual school,
  including a contractual agreement signed by an administrator and designated
  teacher liaison on campus. Facing History staff work with faculty at each
  school to integrate our program across grades and disciplines. Clear
  contracting, high-fidelity implementation and sustainability planning are all
  critical elements of a successful collaboration.
   
   Last year we added seven middle schools to the Partnership Schools Network through a pilot project focused on school-wide anti-bullying practices. The project was conducted with support from the Los Angeles Fund for Public Education and Youth Policy Institute (YPI). YPI contracted with Facing History to provide in-depth professional development for schools in Hollywood and Pacoima, high-poverty areas of federal revitalization focus, as part of its $30 million grant from the U.S. Department of Education for the Los Angeles Promise Neighborhood initiative.
   
   In addition to the work with individual schools, we convene teachers, administrators, students and parents from partner schools across Los Angeles, both in person and online. Teachers, who too often work in isolation, can now regularly connect with educators from other schools who face similar challenges. Collaboration and idea-sharing within the network has been greatly enhanced through the Los Angeles Network blog (lanetwork.facinghistory.org). The blog provides a flexible forum for educators and Facing History staff to share ideas, challenges, and solutions for addressing issues they confront in the classroom. This online community serves as a networking tool for teachers within and beyond the Los Angeles Partnership Schools Network. 
   
   Facing History is investing significantly in a core group of exemplary Facing History educators to serve as mentors for other teachers in Los Angeles. Teacher leaders are early adopters in piloting Facing History’s new resources, and are instrumental in supporting liaisons from the Los Angeles Partnership Network. Collaboration with our teacher leaders is a critical factor in helping Facing History respond to the needs of teachers, build stronger school-wide programs, and continue expanding to more urban schools.
