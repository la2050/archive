Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): |-
  1. Arts & Business Conduit/Network
   We will serve as the conduit between the arts and business community. Referencing our studies of cultural board participation, we will approach and build relationships with the top fifty institutions with demonstrated arts board participation. We will interview key leadership and corporate social responsibility officers on their formal and informal board placement, leadership development and community outreach strategies. Our goal is for the talented employees of top industries in the region to be trained about arts board service and to be placed with a cultural organization that matches their interests and expands their understanding of the cultural infrastructure of Greater Los Angeles. Engaging Angelenos with cultural board service by itself is not enough. We will create ongoing networks between board members at cultural organizations for mutual support (similar to support networks in other fields) through surveys, communications, convenings and networking events. Arts non-profits often run into challenges that their boards do not have knowledge to combat, and many feel at a loss on how to effectively address this issue. By creating networks between board members — including mentor-mentee relationships and periodic gatherings of board members/board chairs, etc. — major decision-making challenges can be addressed with the knowledge base and community support of leaders from across the region. Additionally, we will contract Arts for LA to provide their nationally recognized advocacy-training academy for our Board network to amplify the reach of nonprofit arts organizations throughout the region.
   
   2. Region-wide Arts Fund 
   We will develop a plan to create a region-wide Arts Fund through workplace giving, employee-driven corporate sponsorship support, individual donations from high-net-worth individuals and crowd sourced methodologies. By engaging with the businesses of Greater LA through the Board Placement and Development process, we expect that many LA citizens will be identified who are interested in the cultural landscape of LA, but who are not in a place to engage immediately through Board service. This component of the program will provide a pathway for those who want to support the LA cultural infrastructure without board service. The funds raised will be distributed through an inclusive re-granting to support parts of LA’s cultural landscape that are often overlooked or underfunded.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  In the short term, our project enables stronger and more connected boards of
  directors of arts nonprofits in the region. The United Arts Fund approach will
  identify and distribute new grants dollars into the arts ecosystem, allowing
  for a deepening of support for current working artists.
   In terms of LA in 2050:
   1) Multi-use community arts centers exist in every neighborhood with multi-lingual, around-the-clock programs composed of participatory, professionally produced, or presented productions
   2) The LA region enjoys the highest per capita investment in the arts from Government, Individuals AND the Corporate Sector.
   3) Business leaders from every sector are clamoring to join Arts and Culture Nonprofit Boards – Arts groups enjoy a waiting list for potential Board members.
   4) All artists are making a living wage.
   5) Artists of every discipline are in residence at the top 200 businesses in the region and every major municipal agency.
   6) Low income residents enjoy free access to and feel welcomed at any arts experience they choose at all arts organization in the region.
   
   The Board and Giving networks will become a core group of LA’s ecology and civic engagement that engagement will become a given. Once you reach a certain level of career progression in any field in Los Angeles, it will be socially presumed that you join your peers in Board service within LA’s cultural nonprofit sector.
   
   After 30+ years of these mutually beneficial relationships taking root, it will be hard to see where ‘for profit’ businesses end and ‘nonprofit’ organizations begin. You will find more for- and non-profit businesses fusing into cooperative ventures beyond sharing board members. For example, it will become a standard practice for arts experiences to be incorporated into the business activities of a store or restaurant.
   
   Participation in our Regional Arts Fund will be so commonplace that it will feel like a tithing at church to all those above the poverty line in the region.
   
   Los Angeles will be known as the Cultural Capital of America — the ‘Creative Powerhouse’- where a vast economy is driven by creative activities at every level; where business acumen is tightly woven with art to reach higher levels of community impact and artistry. New generations of cultural innovation will springboard from LA. The best and brightest minds of Los Angeles will collaborate effortlessly, propel our region forward, and help the LA arts sector grow economically and culturally.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Our project benefits all of Los Angeles by enabling a stronger, more robust
  arts and culture sector, contributing to the quality of life, economic
  vitality and social connectedness of the region; making LA the best play to
  CREATE, LEARN, PLAY and CONNECT. Specifically, our project will directly
  improve the lives of artists, volunteers and arts administrators by fortifying
  their foundation of support within the communities they serve.
   
   We seek to ensure a robust and diverse constituent base with programs and services that meet their needs and allow them to further connect with their audiences. We see a gap between those performing arts organizations who are reaching underserved communities and/or communities of color and our current roster of programming. Our goal is to refocus our efforts to ensure greater access to the arts while enabling a more diverse and inclusive group of organizations benefitting from our services. To accomplish this we will leverage our Arts Census, which contains arts participation information on nearly four million unique households provided by nearly 400 local arts organizations.
   
   This work will leverage our NEA and LA County Arts Commission grants focusing on training and networking the boards of our local companies around issues of diversity, inclusion and access while strengthening our tech infrastructure to support increased access to the arts. The technology focus will look at modeling the access initiative of Theater Development Fund as a model to extend our discount ticket program to underserved audiences throughout the region. The Inclusion aspect will look at services to the field provided by Culture Works in Philadelphia as a model for programmatic efficiencies and sustainability. We anticipate that this committee will also provide a blueprint with best practices and recommendations to the community to address issues of Diversity among boards, administration, artists and audiences throughout the region.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  As an alliance, we exist through partnership and collaboration. We’ll activate
  the 1000+ arts organizations we currently serve and develop this initiative
  with our local, regional and national partner organizations who work in this
  connectivity-collaboration space, including the LA Chamber of Commerce, Arts
  for LA, municipal cultural agencies, arts funders, service providers and
  others. We will also leverage individuals serving on cultural boards and the
  networks of philanthropists and business leaders who support the cultural life
  of Los Angeles. We have strong relationships with national partners who have
  encouraged us to pursue this Initiative including both Americans for the Arts
  (their network of Arts & Business Councils, Business Committees for the Arts
  and United Arts Funds) and National Arts Strategies, which develops non-profit
  arts leaders. As previously mentioned, we have confirmed with the staff of
  Arts for LA that, if funded, we would contract with them to provide advocacy
  training over a six-month period with our Board Network.
