Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  We also believe in the power of Angelenos to shape the future of our region.
  In terms of community resilience, the future is in our hands more than we
  realize. We are long overdue for the “Big One” — a catastrophic earthquake
  that is predicted to wreak havoc. Consensus among experts is that LA residents
  in the event of a catastrophic earthquake will need to be prepared to take
  care of themselves for 3 to 7 days until outside help arrives. Our idea is to
  implement a community engagement project that incorporates a
  neighbor-to-neighbor preparedness approach as well as a preparedness smart
  phone app in an effort to create a more connected, and therefore resilient LA.
  It is after all in the coming together that we are strongest.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Our project plan will combine some old-fashioned community networking via Map
  Your Neighborhood with new technology via the Team Red Cross App. 
   
   Map Your Neighborhood (MYN): This initiative is designed to improve disaster readiness at the neighborhood level, teaching neighbors to rely on each other during the hours or days before first responders may be able to reach them. A neighborhood leader, in this case at first a Red Cross Community Ambassador* and then his/her trainees, holds MYN neighborhood meetings to: identify the skills and equipment inventory each neighbor has that are useful in an effective disaster response; create a neighborhood map; develop a neighborhood contact list; and produce a plan to work together as a team to evaluate the neighborhood after a disaster and take the necessary actions.
   
   Team Red Cross App: This brand new app provides solutions for how to best spread preparedness and relief information as widely as possible. It also utilizes the corps of spontaneous volunteers — everyday humanitarians who emerge to support their neighbors during disasters of all scope and size— by digitally educating, coordinating, and mobilizing volunteers who are ready to help at a moment’s notice. Through this app, that will be promoted by our Community Ambassadors during the Map Your Neighborhood sessions, users will: learn about the responsibilities of a spontaneous volunteer via simple steps, short videos and quizzes; receive and respond to push notifications for volunteer jobs based on their location and preferences; share situational awareness and First Aid content from the app to those around them and affected by disaster; and earn different badges for their activities.
   
   Neighborhoods that are prepared for emergencies save lives, reduce the severity of injuries and trauma, and reduce property damage. And neighbors working together toward this goal improve the overall quality of community life.
   
   * Community Ambassadors are leaders who have been selected to serve as community representatives of the Red Cross to promote and increase volunteerism and preparedness in neighborhoods where they live and work. Our new preparedness project will be launched through our Community Ambassador Program. In order to serve the needs of our vast and diverse Los Angeles population, the American Red Cross Los Angeles Region works side by side with a network of Community Ambassadors.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  In Southern California, it is not a matter of if, but rather when a
  catastrophic earthquake will occur. In fact, by most accounts we are 150 years
  overdue for the “Big One,” an earthquake of a magnitude 7.8 or higher. If an
  earthquake this size jolts the lower half of the San Andreas Fault, this could
  mean thousands of lives lost, billions of dollars in property damage, close to
  a half a million businesses and 4.5 million workers impacted; potentially
  crippling the area’s economy. 
   
   As the Red Cross has witnessed first-hand and as studies demonstrate, being prepared is the most critical step in mitigating risk and enabling a community’s ability to recover. A County of Los Angeles Public Health survey found that 100% of Los Angeles residents believe a catastrophic earthquake is imminent, but only a mere 6% of households in Los Angeles reported being “completely prepared.” Since predictions also point to the need for LA residents to be prepared for a minimum of 3 to upwards of 7 days until outside help can arrive, implementing a new multi-faceted and multi-generational preparedness strategy via a highly successful Community Ambassador Program will serve the preparedness needs of Angelenos today and will create better outcomes for our tomorrow. Neighbors working together now will create resilient communities that can face any emergency. While we cannot predict the exact timing of disasters, we can do everything we can now to come together now to create a more hopeful future. 
   
   It will be because of the efforts we collectively take now that will allow for a 2050 that is a year of resilience and hope and not one of devastation and loss. The connections and bonds that are made now through this community-based work will also make for a well-connected, and therefore stronger Los Angles overall. A Los Angeles that is full of residents who can rely on one another for support. A Los Angeles where residents volunteer to help their fellow community members. A Los Angeles that because of this unity can stand in the face of disaster and not fall.

Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  The following on-going partnerships will support the implementation of our new
  project: Community Emergency Response Team (CERT), Washington State Emergency
  Management System, Community Police Advisory Board, City of Los Angeles Office
  of Emergency Management, LA County Office of Emergency Management,
  Neighborhood Councils, and Emergency Network Los Angeles. These partners offer
  additional preparedness training, cross-promote programs and services, serve
  in a program advisory capacity, help identify new Community Ambassadors, work
  with Community Ambassadors to identify Neighborhood Councils and
  community-based organizations who need preparedness presentations. Three
  factors critical to our success of these collaborations are: shared mission;
  continual dialogue about best practices; and exchange of ideas, promotion and
  training programs.

  impact_metrics: "Through both the launch of Map Your Neighborhood and the Team Red Cross App, many more Los Angeles residents will learn a great deal more about the Red Cross’s five lines of service, Disaster Relief, Service to the Armed Forces, Blood Services, Preparedness Health & Safety, and International Services, and will often want to get more involved in a program that inspires them. More Community Ambassadors, Red Cross volunteers, will be recruited through this work as well. As neighbors work on Map Your Neighborhood together, more residents will volunteer their time to achieve the key components of the initiative will likely to engage with their local CERT team, neighborhood block associations and councils. \r\n\r\nNeighbors and community members working together to prepare and protect themselves, their families and neighborhoods will lead to increased social and emotional support for more adult Angelenos. \r\n\r\nThe Team Red Cross App recruits and trains “informal,” spontaneous volunteers inspired to act in the moment after a disaster, no matter what the scale.

  evaluate: "We will measure our success by tracking the number of :\r\n-- New Community Ambassadors; expecting 20% increase in the next year\r\n-- Neighborhoods participating in Map Your Neighborhood\r\n-- Preparedness actions taken in neighborhoods participating in Map Your Neighborhood at least three preparedness actions taken per household\r\n-- Red Cross Disaster Action Team (DAT) volunteers and spontaneous volunteers \r\n-- Community members who take on neighborhood leader roles for Map Your Neighborhood; \r\n-- Community members who volunteer for causes that they are passionate about\r\n-- Community members who report feeling more connected to their neighbors and to those within their communities; at least 80% surveyed \r\n-- Community members who feel better prepared and whose neighborhoods are more resilient; at least 80% of all Map Your Neighborhood participants\r\n-- Team Red Cross downloads and Red Cross disaster preparedness downloads; 50,000 throughout the County\r\n\r\nEvaluation tactics will include: Map Your Neighborhood pre- and post-preparedness surveys, assessment at quarterly Community Ambassador meetings, as well as program review by quarterly PrepareLA Executive Committee and bi-monthly PrepareLA Steering Committee.\r\n"
  two_lessons: "Lesson 1: Conveying preparedness information using a peer-to-peer approach is the most effective tactic. The Community Ambassador Program has been such a success because our ambassadors are passionate about protecting and preparing the neighborhoods where they live and work. This passion is highly contagious. Other community members often volunteer or take preparedness action that they see modeled by a fellow member of their community. The Map Your Neighborhood neighbor-to- neighbor approach should also prove true the “keeping up with the Jones’” theory true as well. \r\n\r\nLesson 2: Incorporating different methodologies to engage a broader cross-section of the Los Angeles community increases preparedness, volunteerism, connectedness and therefore community resiliency. Both in terms of content and delivery, preparedness information is definitely not “one size fits all” much like the way that people prefer to connect is not one size fits all. This is why our project incorporates both neighbor-to-neighbor interaction to discuss preparedness in a group setting as well as an online platform from which individuals can download preparedness and relief information and connect to community members on-line. This multi-faceted approach also transcends generational lines as well. \r\n"
  achievable_goal: >-
    As we have found firsthand during this third full year of the Community
    Ambassador Program, it is true in practice what social scientists report:
    people become more motivated to take preparedness action is when they see
    other people taking preparedness action, especially their peers; and that
    together, a community is able to manage challenges that go beyond what any
    unaffiliated group of individuals can accomplish. To date our community
    ambassadors reach 102 communities throughout Los Angeles County with the
    goal of reaching all 272 in time. As a result, thousands of young people and
    adults have attended preparedness events and classes run or organized by
    Community Ambassadors and have also received or built preparedness kits.
    Community Ambassadors have also helped increase the number of Red Cross
    volunteers to a total of 8,000. Additionally, Community Ambassadors have
    worked with their elected officials to facilitate the signing of 32
    preparedness proclamations. With this solid program framework in place along
    with our strong program partnerships, implementing our new preparedness
    strategy within the next year is achievable.
  major_challenges: "Challenge 1: The vast majority of LA residents understand conceptually that disasters happen all of the time and that the “Big One” is very likely to happen; and yet, there is a disconnect between this understanding and actually joining in the conversation and taking action to prepare. The neighbor-to-neighbor Map Your Neighborhood approach is effective because hearing preparedness information from a peer tends to resonate, and seeing a neighbor take preparedness action to protect his/her family tends to inspire others to also take action. \r\n\r\nChallenge 2: One of the most popular reasons people give as to why they do not volunteer is they do not have the time to commit. The Team Red Cross App removes this obstacle as users are asked to volunteer their time during times of emergency as they are able, and have the option to decline any volunteer jobs via their smart phone. The Team Red Cross App training is also a web-based, self-paced training as well. \r\n"
  competition: >-
    The City and County of Los Angeles Office of Emergency Management have their
    own community-base preparedness model, 5 Steps To Preparedness, which we are
    finding is a bit more complex and requires some expertise before being fully
    adopted. We are in conversations with the County of LA and eventually the
    City of LA to pilot the 5 Steps model as a Part 2 to the Map Your
    Neighborhood program. 
  cost: >-
    Since the Map Your Neighborhood component is volunteer-run, the largest
    expenses revolve around a percent of staff management of the Community
    Ambassador Program, meeting costs, printing,  travel, and collateral like
    preparedness kits, . The Team Red Cross App was very recently released and
    enhancements are already being worked on, so production a percent of salary
    and communication expenses would be part of the cost for these purposes.

      We also believe in the power of Angelenos to shape the future of our
      region. In terms of community resilience, the future is in our hands more
      than we realize. We are long overdue for the “Big One” — a catastrophic
      earthquake that is predicted to wreak havoc. Consensus among experts is
      that LA residents in the event of a catastrophic earthquake will need to
      be prepared to take care of themselves for 3 to 7 days until outside help
      arrives. Our idea is to implement a community engagement project that
      incorporates a neighbor-to-neighbor preparedness approach as well as a
      preparedness smart phone app in an effort to create a more connected, and
      therefore resilient LA. It is after all in the coming together that we are
      strongest.

    answer: "Our project plan will combine some old-fashioned community networking via Map Your Neighborhood with new technology via the Team Red Cross App. \r\n\r\nMap Your Neighborhood (MYN): This initiative is designed to improve disaster readiness at the neighborhood level, teaching neighbors to rely on each other during the hours or days before first responders may be able to reach them. A neighborhood leader, in this case at first a Red Cross Community Ambassador* and then his/her trainees, holds MYN neighborhood meetings to: identify the skills and equipment inventory each neighbor has that are useful in an effective disaster response; create a neighborhood map; develop a neighborhood contact list; and produce a plan to work together as a team to evaluate the neighborhood after a disaster and take the necessary actions.\r\n\r\nTeam Red Cross App: This brand new app provides solutions for how to best spread preparedness and relief information as widely as possible. It also utilizes the corps of spontaneous volunteers — everyday humanitarians who emerge to support their neighbors during disasters of all scope and size— by digitally educating, coordinating, and mobilizing volunteers who are ready to help at a moment’s notice. Through this app, that will be promoted by our Community Ambassadors during the Map Your Neighborhood sessions, users will: learn about the responsibilities of a spontaneous volunteer via simple steps, short videos and quizzes; receive and respond to push notifications for volunteer jobs based on their location and preferences; share situational awareness and First Aid content from the app to those around them and affected by disaster; and earn different badges for their activities.\r\n\r\nNeighborhoods that are prepared for emergencies save lives, reduce the severity of injuries and trauma, and reduce property damage. And neighbors working together toward this goal improve the overall quality of community life.\r\n\r\n* Community Ambassadors are leaders who have been selected to serve as community representatives of the Red Cross to promote and increase volunteerism and preparedness in neighborhoods where they live and work. Our new preparedness project will be launched through our Community Ambassador Program. In order to serve the needs of our vast and diverse Los Angeles population, the American Red Cross Los Angeles Region works side by side with a network of Community Ambassadors.\r\n"

    answer: "In Southern California, it is not a matter of if, but rather when a catastrophic earthquake will occur. In fact, by most accounts we are 150 years overdue for the “Big One,” an earthquake of a magnitude 7.8 or higher. If an earthquake this size jolts the lower half of the San Andreas Fault, this could mean thousands of lives lost, billions of dollars in property damage, close to a half a million businesses and 4.5 million workers impacted; potentially crippling the area’s economy. \r\n\r\nAs the Red Cross has witnessed first-hand and as studies demonstrate, being prepared is the most critical step in mitigating risk and enabling a community’s ability to recover. A County of Los Angeles Public Health survey found that 100% of Los Angeles residents believe a catastrophic earthquake is imminent, but only a mere 6% of households in Los Angeles reported being “completely prepared.” Since predictions also point to the need for LA residents to be prepared for a minimum of 3 to upwards of 7 days until outside help can arrive, implementing a new multi-faceted and multi-generational preparedness strategy via a highly successful Community Ambassador Program will serve the preparedness needs of Angelenos today and will create better outcomes for our tomorrow. Neighbors working together now will create resilient communities that can face any emergency. While we cannot predict the exact timing of disasters, we can do everything we can now to come together now to create a more hopeful future. \r\n\r\nIt will be because of the efforts we collectively take now that will allow for a 2050 that is a year of resilience and hope and not one of devastation and loss. The connections and bonds that are made now through this community-based work will also make for a well-connected, and therefore stronger Los Angles overall. A Los Angeles that is full of residents who can rely on one another for support. A Los Angeles where residents volunteer to help their fellow community members. A Los Angeles that because of this unity can stand in the face of disaster and not fall.\r\n"

    answer: "Through both the launch of Map Your Neighborhood and the Team Red Cross App, many more Los Angeles residents will learn a great deal more about the Red Cross’s five lines of service, Disaster Relief, Service to the Armed Forces, Blood Services, Preparedness Health & Safety, and International Services, and will often want to get more involved in a program that inspires them. More Community Ambassadors, Red Cross volunteers, will be recruited through this work as well. As neighbors work on Map Your Neighborhood together, more residents will volunteer their time to achieve the key components of the initiative will likely to engage with their local CERT team, neighborhood block associations and councils. \r\n\r\nNeighbors and community members working together to prepare and protect themselves, their families and neighborhoods will lead to increased social and emotional support for more adult Angelenos. \r\n\r\nThe Team Red Cross App recruits and trains “informal,” spontaneous volunteers inspired to act in the moment after a disaster, no matter what the scale. A Team Red Cross volunteer’s only action, an incredibly important action, might also be to send preparedness and relief information onto those in need in their neighborhoods and beyond. \r\n"

  - name: two_lessons
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Lesson 1: Conveying preparedness information using a peer-to-peer approach is the most effective tactic. The Community Ambassador Program has been such a success because our ambassadors are passionate about protecting and preparing the neighborhoods where they live and work. This passion is highly contagious. Other community members often volunteer or take preparedness action that they see modeled by a fellow member of their community. The Map Your Neighborhood neighbor-to- neighbor approach should also prove true the “keeping up with the Jones’” theory true as well. \r\n\r\nLesson 2: Incorporating different methodologies to engage a broader cross-section of the Los Angeles community increases preparedness, volunteerism, connectedness and therefore community resiliency. Both in terms of content and delivery, preparedness information is definitely not “one size fits all” much like the way that people prefer to connect is not one size fits all. This is why our project incorporates both neighbor-to-neighbor interaction to discuss preparedness in a group setting as well as an online platform from which individuals can download preparedness and relief information and connect to community members on-line. This multi-faceted approach also transcends generational lines as well. \r\n"

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      As we have found firsthand during this third full year of the Community
      Ambassador Program, it is true in practice what social scientists report:
      people become more motivated to take preparedness action is when they see
      other people taking preparedness action, especially their peers; and that
      together, a community is able to manage challenges that go beyond what any
      unaffiliated group of individuals can accomplish. To date our community
      ambassadors reach 102 communities throughout Los Angeles County with the
      goal of reaching all 272 in time. As a result, thousands of young people
      and adults have attended preparedness events and classes run or organized
      by Community Ambassadors and have also received or built preparedness
      kits. Community Ambassadors have also helped increase the number of Red
      Cross volunteers to a total of 8,000. Additionally, Community Ambassadors
      have worked with their elected officials to facilitate the signing of 32
      preparedness proclamations. With this solid program framework in place
      along with our strong program partnerships, implementing our new
      preparedness strategy within the next year is achievable.
  - name: major_challenges
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Challenge 1: The vast majority of LA residents understand conceptually that disasters happen all of the time and that the “Big One” is very likely to happen; and yet, there is a disconnect between this understanding and actually joining in the conversation and taking action to prepare. The neighbor-to-neighbor Map Your Neighborhood approach is effective because hearing preparedness information from a peer tends to resonate, and seeing a neighbor take preparedness action to protect his/her family tends to inspire others to also take action. \r\n\r\nChallenge 2: One of the most popular reasons people give as to why they do not volunteer is they do not have the time to commit. The Team Red Cross App removes this obstacle as users are asked to volunteer their time during times of emergency as they are able, and have the option to decline any volunteer jobs via their smart phone. The Team Red Cross App training is also a web-based, self-paced training as well. \r\n"
