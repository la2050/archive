Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  We also believe in the power of Angelenos to shape the future of our region.
  In terms of community resilience, the future is in our hands more than we
  realize. We are long overdue for the “Big One” — a catastrophic earthquake
  that is predicted to wreak havoc. Consensus among experts is that LA residents
  in the event of a catastrophic earthquake will need to be prepared to take
  care of themselves for 3 to 7 days until outside help arrives. Our idea is to
  implement a community engagement project that incorporates a
  neighbor-to-neighbor preparedness approach as well as a preparedness smart
  phone app in an effort to create a more connected, and therefore resilient LA.
  It is after all in the coming together that we are strongest.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Our project plan will combine some old-fashioned community networking via Map
  Your Neighborhood with new technology via the Team Red Cross App. 
   
   Map Your Neighborhood (MYN): This initiative is designed to improve disaster readiness at the neighborhood level, teaching neighbors to rely on each other during the hours or days before first responders may be able to reach them. A neighborhood leader, in this case at first a Red Cross Community Ambassador* and then his/her trainees, holds MYN neighborhood meetings to: identify the skills and equipment inventory each neighbor has that are useful in an effective disaster response; create a neighborhood map; develop a neighborhood contact list; and produce a plan to work together as a team to evaluate the neighborhood after a disaster and take the necessary actions.
   
   Team Red Cross App: This brand new app provides solutions for how to best spread preparedness and relief information as widely as possible. It also utilizes the corps of spontaneous volunteers — everyday humanitarians who emerge to support their neighbors during disasters of all scope and size— by digitally educating, coordinating, and mobilizing volunteers who are ready to help at a moment’s notice. Through this app, that will be promoted by our Community Ambassadors during the Map Your Neighborhood sessions, users will: learn about the responsibilities of a spontaneous volunteer via simple steps, short videos and quizzes; receive and respond to push notifications for volunteer jobs based on their location and preferences; share situational awareness and First Aid content from the app to those around them and affected by disaster; and earn different badges for their activities.
   
   Neighborhoods that are prepared for emergencies save lives, reduce the severity of injuries and trauma, and reduce property damage. And neighbors working together toward this goal improve the overall quality of community life.
   
   * Community Ambassadors are leaders who have been selected to serve as community representatives of the Red Cross to promote and increase volunteerism and preparedness in neighborhoods where they live and work. Our new preparedness project will be launched through our Community Ambassador Program. In order to serve the needs of our vast and diverse Los Angeles population, the American Red Cross Los Angeles Region works side by side with a network of Community Ambassadors.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  In Southern California, it is not a matter of if, but rather when a
  catastrophic earthquake will occur. In fact, by most accounts we are 150 years
  overdue for the “Big One,” an earthquake of a magnitude 7.8 or higher. If an
  earthquake this size jolts the lower half of the San Andreas Fault, this could
  mean thousands of lives lost, billions of dollars in property damage, close to
  a half a million businesses and 4.5 million workers impacted; potentially
  crippling the area’s economy. 
   
   As the Red Cross has witnessed first-hand and as studies demonstrate, being prepared is the most critical step in mitigating risk and enabling a community’s ability to recover. A County of Los Angeles Public Health survey found that 100% of Los Angeles residents believe a catastrophic earthquake is imminent, but only a mere 6% of households in Los Angeles reported being “completely prepared.” Since predictions also point to the need for LA residents to be prepared for a minimum of 3 to upwards of 7 days until outside help can arrive, implementing a new multi-faceted and multi-generational preparedness strategy via a highly successful Community Ambassador Program will serve the preparedness needs of Angelenos today and will create better outcomes for our tomorrow. Neighbors working together now will create resilient communities that can face any emergency. While we cannot predict the exact timing of disasters, we can do everything we can now to come together now to create a more hopeful future. 
   
   It will be because of the efforts we collectively take now that will allow for a 2050 that is a year of resilience and hope and not one of devastation and loss. The connections and bonds that are made now through this community-based work will also make for a well-connected, and therefore stronger Los Angles overall. A Los Angeles that is full of residents who can rely on one another for support. A Los Angeles where residents volunteer to help their fellow community members. A Los Angeles that because of this unity can stand in the face of disaster and not fall.

Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  The following on-going partnerships will support the implementation of our new
  project: Community Emergency Response Team (CERT), Washington State Emergency
  Management System, Community Police Advisory Board, City of Los Angeles Office
  of Emergency Management, LA County Office of Emergency Management,
  Neighborhood Councils, and Emergency Network Los Angeles. These partners offer
  additional preparedness training, cross-promote programs and services, serve
  in a program advisory capacity, help identify new Community Ambassadors, work
  with Community Ambassadors to identify Neighborhood Councils and
  community-based organizations who need preparedness presentations. Three
  factors critical to our success of these collaborations are: shared mission;
  continual dialogue about best practices; and exchange of ideas, promotion and
  training programs.
