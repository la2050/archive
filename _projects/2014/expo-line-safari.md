    The Expo line originates in downtown Los Angeles, and then ends in Santa
    Monica and the Ocean! It travels through inland to coastal climatic zones,
    and habitat.   The Expo Safari line travels the path of the undergrounded
    braided river bed of Ballona Creek, the drainage conduit to the Ballona
    Watershed!  Tree canopies provide flyways, habitat and bird rest stops that
    connect the Los Angeles River and Ballona Creek into a continuous system for
    migrating birds as part of the Pacific Flyway. EXPO Safari will make the
    “urban wild” visible and provide visual and digital opportunities for riders
    along the Expo Line to interact with nature and each other as citizen
    scientists!
  implement: "In the spirit of Safari 7, a self-guided tour of urban animal life along New York City’s No. 7 subway line, UCLA Extension Landscape Architecture Program proposes a natural/urban animal life safari along the Expo Line: Expo Safari! An ecological interpretation of Los Angeles while traveling on the Metro Expo Line.  UCLA Extension Landscape Architecture Students and instructors will work with Metro, the  Supervisorial Districts, the cities along the Expo line, the school systems, and other partners to create a natural trail experience of the EXPO Metro’s ride from city center to the sea.\r\n\r\nThe Once and Future Ballona Creek.\r\nThe Expo Safari line travels the path of the undergrounded braided river bed of Ballona Creek, the drainage conduit to the Ballona Watershed!  The Safari will explain the watershed, its importance, the history of urban development and the resulting filling and reduction of the Ballona Creek and its continuing importance and vibrancy, providing habitat and food for migratory birds. \r\n\r\nUrban wildlife is hidden and many creatures live underground, such as possums, rats, raccoons, moles, and snakes.  Subways and pipelines provide habitat for much of this subterranean wildlife.\r\n\r\nConnections to Exposition Park and the LA County Natural History Museum provide opportunities to explore the natural past of California, and the new Botanical Gardens have wonderful displays of California’s native plants, and ecosystems.\r\n\r\nTree canopies provide flyways, habitat and bird rest stops that connect the LAs River and Ballona Creek into a continuous system for migrating birds. Above ground are shorebirds, waterfowl, songbirds and raptors that feed, rest and winter in Southern California. Ducks, hawks, redwing blackbirds, as well as Canada geese, seagulls and snowy plovers are among the many species of birds that can be seen along Expo Safari as it passes through a portion of the Pacific Flyway.\r\n\r\nMaking the “urban wild” of LA visible provides opportunities for schools along the Metro Line to interact with nature. To encourage schools and students to participate, “Field Guides” will be developed and an “Expo Safari! Field Guide Book” (mobile app to be developed), containing information and images of the animals and habitat that are along the route and sections for the recording of animals seen and experienced.  The field guides will be uploaded to a Facebook page : “Field Work: Expo Safari!”, that will showcase citizen scientists discoveries."

  evaluate: "Through our FIeld Guide, and Facbook page we will be able to track individual activity an reach.\r\n\r\nWe will provide evaluations for digital app and feedback so that we can monitor the free downloads and implement suggestions or improvements.\r\n\r\nThrough the school downloads, we will follow up at the end of the school year to gather information on the success and suggestions on improvements and other features."
  two_lessons: "Students who use multi media are not aware of nature. Using digital media we will create a digital program to engage our digital students in the nature of Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nMuch of the natural beauty of LA is undiscovered. Providing views and stories into other layers of LA through a mobile application and interpretive graphics at the Metro stations and on trains, and digital venues will create a better understanding and awareness of nature. \r\n\r\nThis model of success is fully documented in SAFARI 7, which was implemented in New York on the Queens Line #7. We are basing our templates on this successful model of education on transit through mobile apps and graphic displays."
  achievable_goal: "The UCLA Extension Landscape Architecture Program recently completed the Green Alleys Project with Jefferson High School students, and have worked with the County of Los Angeles Department of Parks and Recreation on their regional park master plan. We recently completed working with the City of LA Bureau of Sanitation on applying and creating low impact development solutions along the Tujunga Wash, to reduce TMDL’s at tributaries to reduce the cumulative pollutants at confluences. All these projects were done within the timeframe of a quarter class.\r\n\r\nOur independent study class will cover three quarters and include our landscape architecture, design graphics, and interior design students working with LAUSD students, teachers and scientists. \r\n\r\nMetro grants are available to incorporate arts and sciences and we are in the process of applying as a match.\r\n\r\nThe UCLA Extension Landscape Architecture Program has met all deliverables and timelines within the last 4 years of service project classes."
  major_challenges: "1. Class participants vary in skills, knowledge and learning levels. We will provide outside assistance in areas where we have the need. This also provide more learning opportunities to our students and to LAUSD students and the community.\r\n\r\n2. Funding. We have been seeking funding for this endeavor over this year, but the EXPO Safari covers a broad area and LA2050 actually encourages the broad reach of this service project, thus providing funds for a regional nature experience."

    Expo Safari! is a collaboration with the successful SAFARI 7.ORG.    SAFARI
    7 originated in NY along the Queens Line, Line 7.  In Beijing, the SAFARI
    template was implemented along the No. 4 Line to create SAFARI 4.  Please
    visit www.safari7.org  and http://safari4.org/  for more information on
    their successful work!  UCLA Extension Landscape Architecture Program is
    working with the Safari 7 model to integrate the urban ecologies of Los
    Angeles into the Metro experience.
  cost: 'We believe this will cost  between $75,000 and $85,000.'
