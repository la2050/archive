Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  The Expo line originates in downtown Los Angeles, and then ends in Santa
  Monica and the Ocean! It travels through inland to coastal climatic zones, and
  habitat. The Expo Safari line travels the path of the undergrounded braided
  river bed of Ballona Creek, the drainage conduit to the Ballona Watershed!
  Tree canopies provide flyways, habitat and bird rest stops that connect the
  Los Angeles River and Ballona Creek into a continuous system for migrating
  birds as part of the Pacific Flyway. EXPO Safari will make the “urban wild”
  visible and provide visual and digital opportunities for riders along the Expo
  Line to interact with nature and each other as citizen scientists!
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  In the spirit of Safari 7, a self-guided tour of urban animal life along New
  York City’s No. 7 subway line, UCLA Extension Landscape Architecture Program
  proposes a natural/urban animal life safari along the Expo Line: Expo Safari!
  An ecological interpretation of Los Angeles while traveling on the Metro Expo
  Line. UCLA Extension Landscape Architecture Students and instructors will work
  with Metro, the Supervisorial Districts, the cities along the Expo line, the
  school systems, and other partners to create a natural trail experience of the
  EXPO Metro’s ride from city center to the sea.
   
   The Once and Future Ballona Creek.
   The Expo Safari line travels the path of the undergrounded braided river bed of Ballona Creek, the drainage conduit to the Ballona Watershed! The Safari will explain the watershed, its importance, the history of urban development and the resulting filling and reduction of the Ballona Creek and its continuing importance and vibrancy, providing habitat and food for migratory birds. 
   
   Urban wildlife is hidden and many creatures live underground, such as possums, rats, raccoons, moles, and snakes. Subways and pipelines provide habitat for much of this subterranean wildlife.
   
   Connections to Exposition Park and the LA County Natural History Museum provide opportunities to explore the natural past of California, and the new Botanical Gardens have wonderful displays of California’s native plants, and ecosystems.
   
   Tree canopies provide flyways, habitat and bird rest stops that connect the LAs River and Ballona Creek into a continuous system for migrating birds. Above ground are shorebirds, waterfowl, songbirds and raptors that feed, rest and winter in Southern California. Ducks, hawks, redwing blackbirds, as well as Canada geese, seagulls and snowy plovers are among the many species of birds that can be seen along Expo Safari as it passes through a portion of the Pacific Flyway.
   
   Making the “urban wild” of LA visible provides opportunities for schools along the Metro Line to interact with nature. To encourage schools and students to participate, “Field Guides” will be developed and an “Expo Safari! Field Guide Book” (mobile app to be developed), containing information and images of the animals and habitat that are along the route and sections for the recording of animals seen and experienced. The field guides will be uploaded to a Facebook page : “Field Work: Expo Safari!”, that will showcase citizen scientists discoveries.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  So much of Los Angeles has displaced nature in the development of the
  metroplex. There are many opportunities to show the layers of LA, the past,
  the underground or unseen, the other creatures that call Los Angeles home.
  Taking a transportation route and exposing the scenic and natural processes
  enriches the experiences of the riders, and the understanding of the natural
  world where we live. 
   
   Using the Safari, as an exploration, and creating field guides and citizen scientists who record nature and become aware of these interconnections is just one of the possibilities for the Expo Line “Safari”. This UCLA Extension Landscape Architecture program will work with students, naturalists, artists and metro riders to create an extraordinary experience of nature along the Los Angeles Metro Expo Line.
   
   Upon implementation, the template could be applied to the other Metro lines: Gold (the Cornfields and LA River), Blue (Augustus F. Hawkins Park and LA Port), etc., creating a network of nature and transportation opportunities.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  EXPO Safari will benefit schools in Los Angeles, Culver City, and Santa Monica
  by providing a fun scientific expedition using public transportation and
  exposing these students to the natural process and nature in Los Angeles.
   
   EXPO Safari will increase ridership along the EXPO line, by weaving the Natural History Museum, Gardens, Ballona Creek, into the Safari experience and engaging riders to explore areas along the route.
   
   EXPO Safari will benefit the wildlife we share our space with, by creating an understanding of tree canopies, bird migration, the value of wildlife in our city.
   
   EXPO Safari has the potential to create future botanists, biologists, zoologists, park rangers, hikers and a citizenry that is excited to explore outside the confines of a train, to see more of the world, to learn more and to experience nature.
   
   EXPO Safari will benefit our Landscape Architecture students in understanding that design is a collaborative process.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  LA County Natural History Museum's scientists and gardens create a synergy
  between the past and the present natural history of LA.
   
   We will be working with Science teachers in the various schools along the route. Working together to create a curriculum that is vibrant with urban wildlife. Our Landscape Architecture program has worked with various schools in Los Angeles County on service projects and learning curriculum.
   
   METRO is an essential partner in allowing signage and 
   
   Critical factors
   In our past collaboration, success has depended on: 1) strong public outreach – on the ground level at the schools as well as at agencies; 2) clear understanding of timeline and abilities of students; 3) the ability to share our strengths and leverage partnerships and resources for students and our work.
