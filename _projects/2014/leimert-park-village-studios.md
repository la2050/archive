Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Within the existing framework of the LPV 20/20 Vision Initiative, a grassroots
  community effort to shape the neighborhood’s economic development around its
  cultural and artistic identity, we will flesh out a year-long calendar of
  cultural events: the Summer Arts Program of the Manchester Junior Arts Center;
  a Village-wide Music Caravan to be held every few months with themes like
  Jazz, Blues, Mardi Gras, and World Music; a monthly Art Walk centered in the
  People’s Street Plaza; MLK Day Festival; Kwanza Festival; African-American
  Arts & Music Festival; and, in December the massive street festival CicLAvia.
   
   This event calendar, already in place, will provide us with the production calendar for LPV Studios. Around each event, we will produce original programming: recording performances, readings, and public art. Second, our signature events will be used as deadlines for the production of documentary material (film, audio, and literary) as part of our Artistic & Cultural Heritage Program--to be sold during the events, generating income for the local creative economy, and passing on our living arts to the broader community. 
   
   The event calendar will also structure our youth education efforts. We will use youth involvement in performance, planning and production to create a curriculum in arts history, media literary, in documenting cultural heritage, and in technical skills needed in the creative industry. This curriculum will be designed along the lines of the STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts & Math) educational framework, positioning us to establish an accredited academic program. 
   
   We will conduct an assessment of the current technical capacity of anchor venues, and make necessary upgrades. We plan to target The World Stage, KAOS Network, Barbara Morrison and Fernando Pullum for temporary sound-proofing; to acquire portable green screens that can be used to film in all of the above, and at Youth n Motion; and to acquire a pool of cameras, audio and video recording equipment, and editing equipment to be shared amongst the partner venues. 
   
   Finally, we will build a comprehensive Creative Directory. The talent base will include those directly connected to our anchor venues, independent producers and artists whose involvement in our events can be a springboard for additional ventures. The People’s Street Plaza will in essence serve as an open-air co-working space nurturing connection and collaboration.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  There is already a renaissance in Leimert Park Village, widely recognized as a
  hub of African-American cultural in Los Angeles. The socio-economic
  circumstances of the community belie its artistic wealth. Five MacArthur
  Genius Awards have been bestowed on artists with a history in the
  neighborhood--including Mark Bradford, who is investing in a major new arts
  education initiative. The ongoing effort of the Village to survive as an
  iconic American community is at the heart of our project.
   
   In the short term, existing cultural venues, joined in December by the newly approved Peoples Street Plaza, are a ready infrastructure for performance, education, and creative innovation. Our event calendar assures sustainable performance opportunities, while the LiveStream TV station and online cultural journal offer access to an expanded local (and later national and international) market. Venues with a long history creating more with less will be bolstered by new sources of income, as will independent producers and artists. The involvement of youth in all facets--from planning and performance to documenting the neighborhood’s artistic heritage--will train a new generation of creative industry professionals. The arrival of CicLAvia in December will bring a fresh new audience. 
   
   In the long term, the foundation established in the first year will allow us to fully take advantage of a series of opportunities ahead. The 750-seat Vision Theater will reopen in 2016, dramatically expanding capacity. The creative infrastructure we plan to have in place when the LPV Metro stop opens in 2020 will open up new markets. With a straight link to the airport and national and international travelers, LVP Studios will have access to the global travel market and creative economy. Capturing that market requires a core of cultural, business and artistic activities that will make LPV a 'must see' destination.
   
   By 2050, Leimert Park Village promises to be a fully developed magnet for cultural enrichment and artistic innovation. A homegrown Studio, based in local cultural establishments and anchored by the Vision Theater and People’s Street Plaza, will offer a new generation of creative professionals training, employment, and structure for ongoing collaboration. As the local hub for the culture and arts of the African Diaspora, Leimert Park Village will be both an international destination, and a portal for national and international distribution of film and music.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  LPV Studios will give a dynamic community the tools to build a sustainable
  creative infrastructure, ensuring that future economic development is guided
  by the area’s rich artistic heritage. 
   
   A major beneficiary will be the local African-American community and those who have come to cherish its cultural legacy. Across the country, traditional centers of black culture have been disrupted and dispersed. Los Angeles has witnessed the dissolution of the famed Central Avenue jazz & blues scene, and the dislocation of the literary revival in Watts in the late 60s. Leimert Park remains the best hope for a permanent safe haven for that living history.
   
   Venues that for decades have learned to do more with less will be on solid footing. A shared pool of state-of-the-art equipment, modest facility upgrades, and paid coordinators will ground a thriving local creative industry. An enhanced schedule of cultural events will substantially expand the market for local creative production. Without this foundation, the community will be ill-equipped to capture the new traffic that the coming subway station will surely draw. With it, the possibilities are endless.
   
   Local venues will be able to provide regular work for artists, instructors, and producers who have for years volunteered their time. Anchored by the open-air co-working space of the People’s Plaza, our cultural calendar will be an incubator for artistic innovation. This activity will be a growing source of varied employment in the creative industry.
   
   Area youth, who have for years faced a dearth of school arts and after-school programs, will have exciting new options. Youth participants will be given hands-on experience connecting them with their own cultural heritage, and providing practical skills for the future. We have the opportunity to nurture a whole new generation of artist-entrepreneurs. 
   
   The training component of the Studio will offer skills, structure and a second chance to the previously incarcerated, emancipated minors, foster youth, and young people who have difficulty finding a place in mainstream educational institutions. By providing a safe public space for youth and their families, we will enhance the social fabric of the area and prevent young people from getting into trouble in the first place.
   
   Finally, the historical archiving projects of the Studio will give our neighborhood’s elders a meaningful role in preserving our history and in passing it on to the next generation.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Our core collaborators are the anchor cultural venues that will form the
  foundation of the Studio: all of whom are committed to the mission of the LPV
  20/20 Vision Initiative; have begun coordinating a year-long schedule of
  festivals and cultural events, most recently a Village-wide Music Caravan; and
  have begun joint marketing through a shared website, cultural calendar, and
  LiveStream TV Station. 
   
   These partners, all confirmed, are:
   
   • The Vision Theater (750-seat theater due to re-open in 2016)
   • Manchester Junior Arts Center (youth arts programming)
   • Department of Cultural Affairs (oversight of Vision Theater)
   • KAOS Network (multi-use spaces, film production, sound stage)
   • Barbara Morrison Performing Arts Center (performance space, association with Living Legends)
   • Fernando Pullum Community Arts Center (performance space, training, performance space, production)
   • The World Stage (performance space, music and writing workshops)
   • Youth n Motion (youth tutoring, performance space)
   
   Other confirmed partners are:
   
   • Sika’s (retail store, festival organizer)
   • Community Build (liaison with Business Improvement District)
   • Urban Design Center (consultant)
   • Empowerment Congress West Area Neighborhood Council (co-convener of LPV 20/20 Initiative)
   • USC Annenberg School of Journalism (student interns)
   • African Soul International (youth interns)
   • Black Arts Foundation (festival organizer)
   • Leimert Park Group (festival organizer)
   • Marikel Consulting (festival organizer, consulting)
   • The Institute for Maximum Human Development (technical assistance)
   
   There are a number of challenges involved in coordinating such an ambitious project amongst so many diverse partners. Factors critical to successful collaboration include:
   
   1. Practicing strategic resource management to leverage resources as efficiently as possible; steadily build technical and production capacity; and ensure long-term sustainability.
   
   2. Putting in place an organizational infrastructure that establishes a shared set of values and practices; clarifies benefits and obligations of partners; implements a long-term strategic plan.
   
   3. Building in a broad-based sense of ownership and investment in the Studio: Leimert Park Village is a small area with limited resources; to meet the full scope of our ambitions, we will have to make Leimert a magnet for cultural education, training, and enrichment; and a center for creative innovation.
