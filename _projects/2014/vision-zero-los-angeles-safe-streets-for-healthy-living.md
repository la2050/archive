  Zanja Madre is a non-profit organization based in Los Angeles County that aims
  to impart how the built environment directly impacts the quality of our lives.
  We provide classes, workshops, installations and exhibitions centered around
  the landscape, including watershed, food system, and land art, at our 30,000
  square foot space called “The Shed” in Northwest Pasadena. Barren landscapes
  in turn create barren communities, which have led to increased violence,
  health disparities, and the depletion of fresh water supplies, increased urban
  runoff, and groundwater pollution. We act on the knowledge that the landscape
  is one of the first opportunities to repair decades of poor design practices
  and policies.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Since 2012 we have been working on converting our former commercial auto
  mechanic shop into an ecologically friendly and inspirational community space
  called "The Shed." We have designs for sustainable renovation, including
  installing a green roof, food forest, rain barrels, removing impermeable
  asphalt and concrete, installing habitat water conserving gardens, green
  living walls, converting shipping containers into workshops and studios, a
  commercial kitchen for harvesting, food preservation, and nutrition education
  as well as other improvements that will provide a sustainable demonstration,
  training, and inspirational center for Los Angeles County.
   
   With a grant from LA 2050 we can amplify the facilities of The Shed to host educational classes that promote our three-point approach to watershed restoration, "slow it, spread it, sink it," in order to reduce urban runoff, replenish groundwater, combat the drought, educate our community about the water crisis and eventually heal the watershed. 
   
   Los Angeles is not a desert, but a Mediterranean climate with fresh water springs and aquifers that are not getting recharged from the innocuous development of concrete and lawns. Through courses like reeducating professional plumbers in greywater and rainwater harvesting, block-by-block lawn removal, and impermeable hardscape removal, we can heal the watershed, putting fresh water back into the landscape, instead of diverting it to the channelized LA River and straight out to the ocean. We are all tied together through the quantity (how much) and quality (how well) we utilize our natural resources. Water conservation is paramount to our ability to play, connect, live, create and learn especially during a time of one of the worst drought in California history. 
   
   We plan on having the on-site examples (sustainable demonstration gardens), hands on classes (ecological education for professionals and invididuals), as well as events and art exhibits (focused on land, urban and earth art) to have a holistic approach to long term watershed restoration and “urban healing.”
   
   We need water for a vibrant future and with this grant we can help to inspire, and transform Los Angeles and build a place that will demonstrate the potential power of true sustainability.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Inspired by the name of the original earthwork aqueduct that brought water
  from the LA River in 1781. The Zanja Madre was a low impact system that
  brought water for both domestic and irrigation use for the “Pueblo de Nuestra
  Senora La Reina de Los Angeles.” 
   
   Zanja Madre is a local historic metaphor for the eternal spring of renewal and community. To remind Angelenos of a geographic history and to inspire socially responsible sustainable landscapes that encourage health, safety, community, connection, and recharge local groundwater supplies, and encourage water conservation. 
   
   73 feet of the original Zanja Madre (mother ditch) was recently unearthed in the Blossom Plaza project in Chinatown in April of 2014 underneath the old Little Joe’s restaurant. Most of the archaeological ruin was removed, but parts will be exhibited at the Los Angeles State Historic Park and Metabolic Studios. 
   
   By providing a place like The Shed, a sustainable venue for people to come and experience the benefits of ecologically sound principles, permaculture, placemaking and provides hands on examples of a landscape that feels good, benefits health, increases safety, creates habitat and provides a campus for ecological education in LA County. By providing the public with reasonable and affordable seminars, we want to help with educating our community on the benefits of rainwater harvesting, urban agriculture and water conservation, and tie together environmental and ecological content with earth, land and urban art. 
   
   The unique play between and arts, education and environmental organization at The Shed will create a space for the opportunity for many different communities to engage and interact with each other and build collaborations across diverse fields. We aim to protect our waterways, create more open space, build a sustainable environment, fostering cultural diversity and inclusivity and help folks find new ways to repurpose their skills and talents to “help Los Angeles become the best place in the world to learn, create, play, connect – and the healthiest place to live.”
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  The Shed sustainable venue, classes and exhibits, will benefit the children,
  adults, senior citizens, professionals, individuals, families, and communities
  of Los Angeles, especially Northwest Pasadena, Altadena, North East Los
  Angeles, and the San Gabriel Valley. Our project will also benefit: the
  unemployed; plumbing, landscape design professionals, contractors; students,
  landscape architecture and permaculture design graduates. 
   
   Events at The Shed over the past year have already brought over 1,500 attendees with just ten events with visitors from San Diego, the inland empire and even out of state. 
   
   We have had a diverse and inclusive list of local, national and international presenters. Zanja Madre the operating nonprofit, is a female and minority owned business, and we aim to be inclusive and help champion more diversity in sustainability, and the arts. We feel confident that we will continue to attract as well as reflect the incredible diversity of Los Angeles.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  We have worked with all of our proposed and confirmed partners to the
  project. 
   
   Factors that are critical to the success of our proposed collaboration are outlining: 1) Memorandum of understandings 2) Mutual benefit to ensure commitment 3) Milestones/metrics
