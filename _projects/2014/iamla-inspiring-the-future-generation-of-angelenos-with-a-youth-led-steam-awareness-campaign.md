  For 77 years, BGCH has provided out-of-school educational and enrichment
  programs for underprivileged students. 9 Dots was founded in 2011 by three
  engineering alumni from Stanford University with degrees in mechanical
  engineering, environmental engineering, and computer science and a Ph.D
  student in UCLA’s Department of Education. 9 Dots provides homework help, math
  and literacy enrichment, and hands-on STEAM projects after school. BGCH and 9
  Dots are both located in the Hollywood area of Los Angeles, a high-poverty
  area where the median income ($33,694) is far lower than the county’s
  ($56,241) and the state’s ($61,400), and almost a third of adults 25 years or
  older never finished high school. 
   
   BGCH and 9 Dots will collaborate to provide the IamLA "Steam on the Go!" Campaign. Activities include: 
   1) 20 youth will be identified to become IamLA Youth Leaders and the “STEAM on the Go!” Leadership Team. 
   2) Develop a creative STEAM curriculum for the IamLA Youth Leaders to present. 
   3) Train the IamLA Youth Leaders using STEAM training curriculum covering material relevant to the age groups the Youth Leaders will serve (1st-8th grades). Training will incorporate leadership development skills, classroom management skills, and public speaking skills.
   4) Build the “STEAM on the Go!” mobile lab (cart with all materials).
   5) Create IamLA “STEAM on the Go!” t-shirts. 
   6) Develop the IamLA-“STEAM on the Go!” resource guide. 
   7) Develop a website/blog run by the Youth Leaders for the Campaign. 
   
   IamLA Youth Leaders will participate in on-site visits with (1) professors and/or professionals in STEAM fields at UCLA, USC, and CSUN; (2) a civil engineer or architect at a construction site; (3) a physician at the Children’s Hospital or at the UCLA or USC hospitals; (4) animation crews at an animation studio to observe how computer science or graphic design components go into the animation of a video game or movie; and (5) professors in Archeology, Physics, or Chemistry, culminating with a visit to the Griffith Park Observatory and the La Brea Tar Pits. 
   
   The IamLA Campaign will conclude with a carnival where schools visited will be invited to send a team. Each team will have a booth and will present a STEAM activity/project to those in attendance. A panel of judges made up of city council members, school officials, STEAM professionals, and community partners will determine the winners, basing scores on creativity and audience engagement.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  The IamLA STEAM Campaign will help the Youth Leaders strengthen their
  leadership skills, public speaking skills, and teamwork skills, while
  simultaneously empowering them to create positive changes in their community.
  Educational researchers have found that peer teaching and peer-to-peer
  collaboration are highly effective. Therefore, due to the youth-led aspect of
  the IamLA Campaign, the students that the Youth Leaders present to will be
  excited by STEAM subjects, how these subjects relate to everyday life, and
  what STEAM could mean to them in their future careers. Furthermore, students
  served by the IamLA campaign will be inspired and motivated to learn STEAM
  subjects and engage in discussions with parents and school officials about
  their futures in STEAM. This project will also build in the community by
  laying the foundation for developing more partnerships among organizations,
  youth, and individuals to further promote diversity in STEAM fields. In
  addition, the accessibility of the website and blog will create a space that
  will continue to raise awareness of STEAM and develop new ideas for
  partnerships throughout Los Angeles and beyond.
   
   The Campaign will be a catalyst through which BGCH and 9 Dots youth empower other youth by exposing them to STEAM fields that have traditionally lacked in diversity. The overarching purpose of IamLA is to disprove the idea that STEAM careers are out of reach for disadvantaged youth in Los Angeles.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The IamLA STEAM Campaign will primarily benefit Los Angeles youth in grades
  1-8 in the Los Angeles Unified School District, a demographic that is
  predominantly low income and African American or Latino. The campaign will
  also benefit the community at large by creating more young role models and
  leaders working to better their communities. We believe that the age group we
  are targeting with our campaign is most likely to develop an interest in
  STEAM, as they have many more years of school left to continue developing
  their interest in and knowledge of STEAM before applying to college. In the
  long run, we hope to see an increase in diversity in STEAM fields.
   
   One of the goals of our awareness campaign is to instill in our youth the desire to expand their knowledge of STEAM through involvement in programs like BGCH, 9 Dots, and other STEAM programs. Developing an interest in STEAM during their crucial formative years makes it more possible for youth to pursue STEAM fields. When the youth we serve reach high school, they will be more likely to have a deeper understanding of STEAM, making it an accessible option when applying to college and pursuing a career. 
   
   Los Angeles is an enormously diverse city, and its youth provide an immeasurable wealth of experiences and perspectives that can shape the future of the city and its residents. We believe that if our youth, who will eventually grow up to become college students and young professionals, play a larger role in STEAM fields, Los Angeles will greatly benefit.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  9 Dots Learning Center is partnering with the Boys & Girls Club of Hollywood
  to create the IamLA STEAM Campaign. BGCH and 9 Dots have existing partnerships
  with schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District, and have previously
  worked together to share curriculum and provide STEAM professional development
  workshops. Additional collaborations with local colleges and student
  organizations from UCLA, USC and CSUN will provide guidance, onsite visits
  with professors, and real time learning. BGCH has worked with the Office of
  Admissions from these local colleges and will continue to do so in order to
  gain access to professors and the hands-on learning experiences we plan to
  offer our youth leaders. 
   
   The factors contributing to our success are:
   1. The identification and training of Youth Leaders from Boys & Girls Club of Hollywood and 9 Dots
   2. Establishing working relationships with the administration at local schools
   3. BGCH’s 75+ years in youth development programs and 9 Dots expertise in STEAM subjects
