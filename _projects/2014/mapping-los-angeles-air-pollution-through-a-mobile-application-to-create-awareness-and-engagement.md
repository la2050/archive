    MyAir LA will provide residents of Los Angeles comprehensive information
    easily accessible through a mobile application about the manufacturing
    sources of air pollution and information about the current air quality (AQ)
    in their neighborhood. 376 facilities in the Los Angeles area report to
    EPA's Toxic Release Inventory (TRI). These facilities emitted more than 8
    million pounds of toxics into our environment in 2012 alone. With MyAir LA
    people will easily access current air quality in their location and tips to
    enable them to make healthier lifestyle choices. Users will also be able to
    upload personal tips and pictures on the mobile application and use the
    application to contact facilities directly to encourage them to reduce toxic
    releases
  implement: "We will use publicly available information available from the US EPA about Toxic Releases and Air Quality that has been made available to the public but is currently in a format relatively difficult to access and digest for most people. For example, the TRI was developed by the EPA as a tool of information disclosure to encourage low releases of air toxics by facilities but this information has not been used much by the population yet because of its complexity. Researchers and students at UCLA have recently launched a website, Cal EcoMaps, to communicate this information to the residents of Los Angeles through an interactive map. Our objective is to build on this platform to provide people with a mobile application that will provide real time information about air quality, allow users to upload their own information and access this information in various locations. \r\n\r\nThe main feature of MyAir LA mobile application, will be an interactive map displaying all the facilities in the Los Angeles area with major toxic releases and real-time updates of AQ. Associated health risks in terms of numbers of cancers based on toxic releases and sensitive populations susceptible to air pollution will be identified. The application will encompass sources of air pollution and AQ data with associated health effects and provide corresponding advice to mitigate exposure. Through MyAir LA, residents of Los Angeles will have easy access to this information at their fingertips. Once the mobile application is developed, a campaign will be undertaken to advertise it and reach out to as many people in Los Angeles as possible. Users of MyAir LA will be able to view the AQ and toxic releases in their area based on a zip code or their current location. \r\n\r\nMyAir LA will also contain additional features that will allow for community engagement, besides enhancing community awareness of air pollution. Tips for residents to lessen their negative environmental impact, especially on days with poor AQ will be provided. Alerts will be provided through the application for any spikes in worsening AQ. Users of MyAir LA will be able to upload pictures of AQ in their neighborhood and share it with other users. An important aspect of MyAir LA will be enabling users to contact companies that report to the TRI. By using the power of information disclosure residents of LA can encourage companies to adopt better environmental practices and reduce their toxic releases. \r\n"
  impact_live: "Los Angeles continues to have some of the most polluted air in the nation. We need air to survive each moment of each day and when the very thing we need to live is polluted, the quality of our life is greatly diminished. Providing TRI information and AQ information will both work towards improving the air in Los Angeles in different ways. Reducing the negative effects of air pollution will not only require public policy but will also require individual action.\r\n\r\nOur project is geared to make LA the healthiest place to live by empowering people, especially sensitive populations, with knowledge that they can act on to improve the air they breathe. Rates of childhood asthma and allergies are rapidly rising. The rates of heart disease, cerebovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cancer are growing, diseases attributed to air pollution, and the exposed population is getting larger. Many populations like young children, the elderly, pregnant women, asthma patients, patients with allergies and sensitivities are especially vulnerable to air pollution. \r\n\r\nOur project is geared to make LA the healthiest place to live by using the power of awareness to incentivize companies to improve their environmental performance. By generating awareness of air toxics and the facilities that release these toxics, companies will be likely to change their management practices to reduce their environment impact through the influence of information disclosure. Users of the mobile application will be able to take direct action by engaging with companies to encourage them to adopt better environmental practices. They will be able to provide feedback to companies and email them. Users can also take pictures in real-time and upload them onto a common map where other users can view the pictures and know the air quality in a specific location. This level of detail is not possible with AQ updates since monitoring stations in one location cover large areas of the city. Over time, the power of community awareness and engagement would lead to making LA a healthier place. \r\n"
  who_benefit: "This project is intended to benefit the common resident of Los Angeles by creating awareness of the air pollution in their neighborhoods and communities through MyAir LA. This is an especially useful tool for populations that are vulnerable to air pollution. This project has implications for the health of minorities and sensitive populations, which are adversely impacted by low air quality. Approximately 40% of California’s residents live in high traffic areas. This number is significantly higher in densely populated areas such as Los Angeles. Populations of non-white residents, minorities and low-income households are higher near major roadways almost everywhere in the nation but this disparity is much higher in the Los Angeles Metropolitan area. People of lower socio-economic status disproportionately incur the negative health effects of air pollution more than other segments of the population. It is also these families that are likely to have least access to this kind of information about air quality and have low awareness of mitigation options. By providing them with health tips to reduce their exposure they can make healthier choices. Parents can be more cognizant of what the best times are to take their children outdoors. Residents can determine what times are best for outdoor exercise. \r\n\r\nBy bringing to light data of toxic releases in our communities, facilities will be pushed to adopt more environmentally friendly practices and over time this should result in fewer toxic releases in Los Angeles. With MyAir, toxic releases can be viewed in the vicinity of schools and colleges and it is of prime importance that releases be reduced in these areas where children often spend time outdoors. With MyAir, sensitive populations can make healthier lifestyle choices before traveling or moving homes by being aware of sources of air pollution in those areas. \r\n"

  evaluate: "To begin with, this project will be evaluated by the number of people who download the MyAir mobile application. Areas of Los Angeles where the application is being accessed will also be recorded. This may highlight potential communities who do not have awareness of this application or who do not have access to the technology. This will enable us to conduct a targeted and more effective campaign in those areas if required. MyAir will also include a feedback page for users to provide comments and/or suggestions for improvement, which will then be taken into consideration as the application is improved. The features of the MyAir application that are most used will also be observed to judge the effectiveness of information communication\r\n\r\nOn the other end, the environmental performance of facilities that may be contacted by many users through the MyAir application will be observed for many changes in toxic releases. \r\n"
  two_lessons: "Learning that more than 8 million pounds of toxics were released in the Los Angeles area just in 2012 alone is shocking. Many of these toxics are carcinogens and/or harm other integral systems of the body. A preliminary analysis has also revealed that these releases are on the rise. Though facilities are required to report their releases into the air, water and land they are usually not mandated by law to reduce their releases. The TRI was developed as an information disclosure tool to encourage companies to perform better environmentally and this goal hasn’t been achieved to a great degree. Providing this information to the public so that we may all take action to reduce the toxics released into our environment was a strong motivation for developing this project. \r\n\r\nThe EPA classifies Los Angeles as being a severe non-attainment zone with regard to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Some of the most polluted air in the nation is found in the Los Angeles area. Despite tremendous efforts through public policy, the deadline for achieving compliance with the NAAQS has long passed. The problem is so big that is also it requires individual action especially in regards to protecting one’s health. As individuals, if empowered by the right information, we can take simple protective measures to reduce our exposures. Mitigation strategies exist and what remains to be done is to the bridge the gap by providing people with the knowledge of what actions they can take to protect their health. Over time, they may also be able to observe better health. The cost of this technology, and associated costs of other technology that they may adopt e.g. air filters, is greatly outweighed by the health effects and loss of productivity associated with air pollution. \r\n"
  achievable_goal: "Implementing this project within the next 12 months is a realizable goal. The data for developing the mobile application is publicly available. Additional analysis of the data to better communicate it will be required and is expected to take about a month. Developing and testing the mobile application is expected to take about 4 months. A campaign for spreading awareness about MyAir is expected to go along with the development of the mobile application and will continue even after the application is launched. The development of the project is expected to last 6 months. Beyond that, time will be spent in evaluating the success of MyAir, improving upon it and generating more awareness. \r\n\r\nThis project will be conducted under the guidance of Magali Delmas, who is a professor at the UCLA Institute of the Environment and Sustainability. Our team is comprised of three engineering graduate students and eight undergraduate students. We benefit from the support of several other faculty members at UCLA who are experts in air quality. This project will build on the Cal Ecomap platform we have developed (http://www.environment.ucla.edu/ccep/calecomaps/) and will benefit from a partnership with the US EPA TRI University Challenge, which allows us to work with EPA experts to facilitate the access to TRI and Air quality data.\r\n"
  major_challenges: "One potential barrier of this project might be the difficulty to reach out to people that do not have access to smart phones or similar hand-held devices. Though the number of people who have access to this technology has rapidly increased, low-income populations and minorities may not have as much access to this technology and they are populations that are disproportionately affected by air pollution. Current research from the Pew Foundation (http://www.pewinternet.org/) shows that in 2014, 90% of American adults have a cell phone and 58% have a smart phone. This statistic does not vary much by ethnicity with a slightly higher take up rate of smart phone within the Hispanic community (61%). Lower income populations of less than $30,000 annual income report a 47% take up rate. This provides us with still half of the population with cell phones in low income areas, which we believe will be adequate to spread the word. \r\n\r\nAnother challenge is getting up-to-date information from the TRI databank. The most recent data that exists is for 2012. The 2013 year will be available in the next few months. Our representation of the TRI data will show the last three year in order to show trends of toxic releases in the most recent years. However, the Air Quality information will be uploaded in real time. \r\n"
  competition: >-
    Though several organizations work with TRI data, providing this data through
    a mobile application and in conjunction with AQ is unique to our project.
    Detailed analysis of the data for the Los Angeles area is unique to Cal
    EcoMaps. In addition, the analysis on the TRI data is extensive and also
    involves a unique ranking methodology to encourage better environmental
    performance by facilities. 
  cost: 'This project will cost $100,000. '
  budget: "Funds of $24,976 requested to cover indirect costs based on 25% of overall TOTAL COSTS as per agency's allowance.\r\n\r\nFunds of $20,480 requested to support salary of a 50% GSR during 9 academic months at the current GSR 7 rate of $4,551/mo. Funds of $266 requested to cover GSR benefits during their employment based on campus' composite rate of 1.3%. \r\n\r\nFunds of $7,000 requested to cover materials/supplies costs for this project.  $2,000 is needed for a computer for the GSR, $1,000 is needed for the software program, and an additional $4,000 is needed to purchase a server.\r\n\r\nFunds of $52,182 requested to cover other miscellaneous costs associated with project.  $155 is needed to cover the campus' Technology Infrastructure Fees (TIF).  TIF is a consistently-applied direct charge that is assessed to each and every campus activity unit, regardless of funding source, including units identified as individual grant and contract awards. The TIF pays for campus communication services on the basis of a monthly accounting of actual usage data. These costs are charged as direct costs and are not recovered as indirect costs. This is calculated at the current rate of $34.46/mo/FTE.  $145 is needed to cover the campus' Insurance Liability charges.  Insurance Liability charges are currently calculated at $0.71/$100 in salary funds requested.  Insurance Liability is a self insurance program to cover the costs of its General Liability Program.  Charges are made as a percentage of each $100 of salary costs, and assessed to all extramural funding sources with the exception of support from the federal government, federal flow-through funds and contracts and grants from state or local governments.  Awards from non-profit and for-profit sponsors are being assessed for these general liability program costs.   $1,000 is needed to advertise (printing of posters/flyers) the mobile application tool to LA residents. $15,582 is needed to cover the GSR's annual fees ($5,194.03/qtr).  Finally, $30,300 is needed to pay an outside independent website designer at $100/hr for an estimated 303 hours to develop a new website and to make updates over the project period.\r\n"

  impact_metrics: "Exposure to air toxins will be reduced as people are given tips on how to reduce their exposure to poor quality based on the AQ information provided by monitoring stations in Los Angeles. Sensitive populations will be identified based on real-time AQ and targeted heath advice and tips to mitigate exposure will be provided through MyAir LA. \r\n\r\nOver time, toxic releases are also expected to go down as facilities in the Los Angeles are forced to adopt cleaner and more environmentally friendly practices, as information about toxic releases is more widely available. This would result in further improving the air in Los Angeles. \r\n"
Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  With a population of close to 4 million individuals, it is a stretch to make
  LA the healthiest city with campaigns and small scale projects. Rather it is
  more beneficial to approach the issue of quality of life and health care from
  a holistic point view accessible by ease from everyone while looking at
  preventative as well as clinical care. As such, we will need to approach the
  goal of a healthy city by determining metrics that are related to each other
  and their prevalence in their respective communities. 
   
   Phase 1 will consist of developing a easy to use sensor (to detect different environmental measurements) and placing said sensors in multiple communities of LA to determine the air quality, toxin levels while also measuring bike and transit scores. Sensors will provide us with live regional data as well as detailed data which to benchmark against the whole of LA as well as against other parts of LA. We will then develop an artificial intelligence program and code it within a simple mobile device application which will be created alongside the program that can be accessible across various platforms such as tablets, phones, computers, etc. The application will consist of 4 programs when opened: Eat, Health, Life, and Fitness- all of which will provide access to several different options. 
   
   Phase 2 will be establishing a wider range of local businesses to provide incentives to LA residents to one: use the app, and two: provide discounts to residents from supporting local businesses. Incentives will however be only be used for the Food and Fitness aspect of the application. Within the Health option, we will create an AI (same program with different variables) that determines preventative care for basic ailments through the use of over 1,000,000 data points from past clinical care while providing access to local and state healthcare services from which to receive care from for more severe cases.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Our project may seem like a simple application however it uses complex
  algorithms, not introduced to a free market before, to target an entire city
  rather than just concentrate on a specific group of individuals. Los Angeles
  will be the first city to have an app dedicated to its’ residents and their
  well being. It seeks to bring preventative healthcare to all (through multiple
  methods) while basic clinical care onsite to others and access to clinical
  care to those with more severe cases. The software will be ready to use upon
  release to the public as information will already have been collected for
  recommendations to be made upon individualized data points. Individuals will
  be aware of their dietary, fitness and health habits everyday and will be
  provided with recommendations and incentives along the way for improvements to
  their health. Through the integration of social networks, LA, by 2050, will be
  fully aware of their eating, fitness, and health. The AI system will have more
  than enough data points to reference to create more sophisticated regiments
  for individuals. 
   
   
   By 2050 we will have a platform with an AI that can provide healthcare to much more complex cases with the wider base of data points available by then. In terms of air pollution and water metrics, we will have determined areas in LA most prone to elevated levels of air toxins and water usage through the use of sensors which can later be placed at more locations for a very low cost. We will be able to provide the city of LA within the next 5 years a thorough recommendation for improving water conservation and addressing air quality indexes. 2050 will see a less polluted city of LA after the introduction of incentive based programs (free bikes -already in progress in conjunction with local start ups, parking etc) for communities and individuals when participating in alternative transport such as biking, walking, public transport, and carpool.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Our project aims for a top-down approach. Our aim is to initially approach
  several regions of LA for beta testing and sensor placement. This includes but
  is not limited to Westwood, Santa Monica, Venice, Downtown LA, Hollywood,
  Beverly Hills, Pacific Palisades, East LA, and Bel Air. This project will
  benefit three levels within LA. It will benefit 1) the population down to
  single individuals, 2) their respective communities and 3) City of Los
  Angeles. Based on the results from receptiveness of the population, the City
  of LA will be given extensive review and recommendations for improvement and
  or addition of low cost sensors to reduce and eliminate unhealthy air quality
  and pollution in the city. More specifically, this program will be accessible
  to anyone with a mobile device or computer ( from home, work, or pocket).
  Those without a mobile device will be able to easily access the program
  through a public library as everyones profile will be unique to them and their
  location. There is no separation of income barrier as this project is intended
  to target every individual from different communities. According to the CDC,
  obesity rates are rising in LA County–24.3% of adults while more than 20% of
  students in junior high school are obese. While this program will benefit
  everyone, there will be several more incentivized based models for age groups
  between 12-18, and 18-40.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  We are collaborating with a range of individuals and groups, all of whom who
  come from various backgrounds and expertise. All of the following
  collaborators are confirmed and all of whom we have worked with in the past on
  several successful projects. 
   UCLA Department of Medicine- Faculty members as well as leading departmental doctors will help develop the AI program for preventative and basic clinical care while advances in the program will allow for more complicated cases to be assessed by the the program. 
   UCLA Advanced Heart Failure Lab- With extensive research in social network as well as Multi-Organ Dysfunction, the lab will provide their expertise in demographic participation on a zip code level and the most effective method of targeting populations 
   UCLA School of Engineering will help acquire/ develop sensors for testing several dream metrics; walking, air, pollution, toxins etc. They will also provide us with a team of undergraduate students for continuous support throughout the development and post development phase. 
   UCLA Computer Science Department will provide us with app developers and coders who will create the UI as well as the AI program. Several students have worked for and are currently working for very successful and publicly traded startups and have extensive knowledge in AI software building and scaling such a system on a massive scale. This team will be available on hand throughout the project and after the projects success. In the past we have created for UCLA Medical Center its' first Heart Failure Calculator which uses several algorithms to determine mortality rates in patients with heart failure. 
   UCLA Sociology Department faculty members will help with analyzing complex and big data sets. 
   UCLA Life Sciences Division undergraduate students in conjunction with the School of Medicine and local fitness trainers will help develop multiple healthy dietary regiments based on user profile and needs. 
   UCLA Business School undergraduate students and graduate students will seek to further establish connections with local and corporate businesses to provide incentives for users and rewards for those that reach their target goal/metric such as weight loss, miles walked than driven, etc.
