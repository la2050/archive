Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  With a population of close to 4 million individuals, it is a stretch to make
  LA the healthiest city with campaigns and small scale projects. Rather it is
  more beneficial to approach the issue of quality of life and health care from
  a holistic point view accessible by ease from everyone while looking at
  preventative as well as clinical care. As such, we will need to approach the
  goal of a healthy city by determining metrics that are related to each other
  and their prevalence in their respective communities. 
   
   Phase 1 will consist of developing a easy to use sensor (to detect different environmental measurements) and placing said sensors in multiple communities of LA to determine the air quality, toxin levels while also measuring bike and transit scores. Sensors will provide us with live regional data as well as detailed data which to benchmark against the whole of LA as well as against other parts of LA. We will then develop an artificial intelligence program and code it within a simple mobile device application which will be created alongside the program that can be accessible across various platforms such as tablets, phones, computers, etc. The application will consist of 4 programs when opened: Eat, Health, Life, and Fitness- all of which will provide access to several different options. 
   
   Phase 2 will be establishing a wider range of local businesses to provide incentives to LA residents to one: use the app, and two: provide discounts to residents from supporting local businesses. Incentives will however be only be used for the Food and Fitness aspect of the application. Within the Health option, we will create an AI (same program with different variables) that determines preventative care for basic ailments through the use of over 1,000,000 data points from past clinical care while providing access to local and state healthcare services from which to receive care from for more severe cases.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Our project may seem like a simple application however it uses complex
  algorithms, not introduced to a free market before, to target an entire city
  rather than just concentrate on a specific group of individuals. Los Angeles
  will be the first city to have an app dedicated to its’ residents and their
  well being. It seeks to bring preventative healthcare to all (through multiple
  methods) while basic clinical care onsite to others and access to clinical
  care to those with more severe cases. The software will be ready to use upon
  release to the public as information will already have been collected for
  recommendations to be made upon individualized data points. Individuals will
  be aware of their dietary, fitness and health habits everyday and will be
  provided with recommendations and incentives along the way for improvements to
  their health. Through the integration of social networks, LA, by 2050, will be
  fully aware of their eating, fitness, and health. The AI system will have more
  than enough data points to reference to create more sophisticated regiments
  for individuals. 
   
   
   By 2050 we will have a platform with an AI that can provide healthcare to much more complex cases with the wider base of data points available by then. In terms of air pollution and water metrics, we will have determined areas in LA most prone to elevated levels of air toxins and water usage through the use of sensors which can later be placed at more locations for a very low cost. We will be able to provide the city of LA within the next 5 years a thorough recommendation for improving water conservation and addressing air quality indexes. 2050 will see a less polluted city of LA after the introduction of incentive based programs (free bikes -already in progress in conjunction with local start ups, parking etc) for communities and individuals when participating in alternative transport such as biking, walking, public transport, and carpool.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Our project aims for a top-down approach. Our aim is to initially approach
  several regions of LA for beta testing and sensor placement. This includes but
  is not limited to Westwood, Santa Monica, Venice, Downtown LA, Hollywood,
  Beverly Hills, Pacific Palisades, East LA, and Bel Air. This project will
  benefit three levels within LA. It will benefit 1) the population down to
  single individuals, 2) their respective communities and 3) City of Los
  Angeles. Based on the results from receptiveness of the population, the City
  of LA will be given extensive review and recommendations for improvement and
  or addition of low cost sensors to reduce and eliminate unhealthy air quality
  and pollution in the city. More specifically, this program will be accessible
  to anyone with a mobile device or computer ( from home, work, or pocket).
  Those without a mobile device will be able to easily access the program
  through a public library as everyones profile will be unique to them and their
  location. There is no separation of income barrier as this project is intended
  to target every individual from different communities. According to the CDC,
  obesity rates are rising in LA County–24.3% of adults while more than 20% of
  students in junior high school are obese. While this program will benefit
  everyone, there will be several more incentivized based models for age groups
  between 12-18, and 18-40.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  We are collaborating with a range of individuals and groups, all of whom who
  come from various backgrounds and expertise. All of the following
  collaborators are confirmed and all of whom we have worked with in the past on
  several successful projects. 
   UCLA Department of Medicine- Faculty members as well as leading departmental doctors will help develop the AI program for preventative and basic clinical care while advances in the program will allow for more complicated cases to be assessed by the the program. 
   UCLA Advanced Heart Failure Lab- With extensive research in social network as well as Multi-Organ Dysfunction, the lab will provide their expertise in demographic participation on a zip code level and the most effective method of targeting populations 
   UCLA School of Engineering will help acquire/ develop sensors for testing several dream metrics; walking, air, pollution, toxins etc. They will also provide us with a team of undergraduate students for continuous support throughout the development and post development phase. 
   UCLA Computer Science Department will provide us with app developers and coders who will create the UI as well as the AI program. Several students have worked for and are currently working for very successful and publicly traded startups and have extensive knowledge in AI software building and scaling such a system on a massive scale. This team will be available on hand throughout the project and after the projects success. In the past we have created for UCLA Medical Center its' first Heart Failure Calculator which uses several algorithms to determine mortality rates in patients with heart failure. 
   UCLA Sociology Department faculty members will help with analyzing complex and big data sets. 
   UCLA Life Sciences Division undergraduate students in conjunction with the School of Medicine and local fitness trainers will help develop multiple healthy dietary regiments based on user profile and needs. 
   UCLA Business School undergraduate students and graduate students will seek to further establish connections with local and corporate businesses to provide incentives for users and rewards for those that reach their target goal/metric such as weight loss, miles walked than driven, etc.
