Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  The first step is empowering people through education. World Peace One helps
  to connect the as-built environment in our communities with education through
  community-based projects. Residents who want to transform their environment
  are supported through mentoring and resources. Students in the education
  program gain academic credit in a hybrid learning environment by learning as
  well as journaling, designing, building, sculpting, growing food, coding,
  creating art, and innovating ideas for these neighborhood projects. In the
  end, residents and students form the foundation of a larger community that
  creates these innovative spaces. World Peace One classes are taught through a
  partnership with UCLA Extension, the Los Angeles City Community District, and
  iTunes University and range from a Transforming Your Community weekend boot
  camp for residents with little education to Earth Ethics for Environmental
  Design for degree-oriented learners.
   
   In addition to the Peace Projects above, Innovation hubs will be created in Los Angeles. These hubs will provide co-working space for Peace Project teams, and a nexus for classes and learning activities. Courses taught at the hub will initially focus on practical skills needed for community transformation (from the Peace Project boot camp to drafting to landscape architecture). Students and participants from the program will be encouraged to effect change in their community and provided space, mentoring, and access to potential investors to make their ideas into reality. These hubs are studios where solutions can be created, made, and innovated, including the use of new tools like 3D printing, visualization, and sustainable materials. The hubs will be operated in coordination with local government and universities. The first hub in Los Angeles is expected to be a joint venture amongst the City of Los Angeles, UCLA Extension, the Los Angeles Community College District, and World Peace One.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  World Peace One is launching a global movement for peace, reaching billions of
  people through concerts, music, games, and social media. This movement will
  focus people on envisioning how to transform their communities, cities, and
  nations into safer spaces that will unleash human innovation—giving a voice
  and power to all citizens. World Peace One Education and Communities works
  with residents, businesses, educators, and governments to transform
  neighborhoods step-by-step to more beautiful, usable, safer, eco-friendly, and
  innovative spaces. 
   
   This movement is starting here, this year, in Los Angeles, with coordinated activities next year in cities around the world. Los Angeles will be the hub, the home, and the heart of this peace movement that starts with Angelenos helping create a new city around the needs of the residents in our neighborhoods.
   
   Over the next years and decades, project by project, block by block, L.A. will transform into the city its citizens dream it can be. Through the power of music, global awareness, and planned future fund raising, these Peace Projects will create sustainable spaces in the built environment across the city. L.A. will be the global model and lead other cities in how to become both a beautiful, safer city and to empower its citizens to be engaged, transformative, educated, and active.
   
   Transforming Communities for Peace will make L.A. the city we all dream it could be.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The project benefits Angelenos who are interested in changing the environment
  and conditions in their neighborhoods in a way that will make their lives
  better. The benefactors will be those people, their families, and their
  neighbors.
   
   These people are supported by students who benefit by receiving course credit and real experience in helping to design, build, and manage projects using skills from the classroom.
   
   A greater good happens when projects happen near each other, share practices, and create a library of models and designs that help others in the future. As projects start to connect in a physical way in the city, block by block, areas will be creatively transformed by the residents themselves, supported by not driven by city planners, architects, and professional designers.
   
   L.A.'s amazing strength is the diversity of its citizens and these projects allow them to express that diversity in visible ways and to be empowered to care for, create, and be involved in their city.
   
   From that empowerment, caring citizens watch out for each other, turn out to vote, seek out education and employment, and help others to do so.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  To achieve these goals, there are a wide variety of partners ranging from the
  music production for future fund raising to implementation of Peace Projects
  and innovative hubs in Los Angeles and elsewhere.
   
   Confirmed partners include:
   
   • World Peace One (global organization for awareness and sustaining project beyond initial funding)
   • United Earth (environmental organization that focuses on Earth ethics and holistic studies of environmental impact of changes)
   • UCLA Extension (education partner, managing registration, course certification, and curricula development)
   • LATTC Architecture Program (education partner for reach to new or potential students, connection to existing programs and training)
   • City of Los Angeles (permitting, oversight for city-related projects, partner for innovation hubs, and 311 integration pilot)
   • Los Angeles WorkSource Centers (locations for initial course offerings and innovation hubs)
   • iTunes University (education partner for online courses)
   • ReelFX (media company for production of online interactive materials)
   • Los Angeles World’s Fair 2020 (community partner for collaborating on Peace Projects and larger, transformative changes in the built environment)
   • World Music Group (music partner for writing, talent management, and song, concert, and video production)
   • Advance Group Tickets, Canada (music partner for ticket sales and event management)
   • Sunbox, Portugal (music partner for event and concert production)
   • 350.org, Portugal (environmental designs, models, and best practices for eco-friendly Peace Projects)
   • ENCOUNTER Think Tank (community engagement forum held monthly since 2013 to connect partners, community service groups, and collaborators working together to effect change in L.A.)
   
   World Peace One staff have worked with all of these partners in the past, some for many years. In some cases, World Peace One staff lead these groups.
   
   Three critical factors are:
    1. Continuous connection to the residents in the communities
    2. Effective and efficient execution of Peace Projects, led by residents, that reflect cultural and other needs of the community and are designed to be sustainable
    3. Designing for the future so that projects build on each other and create designs, models, and practices that will make each project part of a larger whole
