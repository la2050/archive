Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  We are currently talking with artists and mobile/online application developers
  in Los Angeles to find competitive bids for the development of a completely
  cloud-based artist software system modeled after the our current GYSTPro
  software. Combining 15 years of research, product development, program
  enrichment, and software, the GYST infrastructure already exists, however we
  feel that a cloud-based platform is essential for the future.
   
   We will hire artist researchers to ensure that our resources are up-to-date, providing a list of arts institutions and resources building on our current lists. We will expand our existing 500+ pages of vital professional practices information currently on our website, printed manuals, and in the GYSTPro software. This expansion will help to disseminate this vast knowledge to a wider and more diverse audience. Unlike many other artwork/gallery management systems, GYST Cloud is a comprehensive one-stop-shop for every artist, not just a product inventory for traditional galleries. We specifically focus on underrepresented artists in Los Angeles emphasizing gender equality, racial/cultural diversities, and artists of any age. 
   
   In addition, GYST Cloud will provide low-cost and high-quality backups of all user data. Connecting to other preexisting successful networking, accounting and social media apps will also be integrated. Existing GYST users will have the option to migrate to the new GYST Cloud and/or keep their data local. 
   
   The GYST Cloud will be delivered to any artist through remote access from any computer. We will also continue to grow our network of creative professionals, administrators, educators, lawyers, and fabricators. This ultimately ensures a robust and thriving online network that connects creatives from the digital art community into its physical counterpart. We plan to host scheduled workshops and free information sessions throughout the city. GYST will raise awareness and educate the public about GYST Cloud that will be readily available at income-based pricing.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  GYST has respect for the wide-ranging diversity of the arts in Los Angeles by
  makes life better for all artists and creative professionals. There are
  multiple obstacles to overcome to achieve a successful career in the arts such
  as: income, knowledge, resources, organization, access to gatekeepers,
  collaborators and communication. GYST Cloud will be a vital contributor to
  helping artists navigate these professional challenges. 
   
   Our organization and the GYST Cloud will simply create better artists. Ultimately creating Los Angeles as the best place for all artists to flourish. GYST provides art business education and resources so that all art communities that reside within LA can directly benefit. GYST Cloud will generate a more organized, prepared, and business-ready artist that will be hirable and thrive in the Los Angeles workforce with our income-based subscriptions. The art world is not currently functioning and communicating on current technology available today. Although companies, organizations, and programs exist to facilitate professional practices for artists, many fail to reach and connect ALL types of artists. The GYST Cloud will be a comprehensive and intuitive software platform that will bridge the gap between artists and the professionals that want to exhibit, review, consult, and/or hire them. 
    
   While many other cities have a clearly defined city center or “art hub”, Los Angeles lacks a central location where the art world(s) reside. Conversely, art communities exist across the vast Los Angeles Basin from Bergamot Station, Culver City, Downtown, Venice, to Chinatown and the Arts District. The GYST Cloud will provide a universal platform for all Los Angeles art communities to connect, learn, share, and hire any artist, anywhere. 
     
   In 2050, with the help of GYST Cloud and its ever-growing network of creative professionals, we want all artists to have their sh*t together. Artists will be valued and respected along with any other profession, leading sustaining art practices and careers. Simply, all Angelino artists and art professionals will have access to professional practices. They will be educated and informed to make the right and smart decisions for their careers in the arts. Furthermore, the public will benefit with immersive exposure and understanding of the arts.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Artists need tools to streamline the process of the exchange of information to
  create sustainability, knowledge and income for all involved. GYST Cloud will
  benefit all individuals, academic institutions, organizations, and businesses
  through universal technology, current relevant content, pedagogy and
  networking. 
   
   ARTISTS will benefit from learning professional strategies, understand how business professionals work with artists, and get their studio practice organized. They will have the means to professionally present their work and skills to others. Artists benefit from being prepared for hybrid careers, business strategies/systems and estate planning. 
   
   GALLERIES can keep track of work sold, connect with collectors and always have information ready to find for presentation or sale. Galleries will communicate with their artists through intergraded cloud-based networks. They will be able to communicate with other galleries to share contacts and data.
   
   CURATORS will have direct access to more artists in LA. Exchanging information and contacts will be easy to curate exhibitions through the GYST Cloud. Not only will they have the ability to organize artists but they will also keep track of exhibition information and writing samples. 
   
   COLLECTORS can effortlessly keep track of their collections. The GYST Cloud archives important information such as current retail values, insurance, exhibition records, and storage. 
   
   MUSEUMS will be able to catalog collections, communicate with curators and trustees, and promote museum programming and cultural events to their patrons.
   
   ARTS ORGANIZATIONS can keep track of programming, exhibitions, monetary donations/contributions, and research. Beyond historical archiving, posting opportunities, open-calls, and promoting the institution will be included.
   
   EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS can teach professional practices to their students by giving them access to the GYST Cloud. Using GYST to catalog their artwork, create artist statements, resumes, mailing lists etc. GYST Cloud provides real-world resources to help all schools educate artists in a visual way.
   
   THE GENERAL PUBLIC can find work/programs and connect with artists directly. GYST Cloud can be used as an educational tool for audiences who seek to understand more about an artists’ work as well as cultural institutions. GYST Cloud will expand art audiences in Los Angeles and generate new collectors in the process.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  We have been collaborating for 15 years with arts professionals to get to this
  point. Moving forward we will collaborate with:
   
   TECH ARTISTS: We will be working with artists who have the technical experience to migrate the existing local GYSTPro software to GYST Cloud. Since the design and infrastructure is already complete, we can spend our energy on new technologies, mobile platforms, and how the interface will work with our diverse clientele.
   
   ARTIST RESEARCHERS: We will be working with artist researchers to create fresh content, resources, and information for arts professionals. Meeting directly with art administrators, curators, non-profits, educators, lawyers, healthcare professionals, and studio artists allows GYST Cloud to stay current, up-to-date, relevant in the ever-changing art world.
   
   USERS (YOU): We will invite our existing individual and organization users (over 2,350) and new clients to beta test GYST Cloud. Further funding from others who donate towards the support of low-income artists, as well as the income-based subscription model will allow this project to be sustainable for future generations. Establishing responsibility within the art community, we will invite users to self-determine their own level of income and therefore their subscription price.
