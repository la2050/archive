Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  PortTech’s concentrated effort to identify, attract and retain qualified
  startups centers around the PortTech Pitch program. The first step of the
  program is attracting entrepreneurs. PortTech connects with Southern
  California’s research universities, investment groups, the clean tech
  entrepreneurial community, and industry organizations to seek out potential
  candidates. We participate in groups such as the Los Angeles Venture
  Association and Cleantech Open. 
   
   This outreach strategy allows PortTech advisors to broadcast the message of innovation and business opportunities in the Harbor area to more than 3,000 entrepreneurs annually. Through presentations and event networking, we highlight the benefits of participating in the PortTech Pitch. This tailored coaching program provides startups with one-on-one mentoring, constructive critiques and mock judging sessions. Pitch competition finalists have the chance to present to a panel comprised of investors, advisors and representatives of Southern California’s ports.
   
   PortTech Pitch draws upwards of 100 startup applicants each year. The program allows staff to evaluate entrepreneurs’ business plans, validate new technologies and assess each startup’s potential for advancing innovation and solving environmental challenges in and around the ports. Through the PortTech Pitch assessment process, PortTech identifies the best startups to participate in the finals and become PortTech clients.
   
   Finalists also participate in the PortTechEXPO, an annual event that provides technology companies and entrepreneurs the chance to connect with business prospects at Southern California’s ports. The EXPO features live demonstrations, interactive displays and the best technology advancements for ports worldwide. With more than 600 attendees and 60 exhibitors, the EXPO provides entrepreneurs the opportunity to showcase their technology advancements to an audience of port executives, industry leaders, and community members.
   
   Beyond the PortTech Pitch program, PortTech continues to support portfolio clients. PortTech hosts an array of forums and workshops to foster a collaborative working environment and provide entrepreneurs continued access to port executives, government agency representatives, mentors and investors, researchers and industry leaders.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  In 2009, the business and community leaders of San Pedro and Wilmington
  envisioned a future where creative entrepreneurs would solve major
  environmental challenges facing port communities while at the same time create
  living-wage “green collar” jobs for area residents. The path to realizing that
  vision began with PortTech. 
   
   PortTech’s mission is to foster and grow startup companies that address the opportunities and challenges in and around the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. These companies assist the ports in achieving their environment, energy, transportation and safety/security goals and in the process help make healthier communities.
   
   In addition, as entrepreneurs succeed they contribute to the local economy by building thriving businesses. This creates jobs and improves economic growth activities in the marginalized communities adjacent to the ports, including San Pedro, Wilmington, Harbor City / Harbor Gateway and Long Beach. These jobs will elevate the types of employment positions available and provide residents the chance to become part of an advanced workforce and participate in the 21st Century’s technology economy.
   
   Looking forward to 2050, PortTech will be the nexus of a thriving technology and advanced manufacturing-based business cluster. Numerous businesses, large and small, will be focused on addressing the global challenges and opportunities of port and maritime-related industries. And the Harbor area will be an economic development engine in the Los Angeles region – creating jobs and generating wealth for these communities. 
   
   In our LA2050 Vision, PortTech helps transform:
   • researchers/innovators into successful entrepreneurs
   • clean technology entrepreneurs into advanced manufacturing leaders
   • harbor area youth into career-focused skilled workforce
   • demonstration/pilot projects into commercialized products/services
   • port-focused innovations into environmental solutions distributed worldwide
   • declining industrial neighborhoods into thriving “clean economy” regions
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: |-
  Entrepreneurs:
   Through meetings, events and workshops we advise and support 80 to 100 start-ups each year. At any given time, PortTech provides one-on-one mentoring to approximately 20 portfolio clients in-house and virtually.
   
   Harbor Area Communities:
   As entrepreneurs succeed they contribute to the local economy by building thriving businesses. As these growing companies hire their workforce from the Harbor area, communities such as San Pedro, Wilmington and Long Beach benefit. According to the 2013 LA City Council Districts Economic Report, residents of CD15, which connects South Los Angeles with the communities surrounding the Port of Los Angeles, earn average annual wages well below the City average. 
   
   Conversely, clean tech jobs offer more opportunities and better pay for low- and middle-skilled workers than the national economy as a whole. In “Sizing the Clean Economy,” The Brookings Institution noted that wages in the clean economy are 13% higher than the national median wage. Furthermore, 26% of these jobs are focused on manufacturing. With the loss of the shipbuilding industry, manufacturing has declined in LA’s port communities. PortTech can help reverse that trend while helping to define LA as a leader in advance manufacturing, technology and innovation. 
   
   The youth of our Harbor area communities have the most to gain. With an average of 24 years of age, the Harbor community of Wilmington has one of the youngest populations in the county. They represent LA’s future workforce and they’re the ones PortTech’s clients will be looking to fill these new technology and advanced manufacturing jobs.
   
   Greater Los Angeles Region and Beyond:
   PortTech is a collaborative organization. We connect entrepreneurs, mentors and investors, industry professionals, academic visionaries, community leaders and students.
   
   In 2013, we reached:
   • 3,000+ entrepreneurs who learned about environmental and economic opportunities at Southern California ports 
   • 2,000+ professionals who attended PortTechEXPO, forums, workshops and networking events
   • 200+ high school and college students who met entrepreneurs and industry leaders
   
   The green/clean economy – producing goods and services with an environmental benefit – is the focus of PortTech clients’ innovations. As PortTech companies implement their technologies into the marketplace, we all enjoy the environmental benefits of improved air and water quality, and more efficient use of Earth’s resources.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Collaboration is critical – both to successfully supporting entrepreneurs and
  to our survival as an organization. PortTech’s founding sponsors include the
  City of Los Angeles, The Port of Los Angeles and the Chambers of Commerce of
  San Pedro and Wilmington. However, as we began to implement our programs,
  PortTech quickly realized that the environmental challenges and opportunities
  did not stop at Los Angeles’ border. 
   
   We work with the Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach Technology Advancement Program (TAP), as well as numerous port tenant companies including terminal operators and trucking companies to implement technology pilot projects. We’re also building relationships with ports beyond Southern California to increase business opportunities for portfolio clients.
   
   Through our partnerships with major Southern California universities, including USC, UCLA and Caltech, we connect student and faculty researchers with real-world business opportunities to support technology commercialization. And our outreach efforts to area colleges and high schools are establishing connections to future entrepreneurs and a skilled workforce.
   
   Volunteer mentors from service business professionals and investor organizations such as Los Angeles Venture Association and Pasadena Angels provide our entrepreneurs with expert advice across a wide range of topics from intellectual property to finance to marketing.
   
   Relationships with government agencies, elected officials, industry and community groups, and business incubator organizations all make up the ecosystem of resources that help our entrepreneurs thrive. With funding from agencies such as the California Energy Commission, U.S. Department of Energy and South Coast Air Quality Management District, our entrepreneurs advance R&D efforts and commercialize their technologies. 
   
   And finally, as a public-private partnership, PortTech can continue to further its mission through support from philanthropic and corporate sponsorships, and industry collaboration.
