What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Is the best place to play a place that fosters violence and cruelty, or one
  wherein compassion and empathy are commonplace? 
   
   For years, both spcaLA and Salesian Boys & Girls Club have been empowering youth in at-risk communities to be compassionate leaders. Now, two of Los Angeles’ finest nonprofit organizations have joined together to offer programming aimed at prevention and early intervention – of violence. 
   
   Our two groups recently collaborated to offer spcaLA’s award-winning violence-prevention program, “Teaching Love & Compassion” (TLC) ™ at the Salesian Boys & Girls Club. Kids in spcaLA TLC programs work to gain empathy, coping skills, and self-esteem through a pro-hero, anti-bullying curriculum involving work with shelter dogs. Students take pre and post surveys to measure empathy, and invariably, empathy increases. In fact, TLC has been so successful spcaLA worked with the Juvenile Division of the Los Angeles Superior Court and the Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office to offer a similar program as part of probation for some juvenile offenders (often convicted of bullying, assault, and animal cruelty offenses). 
   
   But, despite the success of TLC at Salesian Boys & Girls Club, we want more. 
   
   spcaLA and Salesian Boys & Girls Club want to rekindle empathy and break the cycle of violence on a larger scale. We envision a program that would take the successes of spcaLA’s violence-prevention programs to a wider audience – giving educators the tools to teach a humane education and violence prevention course, without the involvement of an animal shelter, its staff or animals. 
   
   With your help, we will work to break the cycle of violence, and empower a generation of kids to be thought leaders in their communities. We will help them to rekindle their empathy and speak up for those who have no voice. We will prevent crime through compassion, and intervene before youthful transgressions become adult patterns of criminal behavior.
   
   If we increase the level of empathy in a generation of children, they will be less likely to perpetrate or be convicted of violent crimes as juveniles and adults, making their communities safe places to play. They will stand up for the weak and victimized - reporting crime. Further, through a childhood of involvement in community groups, like the Salesian Boys & Girls Club, Generation Empathy® kids will be civic leaders, committed to the improvement and revitalization of their neighborhoods.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Partner organizations primarily serve the Boyle Heights community of Los
  Angeles. Demographically, Boyle Heights is a primarily Latino (approximately
  94%), young (median age 30 years) neighborhood. Residents have an increased
  likelihood not to have completed high school, and more of the community lives
  below the poverty level, as compared to rest of Los Angeles. Further, the area
  reports a higher-than-average rate of violent crime. The initial target
  population for Generation Empathy® will be a few groups of students at
  Salesian Boys & Girls Club. Then, after pilot testing, the target population
  will potentially grow to the 1,350 students in Volunteers of America Head
  Start programs (ages 3-5), 200 students in St. Mary’s and Resurrection schools
  (K-8), and 3,000 students in “After the Bell” at Roosevelt High School.
  Generation Empathy® can be further offered to school districts, early
  education centers, clubs and other institutions locally and nationally.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: |-
  Partner:
   Salesian Boys & Girls Club of Los Angeles has been inspiring and enabling the young people of East Los Angeles and the surrounding communities to realize their full potential as productive, responsible and caring citizens, and supporting their families in this effort since 1966 (Tax ID 95-2430743). spcaLA has been working with Salesian Boys & Girls Club for some time, to weave violence-prevention lessons into ongoing programs.
   
   Three factors critical to the success of our proposed collaboration.
   1. Common goals - to help rekindle empathy in a generation of youth.
   2. Proven track record - spcaLA and Salesian Boys & Girls Club work well together to offer violence-prevention programs.
   3. Community involvement - the partnership and potential program is supported by the Boyle Heights Neighborhood Coalition, affording Generation Empathy® the support of the Boyle Heights community at large.
   
   Collaborators - Salesian Boys & Girls Club has ongoing relationship with collaborator organizations, who serve the greater Boyle Heights area.
