  impact_play: "Is the best place to play a place that fosters violence and cruelty, or one wherein compassion and empathy are commonplace?  \r\n\r\nFor years, both spcaLA and Salesian Boys & Girls Club have been empowering youth in at-risk communities to be compassionate leaders.  Now, two of Los Angeles’ finest nonprofit organizations have joined together to offer programming aimed at prevention and early intervention – of violence. \r\n\r\nOur two groups recently collaborated to offer spcaLA’s award-winning violence-prevention program, “Teaching Love & Compassion” (TLC) ™ at the Salesian Boys & Girls Club.  Kids in spcaLA TLC programs work to gain empathy, coping skills, and self-esteem through a pro-hero, anti-bullying curriculum involving work with shelter dogs.  Students take pre and post surveys to measure empathy, and invariably, empathy increases.  In fact, TLC has been so successful spcaLA worked with the Juvenile Division of the Los Angeles Superior Court and the Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office to offer a similar program as part of probation for some juvenile offenders (often convicted of bullying, assault, and animal cruelty offenses).  \r\n\r\nBut, despite the success of TLC at Salesian Boys & Girls Club, we want more. \r\n\r\nspcaLA and Salesian Boys & Girls Club want to rekindle empathy and break the cycle of violence on a larger scale.

We will help them to rekindle their empathy and speak up for those who have no voice.  We will prevent crime through compassion, and intervene before youthful transgressions become adult patterns of criminal behavior.\r\n\r\nIf we increase the level of empathy in a generation of children, they will be less likely to perpetrate or be convicted of violent crimes as juveniles and adults, making their communities safe places to play.

    The Generation Empathy® program is a collaborative effort by spcaLA and
    Salesian Boys & Girls Club, to allow educators to increase empathy, thereby
    preventing violence, by offering a pro-hero, anti-bullying curriculum in the
    classroom, based on spcaLA’s award-winning Teaching Love and Compassion
    (TLC) ™ program.

  who_benefit: >-
    Partner organizations primarily serve the Boyle Heights community of Los
    Angeles.  Demographically, Boyle Heights is a primarily Latino
    (approximately 94%), young (median age 30 years) neighborhood.  Residents
    have an increased likelihood not to have completed high school, and more of
    the community lives below the poverty level, as compared to rest of Los
    Angeles.  Further, the area reports a higher-than-average rate of violent
    crime.   The initial target population for Generation Empathy® will be a few
    groups of students at Salesian Boys & Girls Club.  Then, after pilot
    testing, the target population will potentially grow to the 1,350 students
    in Volunteers of America Head Start programs (ages 3-5), 200 students in St.
    Mary’s and Resurrection schools (K-8), and 3,000 students in “After the
    Bell” at Roosevelt High School.  Generation Empathy® can be further offered
    to school districts, early education centers, clubs and other institutions
    locally and nationally. 
  partners_collaboration: "Partner:\r\nSalesian Boys & Girls Club of Los Angeles has been inspiring and enabling the young people of East Los Angeles and the surrounding communities to realize their full potential as productive, responsible and caring citizens, and supporting their families in this effort since 1966 (Tax ID 95-2430743).  spcaLA has been working with Salesian Boys & Girls Club for some time, to weave violence-prevention lessons into ongoing programs.\r\n\r\nThree factors critical to the success of our proposed collaboration.\r\n1.  Common goals - to help rekindle empathy in a generation of youth.\r\n2.  Proven track record - spcaLA and Salesian Boys & Girls Club work well together to offer violence-prevention programs.\r\n3.  Community involvement - the partnership and potential program is supported by the Boyle Heights Neighborhood Coalition, affording Generation Empathy® the support of the Boyle Heights community at large.\r\n\r\nCollaborators - Salesian Boys & Girls Club has ongoing relationship with collaborator organizations, who serve the greater Boyle Heights area.\r\n\r\nVolunteers of America\r\nSaint Mary’s Church\r\nResurrection Church\r\nBoyle Heights Neighborhood Coalition\r\nRoosevelt High School \r\n"

  evaluate: "With your help, we can effectively operate the pilot Generation\r\nEmpathy® program in Boyle Heights, measure its impact, and its\r\npotential for implementation on a wide scale.\r\nData points will include:\r\n• Pre-/Post-Surveys (Bryant Empathy Index)\r\nAnd may also include:\r\n• Rate of juvenile crime\r\n• Incidents of dog bites\r\n• Reports of animal cruelty\r\n• Animal Care Services data (intake/dogs reported by kids)\r\n• Adoptability/return rate for dogs in the program\r\n• Community initiatives started by kids (fence fixing, spay/neuter, etc)"
  two_lessons: "Students in spcaLA TLC sessions take pre- and post- surveys to\r\nmeasure empathy, and invariably, empathy increases. In fact, TLC\r\nhas been so successful spcaLA worked with the Juvenile Division of\r\nthe Los Angeles Superior Court and the Los Angeles District\r\nAttorney’s Office to offer a similar program as part of probation for\r\nsome juvenile offenders (often convicted of bullying, assault, and\r\nanimal cruelty offenses), called jTLC.\r\n\r\nStudents who completed spcaLA's jTLC as a condition of their\r\nprobation reduced their recidivism rate by half, as compared to their\r\npeers who did not (from a 15% rate to a 7% rate of recidivism).\r\n\r\nAs part of her doctoral dissertation research, spcaLA Director of\r\nHumane Education Melanie Wagner, Ph.D., M.S. Ed, evaluated the\r\npre- and post- surveys participants in jTLC took, to measure empathy\r\n(Bryant Empathy Index). The results are compelling: students\r\nexpressed an increase in empathy after completing jTLC (p<.01 for\r\nall cases).\r\n\r\nResults of TLC survey evaluation also indicate that TLC students\r\nincrease their knowledge of responsible pet care, diminish their fear\r\nof dogs, and learn that there are alternatives to violence. An ancillary\r\nbenefit of the program is that many of the TLC participants have\r\nincreased their reading and writing scores on standardized tests.\r\n\r\nThese findings, coupled with years of anecdotal evidence of children considering the feelings for others after being given access to violence-prevention education, suggest that reigniting empathy will help to improve the safety of our communities, and make ours a more humane world.  \r\n\r\nAfter the success at the Salesian Boys & Girls Club, we determined these lessons could be given to kids in at-risk communities on a larger scale."
  achievable_goal: >-
    spcaLA and Salesian Boys & Girls Club, as well as our partner organizations,
    are committed to increasing empathy in kids in at-risk communities, like the
    Boyle Heights area of Los Angeles.  As such, we are firmly committed to the
    project, and are ready to begin implementation as soon as funding is
    secured.  
  major_challenges: "Current challenges we anticipate for Generation Empathy® include funding and onboarding for new educational institutions.\r\n\r\nspcaLA and Salesian Boys & Girls Club are dedicated to the program, and work both independently and collaboratively to solicit and secure program-specific funding.\r\n\r\nspcaLA and Salesian Boys & Girls Club plan to leverage existing relationships with educational institutions, and show successes of pilot Generation Empathy® sessions, to grow the program to the greater Los Angeles area and beyond."
  competition: "From the beginning, spcaLA has been a pioneer in humane\r\neducation, working to cure violence by increasing empathy. spcaLA\r\nacted when the evidence about the connection between violence\r\ntoward people and violence toward animals mounted.\r\n\r\nDeveloped by spcaLA in 1996, the TLC program was the first of its\r\nsort in the nation. spcaLA’s TLC program has been so successful, it\r\nis now taught in worldwide. Further, jTLC is the only program of its\r\nkind in the United States.\r\n\r\nGeneration Empathy® will create a new definition of performance, as\r\nit is a new frontier in violence-prevention. It is a pilot program, that will\r\nbring the lessons, benefits, and successes of spcaLA's TLC\r\nprograms to the classroom, in a way that has not been attempted\r\nbefore."
  cost: >-
    The realization of Generation Empathy® will likely cost more than $100,000,
    especially as it grows and becomes a staple of Los Angeles, and eventually
    the nation.  spcaLA and Salesian Boys & Girls Club are committed to the
    program, and are collectively and independently working to secure
    program-specific funding.  
  budget: "In the pilot phase of Generation Empathy®, much of the $100,000 grant would be used for staffing - both in the curriculum development stages and then later to hire program-specific staff to teach the program in partner organizations, and/or to teach educators how to offer the Generation Empathy® program.  A portion of the funding would be used for supplies, and other program costs.  The spcaLA Humane Education budget follows. \r\n\r\nPersonnel: 255,020\r\nContract Services: 16,500\r\nSupplies:4,916\r\nTelecommunications:4,569\r\nPostage & Shipping:1,062\r\nRent and occupancy:17,718\r\nEquipment rental & maintenance:6,529\r\nDepreciation:738\r\nTravel:420\r\nConferences, meetings:5,550\r\nOther: 8,523"

  impact_metrics: "After School Programs: The pilot Generation Empathy® program will be held at the Salesian Boys & Girls Club (most offerings are over the summer or after-school), and the success of the program will help to enroll more kids in similar programs.  \r\n\r\nPer capita crimes: If the program is successful in reigniting empathy in a generation of young people, they will break the cycle of violence, and be less likely to commit violent crime.  Further, they will be more likely to want to stand up for those who are victimized or hurt, and may be more likely to intervene and/or report crime happening in their neighborhoods.  \r\n\r\nPercentage of residents that feel safe in their neighborhoods: communities in which a generation of youth is comprised of compassionate individuals will lead to more people feeling safe in their neighborhoods.  Not only will these youths be less likely to commit crime, and more likely to intervene when they see it happening, they will also have the added benefit of understanding the importance of proper pet care and animal handling.  They will know how to correctly handle the issues of stray or dangerous animals.  As adults, they will be more likely to have their pets spayed/neutered, and will be more likely to treat pets as members of the family. \r\nBryant Empathy Index: students who participate in Generation Empathy® will express a higher degree of capacity after having completed it (pre-/post- surveys)"
