Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Our organizing teams will recruit a diverse range of unemployed,
  underemployed, and undereducated young adults in each community we visit.
  Weâ€™ll particularly focus on gaining participation of traditionally
  underrepresented young adults including young Latinos, young
  African-Americans, young parents, community college and other non-traditional
  students, foster youth, young immigrants, and young workers. The Tour stops
  and stories will be both compelling and timely, and will drive significant
  media coverage to the issue and to accompanying solutions. At the same time,
  our policy team will provide the background research needed to accompany the
  Tour and resulting Agenda.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Our Tour stops will also provide a means for the most impacted young adults to
  offer feedback on and build support for state and local workforce development
  solutions amongst relevant stakeholders, including employers. Together these
  policies will help to shape our policy agenda, which we can highlight in our
  networks and through the media, and build public. Our 5 LA Tour Stops will
  focus specifically on local challenges and local solutions. In addition, Young
  Invincibles will publish research predicting the economic consequences of
  youth unemployment in Los Angeles and localized specific youth unemployment
  fact sheets, providing participants at tour stops the ability to localize the
  serious challenges facing our generation.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: |-
  Our project will benefit:
   
   - The trained young leaders who can advocate for our agenda going forward.
   - Policymakers and stakeholders as they gain an understanding of key issues and challenges facing young people seeking employment pathways.
   - Young unemployed and underemployed adults from the communities we focus on.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Young Invincibles has a strong track record of working effectively and closely
  with diverse partners, from local service providers to statewide advocates to
  employers, across all our campaigns. For this project, our goal is to partner
  with no less than 5 organizations already advocating for and addressing the
  needs of unemployed and underemployed young adults in Los Angeles. In each
  community on the Tour, we will work with local partners to amplify the voices
  of unemployed, underemployed, and undereducated youth in the community and
  their desire to work. We also intend to incorporate employers in the
  conversation and stakeholder engagement, as we know that it is important to
  include them in the conversation.
