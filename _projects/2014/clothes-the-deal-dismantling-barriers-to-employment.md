    Clothes The Deal empowers individuals to achieve economic self-sufficiency
    by collaborating with employment programs and providing resources
  more_detail: "We partner with employment and vocational programs in Los Angeles, providing business clothing and job preparation workshops to their clients. We address specific barriers that interfere with employment opportunities to those who are low-income and cannot afford professional attire, those who have spent a long period of time out of the workplace and need instruction on business attire and etiquette, and those who are socially disadvantaged. Clients who may be equally qualified with competing job applicants will lose job opportunities if they cannot present a professional image. \r\nWe would like to expand our community outreach, in order to serve more people in need and get more members of the community involved."
  implement: "Clothes The Deal currently has two programs that we would like to expand: the Business Clothing Program and the Dress to Impress Workshops.\r\n\r\nBusiness Clothing Program: Through a network of corporate clothing drives, donation drop-off locations, and donations directly from local manufacturers and retailers, we are able to collect ready-to-wear items for thousands of job ready clients. We hope to partner with more businesses and organizations throughout the LA community. \r\n\r\nDress To Impress Workshops: These workshops are designed to help educate and enhance the participant's self-esteem and professional image for job interviews. Topics include business wardrobe, business etiquette, self-confidence, hygiene, skin and hair care. Workshops are interactive public forums for discussion of dress codes in various work environments. Also addressed is non-verbal and visual communication between coworkers/customers/clients, sample scenarios, problem solving situations and team building activities. We make it easy for participants to attend a workshop by bringing the clothing and services to them."
  impact_live: "Today, we aim to help individuals get back on their feet and gain employment. Subsequently, we hope to decrease the number of people living on the streets and the number of families who live below the poverty threshold. In addition to higher living wages, they will ultimately achieve a higher quality of life for themselves and their families through things such as obtaining health insurance, purchasing healthy foods, and providing/obtaining a quality education.\r\n\r\nThe more people that we empower today by supporting them in their path back to the workforce, the more leaders and contributors we are cultivating for our communities tomorrow. By 2050, we hope that not only are local businesses and organizations invested in their communities but that the residents we empowered will contribute and help their communities grow. With more people in the workforce, we envision safer neighborhoods, no food deserts, and a higher quality of life for all."
  who_benefit: "We serve low-income individuals in all of Los Angeles County. Men and women, old and young, people of all nationalities qualify for our services.\r\n\r\nClients must be: \r\n1) low-income (according to the Federal Health & Human Services poverty guidelines)\r\n2) currently unemployed\r\n3) enrolled in an employment program, vocational training or educational institution\r\n\r\nSome of the clients that we have had and currently have include veterans, homeless individuals, at-risk youth, mentally or physically disabled individuals, those recovering from mental illness or substance abuse, and foster youth.\r\n"
  partners_collaboration: "We have partnerships with many programs and non-profits throughout the county. An example of a few agencies we collaborate with are LA Works, Children's Institute Inc., LA County of Education, The Salvation Army Bell Shelter, Single Room Occupancy Inc., Substance Abuse Foundation, U.S. Veterans Initiative, and Volunteers of America.\r\n\r\nOur partners provide clients and ensure that they are low-income and searching for employment. By partnering with a number of agencies, we are able to provide services to a diverse population of people coming from different backgrounds and histories. A few of our partners are also able to provide funding for their clients, allowing us to reach a greater amount of people in Los Angeles by using our resources on those who cannot provide their own funding.\r\n\r\nWe also aim to collaborate with the community. We attend many networking events focused on employment and vocational programs, including those hosted by POWER (Providing Opportunities with Essential Resources), LA United Job Creation Council and the Department of Mental Health. Local businesses and organizations also provide clothing donations and host clothing drivers. Annually, we have about 40 volunteers serve a total of 5,550 hours. Volunteers include youth interns, community service volunteers, Temporary Subsidized Employees, and ReEmployability employees. "

  evaluate: "Goal 1: Service to 700 low-income clients. \r\nMethod (of evaluation): Income verification documents (TANF Notice of Action, General Relief Notice of Action, SSI Notice of Action, 2 month pay stubs). Collaborating agencies will assist with supplying income documentation.\r\n\r\n Goal 2: Job placement rates. \r\nMethod: Job placement rates. Clothes The Deal will evaluate job placement from a field sample of 400 clients out of the 700 served from the project. Client data base will be maintained and updated. \r\n\r\n Goal 3: Increased employment opportunities. \r\nMethod: Pre and post service questionnaires will be collected and evaluated to measure changes in various success indicators. Workshop questionnaires will measure information retained from workshops. \r\n\r\n Clothes The Deal will update evaluations with quarterly reports and a final end of project report. Clients served from the project will also have the opportunity to voluntarily provide written, audio and video testimonials to share their stories. "
  two_lessons: "This organization was founded by a student of UCLA Anderson School of Business in 1995 as part of a school project. She distributed needs assessments to different organizations around the city and found that though there were many employment services, they reported that their participants were in need of professional attire and etiquette for job interviews.\r\n\r\nIn the past, our primary donors have had prior relationships with officers on our Board of Directors. However, we realize that in order to be a sustainable organization, we need to keep building and maintaining relationships with local businesses, organizations and our community members. In order to do so, we need to "
  achievable_goal: >-
    We already have established relationships and partnerships with groups from
    different sectors of Los Angeles County. This particular project is aimed at
    becoming a more sustainable resource for the city, serving a greater number
    of people in need as well as increasing our community outreach. The funds
    from this grant will help us utilize social media more effectively and
    re-market our organization. We will also be able to provide more workshops
    to more people, helping to strengthen our relationship with existing
    partners and network/build relationships with new agencies. Because we are
    not starting from the ground up and already have a focus for the year,
    expanding our reach and our organization can easily be done in 12 months. 
  major_challenges: "1) Securing funds to ensure that our organization remains sustainable through the years.\r\n2) Community Outreach"
  competition: "There are a few other similar organizations in the LA/OC area. For example, Dress to Impress operates in North Hollywood locations. However, they only serve women. We serve people of all genders, nationalities, and ages. Working Wardrobes only operates in Orange County and does not accept walk-in clients, only those coming from their partnering agencies. Although we do work to collaborate with any non-profit referring low-income clients, our services are not contingent on a funding agreement. This is the biggest difference between Clothes The Deal and Working Wardrobes.\r\n\r\nOther things that differentiate us from other organizations is that we partner with dozens of different agencies throughout the county. With what we provide, these organizations are able to provide wrap-around services for their clients. In addition to the main boutique we have at our office in Downey, we also have satellite boutiques around the city that provide clothing to those who may live further from the Downey area. "
  cost: >-
    This project is estimated to cost about $160,000 for one year. We will be
    receiving another foundation grant and we also have a government contract.
    About $48,000 will be received through in-kind donations for our warehouse
    and business clothing. The clothing donations will be acquired through
    corporate clothing drives, clothing drop-off boxes located in local
    businesses, and donated directly from manufacturers and retailers in the LA
    area.

  impact_metrics: >-
    By providing business clothing and employment services, we arm low-income
    jobseekers with the tools necessary to obtain employment. We currently have
    about a 65% success rate in participants obtaining employment after
    receiving clothing and/or attending one of our workshops. Our primary goal
    is to aid in decreasing the rate of unemployment in LA, which currently is
    higher than the national average. Through obtaining job security, some of
    our clients who were once homeless are able to subsequently obtain housing
    and other clients have risen out of the poverty threshold. 
Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Through the volunteer health volunteers, it provides basic ambulatory,
  hypertension, diabetic, vision, women’s health, acupuncture and chiropractic
  care to adults. The Eye Clinic provides eye exams, glaucoma testing and
  prescription glasses free of charge to all patients. Vision services are also
  provided to children. When more specialized services are needed, the patients
  are given referrals to appropriate nearby facilities.
    While the MEND health service programs extend over the wide range of illnesses and treatments of young children through seniors, a significant percentage of MEND’s medical activity is extended to the diagnosis and the treatment of hypertension and diabetes prevalent in the dominantly Hispanic population of the northeast San Fernando Valley. Nearly one-third of the MEND medical cash budget is directed to diabetic medications. The MEND Medical Volunteers have designed and implemented a comprehensive medical program that provides health care to poor uninsured families living in the northeast San Fernando Valley. The group includes physicians, doctors of optometry, a doctor of chiropractic, an acupuncturist, nurse practitioners and RN's, 
    Through a Holistic Approach, the Medical Clinic provides health education and exercise classes, including specialty clinics for diabetes, hypertension, women’s health and healthy aging; and has recently launched a 4-month Weight Management Course, the objective of which is to educate obese patients on nutrition and exercise, in a culturally-sensitive manner while helping them adopt lifestyle changes that can help them lose the excess weight. Our plan is to rotate 15 patients every 4 months through the course with the goal of helping them lose 10 pounds or lower their BMI score by one point.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  From its humble beginnings in 1971, MEND – Meet Each Need with Dignity – has
  become one of the most comprehensive and empowering poverty relief agencies in
  Los Angeles County, serving in thousands of individuals each month with a full
  range of services designed to meet basic needs and move recipients on to
  self-reliance. Named the 2012 California Nonprofit of the Year by the
  Governor’s Office, MEND, to better meet the growing number client
  applications, has strategically worked to expand its volunteer workforce to
  more than 5,300 individuals supported by approximately 31 experienced
  employees, who gave the equivalent hours of almost 95 full-time employees in
  2013. On-going collaborations are part of this leveraged manpower, with more
  than 300 universities and colleges, businesses, nonprofit and government
  agencies and community groups regularly working in MEND departments. MEND has
  a reputation for exceptional management, emphasizing high quality and
  innovative service delivery.
   
   As we move closer to 2050, MEND can strengthen its abilities to provide health options for individuals and families and to break the bonds of hunger, disease, and poverty providing a future-serving as a pathway to self-reliance.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  For over 40 years, MEND—Meet Each Need with Dignity has been providing
  services that meet the basic human needs of individuals, many Hispanic, who
  reside in the northeast San Fernando Valley. All of MEND’s clients are below
  the Federal poverty areas of Los Angeles County. Many of MENDS’s clients are
  “working poor,” often holding down several minimum wage jobs and spending more
  than 70% of their income on rent. Others are single parents with small
  children who cannot afford childcare to enable then to work outside the home
  and, thus, must rely on welfare. Still others are individuals who suddenly
  find themselves unemployed and without financial resources. While some clients
  live in government subsidized housing, a large percentage share the rental of
  a house with other families and many still live in garages, shacks, trailers
  or other forms of substandard housing. MEND is the largest and most
  comprehensive poverty-relief agency in the San Fernando Valley and makes a
  significant difference in the lives of 3,100 people who, in 2013, turned to
  MEND for medical help.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  The following collaborators are confirmed, and we have worked together in the
  past. Each collaborator adds its own specialty to complete the quality of the
  various medical services provided. These collaborators bring three critical
  aspects to the success of the medical service on a day-to-day basis: 1) their
  specific expertise, 2) key necessary research and 3) in-kind work to help MEND
  provide full medical follow through.
