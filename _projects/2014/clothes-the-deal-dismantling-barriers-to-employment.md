Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Through the volunteer health volunteers, it provides basic ambulatory,
  hypertension, diabetic, vision, women’s health, acupuncture and chiropractic
  care to adults. The Eye Clinic provides eye exams, glaucoma testing and
  prescription glasses free of charge to all patients. Vision services are also
  provided to children. When more specialized services are needed, the patients
  are given referrals to appropriate nearby facilities.
    While the MEND health service programs extend over the wide range of illnesses and treatments of young children through seniors, a significant percentage of MEND’s medical activity is extended to the diagnosis and the treatment of hypertension and diabetes prevalent in the dominantly Hispanic population of the northeast San Fernando Valley. Nearly one-third of the MEND medical cash budget is directed to diabetic medications. The MEND Medical Volunteers have designed and implemented a comprehensive medical program that provides health care to poor uninsured families living in the northeast San Fernando Valley. The group includes physicians, doctors of optometry, a doctor of chiropractic, an acupuncturist, nurse practitioners and RN's, 
    Through a Holistic Approach, the Medical Clinic provides health education and exercise classes, including specialty clinics for diabetes, hypertension, women’s health and healthy aging; and has recently launched a 4-month Weight Management Course, the objective of which is to educate obese patients on nutrition and exercise, in a culturally-sensitive manner while helping them adopt lifestyle changes that can help them lose the excess weight. Our plan is to rotate 15 patients every 4 months through the course with the goal of helping them lose 10 pounds or lower their BMI score by one point.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  From its humble beginnings in 1971, MEND – Meet Each Need with Dignity – has
  become one of the most comprehensive and empowering poverty relief agencies in
  Los Angeles County, serving in thousands of individuals each month with a full
  range of services designed to meet basic needs and move recipients on to
  self-reliance. Named the 2012 California Nonprofit of the Year by the
  Governor’s Office, MEND, to better meet the growing number client
  applications, has strategically worked to expand its volunteer workforce to
  more than 5,300 individuals supported by approximately 31 experienced
  employees, who gave the equivalent hours of almost 95 full-time employees in
  2013. On-going collaborations are part of this leveraged manpower, with more
  than 300 universities and colleges, businesses, nonprofit and government
  agencies and community groups regularly working in MEND departments. MEND has
  a reputation for exceptional management, emphasizing high quality and
  innovative service delivery.
   
   As we move closer to 2050, MEND can strengthen its abilities to provide health options for individuals and families and to break the bonds of hunger, disease, and poverty providing a future-serving as a pathway to self-reliance.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  For over 40 years, MEND—Meet Each Need with Dignity has been providing
  services that meet the basic human needs of individuals, many Hispanic, who
  reside in the northeast San Fernando Valley. All of MEND’s clients are below
  the Federal poverty areas of Los Angeles County. Many of MENDS’s clients are
  “working poor,” often holding down several minimum wage jobs and spending more
  than 70% of their income on rent. Others are single parents with small
  children who cannot afford childcare to enable then to work outside the home
  and, thus, must rely on welfare. Still others are individuals who suddenly
  find themselves unemployed and without financial resources. While some clients
  live in government subsidized housing, a large percentage share the rental of
  a house with other families and many still live in garages, shacks, trailers
  or other forms of substandard housing. MEND is the largest and most
  comprehensive poverty-relief agency in the San Fernando Valley and makes a
  significant difference in the lives of 3,100 people who, in 2013, turned to
  MEND for medical help.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  The following collaborators are confirmed, and we have worked together in the
  past. Each collaborator adds its own specialty to complete the quality of the
  various medical services provided. These collaborators bring three critical
  aspects to the success of the medical service on a day-to-day basis: 1) their
  specific expertise, 2) key necessary research and 3) in-kind work to help MEND
  provide full medical follow through.
