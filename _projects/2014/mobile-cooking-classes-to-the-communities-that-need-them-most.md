Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  1) Agri-Corps Internships: Agri-Corps interns complete Proyecto Jardin's urban
  farm apprentice program, an 8-month project-based learning experience
  presented in two phases corresponding to cool and warm crop-growing seasons.
  Phase 1 begins in Fall 2014, with an emphasis on cool season crops and their
  nutritional and healing benefits. We will use our signature GoodFood
  Changemaker curriculum, and adaptation of curriculum developed by UC Santa
  Cruz Center for Agroecology & Sustainable Food Systems, supplemented by
  consultation with local immigrant farmers who posses deep wisdom and extensive
  experience in traditional sustainable agriculture. PJ's GoodFood Changemaker
  curriculum consists of three learning modules: (1) Agro-ecology, (2) Food
  Systems Literacy, and (3) Community organizing, followed by a 40 hour
  practicum in community organizing. Together, these learning units
  synergistically guide participants to attain core competencies in organic food
  production, understanding root causes of food system issues, and organizing
  effectively for policy/systems change. Upon completion of Phase 1, Agri-Corp
  Interns will continue to Phase 2 in Spring 2015, to apply learned farming
  skills while expanding knowledge about growing warm season crops and their
  nutritional/health benefits. 
   2) Community Organizing for Outreach & Base-building: In spring 2015, AgriCorps interns will begin recruiting new garden volunteers and presenting workshops, cooking demos, and garden tours at The Wellness Center. Each AgriCorps member will be responsible for building a base of 10 supporters/volunteers who understand community food justice issues in context of larger food system challenges. This cadre of food system leaders, will be recognized as Youth Health Education & Action Leaders (HEALers), and will strengthen organizational capacity to reach and retain youth participants in garden activities and enhance community efforts to transform Boyle Heightsâ€™ food environment through policy and systems change.
   3) Community Organizing for Education/Awareness: Our 10 AgriCorps Interns and 100 Youth HEALers will be based at the newly designed Community Wellness Center located at the Historic LA County Hospital, splitting their time between our on-site demonstration urban farm and Proyecto Jardin's original training garden at White Memorial Medical Center. They will be trained to use our G.L.A.M. community engagement tools: Greet, Listen, Assess, Motivate, to inspire & mobilize support.
