  more_detail: "Eating healthy can be daunting -- unless you know how to prepare the food. \r\nUsing fresh, local and healthy ingredients, Brown Paper LA wants to bring those skills to low-income and working families in Los Angeles County. By showing simple recipes, without any special equipment, we will make these recipes accessible for all audiences. \r\nWe would retrofit a food truck into a mobile kitchen used for hands-on classes and cooking demonstrations. We would take this truck into low-income communities and provide demonstrations of simple, healthy recipes that participants can create at home. \r\n"
  implement: "First, we would retrofit a food truck in consultation with cooking instructors. This requires not only a functional kitchen but also small groups of people to participate in cooking and larger groups to view the process at work. \r\n\r\nSecond, we would partner with community organizations to find locations and events where our lessons could be practical. These could include parks, schools, farmers markets, and community festivals. We would also seek partnerships with public health organizations, so our demonstrations could complement the work that they do.\r\n\r\nThird, we would take the truck into the community. At events like those specified above, we would provide two types of classes: hands-on classes with small groups that would allow community members to participate in creation of recipes, and demonstrations for larger groups that would showcase recipes. \r\n\r\nFourth, once the success of this project has been validated, we would seek sponsors for ongoing support. We anticipate that local supermarkets, for example, could be interested in the social goals of the project in exchange for logo recognition or as part of a corporate social responsibility campaign. \r\n"
  impact_live: "Many people do not prepare healthy meals at home because they believe it is expensive and time-consuming. Brown Paper LA wants to show low-income and working families that neither is the case. Making healthy food at home is easier and cheaper than they expect. \r\n\r\nTeaching these families how to create healthy recipes at home will make LA a healthy place to live today. Our recipes will be simple and easy enough to demonstrate directly from a truck, using inexpensive ingredients that can be found at a local supermarket. Further, through our partnerships with public health organizations and local vendors, communities would have access to healthy foods and health awareness that they might not otherwise have. \r\n\r\nGiving Los Angeles a broader appreciation for fresh food and cooking will make it one of the healthiest places to live in 2050. Food insecurity and lack of access are two major problems facing the city. This shouldn’t be the case, since California has some of the freshest ingredients in the world. We believe that by teaching citizens about how to prepare their food, they have a closer relationship to it and the world around them. \r\n\r\n"
  who_benefit: "These cooking classes will benefit low-income and working families who may believe that they do not have the time nor the skills to cook healthy meals for their families. \r\n\r\nWe would provide these demonstrations in areas that face food insecurity, including high concentrations of WIC and EBT usage, high rates of dietary conditions including diabetes and obesity, as well as limited access to healthy foods.\r\n\r\nBrown Paper LA wants to encourage these families to make healthier choices and show that cooking healthy meals does not have to be an expensive nor time-consuming process. Further, we want to increase availability of healthy foods by encouraging partnerships with local farmers and food vendors who could sell their goods alongside our demonstrations. \r\n\r\nBy the same token, this project would also benefit local farmers and food vendors. We anticipate that our classes and demonstrations would attract captive audiences that could be potential consumers of fresh produce and other foods. This would create new markets that they may not have anticipated and provide them an incentive to serve low-income areas.\r\n\r\n"
  partners_collaboration: "We anticipate that Brown Paper could integrate as an add-on feature to a wide range of events and community services. This project would only be as successful as the partnerships we create. \r\n\r\nStrong potential partners could include: public health outreach campaigns, low-income health clinics, local grocery stores, community gardens, food truck events, farmers markets, and community festivals. Additionally, we could provide specific programming to incorporate into nonprofit events around nutrition, such as school education series. \r\n\r\nWe would also partner with healthy food vendors -- e.g. community-supported agriculture and organic farmers -- to sell their wares alongside our demonstrations. Our demonstrations would likely generate business for these vendors and, in doing so, create a means for low-income neighborhoods to access healthy foods. \r\n"

  evaluate: "We will take into account the following factors to evaluate our project: the number of people who attend our demonstrations, the number of invitations we receive to attend additional events, the reception we receive when we reach out to participate in outside events, and the feedback we receive from hosts and event organizers. If we find that the number of attendees and the number of invitations increase, this would validate that the wider community finds us to be a valuable partner. \r\nThe implementation of new farmers markets and food events in previously food desert areas of LA will be a very positive indication that this food education has taken hold in these communities. "
  two_lessons: "Chris Register, the founder of Brown Paper Los Angeles, previously founded the Tin Box of Curious Artifacts, a mobile van that sold vintage goods and clothing. Through this process, he learned that nontraditional mobile vendors often complement existing vendors and options at live events. For example, at food truck events, Tin Box was often a welcome addition, because it would draw additional attendees to these events and provided another way to build community among attendees at large. \r\n\r\nAlso, through the catering Brown Paper currently does, we’ve learned just how little clients know about the cooking process. Simple recipes that could easily be done at home are very in-demand, because clients assume that they are complicated and time-consuming. While we appreciate the business that this brings our company, we also know that these skills could be very valuable to low-income families and make Los Angeles a healthier city. We are eager to provide these demonstrations as a community service not only to be good corporate citizens but also because the partnerships we create could also be valuable to our growth as a company. \r\n"
  achievable_goal: "Within 2-3 months, we would be able to purchase and retrofit a vehicle that would suit the needs of this project: giving Brown Paper the ability to host the classes and cooking demonstrations discussed.\r\n\r\nAfter this initial setup period, we could commence hosting events and building partnerships. Easy integrations would likely include community gardens and community festivals in low-income neighborhoods. Within 1-2 months, we anticipate gaining a better sense of what has the biggest impact on our audience -- hands-on classes? large-scale demos? food talks? \r\n\r\nThen, over the remaining months, we would build broader partnerships. This could include food truck events, farmers markets and other ongoing events.\r\n"
  major_challenges: "The regulatory framework surrounding food preparation can be tricky. Because we have been a licensed caterer for a number of years, we are confident we can manage this regulatory environment. Further, because the food would not be for sale, this would mitigate some of the regulations that most food trucks have to overcome. \r\n\r\nMore difficult would be creating the partnerships that would make us successful. Because this is a unique approach to an endemic issue, our prospective partners and clients may not initially be interested in the solution we propose. We will be flexible and work with our partners on their terms to ensure strong collaborations. Because this is a new opportunity, there will be a learning curve for our team as well, so flexibility will be essential to ensure our long-term success. \r\n\r\nFurther, cooking methods and ingredients are very culturally-specific, so overcoming those cultural barriers will be essential to build a connection with our target communities. We will work closely with community-level organizations to ensure our approach is culturally-sensitive and engaging to diverse audiences.\r\n"
  competition: "There are a number of organizations doing similar work but none doing specifically what we are proposing: mobile cooking education for low-income communities.\r\n\r\nThere are one-off events that provide cooking demonstrations -- for example, the Santa Monica Farmers’ Market has offered these demonstrations -- but no organizations that have focused providing this education on an ongoing basis for the County more broadly. These demonstrations, when they occur, are generally within stores or community centers; ours would be the first in a mobile environment and thus be able to serve areas that would otherwise be inaccessible. \r\n\r\nThere are also a number of organizations that seek to educate low-income families about nutrition -- for example, First 5 Los Angeles and Roots of Change -- however, there are none that focus on the culinary skills. Studies show that many people still regard healthy cooking as expensive, difficult and time-consuming. This project would be the first organization to tackle that false belief head-on. Our program could provide a valuable partnership for these organizations, because our cooking demonstrations would complement the types of education that they provide.\r\n\r\nThere are national organizations that work towards better cooking education among low-income communities -- Cooking Matters is a good example -- but none that have a mobile environment for their education. \r\n\r\nBased on our research, we believe this would a first not only for Los Angeles but for the country. \r\n"
  cost: "We anticipate that $100,000 would cover the majority of our expenses nicely for the year. Costs beyond that amount would likely be in our ongoing expenses -- ingredients and gas. Once we have established ourselves as a valuable community resource, these costs could be covered by sponsors and community partners. For example, a supermarket could provide ingredients in exchange for logo recognition, and a particular event interested in our participation could provide money for gas. \r\n\r\nThese types of sponsorships and contributions are how we intend to fund the project for the long-term. In the short-term, the LA2050 would be invaluable with our startup costs as well as establishing ourselves as a program deserving of such sponsorships. \r\n"
  budget: "Truck - $15,000\r\nRetrofitting - $5,000\r\nOngoing ingredients - $20,000\r\nGas - $10,000\r\nParking and incidentals - $5,000\r\nInsurance, licensing and other regulatory needs - $5,000\r\nSalaries - $40,000\r\n"

  impact_metrics: "Low-income and working families face a number of food insecurity issues, including obesity due to poor nutrition and lack of access to healthy foods in food deserts. Brown Paper wants to encourage these families to make healthier choices and show that cooking healthy meals does not have to be an expensive nor time-consuming process.\r\n\r\nThere is a popular misconception that cooking healthy meals is expensive and time-consuming. Our food truck would show audiences that this is not the case and encourage participants to follow these recipes in their own homes.\r\nGood nutrition is at the heart of a healthy community.\r\n"
Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  1) Agri-Corps Internships: Agri-Corps interns complete Proyecto Jardin's urban
  farm apprentice program, an 8-month project-based learning experience
  presented in two phases corresponding to cool and warm crop-growing seasons.
  Phase 1 begins in Fall 2014, with an emphasis on cool season crops and their
  nutritional and healing benefits. We will use our signature GoodFood
  Changemaker curriculum, and adaptation of curriculum developed by UC Santa
  Cruz Center for Agroecology & Sustainable Food Systems, supplemented by
  consultation with local immigrant farmers who posses deep wisdom and extensive
  experience in traditional sustainable agriculture. PJ's GoodFood Changemaker
  curriculum consists of three learning modules: (1) Agro-ecology, (2) Food
  Systems Literacy, and (3) Community organizing, followed by a 40 hour
  practicum in community organizing. Together, these learning units
  synergistically guide participants to attain core competencies in organic food
  production, understanding root causes of food system issues, and organizing
  effectively for policy/systems change. Upon completion of Phase 1, Agri-Corp
  Interns will continue to Phase 2 in Spring 2015, to apply learned farming
  skills while expanding knowledge about growing warm season crops and their
  nutritional/health benefits. 
   2) Community Organizing for Outreach & Base-building: In spring 2015, AgriCorps interns will begin recruiting new garden volunteers and presenting workshops, cooking demos, and garden tours at The Wellness Center. Each AgriCorps member will be responsible for building a base of 10 supporters/volunteers who understand community food justice issues in context of larger food system challenges. This cadre of food system leaders, will be recognized as Youth Health Education & Action Leaders (HEALers), and will strengthen organizational capacity to reach and retain youth participants in garden activities and enhance community efforts to transform Boyle Heights’ food environment through policy and systems change.
   3) Community Organizing for Education/Awareness: Our 10 AgriCorps Interns and 100 Youth HEALers will be based at the newly designed Community Wellness Center located at the Historic LA County Hospital, splitting their time between our on-site demonstration urban farm and Proyecto Jardin's original training garden at White Memorial Medical Center. They will be trained to use our G.L.A.M. community engagement tools: Greet, Listen, Assess, Motivate, to inspire & mobilize support.
