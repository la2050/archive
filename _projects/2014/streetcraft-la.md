  How do we help kids create their own jobs in the creative economy? Streetcraft
  LA’s approach to launching creative micro-ventures is a three-step model we
  call engage, partner, and launch. First, we engage youth who are on a path
  leading to dropout, unemployment, and juvenile justice involvement—or who are
  already misapplying their creative capacity through graffiti—in a training and
  youth development program we call The Streetcraft Crew. Crew is a yearlong
  program taught by well-known street artists that empowers at-risk kids to see
  themselves as artists, designers, and entrepreneurs, by building the design
  and production skills needed for creative economy entrepreneurship, and by
  developing the character traits and peer relationships needed to effectively
  apply those skills to entrepreneurship and ongoing education. Crew functions
  not only as a positive intervention in the life of at risk youth, but also
  serves as the Streetcraft human resources department, sourcing the true talent
  that is ready for step two, a formal paid apprenticeship in Streetcraft LA's
  retail platform and design studio. 
   
   Streetcraft LA operates a retail store in the heart of Santa Monica's vibrant Main Street shopping district that showcases collaboratively designed and produced products and original apparel. Youth are formal partners in this social venture, working with Streetcraft's lead designer to design custom furniture and original apparel such as hoodies, lids, and t-shirts. Over a one-year period, Streetcraft partners learn the product design process including market research, sales, marketing and promotion, distribution platforms and retail management through both direct instruction by industry professionals and experiential learning. Streetcraft partners receive a percentage of all sales. Streetcraft partners are also required and supported to complete high school and attend relevant higher education including certificate and degree programs while enrolled.
   
   After this one-year partnership, Streetcraft youth enter a process to launch their own creative micro-enterprise. Youth can choose to enter a business planning process in apparel, product design, or creative services. Youth are paired with industry mentors and attend lectures and one-on-one work sessions on product development, market analysis, financing and organization development. Youth completing this process have the opportunity to pitch their venture to a pool of funders convened by SBCC.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  The unemployment rate in Los Angeles County during June 2014 stood at
  8.2%--significantly higher than the statewide rate of 7.4%. Given the ratio
  between overall unemployment rates, and rates for youth ages 16-19 in recent
  years, this leads us to estimate a youth unemployment rate in LA County of
  more than 28%. 
   
   According to a study published by Jobs for the Future, only 25% of participants in most job training programs increase their annual wages. Over 85% of Streetcraft youth increase their annual income. Within ten years Streetcraft will spread this impact throughout Los Angeles County, becoming a countywide initiative with retail hubs in 20 locations working with over 20,000 young people a year. Our engagement programming will reduce graffiti and illicit street enterprises; the apprenticeship program will increase youths' annual income and provide concrete technical skills and work experience; and the micro venture program will increase the annual income of students by 50%. Finally, communities where Streetcraft hubs are located will see youth unemployment decrease by 5%.
   
   Streetcraft's vision for success in 2050 is ambitious: reduce youth unemployment by 25% through creative economy entrepreneurship. We believe that by targeting youth unemployment, we can dramatically impact other key indicators in the LA2050 metrics: arts establishments per capita increase when new workforce cohorts see the arts as a key component of their own creative entrepreneurship. Jobs per capita increase more dramatically through a strategy that targets the disproportionately unemployed youth population. And given the demographic profile of the majority of youth with whom we work, such a strategy will lead to an increase in the number of minority-owned firms, and to a more equitable distribution of income and opportunities. With its emphasis on degree and certificate programs for participants, we believe that Streetcraft also represents an effective means of re-engaging youth who have disconnected from higher education, increasing the recruiting and retention rates at local colleges and universities and, by building jobs for the graduates, increasing the number of them who remain in LA County.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Juan was arrested when he was 15 for running a 25-person drug ring. When
  Streetcraft's co-founder Jonathan met Juan he was 18 years old, out of jail,
  trying to change his life, but he was hopeless. Juan told Jonathan that he had
  no skills or talents. Jonathan categorically disagreed. “No skills? 25 person
  drug ring?” he said. “You're an entrepreneur, but we got to get you another
  product.” 
   
   Streetcraft works with kids like Juan: low income, marginalized youth who have disconnected from school and the workforce, and who are at risk for misapplying their creativity and getting busted. Increasingly, our outreach program has developed the capacity to target these young people before they become involved with the justice system, reaching them at the point where school failure, unemployment, and lack of positive direction first begin to create barriers and challenges. Our outreach works in tandem with SBCC's countywide community organizing project, which has operated for more than a decade and currently mobilizes more than 100 neighborhood groups throughout the county. These groups are located in neighborhoods that share common characteristics including: pluralities of African American and/or Hispanic/Latino residents, high rates of family poverty and youth unemployment, high rates of high school dropout, and large numbers of youth involved in the juvenile justice system. Our years of relationship-building with these groups of resident leaders give us the capacity to reach youth in this key demographic group throughout L.A. County through direct, neighbor-to-neighbor outreach, rather than relying on expensive and often unreliable mass media approaches, or working through social service agencies. Youth in Streetcraft thus reside in low-income, under-resourced neighborhoods throughout the county, but share common traits in addition to challenges with education and employment: most are African American or Hispanic/Latino; the great majority live in families with incomes at 200% or less of federal poverty level; many speak a language other than English at home; and most have parents who did not attend college, and in many cases did not graduate high school.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Streetcraft has a number of strategic partners. First, we will work with our
  network of Neighborhood Action Councils (NACs) to refer youth into the
  program. Future referral partners will include youth development community
  based organizations seeking career opportunities for marginalized young people
  such as the Boys & Girls Club, YMCAs, and others. In addition, Streetcraft is
  currently developing a partnership with LAPD in several key neighborhoods to
  work with youth being released into the community from juvenile detention
  facilities. Lastly, Streetcraft's model is contingent upon utilizing workforce
  investment funds, and has worked since its inception to engage local workforce
  investment boards interested in entrepreneurship as an ongoing sustainable
  funding source.
   
   SBCC has also made a commitment to leveraging resources provided by philanthropic and public-sector partners to support the goals of Streetcraft while meeting the needs of these funders. Support from the James Irvine Foundation for youth re-engagement strategies, and from the California Wellness Foundation for youth violence prevention, have both been instrumental in the development and piloting of the Streetcraft strategy, and will continue to form an indispensable source of support for the program. SBCC's Family Support program, funded by the L.A. County Department of Children and Family Resources, allows the program to provide ongoing social support services to Streetcraft participants, including counseling, coaching, and referrals for mental and primary healthcare, housing assistance, transportation assistance, childcare, and other critical needs.
   
   SBCC is currently building collaborations with higher education institutions including UCLA, the Design Center, Cerritos College, Santa Monica College, CSU Dominguez Hills, CSU Long Beach, and others, in order to increase opportunities for internship and directed study, as well as college credit-bearing workshops and classes on-site at Streetcraft.
   
   In all of our partnerships, philosophical alignment is the critical elements. The Streetcraft venture has a set of deeply held core values: every person has strengths and talents that need to be respected and placed at the center of any plan to train, educate, and support that person. All of our partners share this commitment to the intrinsic worth of our participants.
