  more_detail: "Arts enhance information transfer and instrumental learning, educate holistically, can reach large audiences, provide a wide variety of avenues for self-expression and possibilities for inclusion in moving people \"from image to action\" for a sustainable future. Art is the great bridge between people across all demographics that interprets and involves them. Earth Protect will engage LA County artists who are creating for sustainability through a web hub. Being part of an ARTISTS4SUSTAINABILITY Earth Protect Hub will encourage \r\ncollaboration, increase creativity and funding and make it easier to find artists specializing in creations about a sustainable future. A4S builds on LA's established global leadership in film and sustainability.  "
  implement: >-
    earthprotect.com already has a hub web site focused on sustainability with
    almost 4,000 videos, 3,500 blogs, over 60 ngo and business partners and
    through its earthprotectproductions.com has engaged over 30 artists
    collaborating on sustainability creations. It has a film studio at 1320 Main
    right across from Silicon Beach that hosts art walk and special art events
    and is embedded in the artistic, sustainability and technology communities
    in LA. Our web developers will  determine to best way to build upon our
    existing sites to create the ARTISTS4SUSTAINABILITY HUB. We will use our
    existing social media outreach and our existing artists community to plan
    and execute the outreach to enroll artists starting with the film industry
    and engaging leaders, nonprofits, higher education and creative businesses
    as the conduits to engage the artists. We will create incentive and reward
    programs to encourage participation and a ongoing communication program.
    Once we have a core number of artists we will create a launch event to
    announce the A4S Hub intended to gain interest, creative projects, funding
    and help to grow the participating artists creations and influence
    sustainable living. This will be done so LA gains additional recognition for
    its global leadership in arts and sustainability. 
  impact_create: "LA is THE global leader in the film industry, has some of the most beautiful natural environment in the world and has taken a lead in moving to sustainable living. Artists of all types are drawn to the County and many use their art to advance causes including achieving a sustainable future. Maggie Q supports animal welfare and conservation, James Cameron produces the TV series The Years of Living Dangerously, G2Gallery offers wildlife art and donates all proceeds to animal causes, Connie Samaras has a retrospective at The Armory Center For the Arts. Her images capture the banal nightmares of manmade landscapes. In an article on May 10, 2013 Robby Herbst asked the question, Who Makes Art About Climate Change? He concludes with this hope and prediction re the future in LA with climate change, \"We'll see it in our changed environments, in species decline and extinctions, and in the rise of global instability as many old ways of living are drowned or toasted. Perhaps in the future too, when somebody asks \"who's making art about climate change in Los Angeles,\" the response won't be a head-scratch and a \"geez, I dunno.\" KCET\r\n\r\nWith Earth Protect's ARTISTS4SUSTAINABILITY, LA and the world will have an answer not only for climate change but all aspects of sustainability across all art forms. We can anticipate that this will further distinguish LA and bring business, funding and global attention as its leadership in arts and sustainability are brought to light \r\nthrough this hub and the outreach to bring it to world attention. It will create jobs for artists and help the economy and bring the message about the need for and how to live sustainability to a wide group of people both in LA and worldwide. \r\n\r\n"

We have  over 60 organizations we partner and collaborate with. \r\nOur values are specific about supporting collaboration.

  two_lessons: "Through our 7 years building several version of earthprotect.com and its film division, earthprotectproductions.com, we learned to persevere as its takes time to get the web site right and build users, we keep learning and improving. We also continue to seek to improve how we are helping people learn and then take action in their lives, communities and work. It one thing for people to learn there is a problem and another to learn what to do about it that leads to solutions. We think the A4S hub is one way to \r\nhelp people find artists that create for sustainability, help the artists find our about each other and to stimulate art which helps move people \"from image to action\" for a sustainable future\" the Earth Protect tag line "
  achievable_goal: >-
    As explained above, we have the web site base platform in earthprotect.com
    that we can build upon and we have the web design specialists in place to
    determine the best approach to creating the A4S hub. We also have 7 years of
    experience in identifying content on sustainability, engaging artists and in
    social media outreach and we have traditional media specialists in place
    also. We are operating in our home town LA and from within the art community
    with vast reach and connections. We have earned a high level of trust. We
    are also good project managers with over 30 years track record for our
    principal project leaders. We are expanding on our existing expertise and
    achievements and are confident we can achieve the establishment of the hub,
    the launch, enroll a core group of artists and advertise the Hub so it is
    well used and benefits the artists, Earth Protect and LA. 
  major_challenges: "While we have considerable internal expertise for this project, they are busy so we will either have to bring in new talent to carry out this project or new talent to do some of the current work our team is doing. We are experienced in planning for and engaging talent and managing work loads so we can confident we can overcome this challenge. \r\n\r\nCreating the incentive package to encourage artists to participate is a challenge, many artists are not focused on marketing and work individually, so we will use our existing artists who have already chosen to collaborate with us to guide us in this. Related to this, we will no doubt need to be smart in creating \r\nongoing communication to build loyalty and in our outreach to create visibility among those who engage artists so new creation and support for artists is achieved. We do have experts to draw upon and will create \r\na group of founding artists that can help us get it right. "
  competition: >-
    We are not aware of any direct competitors. Earth Protect views others
    working on sustainability and artists as collaborators not competitors and
    we specifically have seen information that validates that LA has no such hub
    as we are proposing. 
  cost: >-
    We are comfortable that the $100,000 will be adequate to establish the hub
    and promote it to gain a base number of artists and to do the outreach to
    create visibility that results in creative projects on sustainability. We
    anticipate that we may need grants or sponsors for future iterations to
    improve the site and grow it beyond the launch and early development stage.
    We have grant expertise and an active sponsorship program. We also have
    interns and coop students from Drexel Film School, University of Denver and
    other institutions. The students can be a good labor force to locate the
    artists, do outreach and marketing and load content onto the hub web site. 
  budget: "Core team members, Managing Director, Creative Director, Web Development planning and coordination of project $20,000 \r\nWeb Design = $25,000\r\nOutreach to artists = $15,000\r\nWeb site content development/management = $15,000\r\nPublic Relations for Site Launch and business development $15,000 \r\nLA Launch event $4000 \r\n$6,000 student interns, indirect and miscellaneous \r\n\r\n\r\n"
