Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  earthprotect.com already has a hub web site focused on sustainability with
  almost 4,000 videos, 3,500 blogs, over 60 ngo and business partners and
  through its earthprotectproductions.com has engaged over 30 artists
  collaborating on sustainability creations. It has a film studio at 1320 Main
  right across from Silicon Beach that hosts art walk and special art events and
  is embedded in the artistic, sustainability and technology communities in LA.
  Our web developers will determine to best way to build upon our existing sites
  to create the ARTISTS4SUSTAINABILITY HUB. We will use our existing social
  media outreach and our existing artists community to plan and execute the
  outreach to enroll artists starting with the film industry and engaging
  leaders, nonprofits, higher education and creative businesses as the conduits
  to engage the artists. We will create incentive and reward programs to
  encourage participation and a ongoing communication program. Once we have a
  core number of artists we will create a launch event to announce the A4S Hub
  intended to gain interest, creative projects, funding and help to grow the
  participating artists creations and influence sustainable living. This will be
  done so LA gains additional recognition for its global leadership in arts and
  sustainability.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  LA is THE global leader in the film industry, has some of the most beautiful
  natural environment in the world and has taken a lead in moving to sustainable
  living. Artists of all types are drawn to the County and many use their art to
  advance causes including achieving a sustainable future. Maggie Q supports
  animal welfare and conservation, James Cameron produces the TV series The
  Years of Living Dangerously, G2Gallery offers wildlife art and donates all
  proceeds to animal causes, Connie Samaras has a retrospective at The Armory
  Center For the Arts. Her images capture the banal nightmares of manmade
  landscapes. In an article on May 10, 2013 Robby Herbst asked the question, Who
  Makes Art About Climate Change? He concludes with this hope and prediction re
  the future in LA with climate change, "We'll see it in our changed
  environments, in species decline and extinctions, and in the rise of global
  instability as many old ways of living are drowned or toasted. Perhaps in the
  future too, when somebody asks "who's making art about climate change in Los
  Angeles," the response won't be a head-scratch and a "geez, I dunno." KCET
   
   With Earth Protect's ARTISTS4SUSTAINABILITY, LA and the world will have an answer not only for climate change but all aspects of sustainability across all art forms. We can anticipate that this will further distinguish LA and bring business, funding and global attention as its leadership in arts and sustainability are brought to light 
   through this hub and the outreach to bring it to world attention. It will create jobs for artists and help the economy and bring the message about the need for and how to live sustainability to a wide group of people both in LA and worldwide.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: |-
  LA artists creating for sustainability. 
   LA businesses related to the arts especially those with some focus on sustainability.
   The general public will gain in education on sustainability through the arts. 
   The increased art projects will bring funding to support artists and businesses serving artists and their communities thus also bringing tax revenue.
