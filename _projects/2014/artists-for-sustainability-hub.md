Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  earthprotect.com already has a hub web site focused on sustainability with
  almost 4,000 videos, 3,500 blogs, over 60 ngo and business partners and
  through its earthprotectproductions.com has engaged over 30 artists
  collaborating on sustainability creations. It has a film studio at 1320 Main
  right across from Silicon Beach that hosts art walk and special art events and
  is embedded in the artistic, sustainability and technology communities in LA.
  Our web developers will determine to best way to build upon our existing sites
  to create the ARTISTS4SUSTAINABILITY HUB. We will use our existing social
  media outreach and our existing artists community to plan and execute the
  outreach to enroll artists starting with the film industry and engaging
  leaders, nonprofits, higher education and creative businesses as the conduits
  to engage the artists. We will create incentive and reward programs to
  encourage participation and a ongoing communication program. Once we have a
  core number of artists we will create a launch event to announce the A4S Hub
  intended to gain interest, creative projects, funding and help to grow the
  participating artists creations and influence sustainable living. This will be
  done so LA gains additional recognition for its global leadership in arts and
  sustainability.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  LA is THE global leader in the film industry, has some of the most beautiful
  natural environment in the world and has taken a lead in moving to sustainable
  living. Artists of all types are drawn to the County and many use their art to
  advance causes including achieving a sustainable future. Maggie Q supports
  animal welfare and conservation, James Cameron produces the TV series The
  Years of Living Dangerously, G2Gallery offers wildlife art and donates all
  proceeds to animal causes, Connie Samaras has a retrospective at The Armory
  Center For the Arts. Her images capture the banal nightmares of manmade
  landscapes. In an article on May 10, 2013 Robby Herbst asked the question, Who
  Makes Art About Climate Change? He concludes with this hope and prediction re
  the future in LA with climate change, "We'll see it in our changed
  environments, in species decline and extinctions, and in the rise of global
  instability as many old ways of living are drowned or toasted. Perhaps in the
  future too, when somebody asks "who's making art about climate change in Los
  Angeles," the response won't be a head-scratch and a "geez, I dunno." KCET
   
   With Earth Protect's ARTISTS4SUSTAINABILITY, LA and the world will have an answer not only for climate change but all aspects of sustainability across all art forms. We can anticipate that this will further distinguish LA and bring business, funding and global attention as its leadership in arts and sustainability are brought to light 
   through this hub and the outreach to bring it to world attention. It will create jobs for artists and help the economy and bring the message about the need for and how to live sustainability to a wide group of people both in LA and worldwide.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: |-
  LA artists creating for sustainability. 
   LA businesses related to the arts especially those with some focus on sustainability.
   The general public will gain in education on sustainability through the arts. 
   The increased art projects will bring funding to support artists and businesses serving artists and their communities thus also bringing tax revenue.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Earth Protect has existing partnerships in LA and SO CAL including UCLA Center
  for Tropical Research, UCSD Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Heal the Bay,
  CA Wildlife Center, Tree Musketeers, BIOCOM Institute, Malibu Foundation for
  Environmental Education, Pacific Blue Foundation, Social Change Film Festival
  and Institute, Desert Tortoise Conservancy, Unity for Creativity, G2Gallery.
  We have over 60 organizations we partner and collaborate with. 
   Our values are specific about supporting collaboration. We deliberately created a partnership program that supported sustainability focused NGO's. 
   Further, our Advisory Council includes business, science, educators and sustainability leaders who foster our collaborations. Here is a partial list of organizations we collaborate with: UCLA, UCSD Scripps, NOAA, University of Denver Daniels School of Business, University of the Sunshine Coast AU. New collaborations include ConnectD, Asia Pacific Clean Energy Summit and Expo, Oregon BEST FEST, Ideascape, Inc., Mayor's Office LA.

  more_detail: "Arts enhance information transfer and instrumental learning, educate holistically, can reach large audiences, provide a wide variety of avenues for self-expression and possibilities for inclusion in moving people \"from image to action\" for a sustainable future.

  two_lessons: "Through our 7 years building several version of earthprotect.com and its film division, earthprotectproductions.com, we learned to persevere as its takes time to get the web site right and build users, we keep learning and improving. We also continue to seek to improve how we are helping people learn and then take action in their lives, communities and work. It one thing for people to learn there is a problem and another to learn what to do about it that leads to solutions. We think the A4S hub is one way to \r\nhelp people find artists that create for sustainability, help the artists find our about each other and to stimulate art which helps move people \"from image to action\" for a sustainable future\" the Earth Protect tag line "
  achievable_goal: >-
    As explained above, we have the web site base platform in earthprotect.com
    that we can build upon and we have the web design specialists in place to
    determine the best approach to creating the A4S hub. We also have 7 years of
    experience in identifying content on sustainability, engaging artists and in
    social media outreach and we have traditional media specialists in place
    also. We are operating in our home town LA and from within the art community
    with vast reach and connections. We have earned a high level of trust. We
    are also good project managers with over 30 years track record for our
    principal project leaders. We are expanding on our existing expertise and
    achievements and are confident we can achieve the establishment of the hub,
    the launch, enroll a core group of artists and advertise the Hub so it is
    well used and benefits the artists, Earth Protect and LA. 
  major_challenges: "While we have considerable internal expertise for this project, they are busy so we will either have to bring in new talent to carry out this project or new talent to do some of the current work our team is doing. We are experienced in planning for and engaging talent and managing work loads so we can confident we can overcome this challenge. \r\n\r\nCreating the incentive package to encourage artists to participate is a challenge, many artists are not focused on marketing and work individually, so we will use our existing artists who have already chosen to collaborate with us to guide us in this. Related to this, we will no doubt need to be smart in creating \r\nongoing communication to build loyalty and in our outreach to create visibility among those who engage artists so new creation and support for artists is achieved. We do have experts to draw upon and will create \r\na group of founding artists that can help us get it right. "
  competition: >-
    We are not aware of any direct competitors. Earth Protect views others
    working on sustainability and artists as collaborators not competitors and
    we specifically have seen information that validates that LA has no such hub
    as we are proposing. 
  cost: >-
    We are comfortable that the $100,000 will be adequate to establish the hub
    and promote it to gain a base number of artists and to do the outreach to
    create visibility that results in creative projects on sustainability. We
    anticipate that we may need grants or sponsors for future iterations to
    improve the site and grow it beyond the launch and early development stage.
    We have grant expertise and an active sponsorship program. We also have
    interns and coop students from Drexel Film School, University of Denver and
    other institutions. The students can be a good labor force to locate the
    artists, do outreach and marketing and load content onto the hub web site. 
  budget: "Core team members, Managing Director, Creative Director, Web Development planning and coordination of project $20,000 \r\nWeb Design = $25,000\r\nOutreach to artists = $15,000\r\nWeb site content development/management = $15,000\r\nPublic Relations for Site Launch and business development $15,000 \r\nLA Launch event $4000 \r\n$6,000 student interns, indirect and miscellaneous \r\n\r\n\r\n"

    answer: "Through our 7 years building several version of earthprotect.com and its film division, earthprotectproductions.com, we learned to persevere as its takes time to get the web site right and build users, we keep learning and improving. We also continue to seek to improve how we are helping people learn and then take action in their lives, communities and work. It one thing for people to learn there is a problem and another to learn what to do about it that leads to solutions. We think the A4S hub is one way to \r\nhelp people find artists that create for sustainability, help the artists find our about each other and to stimulate art which helps move people \"from image to action\" for a sustainable future\" the Earth Protect tag line "

      As explained above, we have the web site base platform in earthprotect.com
      that we can build upon and we have the web design specialists in place to
      determine the best approach to creating the A4S hub. We also have 7 years
      of experience in identifying content on sustainability, engaging artists
      and in social media outreach and we have traditional media specialists in
      place also. We are operating in our home town LA and from within the art
      community with vast reach and connections. We have earned a high level of
      trust. We are also good project managers with over 30 years track record
      for our principal project leaders. We are expanding on our existing
      expertise and achievements and are confident we can achieve the
      establishment of the hub, the launch, enroll a core group of artists and
      advertise the Hub so it is well used and benefits the artists, Earth
      Protect and LA.

    answer: "While we have considerable internal expertise for this project, they are busy so we will either have to bring in new talent to carry out this project or new talent to do some of the current work our team is doing. We are experienced in planning for and engaging talent and managing work loads so we can confident we can overcome this challenge. \r\n\r\nCreating the incentive package to encourage artists to participate is a challenge, many artists are not focused on marketing and work individually, so we will use our existing artists who have already chosen to collaborate with us to guide us in this. Related to this, we will no doubt need to be smart in creating \r\nongoing communication to build loyalty and in our outreach to create visibility among those who engage artists so new creation and support for artists is achieved. We do have experts to draw upon and will create \r\na group of founding artists that can help us get it right. "

    answer: >-
      We are not aware of any direct competitors. Earth Protect views others
      working on sustainability and artists as collaborators not competitors and
      we specifically have seen information that validates that LA has no such
      hub as we are proposing.

      This information is for internal purposes only and will not be publicly
      displayed.
    answer: >-
      We are comfortable that the $100,000 will be adequate to establish the hub
      and promote it to gain a base number of artists and to do the outreach to
      create visibility that results in creative projects on sustainability. We
      anticipate that we may need grants or sponsors for future iterations to
      improve the site and grow it beyond the launch and early development
      stage. We have grant expertise and an active sponsorship program. We also
      have interns and coop students from Drexel Film School, University of
      Denver and other institutions. The students can be a good labor force to
      locate the artists, do outreach and marketing and load content onto the
      hub web site.
