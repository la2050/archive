  ChapCare’s Marketing Manager will manage the project. The Manager is a member
  of ChapCare's Senior Leadership Team.
   Upon award, scouting of enrollment shop locations in the El Monte/South El Monte area will begin. Based on previous experience, we expect to locate the 2 shop spaces within 4 weeks, with an additional 2 weeks required to operationalize the sites.
   To support marketing of the project in the community, ChapCare’s 11 member Outreach Department will launch an outreach and education campaign to generate leads that will be enrolled at the 2 shops. 
   Specifically, based on the Consumer Tracking Survey that Covered California conducted (May 6, 2014), we know that the vast majority of people are aware of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and their health insurance options, but what many have not chosen to do is enroll. What this means is that continued education is paramount to decrease barriers to enrollment. 
   We will leverage local partners in El Monte/South El Monte to conduct the majority of outreach work (i.e. making flyers available at their locations). These include the El Monte/South El Monte Chamber of Commerce, Greater El Monte Community Hospital, local school districts, community based organizations, libraries, etc. Outreach conducted by ChapCare directly will focus on locations where the populations live, work, shop, and play; and local high volume locations and events.
   Our main focus to get people to enroll in health insurance will be on planning an aggressive education campaign that will provide group presentations to capitalize on the awareness already created. Education presentations will provide general information about health insurance, and more targeted information that seeks to respond to consumer concerns.
   Referral cards will be available at enrollment locations, whereby a consumer can write a note to a friend about their positive experience enrolling into health insurance, and to encourage them to enroll. These will be mailed at no cost to the client. 
   The proposed strategy is cost-effective and reasonable based on our previous experience and lessons learned.
   During the first open enrollment period, 42% of individuals who enrolled at our enrollment shop in Pasadena did so after a friend or family member enrolled and told them about it. As seen during the first open enrollment period, we expect the initial Outreach & Education to launch a multiplying effect that will leverage limited dollars into a sustained wave of activity.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  In the short-term, ChapCare’s proposed project will support increased health
  care access by stripping down barriers to care (lack of health insurance).
   By 2050, the proposed project will support improved healthcare outcomes, and healthcare as a key driver of economic viability. Studies have shown that many low-income individuals miss significant amounts of time at school and/or work because of poor health; in many instances, affecting their long-term financial viability. These affects can sometimes be so significant, as to be generational in impact.
   In order to shift long-term health in communities, preventive health care is key. In order for people to pro-actively access health care, health insurance is essential. 
   ChapCare’s enrollment shop model is a significant game-changer is this area since it promotes a culture of coverage in communities by normalizing the health insurance process. In most instances, for those who choose to enroll, they have to stand on long lines in a County office to enroll in Medi-Cal or call a phone bank in Sacramento to enroll in Covered California. For those who choose not to enroll there are many issues that need to be overcome such as: a lack of trust, cultural and linguistic barriers, and/or an inability to navigate the complicated health insurance system on their own.
   The enrollment shop is a clean, visible space integrated into the fabric of the community, supported by people the community knows and trusts, that makes enrolling in health insurance feel no different than going to the post office or grocery store.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  ChapCare will open 2 new retail health insurance enrollment shops in the El
  Monte/South El Monte area in the San Gabriel Valley. 
   There are over 120,000 people living in this area, with over 50,000 living at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Level ($22,980 for a single person) who have not accessed health care services. As a result, the area has experienced some of the worst health indicators in Los Angeles County; specifically, the area’s obesity rate ranks 116 out of 117 cities in the County, with over 31% of adults being obese, which has led to high rates of hypertension and diabetes.
   Many people in the El Monte/South El Monte area do not access primary health care services due to a lack of health insurance, which is one of the key barriers to people accessing needed medical services. In the proposed area, there are 39,438 low-income people (living at 400% or below of the Federal Poverty Level) that currently do not have health insurance; of which, 21,789 are eligible for Covered California, and 17,649 can access free insurance (Medi-Cal). 
   The proposed area is predominantly Latino (75%) followed by Asian (20%), with the Asian population being predominantly Chinese and Vietnamese, making services that are culturally and linguistically competent of critical importance.
   ChapCare’s proposed project will benefit the low-income populations of the El Monte/South El Monte region by providing easily accessible health insurance enrollment services. The project will provide services in a culturally and linguistically competent manner that is responsive to the needs of the community.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: Not applicable.
