Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  We imagine a vibrant LA2050 where strong social connectedness joins citizens
  who work together to solve problems and improve communities. The LA2050 we
  envision is a place where civic engagement, voter participation and social
  trust are high because people understand the power of their voice and claim
  their right to be heard in our democracy. Research shows that education is one
  of strongest ways to overcome low levels of social trust and stimulate civic
  engagement. Thus, our idea for increasing social connectedness in LA2050 is to
  equip tomorrow’s voters with the skills and knowledge to lead positive change
  in their communities by expanding our Civic Action Project (CAP) into 50
  additional high school classrooms in LA over the next year.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  A city’s youth are key allies in building a strong future. Third Century Greek
  philosopher Diogenes was one of the first to say this, and may have said it
  best when he said, “[t]he foundation of every state is the education of its
  youth.” This ancient and enduring truth motivates CRF’s work today. Modern
  research confirms that civic learning in school is critical to students’
  becoming prepared and willing to contribute meaningfully to community and
  political life. Youth who participate in civic learning today gain the skills
  and experience to become leaders who will ensure that LA2050 is the most
  civically engaged region in the U.S. While our project takes an educational
  approach, our ultimate aim is a citywide increase in social connectedness
  across LA. We equip high schoolers near graduation with confidence, leadership
  skills and knowledge so that they are prepared to lead ripple-effect increases
  in civic engagement and positive change in their communities throughout LA. By
  teaching high school students skills for civic engagement, we give them the
  tools to actively build a stronger LA both now, and in the future.
   Civic Action Project (CAP) turns the content of the traditional, public school US Government class into a learning experience that embraces the ideal of connectivity on many levels. CAP connects students to their communities and to their own ideals by asking them to identify issues that matter to them, and to back up their beliefs with focused action. CAP students identify a policy-related issue in their community that they want to impact. Students work with peers, get feedback from their teacher, and reach out to local government to create real change around the issue of their choice.
   The issues CAP students choose to work on envision positive changes across a vast range of social issues including: environmental protection, child abuse, homelessness, public transportation, animal welfare, reproductive rights, cyberbullying, and traffic safety. Students learn the content of a traditional government course through the research they must do to determine the best way to tackle their real-world problem. 150 high school teachers in LA high schools currently teach CAP. By recruiting an additional 50 LA teachers, we will connect 5,000 more students to civic engagement via CAP each school year. CAP is a proven program with high teacher retention, so the benefits of our initiative would reach far beyond the 12 month grant timeline.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Civic education today is an essential part of ensuring that the citizens of
  LA2050 are prepared and willing to engage in public life. Schools have a
  critical role to play in ensuring that every LA resident gets the type of
  civic learning opportunities that will empower him or her with the lifelong
  skills to contribute meaningfully to civic processes. Research backs up the
  positive impact that curriculum emphasizing civic engagement has on students’
  attitudes about participating in democracy such as their level of political
  interest, and the strength of their intention to vote. Additionally, there is
  a positive correlation between exposure to civic education and attendance at a
  four-year college. The LA2050 Report notes that this positive cycle comes full
  circle as higher educational attainment is, in turn, linked to greater social
  connectedness. Conversely, students who do not get opportunities for civic
  learning in school are unlikely to come across such opportunities elsewhere.
  They are disproportionately less likely to vote or engage in public life in
  other ways.
   In 2005, a statewide coalition of non-profit organizations, business, and government-affiliated groups worked with funding from the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the Annenberg Foundation, and the W.R. Hearst Foundation to conduct an indepth survey on the impact of civic education in California on graduating seniors. The study surveyed 2,366 high school seniors who had completed the 12th grade government course mandated by the California History/ Social Science Framework and Standards. Students were selected from a range of schools to reflect California’s socioeconomic differences and racial diversity, and the study took differences in students’ classroom experiences in government and civics into account.
   The findings demonstrated that students whose classroom experience included interactive learning, exposure to diversity, and opportunities to practice civic skills were increasingly likely to become adults who prioritize civic participation, are committed to informed voting, and confident in their political knowledge. Citizens with these attitudes have greater social and political trust. By engaging students in project-based learning and requiring collaboration between peers, CAP is a program that not only helps students build prosocial connections today by making real improvements in their communities, but also sets young citizens on a path towards meaningful lifelong civic participation.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  The LA2050 Report is clear that LA’s low “connectedness indicators are perhaps
  the most concrete (and disheartening) manifestation of LA’s inadequate
  education system.” By providing teachers with free, standards-aligned
  resources to facilitate better social studies education, CAP strikes at one of
  the root causes of low connectedness in LA. By giving students the opportunity
  to see the impact their volunteer work can have, CAP instils prosocial values
  like volunteerism, caring, and community involvement – values these students
  will carry into our future LA. This dual approach makes CAP a strong partner
  for LA2050’s strategy of raising LA2050’s connectedness indicators through
  improved educational outcomes that will generate greater civic engagement and
  social trust. Connectedness, the LA2050 Report notes, is fundamental to the
  human experience. Thus, by improving connectedness, implementing CAP on a
  broader scale stands to benefit all Angelenos, now and in 2050.
   The positive changes student volunteers have already created through CAP show the tremendous power of students to shape our communities for the better today. Recent CAP student achievements include:
   -Collaborating with the Public Works Department to improve city bus routes to increase efficiency and reduce traffic congestion;
   -Working with an LA City Council Member to orchestrate a South LA neighborhood clean-up;
   -Working within students’ own high-schools to craft policies that embody students’ voices on campus issues including discipline, tardy policies, student health issues, and recycling.
   These student quotes shows how CAP transforms students’ outlooks, preparing them to become adults with the skills and knowledge to make meaningful contributions to civic society and their communities:
   “I was surprised to realize that some problems and policies can be solved by students and there is no reason to sit and wait for change. Even students have the power to make a difference.”
   “I learned that it is important take opportunities to study governmental policy in the first person, as is provided through the completion of a Civic Action Project, so that students may understand the necessity for citizens to participate in their government. The government cannot take care of every aspect, as it has limited awareness. It is therefore the responsibility of the citizens to finally bring forth the changes they need. Experiencing such a civic action project gives students the experience to do so."
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  CAP participants work on any policy-related issue that is important to them.
  This means that high school students in the program form their own connections
  throughout LA. 
   
   Past partners for student-initiated collaborations include: 
   
   -Bernard Parks, member of the LA City Council, representing the 8th District in South LA;
   -Public Works Department of the City of Bell Gardens;
   -Mayor of Bell Gardens, Daniel Crespo.
   -Roosevelt High School in East LA
   
   LA City Hall, Dodger Stadium, and the California African American Museum have been past key collaborators for CAP by providing locations for CAP Showcases where students have shared their civic actions with the community and media.
   
   CRF has also recently begun collaboration with Heal the Bay and the CA Coastal Commission to equip students with skills to address environmental concerns. In these partnerships, Heal the Bay and the Coastal Commission will provide students and teachers with scientifically accurate information and opportunities to study, observe, and interact with the LA coast. CRF will provide teacher trainings for environmental science teachers and other educators recruited by HtB and the Coastal Commission, and will provide classroom support for implementing CAP with a focus on environmental issues. Three factors critical to the success of these collaborations are as follows: 
   (1) clear communication between organizations; (2) defined roles for each partner specific to that organization’s expertise – for CRF this is providing civic engagement education via CAP, for the environmental groups, this is providing their expertise on environmental stewardship and issues specific to our region; (3) mutual respect for and understanding of each partner’s mission.
   
   These collaborations resulted from a middle school teacher and environmental advocate contacting CRF based on the strength of our reputation for balanced, impactful curricula that teach students how to respectfully engage with peers, opponents, and policymakers to effectively advocate for the issues they care about. The results of this interdisciplinary initiative have the potential to make LA2050 not only one of the most civically engaged regions in the U.S., but also to help ensure that the next generation of environmental stewards are prepared to defend our LA coastline. The future health of our water and of the many different communities that depend on this unique ecosystem depends on the civic engagement skills CAP students develop today.
