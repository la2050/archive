Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): |-
  1. Late 2015 – Early 2015: Comprehensive Community Engagement. 
   FLTS will host two community workshops to engage community in design to ensure the park will meet their needs. Soapbox: When people contribute to a community asset, they invest themselves and derive a sense of pride that often empowers them to stay active in and care for their community. 
   
   2. Late Winter/Early Spring 2015: Design. 
   SWA will finalize the design based on community drawings and verbal input. Final design presented to community during a “sidewalk engagement” party which will serve as the kick off for their new space!
   
   3. Spring – Summer 2015: Construction. 
   
   4. Summer 2015 - Pocket Park Opens! The vacant lot is no more – we have converted a vacant lot into an urban “spot”.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  FLTS has a long standing belief that creating access to greenspaces in
  park-poor communities doesn’t need to be a process that begins in year 1 and
  ends with a park opening in year 9. Cypress Park Pocket Park will be a pivotal
  project in demonstrating that creating access to parks and greenspaces does
  not need to take years. This model can be easily implemented by agencies,
  community based organizations and non-profits to create a network of play and
  greenspaces in their park-poor communities. We are confident this model is a
  long-term, implementable solution to make LA the best place to play.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  For this project, the pocket park will directly benefit the community of
  Cypress Park in North east Los Angeles. According to the 2010 Census , Cypress
  Park has an estimated population of approximately 11, 000 people, among the
  highest densities in Los Angeles County. In addition, the household median
  income for the ½ mile radius of the proposed park is $39,559, well below the
  poverty line. 
   
   However, because this is a pilot project , this pocket park will demonstrate how these small, under-utilized vacant spaces can become a network of greenspaces in park-poor areas in all of Los Angeles. We will illustrate how this project can be replicated and implemented over and over in similar spaces across Los Angeles.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  We believe that successful community projects need a comprehensive
  collaborative of stakeholders. To ensure this, this project will be a
  collaborative between three major partners that will provide resources that
  will engage a comprehensive public. We will be partnering with local community
  leader and business in Cypress Park - Antigua Coffee House. Yancey Quinones,
  owner, is a community leader and advocate of creating community-driven,
  multi-benefit projects that inspire youth in Cypress Park to improve Cypress
  Park. Antigua Coffee House - located four blocks - from the vacant lot will
  serve as the community space hosting design workshops. 
   
   In addition 8th grade students from Nightingale Middle School located less than ¼ from the park will be engaged a grade-level service learning project during the park’s construction. Students will be involved in assisting with community engagement and final stage plantings at the park in 2nd semester of 2015.
   
   FLTS will be partnering with SWA Group (http://www.swagroup.com/) on design of the park. FLTS and SWA have partnered on greenspace projects in the last three years including our successful Dominguez Enhancement and Engagement Projects – which converted a vacant, blighted area of the Dominguez Creek in Gardena into a active bicycle path while restoring the natural habitat that existed along the creek. SWA is a world leader in landscape architecture, planning and urban design with a passion to create exceptional places for people with an emphasis on natural systems and art. SWA will bring their expertise in design to ensure these spaces are designed to specifically meet the community’s needs and assure quality design. 
   Lastly, in order to stay true to a community driven project, labor, materials and resources will be sourced locally. 
   Three factors that are critical to the success of the collaborations are: 
   1. An adopted understanding that final design of the space is community driven
   2. Committed and full participation from all partners
   3. Acknowledging that an engaged community is an empowered community – and every resource partners bring are guided by this principle
