  The NEP has been part of SCC’s primary services since September 2013.
  Implementation of its services is ongoing throughout the year. The NEP is led
  by Maria Paz Quiroga, M.S., R.D., Nutritionist, and available at all three of
  SCC’s sites, name the Beverly Health Center, S. Mark Taper Foundation Health
  Center, and Wallis Annenberg Children and Family Health Center at Hollywood
  Wilshire Health Center (WAC). The Pre-Diabetic and Fitness classes will be a
  new component to the NEP. Ms. Quiroga has already begun developing the
  curriculum for the Pre-Diabetic and Fitness classes. One-on-one and group
  education session will be held at all sites and classes will be held at WAC.
  Education session will be provided during regular business hours and each
  class will be offered on a bi-monthly basis every Saturday in one hour
  sessions. Each class will have between 20-30 students and will be provided
  throughout the year.
   
   The Pre-Diabetic class will covers topics such as identifying and defining diabetes and obesity, the effect of diabetes, how nutrition is linked to chronic disease, the importance of exercise, and more. Fitness classes will comprise of circuit training which incorporates a breadth of exercises such as strength training, cardio, and stretching. An education component will also be included to help participants perform the exercises at home. Participants will receive a diet journal to monitor food intake and utilize measuring tapes and calipers to evaluate progress.
   
   Upon notification of funds, Ms. Quiroga will purchase the necessary equipment and hire a contracted co-trainer to begin classes. SCC will use in-reach efforts to inform medical staff and providers of the services available as well outreach efforts to publicize NEP and its additional services.
   
   SCC’s in-reach efforts include posting posters at medical exam rooms and front desk as well as distributing informational flyers at the registration and discharge rooms. In terms of outreach efforts, SCC’s Managed Care Manager leads a team of Outreach Specialists to promote SCC’s various programs and services, including the NEP. The Managed Care Manager coordinates and leads culturally-sensitive and linguistically-appropriate outreach activities such as maintaining contact with agencies, initiating collaborations and partnerships, and participating in community events. The Outreach Specialists visit schools, local community and faith-based organizations, and other service centers.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  The NEP will make LA the healthiest place to live by providing access to
  quality and affordable health care, health education, and fitness classes to
  those most in need. According to the County of Los Angeles’s Key Indicators of
  Health by Service Planning Area report (2013), 19% of adults in SPA 4 live in
  neighborhoods that do not have walking paths, parks, playgrounds, or sports
  fields, thus limiting spaces to exercise. Further, 25% of adults reported
  their health to be fair or poor, and only 17% of adults say they consume five
  or more servings of fruits and vegetables a day. These statistics are amongst
  the highest of the eight LA County SPAs and shows the potential impact the
  NEP’s services can make. 
   
   One-on-one and group education sessions and the Pre-Diabetic class will teach individuals how to eat healthier, how to maximize their limited funds to purchase healthy foods, appropriate portion control, and much more. Fitness classes will provide individuals a free space to exercise as well as lessons on proper fitness regimens and exercise routines. 
   
   As participants gain more knowledge about nutrition and fitness through the NEP, they will be able to utilize and share them with their friends and family to promote a healthier and more active lifestyle. By 2050, SCC hopes that the network of persons reached will be great enough to have a significant impact on the Los Angeles community. SCC is confident that the NEP will have a positive effect on the communities it serves. SCC has already received positive remarks from patients on how the current NEP and its services have transformed different areas of their health including weight loss, eating habits, blood pressure, and medication intake.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The NEP will benefit both SCC’s current patients and individuals in SPA 4 who
  are at risk for or suffering from chronic disease.
   
   Over 7,000 patients at SCC are currently at risk for and or suffering from chronic disease. In Fiscal Year 2012-2013, 27,188 patient visits were related to chronic disease, accounting for more than a quarter (27%) of SCC’s total number of patient visits. SCC saw 5,653 patients for hypertension and 3,039 for diabetes. Most if not all of these patient can greatly benefit from the NEP and its free services.
   
   Chronic disease is also prevalent within SPA 4. According to the County of Los Angeles’s Key Indicators of Health by Service Planning Area report (2013), major chronic health concerns prevalent among SPA 4 residents include hypertension and high cholesterol. The percentage of hypertension in SPA 4 has increased from 14% in 1997 to 20% in 2011, and the percentage of high cholesterol has increased from 15% in 1999 to 24% in 2011 according to the same report. Diabetes in SPA 4 is also a health concern according to Kaiser Foundation Hospital - Los Angeles’s 2013 Community Health Needs Assessment. In SPA 4, the prevalence of diabetes is 17% and the hospitalization rate is 186 per 100,000 persons. Furthermore, uncontrolled hospitalizations is 22 per 100,000 persons. These statistics are amongst the highest of the eight SPAs. As such, it is clear that many individuals in SCC’s service area can benefit from the NEP.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Yes. The Nutritionist is currently researching and contacting local food banks
  and researching local grocery stores to provide a list of healthy and
  affordable food. Local food banks in SCC’s service area include the Greater
  West Hollywood Food Coalition, World Harvest Food Bank, Los Angeles Regional
  Food Bank, Project Angel Food, and more. 
   
   Three factors critical to a successful collaboration are the following:
   1. Large Capacity. SCC and local food banks and local grocery stores must have reasonably sized resources to accommodate the need for healthy food.
   2. Trustworthiness. SCC and local food banks will need the trust of the community, including those serves, for retaining patients in the NEP. 
   3. Locality. All partnerships and collaborations must be local and accessible and in proximity of patients.
