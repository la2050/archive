  The NEP has been part of SCC’s primary services since September 2013.
  Implementation of its services is ongoing throughout the year. The NEP is led
  by Maria Paz Quiroga, M.S., R.D., Nutritionist, and available at all three of
  SCC’s sites, name the Beverly Health Center, S. Mark Taper Foundation Health
  Center, and Wallis Annenberg Children and Family Health Center at Hollywood
  Wilshire Health Center (WAC). The Pre-Diabetic and Fitness classes will be a
  new component to the NEP. Ms. Quiroga has already begun developing the
  curriculum for the Pre-Diabetic and Fitness classes. One-on-one and group
  education session will be held at all sites and classes will be held at WAC.
  Education session will be provided during regular business hours and each
  class will be offered on a bi-monthly basis every Saturday in one hour
  sessions. Each class will have between 20-30 students and will be provided
  throughout the year.
   
   The Pre-Diabetic class will covers topics such as identifying and defining diabetes and obesity, the effect of diabetes, how nutrition is linked to chronic disease, the importance of exercise, and more. Fitness classes will comprise of circuit training which incorporates a breadth of exercises such as strength training, cardio, and stretching. An education component will also be included to help participants perform the exercises at home. Participants will receive a diet journal to monitor food intake and utilize measuring tapes and calipers to evaluate progress.
   
   Upon notification of funds, Ms. Quiroga will purchase the necessary equipment and hire a contracted co-trainer to begin classes. SCC will use in-reach efforts to inform medical staff and providers of the services available as well outreach efforts to publicize NEP and its additional services.
   
   SCC’s in-reach efforts include posting posters at medical exam rooms and front desk as well as distributing informational flyers at the registration and discharge rooms. In terms of outreach efforts, SCC’s Managed Care Manager leads a team of Outreach Specialists to promote SCC’s various programs and services, including the NEP. The Managed Care Manager coordinates and leads culturally-sensitive and linguistically-appropriate outreach activities such as maintaining contact with agencies, initiating collaborations and partnerships, and participating in community events. The Outreach Specialists visit schools, local community and faith-based organizations, and other service centers.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  The NEP will make LA the healthiest place to live by providing access to
  quality and affordable health care, health education, and fitness classes to
  those most in need. According to the County of Los Angeles’s Key Indicators of
  Health by Service Planning Area report (2013), 19% of adults in SPA 4 live in
  neighborhoods that do not have walking paths, parks, playgrounds, or sports
  fields, thus limiting spaces to exercise. Further, 25% of adults reported
  their health to be fair or poor, and only 17% of adults say they consume five
  or more servings of fruits and vegetables a day. These statistics are amongst
  the highest of the eight LA County SPAs and shows the potential impact the
  NEP’s services can make. 
   
   One-on-one and group education sessions and the Pre-Diabetic class will teach individuals how to eat healthier, how to maximize their limited funds to purchase healthy foods, appropriate portion control, and much more. Fitness classes will provide individuals a free space to exercise as well as lessons on proper fitness regimens and exercise routines. 
   
   As participants gain more knowledge about nutrition and fitness through the NEP, they will be able to utilize and share them with their friends and family to promote a healthier and more active lifestyle. By 2050, SCC hopes that the network of persons reached will be great enough to have a significant impact on the Los Angeles community. SCC is confident that the NEP will have a positive effect on the communities it serves. SCC has already received positive remarks from patients on how the current NEP and its services have transformed different areas of their health including weight loss, eating habits, blood pressure, and medication intake.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The NEP will benefit both SCC’s current patients and individuals in SPA 4 who
  are at risk for or suffering from chronic disease.
   
   Over 7,000 patients at SCC are currently at risk for and or suffering from chronic disease. In Fiscal Year 2012-2013, 27,188 patient visits were related to chronic disease, accounting for more than a quarter (27%) of SCC’s total number of patient visits. SCC saw 5,653 patients for hypertension and 3,039 for diabetes. Most if not all of these patient can greatly benefit from the NEP and its free services.
   
   Chronic disease is also prevalent within SPA 4. According to the County of Los Angeles’s Key Indicators of Health by Service Planning Area report (2013), major chronic health concerns prevalent among SPA 4 residents include hypertension and high cholesterol. The percentage of hypertension in SPA 4 has increased from 14% in 1997 to 20% in 2011, and the percentage of high cholesterol has increased from 15% in 1999 to 24% in 2011 according to the same report. Diabetes in SPA 4 is also a health concern according to Kaiser Foundation Hospital - Los Angeles’s 2013 Community Health Needs Assessment. In SPA 4, the prevalence of diabetes is 17% and the hospitalization rate is 186 per 100,000 persons. Furthermore, uncontrolled hospitalizations is 22 per 100,000 persons. These statistics are amongst the highest of the eight SPAs. As such, it is clear that many individuals in SCC’s service area can benefit from the NEP.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Yes. The Nutritionist is currently researching and contacting local food banks
  and researching local grocery stores to provide a list of healthy and
  affordable food. Local food banks in SCC’s service area include the Greater
  West Hollywood Food Coalition, World Harvest Food Bank, Los Angeles Regional
  Food Bank, Project Angel Food, and more. 
   
   Three factors critical to a successful collaboration are the following:
   1. Large Capacity. SCC and local food banks and local grocery stores must have reasonably sized resources to accommodate the need for healthy food.
   2. Trustworthiness. SCC and local food banks will need the trust of the community, including those serves, for retaining patients in the NEP. 
   3. Locality. All partnerships and collaborations must be local and accessible and in proximity of patients.

  more_detail: "The Achievable Clinic is a state-licensed Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) specializing in providing appropriate, coordinated, continuous, high-quality and comprehensive healthcare services to our under-served community members, with a special focus on serving individuals with developmental disabilities and their families who lack access to such care in the broader community. \r\nFederal support comes with compliance requirements that do not always take into account the unique needs of our clients.  Achievable is looking to collaborate with LA2050 in order to align our model of care with FQHC rules and expectations while still meeting the complex healthcare needs of our clients as well as ensuring long term financial sustainability.  "
  implement: "FQHCs that focus on special populations such as residents of public housing, persons experiencing homelessness or agricultural workers, are subject to special waivers and accommodations that allow the FQHCs to address the unique health care needs of these groups.  No such process currently exists for people with developmental disabilities. \r\n\r\nIt is our hope that we can demonstrate to HRSA the merits of designating people with developmental disabilities as a special population.  Consequently such a designation would allow us to get the proper reimbursement rate for services rendered as well as allow us to receive continued HRSA grant funding. \r\n\r\nIn that regard, we believe that a significant portion of funding could be allocated to the efforts of our CEO and additional consulting support as Achievable looks to streamline operations, ensure federal, state and county compliance, grow our patient base and ensure that we are properly compensated for the care we provide to our clients.  "
  impact_live: >-
    The groups of people we serve are amongst the most medically complex
    individuals in the county.  By better serving their needs, we can help the
    healthcare safety net better deal with the impacts via reduced
    hospitalizations, visits to ER's and better management and prevention of
    chronic health conditions that can be reduced via on-going, culturally
    competent and timely care.  The impacts go beyond the thousands of clients
    we serve, to their families and other care-givers which often neglect their
    own health even as they care for our patients.
  who_benefit: "The Achievable Foundation is a nonprofit organization founded in 1996 with the mission of significantly improving the health and quality of life of under-served individuals living in Los Angeles County who have developmental disabilities such as autism, intellectual disability, cerebral palsy and epilepsy. \r\n\r\nIndividuals with developmental disabilities have numerous complex health care needs and experience poorer health than the general population, including disproportionately high incidence of chronic conditions and preventable mortality.   Although state and federally-supported Community Health Center programs provide significant support for meeting the needs of many vulnerable populations, there is no specific framework for addressing the unique challenges posed in serving a patient base made up primarily of individuals with developmental disabilities.\r\n\r\nWe aim to serve the tens of thousands of potential clients that may seek our services from across the entire county of Los Angeles."
  partners_collaboration: "The Achievable Clinic is leveraging our strategic partnerships with organizations like the Westside Regional Center (WRC)--where we are co-located-- to offer a growing spectrum of health care services to the expanding number of individuals with developmental disabilities who have MediCal insurance coverage through L.A. Care Health Plan.  Based on the latest information from L.A. Care, there are over 2,286 clients at WRC (or roughly one third of all WRC clients) signed up with one of L.A. Care’s health plan providers.   \r\n\r\nAs part of an extensive outreach plan, Achievable is looking to become the medical home of choice for many new L.A. Care clients. Serving as a medical home to L.A. Care clients places our clinic in a strategic position to contribute significantly towards L.A. Care Health Plan’s Triple Aim goals of achieving excellent patient outcomes, excellent patient experiences, and cost effectiveness and efficiency on behalf of our shared clients. To that end, we seek to improve patient experiences while minimizing long-term medical costs through an integrated, whole-person approach to addressing the ongoing healthcare needs of our community members.  \r\n\r\nIf we can demonstrate the effectiveness of this strategy working with WRC, this could be expanded to the other Regional Centers across LA County that together serve tens of thousands of individuals with developmental disabilities."

Individuals with developmental disabilities have numerous complex health care needs and experience poorer health than the general population, including disproportionately high incidence of chronic conditions and preventable mortality.    \r\n\r\nAlthough state and federally-supported Community Health Center programs provide significant support for meeting the needs of many vulnerable populations, there is no specific framework for addressing the unique challenges posed in serving a patient base made up primarily of individuals with developmental disabilities.\r\n\r\nWe also address the mental health issues via our specialists in mental health through our UCLA and Cedars partnerships with their specialty care clinicians working at our clinic.  Collaborating with the Regional Centers also allows for better coordination of services, including various social needs such as housing assistance and job support and independent living skills offered by our partners at Westside Regional Center."

    Achievable deliverables would include both a planning document that will be
    shared with our Health Resource Services Administration (HRSA) liaison and
    other leaders, as well as the establishment of a meeting subsequent to
    delivery of our alignment document to determine next steps and action plans
    to effect changes to the current model that apply to clinics like the
    Achievable Clinic.  In addition, evaluation of the success of the project
    would include the formulation of a long-term plan for obtaining Special
    Population designation for the Achievable FQHC.  This should translate into
    enhanced technical assistance, potential new funding support, and waivers
    that may allow us to meet compliance requirements without compromising our
    client needs or undermining long-term fiscal sustainability.
  two_lessons: >-
    We are learning that the federal healthcare system is very much oriented
    towards a volume and efficiency level that makes it hard to take into
    account the complex healthcare and support needs of people with
    developmental disabilities.  In order to build sustainable safety net
    supports for these individuals, it will be necessary to build in more
    flexibility into the compliance requirements as well as more support options
    that can take into account the different  business models that have to
    evolve to accommodate the unique needs of our patients.  We also realize
    that in order for other parts of the community to pursue this access to
    healthcare gap for clients with developmental disabilities it is vital to
    have viable demonstration pilots to learn from and Achievable can be one of
    those such blueprints with your support.
  achievable_goal: >-
    Twelve months will allow us to begin the research and initial interaction
    stages of implementation, including scheduling meetings with the appropriate
    federal authorities.  That being said, we are aware that this is the
    beginning of  long-term investment in effecting truly wide-ranging change
    that could impact how possibly millions of americans get access to
    healthcare.  The system does not take into account the unique needs of
    people with developmental disabilities, and our hope that this process will
    begin changing how the healthcare network works for this growing part of our
    community.
  major_challenges: >-
    The primary challenges are that this process may be laying the groundwork
    for eventual change that may take more than 12 months.  Change at the
    Federal level is incremental.  In addition, we are not aware of the process
    other groups have utilized to effect similar changes for special populations
    that have received special support like homeless clients and those in
    agricultural regions that have migrant workers.  That being said, raising
    awareness even at the initial stages of this project may allow us to get
    some of the technical assistance and support that the Federal government
    provides to other special population designees.  
  competition: "There are organizations in Northern CA working on similar issues.  At UC San Francisco, they are working with partners to develop clinical solutions for similar potential clients in the San Mateo county area.  We have collaborated with them to share best practices and possibly link up in the future to form a more systemic partnership.  \r\n\r\nAcross a number of universities, there are Centers of Excellence that are providing various programs to help increase healthcare solutions for people with complex healthcare needs in the developmental disabilities arena.  We are aware of their work, and have collaborated with them in a number of ways.  For instance, we have a collaboration with UCLA's Neuro Psychiatric Institute that allows our patients to get access to mental health professionals with experience in our field. \r\n\r\nFinally, we are working with the Department of Developmental Disabilities via its Regional Center network in a collaborative approach to improving outreach and access to their clients.  Currently, we are working with Westside Regional Center, where our new clinic is co-located. "
  cost: >-
    $100,000 is our expected budget, which is covered in more detail in the
    section below.  The other parts of our operating budget are being sustained
    via patient revenues, individual donations and continuing support from
    corporations and foundations as well as public support.  We have also been
    able to leverage significant pro-bono services and in-kind donations.
  budget: "Achievable is respectfully asking for $100,000 in funding to support our Executive leadership in documenting our alignment with the FQHC model. At the heart of this request is the creation of an FQHC Special Population planning process that can be documented in order to demonstrate to HRSA exactly how our clinic model operates, with the view of establishing a case for consideration of developmental disabilities as a potential Special Population Designation in future FQHC certification and support initiatives. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, we are asking to be considered for $30,000 in strategic funding to support our CEO’s contributions to the FQHC alignment documentation process, $50,000 for outside consulting support (including research of prior successful designation processes as well as feasibility assessment for Achievable’s plan), and $20,000 for Operations and Development staff contributions (which would include data collections and evaluation of existing operations and patient impacts and costs). \r\n\r\nThese positions are vital to both producing the documentation to be presented to HRSA, and the follow up needed to make a case to the relevant authorities that a special designation for developmental disabilities is both appropriate and viable.  The funding would cover the costs of researching past efforts to create Special Population designation procedures (such as those for people experiencing homelessness), conducting a feasibility analysis, making the case for support, and providing the required data and justification to underpin a similar request on behalf of our population being served."

To that end, we seek to improve patient experiences while minimizing long-term medical costs through an integrated, whole-person approach to addressing the ongoing healthcare needs of our community members.  \r\n\r\nIf we can demonstrate the effectiveness of this strategy working with WRC, this could be expanded to the other Regional Centers across LA County that together serve tens of thousands of individuals with developmental disabilities."

    answer: "We will improve access to healthcare by being able to serve thousands of clients via our FQHC clinic with enhanced Special Population status allowing for possibly more funding and technical assistance as we implement our clinical care model.\r\n\r\nWe can address the obesity crisis by working with more clients and families in our patient centered medical home model.  Individuals with developmental disabilities have numerous complex health care needs and experience poorer health than the general population, including disproportionately high incidence of chronic conditions and preventable mortality.    \r\n\r\nAlthough state and federally-supported Community Health Center programs provide significant support for meeting the needs of many vulnerable populations, there is no specific framework for addressing the unique challenges posed in serving a patient base made up primarily of individuals with developmental disabilities.\r\n\r\nWe also address the mental health issues via our specialists in mental health through our UCLA and Cedars partnerships with their specialty care clinicians working at our clinic.  Collaborating with the Regional Centers also allows for better coordination of services, including various social needs such as housing assistance and job support and independent living skills offered by our partners at Westside Regional Center."

      Achievable deliverables would include both a planning document that will
      be shared with our Health Resource Services Administration (HRSA) liaison
      and other leaders, as well as the establishment of a meeting subsequent to
      delivery of our alignment document to determine next steps and action
      plans to effect changes to the current model that apply to clinics like
      the Achievable Clinic.  In addition, evaluation of the success of the
      project would include the formulation of a long-term plan for obtaining
      Special Population designation for the Achievable FQHC.  This should
      translate into enhanced technical assistance, potential new funding
      support, and waivers that may allow us to meet compliance requirements
      without compromising our client needs or undermining long-term fiscal
      sustainability.

      We are learning that the federal healthcare system is very much oriented
      towards a volume and efficiency level that makes it hard to take into
      account the complex healthcare and support needs of people with
      developmental disabilities.  In order to build sustainable safety net
      supports for these individuals, it will be necessary to build in more
      flexibility into the compliance requirements as well as more support
      options that can take into account the different  business models that
      have to evolve to accommodate the unique needs of our patients.  We also
      realize that in order for other parts of the community to pursue this
      access to healthcare gap for clients with developmental disabilities it is
      vital to have viable demonstration pilots to learn from and Achievable can
      be one of those such blueprints with your support.

      Twelve months will allow us to begin the research and initial interaction
      stages of implementation, including scheduling meetings with the
      appropriate federal authorities.  That being said, we are aware that this
      is the beginning of  long-term investment in effecting truly wide-ranging
      change that could impact how possibly millions of americans get access to
      healthcare.  The system does not take into account the unique needs of
      people with developmental disabilities, and our hope that this process
      will begin changing how the healthcare network works for this growing part
      of our community.

      The primary challenges are that this process may be laying the groundwork
      for eventual change that may take more than 12 months.  Change at the
      Federal level is incremental.  In addition, we are not aware of the
      process other groups have utilized to effect similar changes for special
      populations that have received special support like homeless clients and
      those in agricultural regions that have migrant workers.  That being said,
      raising awareness even at the initial stages of this project may allow us
      to get some of the technical assistance and support that the Federal
      government provides to other special population designees.

    answer: "There are organizations in Northern CA working on similar issues.  At UC San Francisco, they are working with partners to develop clinical solutions for similar potential clients in the San Mateo county area.  We have collaborated with them to share best practices and possibly link up in the future to form a more systemic partnership.  \r\n\r\nAcross a number of universities, there are Centers of Excellence that are providing various programs to help increase healthcare solutions for people with complex healthcare needs in the developmental disabilities arena.  We are aware of their work, and have collaborated with them in a number of ways.  For instance, we have a collaboration with UCLA's Neuro Psychiatric Institute that allows our patients to get access to mental health professionals with experience in our field. \r\n\r\nFinally, we are working with the Department of Developmental Disabilities via its Regional Center network in a collaborative approach to improving outreach and access to their clients.  Currently, we are working with Westside Regional Center, where our new clinic is co-located. "

      $100,000 is our expected budget, which is covered in more detail in the
      section below.  The other parts of our operating budget are being
      sustained via patient revenues, individual donations and continuing
      support from corporations and foundations as well as public support.  We
      have also been able to leverage significant pro-bono services and in-kind
      donations.

    answer: "Achievable is respectfully asking for $100,000 in funding to support our Executive leadership in documenting our alignment with the FQHC model. At the heart of this request is the creation of an FQHC Special Population planning process that can be documented in order to demonstrate to HRSA exactly how our clinic model operates, with the view of establishing a case for consideration of developmental disabilities as a potential Special Population Designation in future FQHC certification and support initiatives. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, we are asking to be considered for $30,000 in strategic funding to support our CEO’s contributions to the FQHC alignment documentation process, $50,000 for outside consulting support (including research of prior successful designation processes as well as feasibility assessment for Achievable’s plan), and $20,000 for Operations and Development staff contributions (which would include data collections and evaluation of existing operations and patient impacts and costs). \r\n\r\nThese positions are vital to both producing the documentation to be presented to HRSA, and the follow up needed to make a case to the relevant authorities that a special designation for developmental disabilities is both appropriate and viable.  The funding would cover the costs of researching past efforts to create Special Population designation procedures (such as those for people experiencing homelessness), conducting a feasibility analysis, making the case for support, and providing the required data and justification to underpin a similar request on behalf of our population being served."
