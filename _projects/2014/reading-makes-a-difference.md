  We open with motivational Introductory Assemblies geared to each grade level,
  kicking off a 3-week Read-A-Thon. Student reading results in 35 “Jester” books
  and 35 Jester & Pharley Dolls given to local pediatric patients, with
  bookplates acknowledging the school and sponsor. The school receives 30 copies
  of the bilingual English/Spanish "The Jester Has Lost His Jingle/El Bufón ha
  perdido su gracia” and 30 sets of Jester educator-developed enrichment manuals
  -- Curriculum Guide to ‘The Jester Has Lost His Jingle,’” “Educator’s Guide to
  ‘The Jester Has Lost His Jingle,’” “The Jester & Pharley PhunBook.” The
  library receives a Jester & Pharley Doll and “Jester’s Journey” DVD with
  background material. Creative projects, including care cards & illustrations,
  also fire up student imaginations. Many student cards and drawings are
  featured at "Jester & Pharley Place" on our www.thejester.org website. We cap
  the program 6 weeks later with a Recognition Assembly celebrating top readers
  & classrooms with special awards. We invite sponsors and hospital
  representatives to participate.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Literacy will always be the cornerstone of learning – today and in 2050. When
  children can read, doors open. Illiteracy deprives students of a more
  lucrative, bright future. We are dedicated to providing children struggling
  with challenges in disadvantaged neighborhoods with the motivation they need
  to read. We envision all children – especially minority and low-income
  children – improving their and others’ lives because of our literacy program.
  If inspired at an early age to enjoy reading and understand the importance of
  being a contributing member of society, children will lead more productive and
  responsible adult lives and make L.A. the best place to learn. 
   A key objective in teaching low-income children charity is to empower them. Schools praise our program for providing disadvantaged students with a concrete way to GIVE. When students see they can help others simply by reading, they realize they can give of themselves without having to donate money. As we motivate students to give, a love for reading develops. They become empowered learners. Principals report seeing stronger readers and lasting, positive character development that begins with The Jester program. Our project helps children learn as they find joy, meaning and new ideas in books. 
   Our focus consistently draws raves from educators, like this librarian who shepherded our first program: “The most profound impact was in the read-a-thon by which students could give ‘Jester’ books & dolls to children in our local hospital. The level of participation and enthusiasm has been phenomenal. Most of our students are too poor to purchase ‘The Jester’ for themselves, but they care deeply about others. We work very hard to reinforce the importance of caring to our students, so that as they grow older they are tempted less by drugs and violence and more by empathy toward their fellow human beings. Character education requires a way for children to show their character. By offering students the opportunity to actually give something to other children through their own efforts, you enriched their lives immeasurably.”
   This year, an East L.A. teacher noted that, “Students were more conscious of their choice of words, attitudes and beliefs, of friendship, respect, bullying, negative attitudes and they tried more honestly to be more positive.” Teachers tell us their students want to be “just like The Jester” and live up to The Jester’s motto: “It’s up to us to make a difference. It’s up to us to care."
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The Jester & Pharley Phund’s Reading Makes A Difference project, which costs
  $5,000 per school, provides direct benefits to all students, teachers, staff
  and administrators at each school. Using an average of 700 students per
  school, with 30 classrooms per school, 5 administrators and staff per school,
  the total number of direct beneficiaries at 20 schools can be estimated to be:
   ● 14,000 students
   ● 28,000 siblings (an average of 2 per student)
   ● 21,000 parents (an average of 1.5 per student)
   ● 600 teachers
   ● 100 administrators/staff
   Additionally, student participation in The Jester & Pharley Phund Read-A-Thon will result in 35 copies of “The Jester Has Lost His Jingle/El Bufón ha perdido su gracia” and 35 Jester & Pharley Dolls per school donated to an L.A. County hospital.
   Benefiting would be:
   ● 600 young patients receiving “The Jester Has Lost His Jingle/El Bufón ha perdido su gracia”
   ● 600 young patients receiving The Jester & Pharley Doll
   Also benefiting would be the siblings and parents of each child receiving the gift. Since many recipients will be from Spanish-speaking households, the parents would be able to share the powerful uplifting messages of the book with their children in their native language.
   ● 1,200 siblings sharing “The Jester Has Lost His Jingle/El Bufón ha perdido su gracia”
   ● 1,200 siblings sharing The Jester & Pharley Doll with detachable Pharley 
   Low-income families make up the predominant population of the elementary schools with which we partner (elementary population compiled from California Department of Education data). For many, Spanish is their first language. Students at these schools can encounter serious difficulties in acquiring English-language skills quickly. Literacy is the key to becoming an independent learner in all disciplines and our project facilitates literacy development in a fun and efficacious way.
   Similarly, disadvantaged children similarly seldom have the opportunity to act as benefactors. The Jester not only encourages students to consider the needs of others but also provides, through the chance to give Jester books and dolls, a means to channel growing compassion into concrete action.
   And the impact on ill children who receive Jester books and dolls from student participation in our Read-A-Thons is profound. These children often have few, if any, books of their own and urgently need the emotional, educational and therapeutic support The Jester & Pharley book and doll provide.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  During the 13 years that we have been providing this program, we have built
  strong relationships among numerous educators in many L.A. school districts
  and among numerous medical professionals in L.A. County hospitals and clinics.
  Each partner brings a knowledge and understanding of children affected by
  their profession, enhancing the program. Our educator enrichment manuals were
  created with these and other collaborators. 
   The many low-income schools that would like their students to participate in this program come from throughout the county. Christopher J. Steinhauser, Superintendent of the Long Beach Unified School District, is a key collaborator. He has seen positive results in the 15 district elementary schools in which our project has already been implemented and would like to see it boost literacy in the 39 others. In 2013, Phund Executive Director Barbara Saltzman was presented with the Superintendent’s Distinguished Community Service Award for inspiring Long Beach students to read and care about others through this program.
   We will continue to work in the Compton Unified School District with Jefferson Elementary Principal Mario Marcos and Afterschool Program Coordinator Rea Young as well as Dr. Abimmbola Ajala, Assistant Superintendent of Educational Services. Having successfully brought the program to Jefferson and Carver schools, we have been asked to bring it to more of the district’s 28 elementary schools.
   Hospital partners include; Dr. Divya-Devi Joshi, Chief Medical Officer, Miller Children’s Hospital Long Beach; Dr. Ernest Katz, Director of Behavioral Sciences, Children’s Hospital L.A.; Dr. Julie E. Noble, Coordinator of Community Advocacy, Pediatrics Dept. of Harbor-UCLA Medical Center; Cesar Armendariz, Vice President of Business Development, White Memorial Medical Center; Tanya Ybarra, Director of Child Life at California Hospital, and many others. 
   Three factors critical to the success of our proposed collaboration are:
   ● Timely administrative support of and encouragement of the program at the school and district level 
   ● Teamwork with a school liaison who will routinely remain in touch with The Phund throughout the program. Regular communication is vital to maintaining the quality and consistency of the program and working through any slight bumps that might occur along the way. 
   ● Hospital desire for Jester books and dolls to benefit patients.
   “The book is a perfect fit to our literacy program,” reports CHLA & others.
