Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  The Imagined Futures consists of three components: live programming; a
  sequence of galleries; and an augmented-reality panorama of the city of Los
  Angeles in the future. We can start work on the first of these today; the
  other two need custom-designed physical spaces which we will start preparing.
  The first phase of The Imagined Futures, covered by this grant, is the next
  year. We will establish ourselves with live programming while finalizing the
  design for the complete vision. The second phase will implement that vision
  with the aim of opening the building at the end of 2016. (More on this can be
  read on our website, http://theimaginedfutures.org) 
   
   We've found a group of designers and creative minds to help develop our vision. Many are former Disney Imagineers now working at places like Google, The X Prize Foundation, and The Hettema Group. Over the past year, we've had twelve charettes with this group; that process will continue, but we're now at the point where we should work with a professional design firm – Thinkwell Group – to come up with concrete visions of the space needed, layouts of the galleries, what exhibits require, and the greater user experience. We estimate this process will take three months. 
   
   After this, we can commission a feasibility study from Entertainment + Culture Advisors to determine the project's cost (working estimate: $70 million) and resource usage. This will take another three months. At that point, serious fundraising can begin with introductions to potential partners: individuals and L.A.-based corporations that see our work as a way to attract possible future talent.
   
   In parallel with this work, we will start implementing live educational programming – some in Spanish or dual-language – by bringing together creatives and technologists to imagine futures in front of the general public. Our partners will the National Academy of Sciences, who have been presenting films with commentary from scientists. Working with the NAS, we will expand programming to include panels, presentations, debates, and competitions, as well as building mutually beneficial visibility.
   
   We also want to work with schools to bring scientists and artists working in creative media to students as a tool for educators to augment existing curricula. We want to bring together storytellers and people working on technology featured in stories to create a moment of revelation for audiences throughout the city who otherwise might not have such access.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Los Angeles has been built on the idea that the future is captivating. Our
  inexhaustible appetite for science fiction and imaginative entertainment –
  often created right here in Hollywood – exists because everyone loves thinking
  about potential futures. Innovation, in both art and sciences, happens because
  someone looks at the world and imagines how an element of it could be
  different – and, perhaps, the changes that might come across because of that
  difference. New products – and works of art – come into being this way all the
  time. And social change can happen because people imagine better possible
  futures. By encouraging creative and imaginative thinking, we can cultivate a
  better future. The Imagined Futures wants to challenge people to explore,
  predict and imagine the possibilities for the future.
   
   That's why this project, at its core, is about Los Angeles itself. The possibilities for a city focused on imagining future potentials – as Los Angeles historically has been, from the prominence of the film and aerospace industries in the twentieth century to Activision today – are exciting. We want make sure that LA doesn't lose creativity to centers like San Francisco or New York by highlighting local creators, researchers, and companies who are on the cutting edge. We want to excite young Angelenos about scientific, technological, and creative career choices. The Imagined Futures also celebrates imagination, which teaches critical thinking, collaboration, problem solving, and entrepreneurship just as it leads to new industries in engineering, art, science and design. 
   
   A major goal for The Imagined Futures is to brand – or rebrand – LA as the premier place for creative minds to come to tinker with science and art in order to make exciting new things. This rebranding will have an immediate effect on existing creative industries: companies will be able to attract new talent and new ventures will find a foothold here. But the broader benefits of The Imagined Futures will only be seen with time. The seeds of ideas dreamed up today can blossom into future industries and fields of study. By 2050 there will be a more pronounced effect, as students who have grown up with The Imagined Futures programming will become major players in the industries that define the city. A population raised to prioritize the imagination will develop faster, farther and smarter. By doing so, we hope to create a population that will sustain Los Angeles well into the future.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Primary beneficiaries of The Imagined Futures in its completed form will be
  visitors. Visitors to The Imagined Futures can be divided into three groups:
  1) tourists, as we imagine it becoming a destination like LACMA or the
  California Science Center; 2) school children, who will visit The Imagined
  Futures in classroom groups as part of our educational component; and 3)
  Angelenos, who will return for event programming even if they've already
  visited the museum component.
   
   Even at the project's inception, other primary beneficiaries will be Los Angeles scientists, technologists, artists, and storytellers. The Imagined Futures will allow scientists to connect with artists (and vice versa), as well as sharing insights and ideas with the general public, which appears to be interested but generally lacks a venue for this sort of learning. The Imagined Futures will also be a platform for scientists and technologists as well as entertainment firms to promote their work as a way to attract attention, future talent, and the funds to continue.
   
   By extension, this project will benefit the Los Angeles economy more broadly – by bringing in money to the area – and attention to Los Angeles firms and creators. As a resource for educators, it will make getting students interested in STEM jobs (and thinking more broadly about the function of creativity) easier. A primary goal of this museum is to interest underrepresented populations in STEM fields: women, minorities, low-income groups, and those with English as a second language. Long-term, we'd like to see those students going into science, technology, and entertainment, bringing with them their diverse backgrounds and keeping their skills in the Los Angeles area. We want to be a driver of technological and entertainment progress in Los Angeles, which will benefit everyone. 
   
   In the short term, The Imagined Futures will not have a physical building. The number of people – and their economic effects – attending programs set up by The Imagined Futures will be smaller than it will be. We will, however, be able to launch our first year of educational initiatives, as well as public programming in partnership with the National Academy of Sciences. Collaborations between creators and scientists – and interaction between those professionals and students – will be happening from the beginning. We envision an immediate impact on students as well as a secondary impact on the creative arts in Los Angeles.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  As mentioned above, there's been a tremendous interest in our project. We've
  formed an informal working group to design the project that includes people
  working at JPL, Tesla, Google, Disney Imagineering, The X Prize Foundation,
  and The Hettema Group, as well as writers, film producers, gamemakers,
  designers, and architects.
   
   To move forward, we need a complete design for the project's physical implementation. Members of the Burbank-based Thinkwell Group – the premier agency for designing museums, theme parks, and exhibits – have been working with us informally. Thinkwell has agreed to take us on as a client. Their work will finalize concrete visions of the space needed, layouts of the galleries, exhibition requirements, and user experience. We estimate this process will take three months. Once finished, we can commission a feasibility study from Beverly Hills-based Entertainment + Culture Advisors, who we've been meeting with. Successful completion of both studies will allow us to pinpoint exactly what we need to build to make our project feasible and designed for its highest potential. The concrete plan this process will develop will allow us to begin more serious fundraising. 
   
   Risks with these partners include time and money: our working process has given us a good idea of what we'd like to do, but a design process that isn't carefully controlled could drag out and cost more money than we've anticipated. We've reduced risk by having a long pre-design process working with others who've worked on similar projects – like Seattle's Experience Music Project. We've learned from their mistakes. Mission drift is a potential problem, but one we've attempted to minimize by focusing on what we want to do and working with experienced people. 
   
   As part of this preparedness, we want to start programming before we have a final space. Our partner in this will be The Science & Entertainment Exchange, part of the National Academy of Sciences. While they typically work with movies and television to increase the amount of science on screen, they want to work with us to reach a broader audience through public programming. Potential issues are building compelling programming, attracting audiences, and finding spaces. The NAS has shown they can do the first of these; we have tentative agreements with members of our working group in the entertainment business – including film institutes – to help us with the second and third of these issues.
