What is your idea/project in more detail?: |-
  TODAY:
   Today, we know that activities that engage the body and mind have greater impact on what a person learns today but more importantly are retained throughout life. Our program empowers youth to embrace a life-long learning approach to health & wellness.Through education and discussion, this project will increase youth awareness that choices made today effect both present and later-life health and wellness. 
   Our focus will be based on MetroHealth Station's "whole-person" approach to health and wellness, which includes:
    PHYSICAL HEALTH
    - Nutrition and how it affects cognition, physicality, and exercise
    - Obesity prevention
    - Physical health and wellness
    ORAL HEALTH
    - The importance of oral hygiene
    - How nutrition affects teeth, tongue, and gums
    MEDICAL HEALTH
    - Diabetes prevention
    - Sexual and reproductive health
    - Nutrition, the immune system, and health
    - Medical health and wellness
    EMOTIONAL HEALTH
    - Anger management
    - Bullying/Violence
    - Sexual respect and responsibility
    - Self Esteem
    - Healthy Body, Healthy Mind (connection between nutrition/physical health and mental health)
    - Effective communication and listening
    - Comfort with one's self and with others
   
   We expect that our positive model of health and wellness will be associated with:
    - Creation of a sense of community and camaraderie within local youth
    - Reduction of gang participation by offering community and responsibility
    - Reduction in crime
    - Increase in school attendance
    - Reduction of violence and bullying
    - Reduction in teen pregnancy (increased awareness and practice of safe sexual practices, including abstinence as an option)
   
   2050:
   Over time, as students internalize the ideas and apply them to their own lives while helping others to adopt them as well, the effect will amplify. We see our project having long term goals of:
    - Reduction in overall gang presence
    - Reduction in drug use and overdose
    - Increased school truancy/dropout prevention
    - Instilling mindfulness of personal wellness, helping them to avoid joblessness, homelessness, addiction, and incarceration
    - Students' passing of skills they have learned to the next generation
   
   Successful implementation of this project will lead to its reproduction in other locations, spreading wellness and health across all of Los Angeles.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Health & wellness affects everyone! Each life stage from infancy, through
  grade school and high school to young and older adulthood is associated with
  health benefits and health risks. The Healthy Teens LA program will focus on
  the health of youth 12-17 yrs but teens will learn health information that
  will affect them, their friends and family, and the community.
   
   Specifically, we expect that our youth leaders will be health ambassadors for their own school. In addition, our youth leaders will be part of our community outreach activities used to recruit other youth from other schools.
   
   All youth participants will be involved in mentoring programs where older youth supervise younger students in lower grades. Our past programs sponsored with LAUSD Foshay Learning Center has taught us that youth are the best health advocates....especially for other youth and their families.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: |-
  Confirmed partners include:
   
   SCHOOLS:
   LAUSD Foshay Learning Center - We have cultivated relationships with the local schools in the Southern LA area, with the strongest connection being with LAUSD Foshay Learning Center. This school, home to 1st through 12th grades, has partnered with MetroHealth Station on many occasions, ranging from a 5k fun run, to a very successful health education activity night. Foshay Leaning Center is a confirmed collaborator that will contribute students, faculty insight, advertising and outreach support, and organizational support. They will also act as a key contact point when we are reaching out to other schools to join in the project. Other area schools have expressed interest and agreements are in discussion.
   
   CHURCHES & NON_PROFIT PARTNERS:
   West Angeles CDC & the West Angeles Church of God in Christ - MHS is located on the northeast corner of W Jefferson Blvd and Crenshaw Blvd. The Church is not only our landlord but a supportive advocate for our work. West Angeles Plaza has been instrumental in our outreach efforts with the MetroHealth Station thus far, and will continue to collaborate with us on this project. The church of over 22,000 members, as well as multiple social outreach organizations and groups, has offered to publicize on our behalf, advertising in their church services, youth groups, and social outreach groups. The church is a hugely influential and well respected presence in South Los Angeles, and together we will be able to reach a very large and diverse population. Each day, more partners ask to join our efforts at building a healthier South LA.
   
   BUSINESS COMMUNITY:
   MHS is a member of both the Crenshaw Chamber of Commerce and Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce. Both chambers support our efforts and recognize the value that healthy youth become healthy workers. Our relationship with Foshay Learning Center was fostered though the Pillar "Principal for a Day" program. We expect continued support in workforce and youth development from our Chamber partners who we will involved in this project.
