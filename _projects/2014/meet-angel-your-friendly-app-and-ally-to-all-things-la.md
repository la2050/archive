  LA has unfortunately been known as one of the "UNFRIENDLIEST" cities in the

   GEO-TARGETED
   Users will receive information that is target to them within a "x" mile radius thereby increasing local community engagement.

   FOR ALL RESIDENTS
   Local residents will be able to rally other local residents behind community causes. Once "x" residents share the same vision for their local community, we suggest an organizer that will facilitate making the vision a reality for all local residents.
   
   FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS
   Besides our web and mobile application, we can envision having outside kiosks in various places around LA that assist tourists and residents, who may not have access to internet or smart phones, to connect with local businesses and events. These kiosks can be located at malls, street-side and other venues.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  angel will benefit tourists, businesses, LA residents, governmental and
  political representatives seeking to be more involved in creating a friendlier
  LA as well as being more engaged in the community.
   
   TOURISTS
   Tourism in LA is really an insider job and who better to do that than an Angel. The app will give you an real-time view of everything happening in LA and can users can find what interests them. If they want they can even find a local "angel" (tour guide) that can show them around LA.
   
   Users can also video chat live with a local angels to help with translating signs in specific parts of LA (Chinatown, Koreatown, etc.)
   
   BUSINESSES
   Business will be notified when users are nearby and can choose to offer special discounts. Users that also "like" the business receive periodic discounts and rewards as determined by the business.
   
   NEW RESIDENTS
   New residents can easily connect with other users in their area. This will allow users to build friendships.
   
   ALL RESIDENTS
   Residents will have an opportunity to help create a friendly LA by connecting with other local Angelenos about issues that matter to them. When a designated number of residents share the same vision, Angel will help to select an Organizer among the residence. Then Angel will connect the organizer to partner organizations to implement the vision. (i.e. creating a local dog park, developing a neighborhood watch, having cleaning streets.
   
   GOVERNMENTAL REPRESENTATIVES
   Representatives will be able to use Angel to rally support behind agendas and initiatives. Angel will also serve as a digital signature when needed for polls and petitions for initiatives.
