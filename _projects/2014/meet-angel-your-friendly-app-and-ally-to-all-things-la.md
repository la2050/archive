  who_benefit: "angel will benefit tourists, businesses, LA residents, governmental and political representatives seeking to be more involved in creating a friendlier LA as well as being more engaged in the community.\r\n\r\nTOURISTS\r\nTourism in LA is really an insider job and who better to do that than an Angel. The app will give you an real-time view of everything happening in LA and can users can find what interests them. If they want they can even find a local \"angel\" (tour guide) that can show them around LA.\r\n\r\nUsers can also video chat live with a local angels to help with translating signs in specific parts of LA (Chinatown, Koreatown, etc.)\r\n\r\nBUSINESSES\r\nBusiness will be notified when users are nearby and can choose to offer special discounts. Users that also \"like\" the business receive periodic discounts and rewards as determined by the business.\r\n\r\nNEW RESIDENTS\r\nNew residents can easily connect with other users in their area. This will allow users to build friendships.\r\n\r\nALL RESIDENTS\r\nResidents will have an opportunity to help create a friendly LA by connecting with other local Angelenos about issues that matter to them. When a designated number of residents share the same vision, Angel will help to select an Organizer among the residence. Then Angel will connect the organizer to partner organizations to implement the vision. (i.e. creating a local dog park, developing a neighborhood watch, having cleaning streets.\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENTAL REPRESENTATIVES\r\nRepresentatives will be able to use Angel to rally support behind agendas and initiatives. Angel will also serve as a digital signature when needed for polls and petitions for initiatives."
  collaboration: "We will partner will local organizations to help bring awareness to our project. Suggested partnerships are DiscoverLosAngeles.com and newspapers such as the LATimes. These partnerships bring their customer base to the table which is an added benefit to our project.\r\n\r\nThe three factors that are critical to success are:\r\n(1) Partner engagement to clientele\r\n(2) Clientele interest through partner\r\n(3) Mutually beneficial results for both us and partner"
  evaluate: "We will measure success in the following ways:\r\n(1) Within six months we will have a working app\r\n(2) Within six months we will have a user base of at least 100,000\r\n(3) Within six months we will have a partner base of at least 10,000\r\n(4) We will have an advanced backend system that analyzes user satisfaction (tourists, businesses and residents). This will be in real time and users will be asked to provided solutions (not just feedback for what they don't like). As solutions are provided, changes are made. We will create a \"friendly\" rating index system that allows us to know what users are experiences at every level. The rating index will measure how happy people are with their service of the app, local guides, service at local businesses, community happiness and so on."
  two_lessons: "PERSONAL EXPERIENCE\r\nWhen we first moved to LA over six years ago, it was very difficult to know much about the city. At best, we would just walk around the neighborhood to see what was available. When we tried to find out more about the city from residents (where to live, eat, shop, etc.) it wasn't very helpful. At lot of the comments we received were, \"It depends on what you want to do/eat, etc.\" We want a way that allows new Angelenos to get a clearer picture of the city anytime they choose and anywhere they are.\r\n\r\nWe also landed in Koreatown which is great place rich in culture but can be difficult at times if you don't speak/read Korean. This is true in many other parts to LA. We want to help solve this challenge as well.\r\n\r\nAlso, understanding that LA can be a very difficult place to live \"financially\" as well as \"socially\", we would invite residents over to our place for Thanksgiving if they didn't have anywhere to go or they simply didn't have food themselves. This was always a great experience and it would have been great to actually connect to these residence easier and even have a virtual database \"friend list\" to connect with them later.\r\n\r\nAlso, we like to connect with people and trying to do this was very difficult in LA unless you lived in the community for a while. We were constantly finding out about groups, events and activities after it occurred. We want a way that Angelenos can be more connected to each other.\r\n\r\nPROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE\r\nBeing a business owner in Los Angeles is also a unique environment and we are constantly trying to reach new customers. It would be great to connect with customers on a tangible need level. If we \"knew\" customers/residents were looking specifically for our service this would save a lot of money on advertising and procuring a customer."

  major_challenges: "First Barrier: Funding\r\nFunding is obviously the first barrier and the $100,000 will ease most of that burden. With our professional background, we understand that many unplanned expenses arise with new venture. We are proactively thinking about as many of those \"unplanned\" expenses now and what we would do about it. To ensure continuity of the project, we will immediately begin raising money from other sources such as personal and private donations. We will begin a crowd-funding campaign as well. We will build a revenue platform that allows us to receive funds from sponsors, advertising partners, revenue sharing/referral fees and other premium services through the project.\r\n\r\nSecond Barrier: Exposure\r\nWe believe that every business has the challenge of exposure so we will immediately begin to garner support through social media and our network of connects. Among our group we are well connected to the business and entertainment world and will utilize this as a means of exposure. We also will begin a serious of PSA's (Public Service Announcement) videos highlighting the project and it's benefits to residences. We will also begin partnering with major travel companies "
