Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  1. PHE partners with high schools that lack skills-based health education and
  in which the majority of the students come from low-income households. These
  students experience a disproportionate number of serious health risks
  including unplanned pregnancy, substance abuse, and untreated mental illness.
  Volunteers teach the PHE curriculum in a required, non-academic class period
  so that PHE does not interfere with the students’ academic requirements.
   
   2. PHE recruits, selects, and rigorously trains college student volunteers to teach thirteen skills-based workshops on topics including Reflection, Accessing Resources, Decision-Making, and Communication & Advocacy. Our workshops build the skills of the teens we serve while engaging teens on issues related to sexual health, mental health, interpersonal violence, and substance use. PHE maintains a high level of selectivity through our rigorous volunteer recruitment process, securing a minimum of 150% applications to volunteer positions available. This standard allows us to ensure a high level of teaching quality across our cohort.
   
   3. PHE empowers teenagers to make healthy decisions. In the classroom, PHE high school students reflect on and contextualize influences that shape their health-related attitudes and actions; articulate their values and goals; learn basic, accurate health information; practice making and communicating healthy decisions through interactive role-plays; discuss barriers to healthy behaviors and strategies to overcome them; and identify and learn how to use the health resources in their communities.
   
   4. PHE fosters a commitment to public service in college students, many of whom go on to become leaders dedicated to addressing the needs of low-income, urban communities.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  PHE LA was founded to address a growing crisis: our teens are navigating
  difficult decisions and exhibiting risky behaviors on a daily basis, many of
  which threaten their bodies, well-being, and futures. According to data from
  the 2013 CDC Youth Risk Behavior Survey: 
   
   • 19% of LA teenagers are currently sexually active, and 37% of these teens did not use a condom the last time they had sex
   • 28% of LA teenagers currently drink alcohol 
   • 13% of LA teenagers have seriously considered attempting suicide
   
   These issues directly impact high school students' progress to graduation. 30% of young women who drop out of school cite pregnancy or parenthood as a key reason. Heavy alcohol use by age 16 is also strongly associated with high school dropout, particularly for young men. Finally, untreated mental illnesses affect teens’ ability to stay and excel in school. Studies of the associations between psychiatric disorders and high school dropout found a positive correlation between all disorders investigated and high school dropouts. A recent study of LAUSD middle and high school students
   found 40% of adolescents within the district display symptoms of trauma at a level requiring mental health services.
   
   In recent years, public schools’ increased focus on academic testing, budget cuts and staffing shortages have exacerbated this crisis by eliminating health courses, leaving teens unprepared to protect themselves against these serious health risks. 
   
   Peer Health Exchange directly addresses this crisis by using relatable and knowledgeable college students to give teens medically accurate, critical facts about their mental, physical and sexual health. Moreover, our volunteers engage teens in real-life role play scenarios and equip them with the skills to make decisions, communicate those choices and access health resources with confidence. 
   
   Investing in teen health today can impact the overall health of LA County by 2050 by directly decreasing teen pregnancy, STI rates, substance abuse rates, and rates of untreated mental illness, while indirectly increasing high school graduation rates. PHE teens can pass their health knowledge on to their families and friends, today and in the future. And by engaging LA college students in some of the most high-need and underserved schools and communities, we encourage volunteerism and civic participation for years to come. Many PHE teens also report they are inspired by PHE volunteers to engage in community service themselves.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  During the 2011-2012 program year, 92% of the PHE Los Angeles high school
  students qualified as low-income and received free or reduced lunch and 90%
  were Latino or Black. 
   
   Through our program, PHE high school students will gain:
   1. The knowledge and skills they need to make healthy decisions. Teenagers who make healthy decisions now and in the future will be more likely to stay and excel in school, join and remain part of the workforce, improving opportunities for a future life of quality.
   
   2. The knowledge and tools to access the health resources in their communities. In the Accessing Resources workshops, students identify valid services available from home, school, and in the community, learn how to locate these services, and prepare to access resources and services that are customized to their needs.
   
   3. Role Models. Over the course of thirteen workshops, undergraduate volunteers act as slightly older peers who can respectfully address students’ questions and concerns in a language and context that is relevant to their everyday lives while modeling healthy behavior and the successful transition from high school to college.
   
   We have 250 LA volunteers, 68 from CSUN, 90 from Occidental and 90 from USC.
   They will gain:
   1. Health knowledge and skills. Several studies demonstrate that peer health educators benefit from their training and teaching roles, particularly by gaining increased knowledge about the health topics they teach. In addition to increased knowledge, several studies show that peer health educators demonstrate an increased ability to communicate with friends, partners, and parents, and make positive changes in their own health behavior, attitudes and goal-setting. This growth in skills and knowledge enables PHE college students to make healthy decisions that will help them complete college, find and retain jobs, and become healthy, happy, and productive adults capable of having healthy families.
   
   2. Public speaking, teaching, and leadership skills. In PHE training sessions, PHE Health Educators learn how to manage a classroom of high school students and communicate effectively with them, learning skills that are useful in the job market. PHE student leaders also learn to manage a group of their peers. 
   
   3. A commitment to public service. Many PHE volunteers are inspired by their experience and go on to become teachers, doctors, public interest lawyers, and policymakers, who will continue to serve their communities throughout their lives.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: |-
  All of the following partnerships are confirmed for the 2014-15 school year:
   University of Southern CA
   Cal State Northridge
   Occidental College
   LA Alliance College-Ready Schools
   Partnerships to Uplift Communities (PUC) Schools
   Green Dot Schools
   New Village Girls Academy
   Environmental Charter HS
   
   We have worked with each of the above partners in past years, with great success. 
   
   On the college side, each campus has demonstrated a commitment to serving our communities and a student culture invested in volunteerism. Occidental students are especially committed to social justice, as per the mission of their school. CSUN students are especially relatable to our teens, as most come from the communities we serve in the San Fernando Valley (some are even alumni of our high school partners). USC students live in South LA, one of the communities with the greatest need for our program. 
   
   We must meet a recruitment goal of 150% more applications than we have space for in our cohort to maintain a high degree of volunteer selectivity. College volunteers must also commit to attending weekly trainings led by our staff, and must teach at least 7 times each by the end of the academic year.
   
   On the high school side, each of these schools and networks has demonstrated the willingness to provide time and space for our program during the school day, supported by host teachers who are invested in the program's success. PUC Schools and LA Alliance Schools, for the first time, are now sharing the costs of our program.
   
   Our program must have a 40-60 minute time slot during the school day, be able to reach the entire 9th grade in the school, and have a committed and supportive host teacher in the classroom at all times in order to achieve success.
