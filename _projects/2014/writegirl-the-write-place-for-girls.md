Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  For many years, WriteGirl has offered workshops and creative programming for
  girls at community centers, museums, parks and theaters all over greater Los
  Angeles. While girls have enjoyed learning songwriting at Disney Hall and
  poetry at the Autry Museum, we have seen that girls need the consistency of a
  calm and positive space that’s just for them.
   
   In the fall, WriteGirl will move its headquarters to a 2,100 square foot space in the new Goodwill Community Enrichment Center in Glassell Park, near downtown LA. This space will not only house the WriteGirl offices, but a large area will be built as a library and writing center for teen girls – a safe and exciting place where girls will want to connect and learn.
   
   The Write Place for Girls will be a comprehensive afterschool writing and college guidance program for teen girls, offering small group workshops, one-on-one mentoring, special guest speakers, innovative writing activities, film screenings, group discussions and quiet reading and writing time. All programming will be offered at no cost to participants. To implement this program we will conduct extensive outreach throughout Los Angeles, including students, parents/families and schools. WriteGirl will expand its volunteer base to provide ample mentors, as well as recruit and train additional staff members to manage programs and members, develop new curriculum and establish new community partnerships.
   
   This new Write Place for Girls will be a center for creativity, collaboration and community for LA teen girls. WriteGirl is about transformation. When girls are given the space, time and support to just be themselves and say what they feel, all the while surrounded by creative and dedicated mentors, they excel and their confidence soars. We know that this new space, and the exciting programming it will offer, will give girls a foundation for individual growth.
   
   This grant would support staffing and outreach needed to double the amount of programming hours WriteGirl offers. Girls in our Core Mentoring Program currently receive 10 hours of programming per month through group workshops and one-on-one mentoring. In contrast, the Write Place for Girls afterschool program will offer a minimum of 30 hours of group programming monthly, in addition to 90 hours of mentoring time. WriteGirl leverages the skills of hundreds of women writers to inspire teen writers, training them to lead workshops and mentor girls individually and in small groups.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  WriteGirl is an esteemed educational model for organizations across the
  country. In 2013, WriteGirl received the National Arts and Humanities Youth
  Program Award, the highest national honor awarded to exemplary afterschool and
  out-of-school time programs from across the country. In 2014, WriteGirl
  Executive Director Keren Taylor was named a CNN Hero. In expanding WriteGirl’s
  presence through this new Write Place for Girls, WriteGirl will be a more
  visible inspiration for other nonprofits and educational institutions
  throughout Los Angeles, helping to make 2050 a time when all youth have
  inspiring places and mentors to guide them to their full potential. 
   
   For 13 years, WriteGirl has been an important gathering place – a sort of town square for girls to connect with other girls, meet accomplished women and be inspired; a place to stand up for their ideas and ideals and most importantly, to celebrate their own unique voices and identities. Research supports that girls, who may be overly self-critical in the presence of teen boys and men, learn best from other girls and women. Girls learning in single-sex environments are more self-confident, have heightened career aspirations, develop broader interests, are more willing to accept challenges, engage in more leadership opportunities and embrace achievement in academics, the arts and sports.
   
   The Write Place for Girls is designed to meet the unique needs of teen girls, expanding on what WriteGirl has been building and refining for over a decade. We always keep it fun, fresh and creative, but at its core, WriteGirl is a rare and vital pathway for girls to find their way forward, to grow confident and clear in who they are, what they believe and how their ideas and choices matter, in their families, communities and in the world. The center will offer a lending library of books on writing as well as college entrance handbooks, special guest speakers, computer and internet access, specialized workshops in everything from resume-writing to novel writing clinics and field trips to LA landmarks. 
   
   Teen participants will be published in WriteGirl’s award-winning anthologies and on the WriteGirl blog. WriteGirl teens are increasingly published in many prominent outlets and featured as guest performers throughout the greater Los Angeles region, from events sponsored by Mayor Eric Garcetti to public readings at Skylight Books, the Los Angeles Public Library and onstage at the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Building this center for girls in Northeast Los Angeles is a deliberate
  choice, recognizing the urgent need for creative programming for diverse youth
  in the area. Glassell Park, Atwater Village, Eagle Rock, Montecito Heights,
  Highland Park and Cypress Park have very few community centers to serve this
  low-income, high-density region of LA. Less than a dozen community centers
  serve the 243,000 residents in this area, and only several offer academic and
  creative programs for teens.
   
   The large schools in the region are unable to serve the individual needs of teen girls, such as offering specific college application and financial aid assistance, help with family or emotional challenges or even academic and literacy skill development. Guidance counselors, charged with facilitating the college application process, often are assigned hundreds of students, prohibiting access to higher education. 
   
   Many of the girls in our program are facing some of the most intense challenges a teen girl can face, such as pregnancy, incarceration, unstable home environments, clinical depression, suicide attempts and homelessness. WriteGirl provides a sanctuary and positive atmosphere that builds skills and confidence, sending girls into the world with the tools to succeed. WriteGirl fosters a powerful intercultural exchange among ethnically and economically diverse participants, allowing unique cross-generational relationships to develop between girls and women who would otherwise never meet. 
   
   Continuing WriteGirl’s longstanding policy of inclusion, all teen girls in Los Angeles County will be welcome to participate at workshops and events. The Write Place for Girls program will make a focused effort to enroll girls specifically from Northeast Los Angeles communities in a roughly five-mile radius of the Goodwill Enrichment Center. WriteGirl will have a greater opportunity to connect with parents and the surrounding community as this unique space offers many family-friendly amenities, including ample parking and a cafe, that will make parents feel welcome to wait while their girls participate in program activities.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  WriteGirl has developed relationships with dozens of partners, including the
  Goodwill Enrichment Center, the Los Angeles Times, Fox Studios, Writers Guild
  of America, and others that provide wide-ranging resources from venues to
  volunteers to financial support. We have worked with most of our partners for
  many years, and they have increased their support as we have grown. Our newest
  partner, the Goodwill Community Enrichment Center, represents much more than a
  new space, but a powerful collaboration for hundreds of youth and their
  families.
   
   Goodwill is offering far-reaching support, including daily security, affordable onsite catering, meeting spaces, staff support and ample free parking for 400 vehicles. We haven’t even moved in yet and we are already collaborating with Goodwill by leading writing workshops at Goodwill sponsored youth events and bringing several WriteGirl events to the facility.
   
   We have dreamed about creating a center for girls, and this Write Place for Girls center will allow us to fulfill that vision. The move will be more than just a physical one. It signifies an important next step in our organization’s development and exemplifies the kind of partnerships we hope to cultivate in the future. This move symbolizes what we’ve strived so hard to achieve and it illustrates the trajectory of our growth.
   
   Three factors that are critical to success in all our partnerships: 1) Financial health in order to remain stable and support each other. 2) Similar values – for example, positivity and respect are key components in building community and successful programs. 3) Making decisions with an eye to the future, and having a shared vision for the health of Los Angeles. After all, 2050 is not that far away!
