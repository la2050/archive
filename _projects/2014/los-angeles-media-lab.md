Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  We have already began to implement the foundation of our plan through building
  a mobile studio, hosting live television tapings, teaching A/V workshops, and
  collaborating with local artists. We are adept with both the professional
  equipment and support skills needed to create a public forum accessible to
  children, artists, and people from the local community interested in working
  with media and video. 
   
   We will select a centrally-located space in Los Angeles to serve as a broadcast center. Our vision is to build two TV studios: one housing a traditional three-camera setup, which allows more complex tapings and visual effects. The other will be a smaller studio serving more intimate video tapings. Several adjacent multi-use rooms will serve as classrooms for youth education and training for emerging and established professionals, with public workshops, and in-house artist studios and residencies. Through the media lab’s outreach and workshops, community members will be trained in how to operate equipment and develop the audiovisual storytelling techniques necessary to realize their vision.
   
   Geographic selection of the space will focus on the eastside of Los Angeles, a region underserved with local resources, rich with cost-effective space, and located at a demographic cross-section. Within our rental budget we can procure a space both proportionate to meet the needs of our facility and centrally accessible to the diverse communities we will serve.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  By creating a publicly-available media lab we will enrich the community
  through active participation in events, tapings, and broadcasting. The lab
  will serve as a hub for Los Angeles audio and video culture both through
  providing the end-product, and through serving as a central meeting point
  placing exhibition space and artistic disciplines in context with a larger
  community.
   
   It will reconnect the community to lacking resources by providing a facility specialized to meet a number of activities. Hosting residencies for guest artists will further aid in diversifying our growing creative community - allowing interaction with and exposure to working artists in Los Angeles as well as international artists working in alternative media. Giving the local community exposure to artists and resources has a myriad of beneficial social, cultural and economic effects. The center we propose to establish will enable local community members and children to gain valuable skills and resources to prepare them for a lifetime of creative work in digital media. Additionally, our media lab would allow skilled artists to employ their professional training for use on a community level.
   
   There is a lack of access to public media resources to an ever technological oriented culture that we hope to account for through our center. Our media labs will fill a broad variety of needs: as a way for people to inform each other and express their specific voices about their local community needs; as a way for people to engage with their own community on a grassroots level; as a way to give marginalized voices in the community a sense of agency; and as a way for the community to produce work using professional media equipment that is otherwise out of range. Our center will help to produce videos that community members want to share with the rest of LA.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Through the establishment of a media lab we will take what our city is
  notorious for— media production— and decentralize it into an everyday act
  artists from across Los Angeles can participate in. By moving media production
  away from only being in the realm of large corporations and into the hands of
  the artistic and local community we will establish LA as a vanguard for
  multimedia art production and groundbreaking exhibitions.
   
   Our center will positively reach a range of people. It will benefit local artists through allowing access to video technology that is otherwise limited to institutions or commercial ventures. It will provide a space for them to experiment with new ideas and work. It will benefit community members curious to further their knowledge of video and digitized forms - those interested to produce their own media, whether it’s a vlog, television show or video installation. It will positively impact the local youth because it will offer an inspiring, exciting, and professional environment where one can be exposed to the infinite possibilities that video technologies and multimedia artists have to offer.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: |-
  Pasadena Arts Council
   Artists
   Ghosting.TV
   KXLU
   Dublab
   KCHUNG TV
   GYST Radio
   
   We have worked with each of the partners listed above and each brings a unique element to the project through their individual strengths. The Pasadena Arts Council will serve as the fiscal sponsor for this project and is the current fiscal sponsor for Experimental Half-Hour. Ghosting.TV is LA’s premier monthly artist hang-out and screening series of cutting edge video art and animation. Through the use of our media lab’s space they will be able to expand their reach to a growing audience and continue to host visiting artists to present their work. Through our collaborations with DJs at LA based FM radio station KXLU, we look forward to having a more consolidated space to host events and remote broadcasts. Dublab is a non-profit web radio collective that has been broadcasting independently since 1999. They curate shows and host video screenings - sharing a vision very much aligned to ours. A broader space for us would facilitate more productions for our collaboration[s] and would benefit not only the scope of their programming, but the local television and media platforms in LA. For the UCLA Hammer Museum’s 2014 Made in L.A. biennial exhibition, KChung Radio launched its subsidiary television network KChung TV and hired Experimental Half-Hour as video technical producers to help realize their project. We loaned them our mobile studio system and trained KChung volunteers to use the equipment so they could produce their own series of variety shows. GYST Ink is an artist-run company providing information, technology and solutions created by artists for artists. GYST would be able to use the video technologies to broaden their journalistic coverage of the arts community.
