Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  In order to implement this initiative, we will work with our existing partners
  who have been serving at-risk youth, so we can effectively and efficiently
  impact increasing numbers of our targeted population. Through collaborating
  with local social service agencies and community groups, HH brings instructors
  to share industry expertise and creativity with hundreds of at-risk youth each
  year who might not otherwise receive this unique training.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Our initiative will benefit at-risk youth within the Greater Los Angeles area
  as well as local artists. The LA has HEART project also seeks to benefit the
  LA community as a whole by creating arts programs that will deter at-risk
  youth from engaging in street crime and activities as well as giving LA the
  chance to educate itself in the importance of arts education and empowerment.
   
   The LA has HEART initiative directly takes advantage of the unique opportunities that only LA can offerâ€”great artistic partners and young artists. In collaborating with them, we can, through each workshop, work towards eradicating street crime and increasing interest of the arts among at-risk youth.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Our target audience is teens and young adults, ages 13-21, who face a number
  of serious issues such as poverty, unstable family environments, drugs and
  alcohol, medical illness, and/or absence from school. 
   
   The initiative will also benefit artists who seek to create a network for themselves or find opportunities to share their talents.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  LA is fortunate to have many organizations that offer arts instruction to
  at-risk youth. HH has strong relationships with two of these, CoachArt and The
  Mobile Film Classroom, with which we have completed over 10 programs and four
  workshops, respectively. In addition, HH has facilitated two filmmaking
  workshops with the IBD Support Foundation and partnered with the San Fernando
  Valley Partnership, Hillsides Education Center, Gabrielino, and Los Angeles
  High School as well. 
   
   Recently HH established new collaborations with The Salvation Army Algeria and the Laurel Foundation, and is in talks to offer programming with the Boys and Girl Club of the West Valley. 
   Our ability to establish sustainable partnerships is illustrated in our 19-year partnership with One Heartland for our summer arts camp. HH is dedicated to strengthening relationships with all our existing partners and continually seeks to collaborate with other like-minded organizations in for future programs.
