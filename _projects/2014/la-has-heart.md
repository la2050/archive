  more_detail: "LA has HEART is a program that is composed of workshops including everything from creative writing, music, acting, culinary arts, fashion, documentary filmmaking, and fashion. The goal is to provide instruction and hands-on training in small groups – one workshop at a time. This format allows participants the opportunity to absorb, practice, and sharpen their skills under the guidance of working arts professionals. Participants are not only given opportunities to express themselves, but they are also educated on how they can turn their talents into possible careers. \r\n"
  implement: >-
    In order to implement this initiative, we will work with our existing
    partners who have been serving at-risk youth, so we can effectively and
    efficiently impact increasing numbers of our targeted population. Through
    collaborating with local social service agencies and community groups, HH
    brings instructors to share industry expertise and creativity with hundreds
    of at-risk youth each year who might not otherwise receive this unique
    training. 
  impact_create: "Our initiative will benefit at-risk youth within the Greater Los Angeles area as well as local artists. The LA has HEART project also seeks to benefit the LA community as a whole by creating arts programs that will deter at-risk youth from engaging in street crime and activities as well as giving LA the chance to educate itself in the importance of arts education and empowerment.\r\n\r\nThe LA has HEART initiative directly takes advantage of the unique opportunities that only LA can offer—great artistic partners and young artists. In collaborating with them, we can, through each workshop, work towards eradicating street crime and increasing interest of the arts among at-risk youth. \r\n"
  who_benefit: "Our target audience is teens and young adults, ages 13-21, who face a number of serious issues such as poverty, unstable family environments, drugs and alcohol, medical illness, and/or absence from school. \r\n\r\nThe initiative will also benefit artists who seek to create a network for themselves or find opportunities to share their talents. \r\n"
  partners_collaboration: "LA is fortunate to have many organizations that offer arts instruction to at-risk youth. HH has strong relationships with two of these, CoachArt and The Mobile Film Classroom, with which we have completed over 10 programs and four workshops, respectively. In addition, HH has facilitated two filmmaking workshops with the IBD Support Foundation and partnered with the San Fernando Valley Partnership, Hillsides Education Center, Gabrielino, and Los Angeles High School as well. \r\n\r\nRecently HH established new collaborations with The Salvation Army Algeria and the Laurel Foundation, and is in talks to offer programming with the Boys and Girl Club of the West Valley. \r\nOur ability to establish sustainable partnerships is illustrated in our 19-year partnership with One Heartland for our summer arts camp. HH is dedicated to strengthening relationships with all our existing partners and continually seeks to collaborate with other like-minded organizations in for future programs.\r\n"

  evaluate: "-We will track the growth in the number of participants and artists involved every month within each artistic field to track the program’s popularity and success\r\n\r\n-We design and develop surveys for students, staff, and partner organizations. The first survey will be conducted when the workshop begins and the second will be conducted culminating the event. These surveys will measure how satisfied participants, staff, and volunteers are with this unique art skills immersion experience. These surveys will also show that the students absorbed, practiced, and sharpened their art skills during their experience as they measure the students’ agreement with questions that incorporate self-evaluative concepts like confidence and comfortability. \r\n"

    While there are other organizations doing similar work, LA has HEART is
    unique from what already exists in that it strives to be beneficial to both
    parties involved in the workshop program. Not only will the youth benefit
    from arts education, but these workshops also act as a means of practicing
    and perfecting the aspiring artist’s talents. Through our existing network
    of contacts, Hollywood HEART as an organization may also help leverage the
    artist’s talents and connect them with various organizations and
    individuals.

  impact_metrics: >-
    In a recent article, "How to Save our Schools" regarding the importance of
    funding arts and music in public schools, a statistic that reinforces the
    importance of the Hollywood Heart mission is cited: "[according] to the US
    Department of Education, almost 6 million elementary
    students--overwhelmingly in our highest poverty schools--have no art or
    music classes". The youth we target for services are graduates of the
    elementary education which the article critiques. We will address this lack
    of arts education by providing educational workshop for at-risk youth in the
    LA area.
