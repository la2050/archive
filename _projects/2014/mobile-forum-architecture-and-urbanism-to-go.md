  more_detail: "Los Angeles is the world’s preeminent residential laboratory. As its multicultural population booms and neighborhoods densify, the LA Forum seeks to involve the city in the issues of access, affordability, and design quality.\r\n\r\n\"Mobile Forum\" is a design think-tank on wheels. Part Case Study House Program, part food truck − it is an experiment in home and transportation combined. Its goal is to address a changing society through housing design and to test new building technologies in the field. It drives conversation and exhibition to and through audiences outside the more conventional architecture venues, engaging diverse publics in explorations into the ideals of living and the role of good design."
  implement: "\"Mobile Forum\" is a typical box truck turned migratory research hub and exhibition instigator. A demonstration of advanced ideas about home and housing, the vehicle gives a public presence to residential design discourse, one with the freedom to roam, solicit, and activate the region’s communal and creative capital. \"Mobile Forum\" instigates discussion by taking design questions and proposals on the road, encouraging people to talk to one another about the future conditions of living. It issues an open invitation to participate in the identification of neighborhood-by-neighborhood design cases and it provides the opportunity to bring the inventories to those with the means to influence change − and vice versa.\r\n\r\n\"Mobile Forum\" is a combination gallery space, lecture hall, and activity center that packs up and ships out. It employs the ecological and physical footprint of the truck in cues to reconsider the desirability of the proximate, the small, and the shared. It provides the LA Forum with a flexible, opportunistic, and responsive platform for the staging of events. Loaded with an assortment of audio-visual, display, and workshop devices and equipment, the project caters to disparate deployments and facilitates interactions with groups and sites typically beyond the reach of fixed-location programming.\r\n\r\n\"Mobile Forum\" sets out through the initiation of a series of community workshops. After locales are selected from an open call to neighborhood groups, the truck establishes temporary outposts for designers, locals, officials, and organizations to take stock of existing conditions and to speculate about the future of LA housing. Participants act as ad hoc interdisciplinary design teams, producing examples of how domestic spaces might shape the city of 2050.\r\n\r\nThe collected designs and visions created in these on-the-ground efforts form the content for the next iteration of \"Mobile Forum\" − a traveling gallery and advocacy vessel. The truck, retrofitted with displays of the accumulated new ideas for living, returns to the communities as a visual and spatial provocation to action.\r\n\r\nAll \"Mobile Forum\" work will be published − as it occurs through online and social media, and in its entirety as a building manual. The documents will be used to incite local developers, governments, and sponsors to break ground on the suggestions."
  impact_live: "What’s the future of housing in LA? Livability, mobility, affordability. The LA Forum for Architecture and Urbanism believes that design is a tool that supports sustainable and healthy lives. Through design’s lens, learning, living, playing, and creating are actualized as physical environments. \"Mobile Forum\" extends the agency for the imagination of how all of these elements connect across the constituents, experts, and leaders for whom LA is home.\r\n\r\nTypically, the question of what constitutes the spaces in which we live is the decision of developers responding to economics and government codes. If designers are involved, it likely is at the service of those pre-determined terms. And, residents simply chose from amongst the outcomes. “Mobile Forum” reverses and mixes up this practice, asking how we might understand needs in order to impact building regulations and developer decisions. It puts designers in a bridge position, enabling them to draw out how good living and good spaces come together. It does all of this by unifying all of these unique voices, by providing a platform for dialogue between communities, residents, builders, policymakers, artists, and creatives to take shape as actionable visions.\r\n\r\nBy focusing on housing, \"Mobile Forum\" taps into LA’s dominant source material − domestic space. Urban transformation begins with home and prepares the way for a thriving 2050.  It literally gives shape to the conditions that will make LA the best place to live today and tomorrow. It shows how to maintain quality while fixing costs per square foot. It enables urban resilience by making sustainability inseparable from building practices − by revealing desirability and efficiency in reduced housing footprints, by demonstrating seamless integrations of living, working, playing, and moving, and by encouraging a valuation of these conditions. It models interdependent environments where the lines between open space, community space, and private space blur, where all of the amenities and relationships crucial to a healthy and fulfilled existence are proximate. It suggests that empowerment depends on literally building interaction into the expectations for the everyday surrounds. It holds the American dream up for review and encourages the development of an alternative ideal around which to construct the future."
  who_benefit: "“Mobile Forum” targets residents living around new and proposed transit routes that are seeing or will see significant redevelopment growth and changing property valuation. These areas are subject to rapid reconstruction, displacing existing populations through eminent domain or rent inflation. The LA Forum project seeks to provide a sounding board for those involved in and impacted by the urban transformation. It aspires to produce concrete examples for building that innovates design inclusive of both established communities and of densification efforts.\r\n\r\nThe LA Forum will identify ten communities along new or pending light rail corridors. “Mobile Forum” will interact with these communities in a series of information gathering and idea generating engagements that pool human resources in the planning of how to adapt. It takes advantage of the infrastructures of streets and lots to set-up a vast array of unexpected public venues. Wherever the truck parks, an event unfolds, revealing glimpses of locational potential and catalyzing the forces to realize them. Lessons learned at each stop travel from point to point, distributing insights from one community to another. The city and its citizens are encouraged to observe and shape each other in hands-on exploration.\r\n\r\nThe interactive and cumulative nature of “Mobile Forum” benefits the direct participants − who learn the mechanisms for influencing the development taking place around them − and their communities − by mobilizing the agents required to alter the expectations for and outcomes of comprehensive neighborhood restructuring. It also has the potential to act as a global conversation starter, to model for the world best practices for light-touch living and to reinstate LA as the residential laboratory to envy and emulate.\r\n\r\nPeripherally, “Mobile Forum” reminds LA about the profound role of the design and construction industry, a significant part of the creative capital for which the city is known. It reinvigorates the energy and economy around literal world shaping, helping to maintain the diversity of the region’s productions and of the people drawn to be a part of the excitement of creating and making."
  partners_collaboration: "The LA Forum expects three types of collaborator-partners for “Mobile Forum” − community groups, governing bodies, and development organizations. If awarded the LA2050 support, “Mobile Forum” will consist of a team of designers and urbanists − from the LA Forum − between eight and ten community groups and/or governing bodies and two development organizations. This perfect storm of agents for the built environment will pool resources to cultivate the intellectual and material content of a proposal for a new approach to living.\r\n\r\nAs an example, the LA Forum has a confirmed collaboration with the City of Glendale and intended collaborations with the be.group and with Enterprise Community Partners (or similar). In this hypothetical relationship, “Mobile Forum” would work on-site in Glendale in its proactively anticipated light rail corridor. The City of Glendale would share the resources of its planning and policy offices and would provide guidance and structure to the event staging and to institutionalizing outcomes. The be.group, a local advocate of Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities and Aging in Place Initiatives, would host the workshops through the perspective and in consideration of the needs of their constituents. Enterprise Community Partners would provide the development and economic expertise and connection to fiscal enablers. And, the LA Forum would establish the framework and act as the intermediary and translator (from conversations to building proposals) for a cooperative research and design effort.\r\n\r\n“Mobile Forum” would organize similar, but circumstantially unique arrangements across the city − amassing a variety of both tailored and universal approaches to responsive development by design. Other collaborator-partners to which the LA Forum has reached out and/or with which the LA Forum has the potential of working include the City of West Hollywood, Skid Row Housing Trust, El Proyecto del Barrio, and the Housing Rights Group, to name a few. The LA Forum’s board members, all well established design and urbanism professionals, have respected histories working with an extended network of organizations appropriate to fill the collaborator-partner positions and will activate that network in order to secure involvement in “Mobile Forum.”\r\n\r\nThe three factors critical to a successful “Mobile Forum” collaboration-partnership are: (1) a distributed and representative audience, (2) connection to decision-makers, and (3) promotion."

  evaluate: "We will measure the success of \"Mobile Forum\" based on the expansion of our organization’s audience, the connections we can make between a diverse body of community groups and decision-makers, and the lasting impact of the project.\r\n\r\nWe will survey attendees at our \"Mobile Forum\" events to understand: their prior relationship to the LA Forum, if any; the frequency of their attendance at cultural events; the likelihood that they will continue to follow our \"Mobile Forum\" project.\r\n\r\nThe diversity of participants in our workshops will contribute significantly to the success of the project. We will measure the breadth of connections we make through geographic diversity; representation of age, gender, and race; and the balance of participation between designers, developers, government officials, and locals.\r\n\r\nThe lasting impact of the project will depend on the influence we can have on the planning, design, and construction of future housing. Changes in governmental policies or planning processes, investments in material or technological research, and continued activism by participants and community groups are all indicators of success for our project. The opportunity to design and build one of the proposals from our workshops is our own dream metric of success for \"Mobile Forum.\""
  two_lessons: "Housing is a recurring topic within the LA Forum’s programming − for events ranging from building tours, to competitions, to panel discussions. In the summer of 2013, we hosted two simultaneous exhibitions on the subject: How Small is Too Small? and By-Right/By-Design. An installation of a 300 square foot micro-housing unit, How Small is Too Small? invited visitors to experience the spatial ramifications of a comfortable and compact housing arrangement. By-Right/By-Design was a side-by-side fiscal and material comparison of real estate development models and innovative design-driven projects.\r\n \r\nThese shows and the feedback that they generated provide a couple of lessons that inform “Mobile Forum.” One, the immersive experience of physical space profoundly influences discussion quality, liberating diverse inhabitants to interact and engage in dialogue animated unlike in any other format. Two, the potentials for design to instigate changes in how we build and live − by challenging accepted models of development − are underappreciated and underutilized.\r\n \r\n“Mobile Forum” transforms information and suggestions acquired within the relatively controlled gallery environment and applies it to the messy reality of public spaces. It offers a test of design discipline knowledge by exposing − and bolstering − it to and for an expanded audience."
  achievable_goal: "The timeline provided below illustrates the achievability of the “Mobile Forum” goals within the next twelve months.\r\n \r\n“Mobile Forum” Timeline\r\n \r\nSeptember 2014:\r\n- secure collaborator-partners\r\n- plan community residencies / workshops\r\n- buy “Mobile Forum” truck and implement initial outfitting\r\n- launch communications campaign\r\n \r\nOctober 2014-July 2015:\r\n- hold citywide community residencies / workshops\r\n- one community per month / one daylong event per month\r\n- develop designs and publications from community workshops concurrently\r\n \r\nAugust 2015:\r\n- run citywide housing exhibition returning outcomes to original ten sites\r\n- release “Mobile Forum” publication\r\n"
  major_challenges: "One challenge will be the synthesis of potentially wildly-divergent ideas about the future of housing into a cohesive set of proposals or tenets. We want to open up the discussion about housing to new and unexpected possibilities, but we also want to translate the richness of such conversations into a directable action. We’ll use design as the medium for focusing our efforts. This means designing workshop materials that encourage collaboration and participation; designing mechanisms for recording conversations in a visual manner that can be distributed back out to the public; and most importantly using design as the lens through which questions and proposals are posited and answered.\r\n\r\nThe logistics of staging a series of itinerant events across the LA basin over the course of a year is also a significant challenge. As a peripatetic organization, we’ve grown accustomed to planning and hosting events at sites around the city. For “Mobile Forum,” we’ll rely on our collaborators and partners to introduce us to their neighborhoods, help us find a spot for our events, and identify local leadership and experts to participate in our workshops. We’ll make use of our collaborators’ networks to promote the “Mobile Forum” events and ideally draw an engaged audience.\r\n\r\nWe’ll also need a good mechanic, someone reliable and not too expensive. :)"
  competition: "LA has a rich history of housing experimentation and housing activists. The Case Study House Program established a precedent for innovative and affordable housing, defining ideas about living in LA that persist today. More recently, community-oriented organizations have used innovation and affordability as cornerstones for improving housing for all residents of Los Angeles. These groups include Skid Row Housing Trust, West Hollywood Community Development, Restore Neighborhoods LA, Community of Friends, Santa Monica Community Corporation, SCANPH, LA County Resource Center, and Building Healthy Communities.\r\n\r\nTwo things make “Mobile Forum” unique in this line-up. One, we are not a professional organization, funding source, nor developer; we are design advocates with the ability to bring those groups together with residents and community leaders for a series of critical conversations. We’re agnostic; or, rather, our bias is good design, which means serving all interests together. We are positioned to provide a critical eye for understanding all of the moving pieces and a projective outlook for productively (re)assembling them. “Mobile Forum” utilizes the LA Forum’s distinct outlook to contribute to the legacy of housing innovation. It aims to involve the citizenry of LA to generate models for living by acting as curators, selecting the best work on housing being done now, getting the creators of that work into the same place, and facilitating speculation.\r\n\r\nAnd, two, we’re mobile. Of course, mobile architecture also is a trend with a history... Examples cover the globe and go back in time, from the further afield WorldWide Storefront “Circus for Construction,” Productora’s “A47 Mobile Library,” Raumlabor’s “Space Buster,” and Archigram’s “Instant City” to the more local “On the Road,” “Coolhaus Ice Cream Truck,” and “Barrio Mobile Art Studio.” But, few of these examples employ the mobility to its potential, in partnership, connecting activities and agendas through their travels. “Mobile Forum” understands mobility as a facilitator of unlikely and revolutionary relationships, as a prompt for inspiring the alignment of ideas and resources necessary to impact change."
  cost: "The primary costs for the first year of the “Mobile Forum” will fit within the $100,000 budget designated by LA2050. The LA Forum will cover any overages with its in-house funding or will seek additional awards or donations as necessary.\r\n\r\nRefer to the itemized budget provided in the next prompt for a comprehensive assessment of expenses."

  impact_metrics: "\"Mobile Forum\" will impact a number of the Live metrics immediately: \r\n\r\nLivability\r\nA rich urban housing ecology is Sustainable, Healthy, Dense, and Safe. By addressing these issue through the design of residential units in LA we can directly discuss the following issues that impact domestic and urban life: access to healthy food, walkable neighborhoods, mixed used services that offer healthcare and community support. Good housing design increases quality of life at all levels, providing maximum light, air, and green open space.\r\n\r\nLA is a residential city. Decisions about housing − how we build it, how we organize it − inevitably impact how we use our city, how we connect to one another in Los Angeles. The outcome of the discussions and workshops of \"Mobile Forum\", which we plan to publish and distribute to community groups, developers, and government officials, have the potential to influence and positively change housing and therefore the urban patterns of LA. \r\n\r\nMobility\r\nBy focusing on transit corridors along the Metro Line, we can address the relationship between home and work. The creation of more affordable and desirable housing near transit, impacts the median travel time to work, number of public transit riders, and transit-accessible housing and employment. \r\n\r\nThe ability to bring the LA Forum’s activities to locations throughout LA in collaboration with community groups will increase attendance at cultural events. The pop-up nature of the events will similarly increase attendance at public/open street gatherings; locating these pop-ups near transit will likely increase the number of public transit riders. The promotion of the events and the connections made between participants will increase the total number of social media friends of all involved.\r\n\r\nAffordability\r\nWe are seeing housing experiments in other cities that are working to reduce inequity and support diversity. These include elements such as microunits, co-housing, and shared services and outdoor spaces. Housing that supports a multi-income community increases the quality of life for all residents by redefining affordability. By facilitating human relationships, by bringing resources to residents, and by integrating the functions of living, well-designed housing provides more for less."
Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  To implement this project, we will install 75 more gardens in LA in the next
  twelve months.
   
   By augmenting our existing 38 Learning Gardens with an additional 75 gardens, we will have over 100 gardens installed in Los Angeles. This presence will enable us to enter into larger conversations with district decision-makers and funders about policy changes that can fundamentally change the role that schools play in promoting healthful learning and play for young Angelenos now and for years to come.
   
   We work with community members, landscape architects, researchers, designers, policy makers, teachers, parents, and kids to revolutionize the concept of a school garden entirely. Our Learning Gardens are a lightweight, durable, modular, and interactive, designed as both an outdoor classroom and living play place, that is also easily customized to fit a wide variety of school needs. Our beds can be placed on asphalt, on rooftops, in school entrances, and even safely on top of toxic soil, and are also ADA-compliant handicap accessible. 
   
   To build these gardens, we will raise funds through a network of like-minded foundations, donors, businesses, and organizations. With proper funding, we will be able to increase garden construction and build our team capacity in LA. We will continue working with local partners in the construction of our gardens and in the sourcing of our materials such as soil, seeds, and irrigation parts, and will also be incorporating data from our evaluations to make continual improvements upon our gardens and our services.
   
   LA is the second largest school district in the country. If we can build a successful garden model here, not only can we make LA the healthiest city in America, we can also make LA a model city for others to look to when seeking to significantly impact the health and future of our nation’s children and families.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Obesity is one of the biggest health concerns facing LA today, especially
  children. Recent research published in the Journal of the American Medical
  Association shows that nearly one in every three children in America today are
  obese or overweight, putting them at significant risk of developing serious
  health problems and positioning our nation for a future of crippling debt and
  disease. According to the Mayo Clinic, unhealthy lifestyles marked by poor
  food choices and inactivity are the leading cause of obesity in children.
  Latino youths suffer disproportionately from obesity, and LA alone contains
  4.9 million Hispanics (9% of the nation’s entire Hispanic population).
   
   Armed with this knowledge, we believe that there is no better way to promote a healthy lifestyle for our youth than by ensuring that all young Angelenos have access to a high-quality school garden, designed with their needs in mind. By teaching kids about how food grows in a setting that is playful, accessible, and safe, we help set them up for healthy success now and in the future. 
   
   Learning Gardens connect kids to real food, helping them learn to prize snap peas over sodas, carrots over candy, and peppers over poptarts. In a Learning Garden pilot study, we found that students increased their awareness of nutrition goals by 13.7%, and increased their preference for vegetables found in the garden by 12%. Learning Gardens provide exposure to a world of healthy food choices before unthinkable to many students, and help them to take necessary first steps towards living active and healthy lives.
   
   The health benefits of school gardening are not just physical. Over 60 years of research demonstrates the benefits of school gardens on children’s mental health as well, helping kids deal more effectively with stress and resist violent activity. In our own pilot study, we found a statistically significant reduction in competitive play around Learning Gardens and a complete absence of violent activity around the Learning Gardens (despite violence occurring in other areas of the playground).
   
   And most importantly, by working strategically to bring Learning Gardens to scale, we make sure that these opportunities will be made available to all children and families in LA, not just a select few. 
   
   In 2050, there will be thousands of Learning Gardens in communities across LA, fostering new generations of healthy thinkers who know how to grow, harvest, and share nutritious food.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Our Learning Gardens help foster a more positive and healthy educational
  environment for students. Over 75% of our students qualify for Free and
  Reduced Lunch and over 75% of students are either Black or Latino/Hispanic.
  Our research shows that students with Learning Gardens value and enjoy them,
  with 95% of students reporting that they want a Learning Garden at their
  school and with 40% of those students visiting the Learning Garden daily. 
   
   Our Learning Gardens are designed so that the children who use them feel a sense of ownership. With curvilinear raised beds that can be painted or mosaiced, and interlocking pieces that can include benches, lights, shade sails, sundials, and more, teachers can let children freely explore the garden without fear of trampling plants, and kids can interact with soil, seeds, and plants at eye-level. 
   
   Learning Gardens are also attractive and practical outdoor classrooms for teachers, complete with seating, shading, and a comprehensive workshop series with materials that help teachers integrate lessons on nutrition, health, science, math, technology, art, and a host of other subjects into their curriculum. 
   
   With the addition of another 75 gardens in LA, we will be able to expand our offerings to comprise more comprehensive teacher workshops that will help our teachers better integrate the Learning Garden into their lesson plans. Having a wider variety of schools and teachers attending these workshops also helps foster more collaboration and sharing of ideas between schools.
   
   By working within the school district to install gardens at scale, we will be able to unlock the potential to have our workshops and trainings count toward teacher’s Professional Development credits, helping teachers fit our workshops into their existing schedules.
   
   Our project will also benefit families. Not only do families have the opportunity to get involved in the garden itself through build and harvest days and volunteer programs, they also benefit from the addition of the Learning Gardens to existing school, after school, and summer programs. In our pilot study, we found that 96% of parents surveyed wanted a Learning Garden at their school.
   
   Designed by certified landscape architects, Learning Gardens also serve to beautify communities, and are as attractive as they are practical.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Three factors that have been critical to our past success and will be crucial
  in our project going forward have been found in partnerships that:
   
   1. Take advantage of existing school infrastructure.
   
   We have a deep relationship with Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) via their Sustainable Environment Enhancement Developments for Schools (SEEDS) program. SEEDS is a $4 million bond fund set up for green projects in schools that awards funds in installments. New installments can only be awarded after existing funds are spent.
   
   To ensure effective deployment of these funds, we will work both in tandem with LAUSD and our schools to apply for funding to be used towards the construction of a Learning Garden, significantly reducing the cost of a garden to the school and making sure that funds from the bond are awarded rapidly so that more funds can be released and more schools can have access to them. 
   
   We will work with LAUSD with the intent to fund 60 Learning Gardens together. We have also worked with LAUSD on using our gardens specifically for nutrition education and obesity prevention, helping them to use our gardens as part and parcel of their messaging and curriculum.
   
   2. Compliment our gardens with quality programming
   We partner with a number of organizations that have developed excellent curriculum that can be put to use in our gardens. For example, we have partnered with Enrich LA and GrowingGreats on pilot projects to bring their curriculum to bear on our Learning Gardens in Compton and Hawthorne.
   
   We also partner with after and summer school programs to ensure our gardens get the most use possible. Some of our programming partners include Beyond the Bell (an after school program) and the Child Development Center (a summer camp organization).
   
   Through this project, we will be seeking new curriculum and programming partners to strengthen the efficacy of our gardens. 
   
   3. Include highly influential people and organizations
   We work with The California Endowment Fund through a substantive grant to install gardens in schools that fall outside of the LAUSD. We will continue nurturing this partnership and others in hopes of unlocking future funds.
   
   Our organizational ties to LA-based companies like Space X enable us to reach a targeted population of highly influential individuals and organizations, building our network through these channels.
