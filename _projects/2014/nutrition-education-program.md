Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  First, we would retrofit a food truck in consultation with cooking
  instructors. This requires not only a functional kitchen but also small groups
  of people to participate in cooking and larger groups to view the process at
  work. 
   
   Second, we would partner with community organizations to find locations and events where our lessons could be practical. These could include parks, schools, farmers markets, and community festivals. We would also seek partnerships with public health organizations, so our demonstrations could complement the work that they do.
   
   Third, we would take the truck into the community. At events like those specified above, we would provide two types of classes: hands-on classes with small groups that would allow community members to participate in creation of recipes, and demonstrations for larger groups that would showcase recipes. 
   
   Fourth, once the success of this project has been validated, we would seek sponsors for ongoing support. We anticipate that local supermarkets, for example, could be interested in the social goals of the project in exchange for logo recognition or as part of a corporate social responsibility campaign.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Many people do not prepare healthy meals at home because they believe it is
  expensive and time-consuming. Brown Paper LA wants to show low-income and
  working families that neither is the case. Making healthy food at home is
  easier and cheaper than they expect. 
   
   Teaching these families how to create healthy recipes at home will make LA a healthy place to live today. Our recipes will be simple and easy enough to demonstrate directly from a truck, using inexpensive ingredients that can be found at a local supermarket. Further, through our partnerships with public health organizations and local vendors, communities would have access to healthy foods and health awareness that they might not otherwise have. 
   
   Giving Los Angeles a broader appreciation for fresh food and cooking will make it one of the healthiest places to live in 2050. Food insecurity and lack of access are two major problems facing the city. This shouldnâ€™t be the case, since California has some of the freshest ingredients in the world. We believe that by teaching citizens about how to prepare their food, they have a closer relationship to it and the world around them.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  These cooking classes will benefit low-income and working families who may
  believe that they do not have the time nor the skills to cook healthy meals
  for their families. 
   
   We would provide these demonstrations in areas that face food insecurity, including high concentrations of WIC and EBT usage, high rates of dietary conditions including diabetes and obesity, as well as limited access to healthy foods.
   
   Brown Paper LA wants to encourage these families to make healthier choices and show that cooking healthy meals does not have to be an expensive nor time-consuming process. Further, we want to increase availability of healthy foods by encouraging partnerships with local farmers and food vendors who could sell their goods alongside our demonstrations. 
   
   By the same token, this project would also benefit local farmers and food vendors. We anticipate that our classes and demonstrations would attract captive audiences that could be potential consumers of fresh produce and other foods. This would create new markets that they may not have anticipated and provide them an incentive to serve low-income areas.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  We anticipate that Brown Paper could integrate as an add-on feature to a wide
  range of events and community services. This project would only be as
  successful as the partnerships we create. 
   
   Strong potential partners could include: public health outreach campaigns, low-income health clinics, local grocery stores, community gardens, food truck events, farmers markets, and community festivals. Additionally, we could provide specific programming to incorporate into nonprofit events around nutrition, such as school education series. 
   
   We would also partner with healthy food vendors -- e.g. community-supported agriculture and organic farmers -- to sell their wares alongside our demonstrations. Our demonstrations would likely generate business for these vendors and, in doing so, create a means for low-income neighborhoods to access healthy foods.
