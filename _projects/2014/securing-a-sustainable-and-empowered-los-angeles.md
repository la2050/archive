Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  We will use publicly available information available from the US EPA about
  Toxic Releases and Air Quality that has been made available to the public but
  is currently in a format relatively difficult to access and digest for most
  people. For example, the TRI was developed by the EPA as a tool of information
  disclosure to encourage low releases of air toxics by facilities but this
  information has not been used much by the population yet because of its
  complexity. Researchers and students at UCLA have recently launched a website,
  Cal EcoMaps, to communicate this information to the residents of Los Angeles
  through an interactive map. Our objective is to build on this platform to
  provide people with a mobile application that will provide real time
  information about air quality, allow users to upload their own information and
  access this information in various locations. 
   
   The main feature of MyAir LA mobile application, will be an interactive map displaying all the facilities in the Los Angeles area with major toxic releases and real-time updates of AQ. Associated health risks in terms of numbers of cancers based on toxic releases and sensitive populations susceptible to air pollution will be identified. The application will encompass sources of air pollution and AQ data with associated health effects and provide corresponding advice to mitigate exposure. Through MyAir LA, residents of Los Angeles will have easy access to this information at their fingertips. Once the mobile application is developed, a campaign will be undertaken to advertise it and reach out to as many people in Los Angeles as possible. Users of MyAir LA will be able to view the AQ and toxic releases in their area based on a zip code or their current location. 
   
   MyAir LA will also contain additional features that will allow for community engagement, besides enhancing community awareness of air pollution. Tips for residents to lessen their negative environmental impact, especially on days with poor AQ will be provided. Alerts will be provided through the application for any spikes in worsening AQ. Users of MyAir LA will be able to upload pictures of AQ in their neighborhood and share it with other users. An important aspect of MyAir LA will be enabling users to contact companies that report to the TRI. By using the power of information disclosure residents of LA can encourage companies to adopt better environmental practices and reduce their toxic releases.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Los Angeles continues to have some of the most polluted air in the nation. We
  need air to survive each moment of each day and when the very thing we need to
  live is polluted, the quality of our life is greatly diminished. Providing TRI
  information and AQ information will both work towards improving the air in Los
  Angeles in different ways. Reducing the negative effects of air pollution will
  not only require public policy but will also require individual action.
   
   Our project is geared to make LA the healthiest place to live by empowering people, especially sensitive populations, with knowledge that they can act on to improve the air they breathe. Rates of childhood asthma and allergies are rapidly rising. The rates of heart disease, cerebovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cancer are growing, diseases attributed to air pollution, and the exposed population is getting larger. Many populations like young children, the elderly, pregnant women, asthma patients, patients with allergies and sensitivities are especially vulnerable to air pollution. 
   
   Our project is geared to make LA the healthiest place to live by using the power of awareness to incentivize companies to improve their environmental performance. By generating awareness of air toxics and the facilities that release these toxics, companies will be likely to change their management practices to reduce their environment impact through the influence of information disclosure. Users of the mobile application will be able to take direct action by engaging with companies to encourage them to adopt better environmental practices. They will be able to provide feedback to companies and email them. Users can also take pictures in real-time and upload them onto a common map where other users can view the pictures and know the air quality in a specific location. This level of detail is not possible with AQ updates since monitoring stations in one location cover large areas of the city. Over time, the power of community awareness and engagement would lead to making LA a healthier place.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  This project is intended to benefit the common resident of Los Angeles by
  creating awareness of the air pollution in their neighborhoods and communities
  through MyAir LA. This is an especially useful tool for populations that are
  vulnerable to air pollution. This project has implications for the health of
  minorities and sensitive populations, which are adversely impacted by low air
  quality. Approximately 40% of Californiaâ€™s residents live in high traffic
  areas. This number is significantly higher in densely populated areas such as
  Los Angeles. Populations of non-white residents, minorities and low-income
  households are higher near major roadways almost everywhere in the nation but
  this disparity is much higher in the Los Angeles Metropolitan area. People of
  lower socio-economic status disproportionately incur the negative health
  effects of air pollution more than other segments of the population. It is
  also these families that are likely to have least access to this kind of
  information about air quality and have low awareness of mitigation options. By
  providing them with health tips to reduce their exposure they can make
  healthier choices. Parents can be more cognizant of what the best times are to
  take their children outdoors. Residents can determine what times are best for
  outdoor exercise. 
   
   By bringing to light data of toxic releases in our communities, facilities will be pushed to adopt more environmentally friendly practices and over time this should result in fewer toxic releases in Los Angeles. With MyAir, toxic releases can be viewed in the vicinity of schools and colleges and it is of prime importance that releases be reduced in these areas where children often spend time outdoors. With MyAir, sensitive populations can make healthier lifestyle choices before traveling or moving homes by being aware of sources of air pollution in those areas.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  We don't have any outside collaborators but several researchers at UCLA are
  part of the MyAir LA team.
