  more_detail: "LASC is dedicated to creating a more sustainable LA by facilitating research, informing stakeholders and providing solutions to emerging environmental challenges.  Our project aims to accomplish the following key endeavors:\r\nSenior Fellows- Grant fellowships to 4 Senior Fellows, each assigned to guide research in each of our initiative areas: Protecting Our Water, Reinventing Our Streets, Re-Powering Our Cities, and Fostering Innovation in Sustainability.\r\nNew Student Fellowship- Support 10 new student research project, with at least two in each initiative area. \r\nNew Leaders in Sustainability (NLS)- Develop a 4 month leadership development program to empower and train young professionals with skills to solve environmental issues facing LA.\r\n"
  implement: "LASC will implement this idea through the following activities:\r\na.\tSenior Fellows: Hire four temporary or part time “Senior Fellows” to be managed and coached by LASC Board and staff to oversee research and programs under each initiative area. Senior Fellows will be young professionals or graduate students, with demonstrated interest in Southern California sustainability issues. Each Senior Fellow’s job description is as follows:\r\ni.\tPerform continual oversight over multiple Research Fellows.\r\nii.\tIdentify and propose outreach and advocacy campaigns to advance each initiative area.\r\niii.\tWork with current partner organizations and agencies to identify next steps, outreach opportunities, and additional research needed.\r\niv.\tIdentify/draft at least two new research ideas per initiative, network with potential partners, and solicit student interest.\r\nb.\tNew Leaders in Sustainability (NLS)\r\ni.\tThe NLS Program will fill a critical need in Southern California by helping train, empower, and launch new leaders within the environmental community. This would be the region’s first program of its kind. The NLS program will provide participants with access to leading industry experts, policy makers, and advocates; opportunities to attend and participate in policy briefings with regional stakeholders; and professional mentoring.  \r\nii.\tNLS will provide participants with: \r\n1.\taccess to experts , policy makers, and other professionals;  \r\n2.\tone-on-one mentoring opportunities; \r\n3.\taccess to leadership and advocacy training seminars and meetings; and \r\n4.\tan opportunity to organize policy/community briefings in collaboration with partner organizations.  NLS participants will be selected from applicants with demonstrated interest in local sustainability and environmental advocacy. \r\nc.\tOrganizational Development\r\ni.\tExpand awareness of LASC’s mission and impact through increased education, fundraising, and public outreach\r\nii.\tSupport a 2-day strategic planning workshop for LASC Board, staff, and partners to \r\ndevelop and start implementing new 5-year strategy. This will allow us to analyze our growth over the last 5 years and identify how best to advance LASC’s mission and sustainability in Los Angeles in the future. \r\n"
  impact_live: "LASC’s mission is directly in line with the goals and metrics of LA2050. We are not only making LA the best place to live, but also to play, connect, create, and learn today and into the future. We prepare our region’s future leaders with the tools and guidance needed to transform LA into a place with low obesity rates; clean air and water; access to local and healthy food; and plenty of green space Furthermore, our collaborations with academia, local government, non-governmental organizations, private businesses, and community groups, create invaluable partnerships which attract young and up-and-coming researchers and thought-leaders to Los Angeles’s growing environmental movement.  By doing so, we will encourage innovative thinking, creative solutions, and exciting new partnerships to ensure LA will be more sustainable in 2050 than ever before.\r\n\r\nTo date, LASC has funded and coached 17 graduate Fellows to research emerging, current, and local environmental issues. Each Fellow is required to identify opportunities to use their research to educate the public and advance our initiatives.  Current projects include research on how to improve local food policy, create ways (including using alleys and freeways) to increase the number of urban parks, and identify best practices to conserve and protect water resources. Previous fellows identified how to reform parking policies, increase biking, and minimize air pollution exposure through urban design and traffic management strategies. Additionally, Fellows identified specific strategies emergency response and coastal agencies ought to employ to prevent and address the threat of a major oil spill off our coast. \r\n\r\nAll of our past and current Fellows’ research helps make LA the best place to be today and in the future.  In the next year, with your support, LASC will create four new quality entry-level LA-based green jobs, fund 8-10 new research Fellowships, and pilot our New Leaders in Sustainability Program, which will provide our region’s future leaders with the tools and guidance needed to make LA the healthiest place to live by 2050.  By then, LASC will have supported hundreds, if not thousands, of student research Fellowships, provided working experience and mentorship to our region’s young professionals, and training new sustainability leaders to make LA a healthy and vibrant environment. Additionally, LASC will lead the nation with the original model and headquarters for numerous Sustainability Collaboratives."
  who_benefit: "Over the next year, expanded LASC operations will benefit current fellows, a new class of 12-15 NLS participants, as well as LASC’s current and future partners and staff, which includes 4 Senior Fellows and 8-10 Research Fellows.  With your support, LASC will create original research and policy recommendations, which will advance our initiatives and benefit all those who live, work, learn and play in the City of LA. \r\n\r\nCurrent Research Fellows, students at 5 southern California based universities, will benefit from expanded support to educate the public and advocate for change based on their findings. These projects include how to improve demand side water management, increase wetlands resiliency in the face of climate change, reduce air pollution through urban design, and create a revitalized network of green alleyways. Current partners include the LA Food Policy Council and South Park BID. \r\n \r\nNew hires, new fellowship recipients, and participants of the NLS program will receive a valuable opportunity to develop their careers by working with preeminent experts in their fields of interest, actively engaging and contributing to the missions of respected environmental organizations in the region, and making a direct and substantive impact.\r\n\r\nIn the long term, your support allows LASC’s work to benefit Angelenos, and also helps LA continue to lead the nation with innovative solutions, best management practices, quality research, top environmental professionals, and a successful model to create a resilient, healthy, vibrant, and sustainable city.  \r\n"
  partners_collaboration: "LASC collaborates with professionals in academia, government and the non-profit sector to identify current and emerging environmental and sustainability issues that impact the Los Angeles region and pinpoint research needed to address those issues.  We then partner with those experts to fund and guide student Research Fellows, to identify and advocate for solutions revealed through their research. Current partnerships include Los Angeles City Council District 7, UCLA Institute of Environment and Sustainability, UCLA Luskin School of Pubic Affairs, Los Angeles Food Policy Council, and South Park Business Improvement District.\r\n\r\nFuture partnerships depend on which issues are identified through topics/issues we decide to address, and can vary accordingly. We are currently exploring opportunities to collaborate with the LA Unified School District to update their sustainability plans. Some organizations we have partnered with in the past and would do so again include: Los Angeles Waterkeeper, Environment Now, City of Los Angeles City Council, UCLA Luskin Center for Innovation, USC Center for Sustainable Cities, CicLAvia, Los Angeles River Revitalization Corporation, Environmental Defense Fund, Natural Resources Defense Council, California Center for Sustainable Communities, The Bay Foundation, Heal the Bay, TreePeople, and EarthJustice.\r\n\r\nCollaboration, as our name suggests, is the foundation of our work. Our mission to create a more sustainable LA cannot be done alone and we strive to establish long lasting relationships with leaders in government, nonprofits, academia, and businesses. \r\n\r\nWhile we have yet to identify partners for this grant period, we expect they will be confirmed within one to three months after the grant is awarded.  Three factors that are critical to the success of our proposed collaborations are 1) adequate funding to staff our initiative areas with Senior Fellows; 2)  growth and expansion in the number of Research Fellowships; and 3) sufficient operational revenue to support growing staffing needs.\r\n"

  evaluate: "We will measure success by evaluating the growth of the organization within its core programs. Specifically, LASC will analyze if we are able to 1) create 8-10 new research projects, 2) partner with 8-12 new collaborators, 3) fund 8-15 graduate students, 4) hire 4 people into entry-level positions, 5) coordinate 8-10 policy briefings, and 6) enroll, train, and help 12-15 students graduate through our NLS program.\r\n\r\nThese indicators will demonstrate our ability to expand our initiatives’ impact by building on previous projects and partnerships, creating new collaborations, and further minimizing the gap between academic research and real world issues. Additionally, LASC will continue to create a smooth transition for students to gain employable skills and experience. The more experienced sustainability experts we train the more we can ensure Angelenos have increased access to healthy foods, reduced exposure to air toxins, minimized water imports, and improved quality of life. \r\n \r\nLASC has grown leaps and bounds since it was founded. We planned our success through a well thought out a 5 year strategic plan to expand our initiatives, fund more students, and partner with more groups. Now we need to look at the next 5 years: another indicator of success will be our ability to develop a new road map and start implementing it. Support from the Goldhirsh Foundation will be our first large grant creating a significant opportunity for growth and a strong foundation for success. \r\n"
  two_lessons: "LASC was founded in 2009 by seven young professionals immersed in the Southern California sustainability movement. In addition to unique and fresh ideas, each founding Board Member has distinct expertise from a wide range of professions, including academia, business, law, advocacy, public affairs and communications. We collectively identified two gaps within the local environmental movement: 1) environmental advocates need sound research to make informed decisions and 2) graduate students need real-world working experience. The Los Angeles Sustainability Collaborative (LASC) is the solution: we lead practical academic research and foster tomorrow’s urban environmentalists.\r\n\r\nLASC was founded in 2009 by seven young professionals immersed in the Southern California sustainability movement.

  achievable_goal: "LASC has already established a great working foundation in which to grow. All Board Members and staff are in our 20’s and 30’s and are passionate and committed. As with all our big decisions, applying for this grant was strategic. Since Board Members hold full time jobs, the best way to use LA2050 funds is to hire more young professionals to manage our initiatives. This will create new quality green jobs for our region, provide our Board with more experience managing staff, and allow LASC to support more students and advocates. With a dedicated staff person for each initiative, we will be able to identify more opportunities for research, partnerships, and advocacy.\r\n\r\nThrough our RFP process (to select students for Fellowships), we already have a great network of universities and other groups in which to advertise new positions and a process to assess applicants’ strengths. Additionally, we continuously have a list of emerging and current local sustainability issues that we would address if we had increased capacity. We use our funds efficiently, are nimble, eager to learn, and are prepared to take on this challenge.\r\n"
  major_challenges: "Two challenges LASC may face during this grant period are 1) changing partner priorities and 2) general organization growing pains. Creating a sustainable and resilient LA through collaboration is ambitious and sometimes partners, Technical Advisory Committee members, and other experts need more time to provide feedback to students. We value our partners’ time and ameliorate these issues by preparing conservative timelines and encouraging open discussions about commitments. Another way we will address this challenge is by preparing LASC staff to take on a larger portion of the work needed to finalize research project, coordinate meetings, briefings, etc. This way, we can ensure partners’ participate to the fullest extent without negatively impacting our mission, goals, and timelines.\r\n\r\nAnother challenge our Board will continue to face is finding the balance between growing organically and growing strategically. Unforeseen opportunities and issues come up and we are learning to be flexible while keeping the end goal in mind. After 5 years, we have had Board members change jobs, start families, and become more or less involved. To address these growing pains, we established an Advisory Board of Directors of seasoned environmental professionals to help guide LASC’s organizational growth, hired a part time staff to help with day to day tasks, and are adding additional Board members to ensure our growth is successful.\r\n"
  competition: "At the height of the recession in 2009 and as non-profits and community organizations struggled to find resources for research, LASC was created. Since then, LASC has been a matchmaker between academia, non-profit organizations, and policy makers — pioneering a model of collaboration and problem solving. \r\n\r\nThere are no other sustainability organizations with the sole mission of providing critical research needed and professional development to young advocates. Thus, an in-vestment in LASC pays dividends, providing resources to not just one, but many important non-profit organizations and those students who will be the next generation of environmental stewards. LASC is unique in that at its core the organization promotes collaboration in advancing sustainability for LA. While many organizations focus on advocacy, LASC instead utilizes its research and findings to inform decision makers and impact policy. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the NLS program is the first of its kind in Southern California. The NLS program will fill a critical need in southern California by helping train, empower and launch new leaders to take on issues related to ensuring a healthy and livable community.  The NLS program provides emerging thought leaders with the tools necessary to lead the future of sustainability in southern California. \r\n\r\nTo our knowledge, we are the first organization of its kind utilizing this unique model. \r\n"
  cost: >-
    As per the detailed budget (see below) indicates, LASC can complete the
    proposed project with $100,000. Because the funds will be going towards
    achieving the LA2050 metrics through LASC research and programs, we
    anticipate covering any additional costs through LASC's annual fundraising
    event.
  budget: >-
    We anticipate budgeting the $100,000 by initiative area. $15,000 will be
    allocated for each of the 4 LASC initiatives: Protecting Our Water;
    Repowering Our Cities; Reinventing Our Streets; and Innovation in
    Sustainability. The $15,000 will cover staff salary including the Senior
    Fellows ($12,000) and the graduate student fellowships ($3,000). We
    anticipate allocating $25,000 for the New Leaders in Sustainability Program.
    The funding will go towards building the program, the application efforts,
    and successfully carrying out the pilot program. An additional $15,000 will
    be budgeted for development, which includes grant writing to go after more
    partnerships and strategic plan development to ensure LASC successfully
    meets the LA2050 metrics.

  impact_metrics: "LASC's mission is to create a sustainable Los Angeles. To do so, LASC works with local partners and funds graduate student research fellowships to answer questions and identify policy recommendations to emerging sustainability challenges including: securing a sustainable LA food shed, identifying sources of air toxins and controls to reduce exposure, securing a reliable local water supply and methods for water conservation, creating complete streets, and analyzing water quality and how to ensure safe drinking water and waterways. The research topics listed only covers those that LASC has worked on thus far, and does not include future research areas LASC will address. \r\n\r\nOur Fellow’s projects on air pollution, water quality and conservation, and biking all satisfy several of the  LA2050’s “Live” metrics. Additionally, LASC just partnered with the Los Angeles Food Council to hire a Fellow to address access to healthy, affordable food. Specifically, the student will develop a tool for increasing the effectiveness and coordination of food policy advocacy efforts across issue areas by better understanding systemic causes impacting food system outcomes and their policy/regulatory drivers. This project will be used as a component of a facilitated discussion at an upcoming interdisciplinary food system symposium at UCLA. \r\n\r\nWe support students to complete relevant, quality, and most importantly, applicable sustainability related research projects.  LASC creates new entry-level green jobs and operates a system that allows seamless transitions between higher education institutions and the workforce by providing professional guidance and experience to students.  LASC prepares LA residents to develop and contribute their skills, talents, and abilities to society. LASC capitalizes on its relationships with higher education facilities to foster new businesses, advance research, and spur innovation.\r\n"
Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  We will use publicly available information available from the US EPA about
  Toxic Releases and Air Quality that has been made available to the public but
  is currently in a format relatively difficult to access and digest for most
  people. For example, the TRI was developed by the EPA as a tool of information
  disclosure to encourage low releases of air toxics by facilities but this
  information has not been used much by the population yet because of its
  complexity. Researchers and students at UCLA have recently launched a website,
  Cal EcoMaps, to communicate this information to the residents of Los Angeles
  through an interactive map. Our objective is to build on this platform to
  provide people with a mobile application that will provide real time
  information about air quality, allow users to upload their own information and
  access this information in various locations. 
   
   The main feature of MyAir LA mobile application, will be an interactive map displaying all the facilities in the Los Angeles area with major toxic releases and real-time updates of AQ. Associated health risks in terms of numbers of cancers based on toxic releases and sensitive populations susceptible to air pollution will be identified. The application will encompass sources of air pollution and AQ data with associated health effects and provide corresponding advice to mitigate exposure. Through MyAir LA, residents of Los Angeles will have easy access to this information at their fingertips. Once the mobile application is developed, a campaign will be undertaken to advertise it and reach out to as many people in Los Angeles as possible. Users of MyAir LA will be able to view the AQ and toxic releases in their area based on a zip code or their current location. 
   
   MyAir LA will also contain additional features that will allow for community engagement, besides enhancing community awareness of air pollution. Tips for residents to lessen their negative environmental impact, especially on days with poor AQ will be provided. Alerts will be provided through the application for any spikes in worsening AQ. Users of MyAir LA will be able to upload pictures of AQ in their neighborhood and share it with other users. An important aspect of MyAir LA will be enabling users to contact companies that report to the TRI. By using the power of information disclosure residents of LA can encourage companies to adopt better environmental practices and reduce their toxic releases.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Los Angeles continues to have some of the most polluted air in the nation. We
  need air to survive each moment of each day and when the very thing we need to
  live is polluted, the quality of our life is greatly diminished. Providing TRI
  information and AQ information will both work towards improving the air in Los
  Angeles in different ways. Reducing the negative effects of air pollution will
  not only require public policy but will also require individual action.
   
   Our project is geared to make LA the healthiest place to live by empowering people, especially sensitive populations, with knowledge that they can act on to improve the air they breathe. Rates of childhood asthma and allergies are rapidly rising. The rates of heart disease, cerebovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cancer are growing, diseases attributed to air pollution, and the exposed population is getting larger. Many populations like young children, the elderly, pregnant women, asthma patients, patients with allergies and sensitivities are especially vulnerable to air pollution. 
   
   Our project is geared to make LA the healthiest place to live by using the power of awareness to incentivize companies to improve their environmental performance. By generating awareness of air toxics and the facilities that release these toxics, companies will be likely to change their management practices to reduce their environment impact through the influence of information disclosure. Users of the mobile application will be able to take direct action by engaging with companies to encourage them to adopt better environmental practices. They will be able to provide feedback to companies and email them. Users can also take pictures in real-time and upload them onto a common map where other users can view the pictures and know the air quality in a specific location. This level of detail is not possible with AQ updates since monitoring stations in one location cover large areas of the city. Over time, the power of community awareness and engagement would lead to making LA a healthier place.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  This project is intended to benefit the common resident of Los Angeles by
  creating awareness of the air pollution in their neighborhoods and communities
  through MyAir LA. This is an especially useful tool for populations that are
  vulnerable to air pollution. This project has implications for the health of
  minorities and sensitive populations, which are adversely impacted by low air
  quality. Approximately 40% of California’s residents live in high traffic
  areas. This number is significantly higher in densely populated areas such as
  Los Angeles. Populations of non-white residents, minorities and low-income
  households are higher near major roadways almost everywhere in the nation but
  this disparity is much higher in the Los Angeles Metropolitan area. People of
  lower socio-economic status disproportionately incur the negative health
  effects of air pollution more than other segments of the population. It is
  also these families that are likely to have least access to this kind of
  information about air quality and have low awareness of mitigation options. By
  providing them with health tips to reduce their exposure they can make
  healthier choices. Parents can be more cognizant of what the best times are to
  take their children outdoors. Residents can determine what times are best for
  outdoor exercise. 
   
   By bringing to light data of toxic releases in our communities, facilities will be pushed to adopt more environmentally friendly practices and over time this should result in fewer toxic releases in Los Angeles. With MyAir, toxic releases can be viewed in the vicinity of schools and colleges and it is of prime importance that releases be reduced in these areas where children often spend time outdoors. With MyAir, sensitive populations can make healthier lifestyle choices before traveling or moving homes by being aware of sources of air pollution in those areas.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  We don't have any outside collaborators but several researchers at UCLA are
  part of the MyAir LA team.
