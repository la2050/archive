  more_detail: "Divining LA is a collaborative, multi-year initiative designed to seek, reveal, and champion a water-smart future for Los Angeles, and to position LA as a leader in the design of drylands resilience globally.  Divining LA brings together teams of architects, urban designers, citizens, scientists, and policy advisors to envision an abundant future in drylands.  \r\n\r\nOne hundred years after Los Angeles pioneered the long-distance delivery of remote snowpack as water source, Divining LA will give voice and vision to the next century of water resilience and localized self-sufficiency. "
  implement: "Divining LA will convert cutting-edge research on stormwater resources, groundwater augmentation, water recycling, and water conservation into planning and design strategies for neighborhoods across Los Angeles.  Divining LA will pair economically and culturally diverse community-based organizations with teams of university and professional designers.  Each team will be challenged and supported to invent a water-smart future for specific neighborhoods.  Teams will generate design visions and policy recommendations for their own small-scale, distributed approaches to a localized water future, appropriate to the scale, tempo, and flavor of their neighborhood, and the greater hydrologic function of the LA basin. \r\n\r\nDivining LA provides an opportunity not only to residents and business owners to visualize climate adaptation and mitigation strategies; it also provides a much-needed, real-time opportunity for Los Angeles’ rich design culture to advance water-smart planning policy and building systems for a resilient future.\r\n\r\nDivining LA will bring together faculty, graduate and undergraduate researchers from Woodbury, asmall, private Hispanic-serving university, and collaborator design programs from around the region.  Teams will have the support and involvement of engineers from public water agencies and leading global firms; NGOs with long track records of service to the communities of Los Angeles; and multidisciplinary research and design teams from universities and the design professions.  In year one, Divining LA partners will build on existing relationships throughout its collaborator network to identify specific neighborhoods and community-based organizations for partnerships.  Divining LA will partner with a range of communities facing specific hydrologic, economic, and cultural challenges that would most benefit from being paired with Divining LA planning and design teams.   The goal is to generate a set of visionary water-management strategies for each of the disparate communities engaged, and to propose and advocate for new policies suggested by the design challenge.  From these, a small number of projects will be selected as possible demonstration projects.  Divining LA will widely publicize, encourage debate, document and disseminate the results of all projects.\r\n"
  impact_live: "LA benefits today in engaging citizens to design their own destiny.  LA benefits tomorrow with water, energy, and carbon savings.  Los Angeles River Watershed area, at 864 square miles and  65% impermeability, generates 350,000 acre feet of storm water runoff per year, enough for 2,100,000 people per year at current usage rates or with conservation measures in place, enough for 2,625,000 people.  That translates to a gross energy savings of 700 gigawatt hours or the equivalent of taking 130,000 passenger vehicles off the road. \r\n\r\n \r\n"
  who_benefit: "Divining LA outreach has the potential to bring advanced geospatial research to public benefit rapidly. It has the potential to optimize the hydrologic function of the arid built environment; uncouple the water-energy nexus; produce hydrologic planning, zoning, building code reforms; encourage small scale distributed water infrastructures as design opportunities that respect the cultural and biophysical attributes of communities and watersheds; promote building-integrated water systems innovation for the global marketplace; retool science and design curricula to creatively engage the challenges of climate adaptation; and increase participation of underrepresented communities. Divining LA outputs are scaleable and transferable to water-stressed environments affecting 30 million people in the US West, and 1.2 billion people worldwide.\r\n"
  partners_collaboration: "Partners who have confirmed their participation and support include TreePeople, ARUP\r\nCity of LA Bureau of Engineering, City of LA Bureau of Sanitation/Watershed Protection Program, County of LA Flood Control/Watershed Management program, LADWP Stormwater Management, UCLA Water Resources Group, American Institute of Architects | Los Angeles, Perkins + Will Architects, AC Martin Architects, and Mia Lehrer + Associates.  ALI has secured the preliminary interest of design leaders at USC, UCLA, CalPoly Pomona, Art Center College of Design, SCI-Arc, and of course Woodbury School of Architecture.\r\n"

  two_lessons: "ALI’s Drylands Design Conference of 2012, which brought together 175 designers, scientists, and policy makers, taught us that there is great hunger for design vision as a catalyst for making change possible, real, and appealing.   Our work since then has taught us that much good water conservation and reclamation work is going on around Los Angeles, but without a strong habit of coordination and collaboration across sectors.  Divining LA builds on design as a bridge between science, policy, and the public imagination, and brings together multiple conversations across the region.\r\n"
  achievable_goal: >-
    In the next 12 months, Divining LA will achieve major milestones: 
    developing the design brief and support materials for design teams; inviting
    university and professional collaborators to join the challenge; identifying
    community-based organizations to represent their neighborhoods in the
    challenge; and launching the first phase of design by Fall 2015.  By the end
    of 2015, Divining LA will be in the process of generating lively design and
    policy visions, which will be documented, debated, curated, and disseminated
    via digital and physical media in the second phase.
  major_challenges: "Efforts to build climate resilience through localization of water supply in urban centers within arid regions are frequently hampered by lack of integration between water supply and water quality policy objectives; lack of integration of water, energy, and carbon objectives; conflicting watershed data, assessment, and management practices across political boundaries; lack of high-resolution data, including projected climate impacts on hydrologic processes; insufficient costs/benefit analysis that includes valuation of ecosystem services; overreliance on single-purpose, single-scale infrastructure design; static, empirical models offering limited options for scenario-based testing and stakeholder involvement. \r\n\r\nThe Divining LA network collaborates across sectors to support an adaptive, dynamic environmental modeling tool that: integrates water supply, quality, energy, carbon, and economic metrics; incorporates high-resolution data, including high-resolution projected climate impacts; measures interactions and feedbacks between human and natural systems; simulates and compares policy  and development scenarios; tests multiscalar and multipurpose approaches, patterns and processes; evaluates impacts and implications of development scenarios on human and natural systems; incorporates design visioning as a mechanism for providing socially and culturally responsive choices that are plausible and acceptable to stakeholders.\r\n"
  competition: "Divining LA is timed to support and amplify related public initiatives, including the establishment of a City of LA Resilience Office through the Rockefeller Foundation’s 100 Resilient Cities campaign; the Mayor’s Great Streets initiative; and the $1 billion dollar retrofit of the LA River by the City, State, and the US Army Corps of Engineers.  Divining LA anticipates the next chapter in LA’s retrofit of the urban fabric:  the capture, filtration, and distribution of local waters (rain, storm, and recycled) across the surface of the entire basin, not just the river bed and its adjacent greensward.  The success of massive public investment in the river will, in large part, depend on how LA remakes the surfaces of the basins that drain to the river.  Divining LA is unique in anticipating LA’s next water chapter at the larger scale and the finer-grain resolution that it does.\r\n"
  cost: >-
    We expect Divining LA to unfold over several years.  We have applied for
    major funding from the National Science Foundation for the scientific and
    technical aspects of the work.  We expect the public engagement and
    dissemination phases to cost approximately $350,000. We are actively
    pursuing funding from private foundations based here in Los Angeles and
    elsewhere.
  budget: "20K convening and planning: 2 planning events/listening sessions\r\n\r\n15K  full documentation and archive of planning events including visual and dissemination costs\r\n\r\n45K creation of web-based and printed resources, including prototype digital tool\r\n\r\n20K outreach and communications campaign\r\n"

Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  FQHCs that focus on special populations such as residents of public housing,
  persons experiencing homelessness or agricultural workers, are subject to
  special waivers and accommodations that allow the FQHCs to address the unique
  health care needs of these groups. No such process currently exists for people
  with developmental disabilities. 
   
   It is our hope that we can demonstrate to HRSA the merits of designating people with developmental disabilities as a special population. Consequently such a designation would allow us to get the proper reimbursement rate for services rendered as well as allow us to receive continued HRSA grant funding. 
   
   In that regard, we believe that a significant portion of funding could be allocated to the efforts of our CEO and additional consulting support as Achievable looks to streamline operations, ensure federal, state and county compliance, grow our patient base and ensure that we are properly compensated for the care we provide to our clients.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  The groups of people we serve are amongst the most medically complex
  individuals in the county. By better serving their needs, we can help the
  healthcare safety net better deal with the impacts via reduced
  hospitalizations, visits to ER's and better management and prevention of
  chronic health conditions that can be reduced via on-going, culturally
  competent and timely care. The impacts go beyond the thousands of clients we
  serve, to their families and other care-givers which often neglect their own
  health even as they care for our patients.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The Achievable Foundation is a nonprofit organization founded in 1996 with the
  mission of significantly improving the health and quality of life of
  under-served individuals living in Los Angeles County who have developmental
  disabilities such as autism, intellectual disability, cerebral palsy and
  epilepsy. 
   
   Individuals with developmental disabilities have numerous complex health care needs and experience poorer health than the general population, including disproportionately high incidence of chronic conditions and preventable mortality. Although state and federally-supported Community Health Center programs provide significant support for meeting the needs of many vulnerable populations, there is no specific framework for addressing the unique challenges posed in serving a patient base made up primarily of individuals with developmental disabilities.
   
   We aim to serve the tens of thousands of potential clients that may seek our services from across the entire county of Los Angeles.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  The Achievable Clinic is leveraging our strategic partnerships with
  organizations like the Westside Regional Center (WRC)--where we are
  co-located-- to offer a growing spectrum of health care services to the
  expanding number of individuals with developmental disabilities who have
  MediCal insurance coverage through L.A. Care Health Plan. Based on the latest
  information from L.A. Care, there are over 2,286 clients at WRC (or roughly
  one third of all WRC clients) signed up with one of L.A. Care’s health plan
  providers. 
   
   As part of an extensive outreach plan, Achievable is looking to become the medical home of choice for many new L.A. Care clients. Serving as a medical home to L.A. Care clients places our clinic in a strategic position to contribute significantly towards L.A. Care Health Plan’s Triple Aim goals of achieving excellent patient outcomes, excellent patient experiences, and cost effectiveness and efficiency on behalf of our shared clients. To that end, we seek to improve patient experiences while minimizing long-term medical costs through an integrated, whole-person approach to addressing the ongoing healthcare needs of our community members. 
   
   If we can demonstrate the effectiveness of this strategy working with WRC, this could be expanded to the other Regional Centers across LA County that together serve tens of thousands of individuals with developmental disabilities.
