Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  FQHCs that focus on special populations such as residents of public housing,
  persons experiencing homelessness or agricultural workers, are subject to
  special waivers and accommodations that allow the FQHCs to address the unique
  health care needs of these groups. No such process currently exists for people
  with developmental disabilities. 
   
   It is our hope that we can demonstrate to HRSA the merits of designating people with developmental disabilities as a special population. Consequently such a designation would allow us to get the proper reimbursement rate for services rendered as well as allow us to receive continued HRSA grant funding. 
   
   In that regard, we believe that a significant portion of funding could be allocated to the efforts of our CEO and additional consulting support as Achievable looks to streamline operations, ensure federal, state and county compliance, grow our patient base and ensure that we are properly compensated for the care we provide to our clients.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  The groups of people we serve are amongst the most medically complex
  individuals in the county. By better serving their needs, we can help the
  healthcare safety net better deal with the impacts via reduced
  hospitalizations, visits to ER's and better management and prevention of
  chronic health conditions that can be reduced via on-going, culturally
  competent and timely care. The impacts go beyond the thousands of clients we
  serve, to their families and other care-givers which often neglect their own
  health even as they care for our patients.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The Achievable Foundation is a nonprofit organization founded in 1996 with the
  mission of significantly improving the health and quality of life of
  under-served individuals living in Los Angeles County who have developmental
  disabilities such as autism, intellectual disability, cerebral palsy and
  epilepsy. 
   
   Individuals with developmental disabilities have numerous complex health care needs and experience poorer health than the general population, including disproportionately high incidence of chronic conditions and preventable mortality. Although state and federally-supported Community Health Center programs provide significant support for meeting the needs of many vulnerable populations, there is no specific framework for addressing the unique challenges posed in serving a patient base made up primarily of individuals with developmental disabilities.
   
   We aim to serve the tens of thousands of potential clients that may seek our services from across the entire county of Los Angeles.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  The Achievable Clinic is leveraging our strategic partnerships with
  organizations like the Westside Regional Center (WRC)--where we are
  co-located-- to offer a growing spectrum of health care services to the
  expanding number of individuals with developmental disabilities who have
  MediCal insurance coverage through L.A. Care Health Plan. Based on the latest
  information from L.A. Care, there are over 2,286 clients at WRC (or roughly
  one third of all WRC clients) signed up with one of L.A. Care’s health plan
  providers. 
   
   As part of an extensive outreach plan, Achievable is looking to become the medical home of choice for many new L.A. Care clients. Serving as a medical home to L.A. Care clients places our clinic in a strategic position to contribute significantly towards L.A. Care Health Plan’s Triple Aim goals of achieving excellent patient outcomes, excellent patient experiences, and cost effectiveness and efficiency on behalf of our shared clients. To that end, we seek to improve patient experiences while minimizing long-term medical costs through an integrated, whole-person approach to addressing the ongoing healthcare needs of our community members. 
   
   If we can demonstrate the effectiveness of this strategy working with WRC, this could be expanded to the other Regional Centers across LA County that together serve tens of thousands of individuals with developmental disabilities.
