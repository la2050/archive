    By 2050 our global population will reach 9 billion. Coastal cities like L.A.
    will look to the ocean for food sources more than ever before. But our ocean
    is not limitless. More than two thirds of the world’s fisheries are
    harvested at capacity, threatening our food supply, marine ecosystem, and
    coastal lifestyle. Seafood for the Future is a nonprofit seafood advisory
    program building a community of consumers, chefs, restaurants, fisheries,
    and farmers to promote healthy seafood choices. We are the only regional
    group working across the supply chain, but we need new tools for consumers
    to tackle the issue from the demand side. With demand for sustainable
    seafood, we can ensure that people, fish, and the ocean are all part of the
    equation.
  implement: "Seafood for the Future (SFF) works at all levels of the supply chain to bring about change, generates public awareness of ocean issues, and helps consumers make responsible choices about seafood that support family budgets, local economies, and our ocean ecosystem. We have successful partnerships with chefs, restaurants, fisheries, and distributors, and while we will continue to grow the business advisory aspect of our program, our focus now is on generating tools for the consumer. \r\n\r\nUltimately, the consumer controls the demand for seafood. By empowering the public with the knowledge and tools they need to make healthy, responsible seafood choices, we can shift the demand in favor of sustainable seafood options, healthier communities, and abundant ocean ecosystems.\r\n\r\nTo do this, we need to educate the public about the health and economic benefits of eating a variety of seafood. Our consumer platform will create a number of new digital resources, our community’s preferred source of educational and consumer information, in collaboration with a nutrition expert and local chefs. \r\n\r\n1. Instructional cooking videos and easy recipes for healthy seafood meals for busy, budget conscious families.\r\n2. A podcast series that discusses the future of seafood and how our food choices are affecting the ocean and local L.A. seafood communities from fisherman, to restaurants, to consumers.\r\n3. A social media campaign that catalogs recipes for healthy, affordable seafood meals contributed and reviewed by the public.\r\n4. An expanded web tool that showcases local restaurants and businesses providing seafood from responsible sources. Participating businesses will label responsible seafood items with the SFF California Local icon.\r\n\r\nVideos will be produced by the Aquarium's award-winning audio visual production team, which has won 14 international Telly awards. We will use existing relationships within the seafood industry in Southern California (chefs, fishermen, aquaculture farmers, scientists, and government and non-government organizations) to provide content for podcasts. The Aquarium's marketing department will inform and promote the social media campaign and digital resources to 1.5 million onsite visitors and 3 million visitors to the website annually.\r\n\r\nSeafood for the Future is a non-profit seafood advisory program based at the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, the second most-visited cultural destination in Los Angeles County.  "
  impact_live: "In Los Angeles, the urban ocean is one-of-a-kind. Its beauty attracts people from around the world in search of inspiration, adventure, and rejuvenation. It offers an uncharacteristically forgiving oceanography, and the second-largest port system in the world, supporting local, national, and global economies. The ocean regulates our weather, supplies our food and medicines, and sustains all life on the planet. \r\n\r\nBut the ocean is in a state of duress–overfishing, bycatch, and habitat damage are threatening the health of our ocean and seafood supply. We have the opportunity and the responsibility, especially in Los Angeles, a coastal metropolis and one of the largest economies in the world, to model a balanced approach to seafood consumption that is healthy for people, communities, and the planet.\r\n\r\nThe United States has the largest Exclusive Economic Zone (the area extending from the coastline out 200 miles) of any nation on Earth. And, the United States is a global leader in sustainable fishing—our fisheries are some of the best managed in the world. Yet 91% of our seafood is imported, (mostly farmed tilapia and shrimp that provide fewer nutrients), while we export a third of our heart healthy, omega-rich, sustainably-fished and farmed seafood. \r\n\r\nSeafood is an important part of a healthy diet and Americans do not eat enough. With easy-to-use digital tools and access to educational resources, the public can make affordable, nutrient-rich, local sustainable seafood choices today. Consumers have the power to influence sourcing with our wallets, and Seafood for the Future’s new tools will guide consumer decision-making all the way from the grocery store to the dinner table.\r\n\r\nIn 2050, we envision a new relationship between humans and the ocean–one that sustains healthy, abundant ecosystems and economies. Our ocean is resilient, and given the chance, marine species can recover from over-fishing. Since 1999, with a stringent U.S. protection plan and international cooperation, the swordfish population has nearly fully recovered from a state of severe depletion to healthy levels. By 2050, with low consumer demand, better management of fisheries, and conservation efforts in place, we can rebuild the population of many more threatened species while supporting a rapidly growing population (expected to be 9 billion by 2050) with access to healthy, nutrient-rich, and affordable seafood options.  \r\n"
  who_benefit: "Eating the right types of seafood is healthy for people and the planet. It will require a balanced approach that includes seafood from well-managed fisheries, responsible aquaculture, and imports from sustainable sources. This approach to seafood consumption will reduce pressure on wild stocks, promote ecologically responsible aquaculture, and reduce our climate impacts by balancing imports with local seafood sources. \r\n\r\nConsumers: Seafood is a healthy source of heart-healthy Omega-3 fatty acids, low-fat protein, and a variety of vitamins and minerals. The U.S. FDA and EPA recently released updated advice that recommends pregnant women and young children to eat two to three servings of a variety of low-mercury fish per week to promote healthy brain development. This project will provide tools and resources for families on the go to enjoy quick, healthy, and responsibly-sourced seafood meals that balance our nutritional needs with our impact on the ocean. \r\n\r\nRestaurants and Businesses: Heightened consumer awareness will strengthen SFF and other organizations' efforts to promote restaurants and businesses that are working to source responsibly. In addition, the education and outreach programs will offer information on where to buy local seafood and delicious recipes to inspire chefs and restaurants to diversify their menus to incorporate local seafood items such as sablefish, sardines, and rockfish. \r\n\r\nLocal Fishermen and Coastal Communities: Most of the seafood harvested in Southern California is shipped to international markets. The outreach tools developed by the project will make buying local easy and affordable. By supporting local seafood consumption, consumers will be connected to local fishing communities and  committed to revitalizing our working waterfront to support fishermen, our coastal communities, and other projects such as environmentally-sound aquaculture. \r\n"
  partners_collaboration: "LA Kitchen (confirmed): LA Kitchen is a nonprofit providing youth aging out of foster care and older adults in the prison system hands-on training for careers in the food service and health care industries. SFF works with LA Kitchen to teach participants about healthy seafood choices in the food service industry. Affordable options, exciting recipes, and the opportunity to promote the efforts of LA Kitchen participants are critical to a successful collaboration.\r\n\r\nTrace and Trust (confirmed): Trace and Trust is building a community of food professionals dedicated to celebrating the farmers and fishermen behind our food. Using the Trace and Trust platform, restaurants trace their menu items directly to the farmers and fishermen responsible for the food and share these stories with their patrons. Trace and Trust members include restaurants, distributors, fishermen, farmers, and ranchers in Southern California and other locations, as well as aquaculture farms. SFF is the first aquarium partner working with Trace and Trust to support local seafood communities and promote responsible seafood from the boat or the farm to the plate. This successful collaboration will include promotion to Aquarium audiences, diverse avenues to share stories from social media to onsite festivals, and connecting our partners with Trace and Trust's project and mission.\r\n\r\nLocal Fishermen and Producers (confirmed): SFF works closely with local fishermen and aquaculture producers to promote healthy and responsible seafood choices. Our new tools will include education and outreach materials that feature local fishermen, directories of local fish markets where consumers can buy direct, and a local seasonality chart for chefs and consumers. These new tools will help bridge the gap between consumers and the source of their seafood.\r\n\r\nSFF Restaurant and Business Partners (confirmed): SFF has established a network of restaurant, distribution, and retail partners working together to promote responsible seafood sourcing. Our partner chefs will star in the video demonstration series, provide seafood for cooking demonstration and educational purposes, and host cooking demonstrations at outreach events.\r\n"

  evaluate: "SFF measures successful partnerships by the improvements in their sourcing practices and the quantities of locally and sustainably-sourced seafood available and consumed the region. For the purposes of public education and outreach, we will measure success through a series of surveys conducted onsite at the Aquarium and via email and social media. Surveys before program participation will create baseline data about our audiences from which we will evaluate changes in knowledge and behavior, including:\r\n1. Knowledge (baseline and post-program) of the health benefits of eating certain types of seafood.\r\n2. Knowledge (baseline and post-program) of ocean issues relating to seafood consumption.\r\n3. Responses to recipes shared and likelihood to try recipes like these at home or in restaurants.\r\n4. Likelihood to look for more sustainable types of seafood at grocery stores and restaurants.\r\n5. Effectiveness of outreach tools, including usability, educational value, and accessibility."
  two_lessons: "Health of the Ocean: The global population has passed 7 billion and is expected to reach more than 9 billion by 2050. One in three people on this planet depends on seafood for their primary source of protein and with the growing awareness of the health benefits of eating seafood, demand is on the rise. More than two-thirds of the world’s fisheries have been harvested at or above their maximum capacity and aquaculture, or fish farming, has surpassed wild capture production to meet the growing demand. Preventing the collapse of our wild-capture fisheries and reducing impacts from aquaculture will require a balanced approach to seafood sourcing, beginning with consumer demand for better seafood choices, and supported by well-managed local fisheries, responsible aquaculture practices, and sustainably fished and farmed imports.  \r\n\r\nHuman Health: The U.S. FDA and American Heart Association recommend two-to-three servings of a variety of seafood per week as sources for heart-healthy Omega-3s, low-fat protein, and various vitamins and minerals. Despite clear evidence that eating more of the right types of seafood is good for us, Americans are still not eating enough. Simply put, we avoid foods that we are unfamiliar with. Shrimp, salmon, and tuna are the top consumed seafood items in the U.S. with whitefish, such as tilapia (which has relatively little nutritional value in terms of seafood) and cod and pollock (fish sticks anyone?) close behind. These are not bad choices, but we need a variety of seafood to ensure we are getting the right balance of nutrients. Right here in Southern California there is a wealth of low-fat protein, heart-healthy Omega-3s, and a variety of nutrients, such as selenium, niacin, and B and E vitamins, available in the form of sablefish, sardines, anchovies, and more. Canned and frozen products also offer easy and affordable options for bringing healthy seafood protein into family meals. SFF’s new resources will teach consumers how to prepare budget-friendly delicious meals from diverse sources of sustainable seafood.\r\n"
  achievable_goal: >-
    Seafood for the Future is a reputable seafood advisory program with a
    diverse portfolio of partners and education materials. This project will
    strengthen our efforts by focusing on implementing new tools for the
    consumer. We will use our existing relationships and partners to build the
    tools and promote them to an established audience of 1.5 Aquarium visitors
    and 3 million online users annually.  
  major_challenges: "1.\t“I don’t like fish because it is too fishy.”\r\nMany people claim that they don’t like seafood, or that they have become sick from eating seafood. When seafood is sourced and prepared correctly, it is healthy and delicious. And, as with any food product, proper sourcing and handling will also reduce the risk of seafood poisoning. SFF will address this issue by exposing the public to new recipes through live cooking demos and web videos. \r\n\r\nAnecdotally, SFF successfully changed visitors minds about an abundant local fish, pacific mackerel. We featured the mackerel at a cooking demo at the Aquarium’s Urban Ocean Festival in May. The guests were skeptical, but after they tried it, we were bombarded by requests for the recipe and to serve the dish at Café Scuba, the Aquarium’s onsite restaurant. Kids and parents alike enjoyed the dish.\r\n\r\n2.\tSeafood Fraud\r\nWhile seafood fraud is a serious issue that needs to be addressed, the numbers reported by the media are skewed. Eating locally-sourced seafood greatly reduces the risk of seafood fraud. The podcast series will address issues like seafood fraud through panel discussions reflecting the opinions of diverse stakeholders, and will educate the public about existing programs that are in place to address the issue on international, national, and state levels. \r\n\r\n3.\tThe Right Mix of Nutrition and Ease \r\nThis project will be successful if it involves experts that balance nutrition and culinary expertise with recipes that taste good, are budget-conscious, and are fairly simple and quick to prepare. SFF and the Aquarium have worked with health experts in the past, most recently in the development of our Mercury in Seafood Exhibit, which was created in partnership with Stony Brook University. We will leverage our current connections and forge new relationships with experts specializing in healthy seafood consumption. \r\n"
  competition: "The development of educational materials promoting responsible seafood options and recipes for families on the go is unique to SFF on the West Coast. The New England Aquarium in Boston, Massachusetts has worked with Chef Barton Seaver to develop recipes and materials targeting a similar audience. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, Monterey Bay Aquarium’s Seafood Watch Program is widely recognized with seafood recommendation cards distributed at businesses and organizations across the nation. Established in 1999, Seafood Watch has done amazing work to bring awareness to encourage responsible seafood consumption. Their sustainable seafood recommendations are based on stringent environmental standards for national seafood consumption.\r\n\r\nOur program’s recommendations build upon the successes of Seafood Watch, but consider the impact of the fishing industry on our local economy and the socioeconomic backgrounds of our local audiences. Including these additional factors yields results that emphasize the benefits of supporting our local seafood communities and the need to encourage the development of responsible marine aquaculture. \r\n"

    Many people do not recognize the health benefits associated with eating
    seafood, especially the nutrient-rich local seafood that is largely exported
    in favor of less healthy farmed fish and shrimp. Nor do we understand the
    environmental consequences that over-fishing, bycatch, and habitat
    degradation have on the health of our ocean. SFF's new outreach tools will
    teach Angelenos where to buy and how to cook different types of sustainable
    seafood to support better nutrition, smarter consumer choices, and a healthy
    ocean ecosystem. It will also create a forum for sharing great recipes for
    local seafood that are quick, easy, and budget-conscious. Finally, this set
    of tools will teach the general public about the fundamental health benefits
    of eating a variety of types of seafood, especially nutrient-rich, local
    fish using panelists from across the seafood and health industries. SFF has
    built a community of people that are making local, heart-healthy,
    sustainably-sourced seafood affordable and delicious, and we are ready to
    help our community reimagine its ideas about seafood.

  "Mobile Forum" is a typical box truck turned migratory research hub and
  exhibition instigator. A demonstration of advanced ideas about home and
  housing, the vehicle gives a public presence to residential design discourse,
  one with the freedom to roam, solicit, and activate the region’s communal and
  creative capital. "Mobile Forum" instigates discussion by taking design
  questions and proposals on the road, encouraging people to talk to one another
  about the future conditions of living. It issues an open invitation to
  participate in the identification of neighborhood-by-neighborhood design cases
  and it provides the opportunity to bring the inventories to those with the
  means to influence change − and vice versa.
   
   "Mobile Forum" is a combination gallery space, lecture hall, and activity center that packs up and ships out. It employs the ecological and physical footprint of the truck in cues to reconsider the desirability of the proximate, the small, and the shared. It provides the LA Forum with a flexible, opportunistic, and responsive platform for the staging of events. Loaded with an assortment of audio-visual, display, and workshop devices and equipment, the project caters to disparate deployments and facilitates interactions with groups and sites typically beyond the reach of fixed-location programming.
   
   "Mobile Forum" sets out through the initiation of a series of community workshops. After locales are selected from an open call to neighborhood groups, the truck establishes temporary outposts for designers, locals, officials, and organizations to take stock of existing conditions and to speculate about the future of LA housing. Participants act as ad hoc interdisciplinary design teams, producing examples of how domestic spaces might shape the city of 2050.
   
   The collected designs and visions created in these on-the-ground efforts form the content for the next iteration of "Mobile Forum" − a traveling gallery and advocacy vessel. The truck, retrofitted with displays of the accumulated new ideas for living, returns to the communities as a visual and spatial provocation to action.
   
   All "Mobile Forum" work will be published − as it occurs through online and social media, and in its entirety as a building manual. The documents will be used to incite local developers, governments, and sponsors to break ground on the suggestions.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  What’s the future of housing in LA? Livability, mobility, affordability. The
  LA Forum for Architecture and Urbanism believes that design is a tool that
  supports sustainable and healthy lives. Through design’s lens, learning,
  living, playing, and creating are actualized as physical environments. "Mobile
  Forum" extends the agency for the imagination of how all of these elements
  connect across the constituents, experts, and leaders for whom LA is home.
   
   Typically, the question of what constitutes the spaces in which we live is the decision of developers responding to economics and government codes. If designers are involved, it likely is at the service of those pre-determined terms. And, residents simply chose from amongst the outcomes. “Mobile Forum” reverses and mixes up this practice, asking how we might understand needs in order to impact building regulations and developer decisions. It puts designers in a bridge position, enabling them to draw out how good living and good spaces come together. It does all of this by unifying all of these unique voices, by providing a platform for dialogue between communities, residents, builders, policymakers, artists, and creatives to take shape as actionable visions.
   
   By focusing on housing, "Mobile Forum" taps into LA’s dominant source material − domestic space. Urban transformation begins with home and prepares the way for a thriving 2050. It literally gives shape to the conditions that will make LA the best place to live today and tomorrow. It shows how to maintain quality while fixing costs per square foot. It enables urban resilience by making sustainability inseparable from building practices − by revealing desirability and efficiency in reduced housing footprints, by demonstrating seamless integrations of living, working, playing, and moving, and by encouraging a valuation of these conditions. It models interdependent environments where the lines between open space, community space, and private space blur, where all of the amenities and relationships crucial to a healthy and fulfilled existence are proximate. It suggests that empowerment depends on literally building interaction into the expectations for the everyday surrounds. It holds the American dream up for review and encourages the development of an alternative ideal around which to construct the future.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  “Mobile Forum” targets residents living around new and proposed transit routes
  that are seeing or will see significant redevelopment growth and changing
  property valuation. These areas are subject to rapid reconstruction,
  displacing existing populations through eminent domain or rent inflation. The
  LA Forum project seeks to provide a sounding board for those involved in and
  impacted by the urban transformation. It aspires to produce concrete examples
  for building that innovates design inclusive of both established communities
  and of densification efforts.
   
   The LA Forum will identify ten communities along new or pending light rail corridors. “Mobile Forum” will interact with these communities in a series of information gathering and idea generating engagements that pool human resources in the planning of how to adapt. It takes advantage of the infrastructures of streets and lots to set-up a vast array of unexpected public venues. Wherever the truck parks, an event unfolds, revealing glimpses of locational potential and catalyzing the forces to realize them. Lessons learned at each stop travel from point to point, distributing insights from one community to another. The city and its citizens are encouraged to observe and shape each other in hands-on exploration.
   
   The interactive and cumulative nature of “Mobile Forum” benefits the direct participants − who learn the mechanisms for influencing the development taking place around them − and their communities − by mobilizing the agents required to alter the expectations for and outcomes of comprehensive neighborhood restructuring. It also has the potential to act as a global conversation starter, to model for the world best practices for light-touch living and to reinstate LA as the residential laboratory to envy and emulate.
   
   Peripherally, “Mobile Forum” reminds LA about the profound role of the design and construction industry, a significant part of the creative capital for which the city is known. It reinvigorates the energy and economy around literal world shaping, helping to maintain the diversity of the region’s productions and of the people drawn to be a part of the excitement of creating and making.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  The LA Forum expects three types of collaborator-partners for “Mobile Forum” −
  community groups, governing bodies, and development organizations. If awarded
  the LA2050 support, “Mobile Forum” will consist of a team of designers and
  urbanists − from the LA Forum − between eight and ten community groups and/or
  governing bodies and two development organizations. This perfect storm of
  agents for the built environment will pool resources to cultivate the
  intellectual and material content of a proposal for a new approach to living.
   
   As an example, the LA Forum has a confirmed collaboration with the City of Glendale and intended collaborations with the be.group and with Enterprise Community Partners (or similar). In this hypothetical relationship, “Mobile Forum” would work on-site in Glendale in its proactively anticipated light rail corridor. The City of Glendale would share the resources of its planning and policy offices and would provide guidance and structure to the event staging and to institutionalizing outcomes. The be.group, a local advocate of Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities and Aging in Place Initiatives, would host the workshops through the perspective and in consideration of the needs of their constituents. Enterprise Community Partners would provide the development and economic expertise and connection to fiscal enablers. And, the LA Forum would establish the framework and act as the intermediary and translator (from conversations to building proposals) for a cooperative research and design effort.
   
   “Mobile Forum” would organize similar, but circumstantially unique arrangements across the city − amassing a variety of both tailored and universal approaches to responsive development by design. Other collaborator-partners to which the LA Forum has reached out and/or with which the LA Forum has the potential of working include the City of West Hollywood, Skid Row Housing Trust, El Proyecto del Barrio, and the Housing Rights Group, to name a few. The LA Forum’s board members, all well established design and urbanism professionals, have respected histories working with an extended network of organizations appropriate to fill the collaborator-partner positions and will activate that network in order to secure involvement in “Mobile Forum.”
   
   The three factors critical to a successful “Mobile Forum” collaboration-partnership are: (1) a distributed and representative audience, (2) connection to decision-makers, and (3) promotion.
