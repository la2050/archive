  "Mobile Forum" is a typical box truck turned migratory research hub and
  exhibition instigator. A demonstration of advanced ideas about home and
  housing, the vehicle gives a public presence to residential design discourse,
  one with the freedom to roam, solicit, and activate the region’s communal and
  creative capital. "Mobile Forum" instigates discussion by taking design
  questions and proposals on the road, encouraging people to talk to one another
  about the future conditions of living. It issues an open invitation to
  participate in the identification of neighborhood-by-neighborhood design cases
  and it provides the opportunity to bring the inventories to those with the
  means to influence change − and vice versa.
   
   "Mobile Forum" is a combination gallery space, lecture hall, and activity center that packs up and ships out. It employs the ecological and physical footprint of the truck in cues to reconsider the desirability of the proximate, the small, and the shared. It provides the LA Forum with a flexible, opportunistic, and responsive platform for the staging of events. Loaded with an assortment of audio-visual, display, and workshop devices and equipment, the project caters to disparate deployments and facilitates interactions with groups and sites typically beyond the reach of fixed-location programming.
   
   "Mobile Forum" sets out through the initiation of a series of community workshops. After locales are selected from an open call to neighborhood groups, the truck establishes temporary outposts for designers, locals, officials, and organizations to take stock of existing conditions and to speculate about the future of LA housing. Participants act as ad hoc interdisciplinary design teams, producing examples of how domestic spaces might shape the city of 2050.
   
   The collected designs and visions created in these on-the-ground efforts form the content for the next iteration of "Mobile Forum" − a traveling gallery and advocacy vessel. The truck, retrofitted with displays of the accumulated new ideas for living, returns to the communities as a visual and spatial provocation to action.
   
   All "Mobile Forum" work will be published − as it occurs through online and social media, and in its entirety as a building manual. The documents will be used to incite local developers, governments, and sponsors to break ground on the suggestions.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  What’s the future of housing in LA? Livability, mobility, affordability. The
  LA Forum for Architecture and Urbanism believes that design is a tool that
  supports sustainable and healthy lives. Through design’s lens, learning,
  living, playing, and creating are actualized as physical environments. "Mobile
  Forum" extends the agency for the imagination of how all of these elements
  connect across the constituents, experts, and leaders for whom LA is home.
   
   Typically, the question of what constitutes the spaces in which we live is the decision of developers responding to economics and government codes. If designers are involved, it likely is at the service of those pre-determined terms. And, residents simply chose from amongst the outcomes. “Mobile Forum” reverses and mixes up this practice, asking how we might understand needs in order to impact building regulations and developer decisions. It puts designers in a bridge position, enabling them to draw out how good living and good spaces come together. It does all of this by unifying all of these unique voices, by providing a platform for dialogue between communities, residents, builders, policymakers, artists, and creatives to take shape as actionable visions.
   
   By focusing on housing, "Mobile Forum" taps into LA’s dominant source material − domestic space. Urban transformation begins with home and prepares the way for a thriving 2050. It literally gives shape to the conditions that will make LA the best place to live today and tomorrow. It shows how to maintain quality while fixing costs per square foot. It enables urban resilience by making sustainability inseparable from building practices − by revealing desirability and efficiency in reduced housing footprints, by demonstrating seamless integrations of living, working, playing, and moving, and by encouraging a valuation of these conditions. It models interdependent environments where the lines between open space, community space, and private space blur, where all of the amenities and relationships crucial to a healthy and fulfilled existence are proximate. It suggests that empowerment depends on literally building interaction into the expectations for the everyday surrounds. It holds the American dream up for review and encourages the development of an alternative ideal around which to construct the future.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  “Mobile Forum” targets residents living around new and proposed transit routes
  that are seeing or will see significant redevelopment growth and changing
  property valuation. These areas are subject to rapid reconstruction,
  displacing existing populations through eminent domain or rent inflation. The
  LA Forum project seeks to provide a sounding board for those involved in and
  impacted by the urban transformation. It aspires to produce concrete examples
  for building that innovates design inclusive of both established communities
  and of densification efforts.
   
   The LA Forum will identify ten communities along new or pending light rail corridors. “Mobile Forum” will interact with these communities in a series of information gathering and idea generating engagements that pool human resources in the planning of how to adapt. It takes advantage of the infrastructures of streets and lots to set-up a vast array of unexpected public venues. Wherever the truck parks, an event unfolds, revealing glimpses of locational potential and catalyzing the forces to realize them. Lessons learned at each stop travel from point to point, distributing insights from one community to another. The city and its citizens are encouraged to observe and shape each other in hands-on exploration.
   
   The interactive and cumulative nature of “Mobile Forum” benefits the direct participants − who learn the mechanisms for influencing the development taking place around them − and their communities − by mobilizing the agents required to alter the expectations for and outcomes of comprehensive neighborhood restructuring. It also has the potential to act as a global conversation starter, to model for the world best practices for light-touch living and to reinstate LA as the residential laboratory to envy and emulate.
   
   Peripherally, “Mobile Forum” reminds LA about the profound role of the design and construction industry, a significant part of the creative capital for which the city is known. It reinvigorates the energy and economy around literal world shaping, helping to maintain the diversity of the region’s productions and of the people drawn to be a part of the excitement of creating and making.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  The LA Forum expects three types of collaborator-partners for “Mobile Forum” −
  community groups, governing bodies, and development organizations. If awarded
  the LA2050 support, “Mobile Forum” will consist of a team of designers and
  urbanists − from the LA Forum − between eight and ten community groups and/or
  governing bodies and two development organizations. This perfect storm of
  agents for the built environment will pool resources to cultivate the
  intellectual and material content of a proposal for a new approach to living.
   
   As an example, the LA Forum has a confirmed collaboration with the City of Glendale and intended collaborations with the be.group and with Enterprise Community Partners (or similar). In this hypothetical relationship, “Mobile Forum” would work on-site in Glendale in its proactively anticipated light rail corridor. The City of Glendale would share the resources of its planning and policy offices and would provide guidance and structure to the event staging and to institutionalizing outcomes. The be.group, a local advocate of Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities and Aging in Place Initiatives, would host the workshops through the perspective and in consideration of the needs of their constituents. Enterprise Community Partners would provide the development and economic expertise and connection to fiscal enablers. And, the LA Forum would establish the framework and act as the intermediary and translator (from conversations to building proposals) for a cooperative research and design effort.
   
   “Mobile Forum” would organize similar, but circumstantially unique arrangements across the city − amassing a variety of both tailored and universal approaches to responsive development by design. Other collaborator-partners to which the LA Forum has reached out and/or with which the LA Forum has the potential of working include the City of West Hollywood, Skid Row Housing Trust, El Proyecto del Barrio, and the Housing Rights Group, to name a few. The LA Forum’s board members, all well established design and urbanism professionals, have respected histories working with an extended network of organizations appropriate to fill the collaborator-partner positions and will activate that network in order to secure involvement in “Mobile Forum.”
   
   The three factors critical to a successful “Mobile Forum” collaboration-partnership are: (1) a distributed and representative audience, (2) connection to decision-makers, and (3) promotion.
