Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  FLY will send our Creator/ Director, Haley Dawn, to lead large staff trainings
  for LA's BEST Enrichment Program staff. We will send teaching artists to
  various schools to work closely on site, providing ongoing lesson plans,
  exercises, student progress charts, and classroom management support
  throughout the 2014-2015 school year. 
   
   We will create surveys & communication plans that monitor each staff member's understanding and ability to implement lessons in an authentic way, and by the end of the year hope to be able to certify many LA’s BEST staff in the FLY Methods. Staff will bring these creative tools to their endeavors beyond their time with LA’s BEST, reaching more with their efforts in creative play and arts education.
   
   Finally, to keep true to its vision and spirit, FLY will create video/ audio recordings that will aid in introducing and leading exercises. In addition, FLY will provide curriculum materials (lesson plans, intentions, teacher handbooks, and student worksheets), as well as classroom materials and equipment for LA's BEST Schools to run our program for a full calendar year.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  FLY will introduce thousands of young people and educators to the joys of
  Artistic Play! In doing so, we will bring Arts Education to low income
  communities, empower students to academic success, increase attendance in
  after school programs, and plant seeds of healthy living.
   
   Our LA schools are in crisis. The impact of strict testing and low budgets is generally one of low morale and low self-confidence among students and staff. 
   
   The quick fix both in schools and at home is to "plug in" the kids to their iGadgets. We have all seen the socio- emotional consequences and lack of civility that is a result of too little human connection, too little creativity and too little self-understanding. While new technology is amazing for efficiency and entertainment, these tools rarely engage our physical bodies and creative minds: the main instruments for experiential learning. 
   
   FLY has seen the vast benefits of bringing balance through Arts education to every social and economic community. Through FLY, teachers take kids out of their seats, out of the box and into their bodies. Our innovative training establishes community, enhances healthy self- image and communication, trains the right brain, improves focus, and keeps kids excited to come to school each day. With students inspired to learn through Artistic Play, our after school numbers will grow, attendance can improve, and progress can skyrocket.
   
   Our New York program saw a 40% increase in students coming to after school programs at our partner schools in just this past calendar year, and students have often said that these classes are "the reason why we come to school."
   
   FLY's unique teacher training offers a complete skill set that brings kids into physical, social, and emotional engagement while threading in the lessons of the day. Our Arts framework guides teachers and students toward critical thinking, teamwork, expression and compassionate communication. Additionally, we give tools for classroom management and engagement, as well as breathing exercises and attention- training games that help kids to stay focused and excited about the task at hand. 
   
   FLY is committed to instilling a genuine love for teaching and learning that only can be illuminated by a program that highlights the personal gifts of each and every participant. If we truly encourage our youth to learn to play, and play to learn, we will blaze a trail for the next generation to be healthier, happier and more innovative by 2050!
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Our project’s main beneficiary will be the LA’s BEST Staff for whom we provide
  close training, mentorship, and development. We hope to give much of this
  young team, drawn directly from lower income neighborhoods and schools,
  innovative and wellness-centered skills that they have rarely been exposed to.
  These tools of creativity, on-your- feet learning, and mindfulness will
  encourage them toward personal happiness and wellness, as well as offer them
  teaching practices that can carry them into successful relationships,
  educational endeavors, and careers, with FLY, LA’s BEST and beyond.
   
   Second, as FLY's Teaching Artists land at each school, they will directly affect and nurture the LA’s BEST Supervisors and Staff with extra support needed to increase Arts education in LA schools. FLY will provide essential materials and classroom tools for the organization that will benefit the program as a whole.
   
   Finally, FLY will benefit the LAUSD students. Under well trained staff guidance, they will experience creative play and arts education at its best! Kids will not only learn to express, create and collaborate through their creative playtime, but will gain the health benefits of our movement curriculum’s physical fitness and energetic wellness. They will also be exposed to priceless self-awareness, communication, and life skills that will grow them into curious, compassionate, and innovative citizens.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  FLY is collaborating with LA’s BESTt Enrichment Program. Beginning this past
  April, we have developed a relationship with LA’s BEST FIT as well as LA’s
  BEST ARTS in order to bring new and innovative Yoga training and Performing &
  Visual Arts instruction skills to their team. We have also provided lesson
  outlines, and curriculum breakdowns that easily bring our FLY classes and
  methodology to their students. 
   
   We have continued our communication and are working to schedule initial trainings and a handful of school partnerships beginning in August. If awarded, we will be able to provide much more in depth training, ongoing classroom time, and give tools to more of the LA’s BEST programs- providing nearly 200 LAUSD Elementary Schools with a more qualified staff, and potentially exposing thousands more after school kids to artistic education!
   
   The critical factors that will make this collaboration successful, will be: 
   
   1. Our ability to meet with and train the LA’s BEST staff at least three times over the year: one initial training, an in classroom follow up, and an end of year follow up workshop.
   
   2. Access and commitment from the LA’s BEST staff to implement our tools and practices, including lesson plans, audio, video and funsheets into their Enrichment programming.
   
   3. LA's BEST's assistance in measuring our goals through surveys, student and staff testimonials, and on site observations throughout the school year.
