  We uphold that more connected people are more likely to manage crises and move
  out of poverty. In LIFT-LA’s Care. Connect. Change. Project, low-income
  Angelenos map to jobs, a safe home, and a better future for their families by
  partnering with volunteer Advocates-- trained problem-solvers who work with
  Members to set and achieve goals. Using our innovative feedback tool,
  Constituent Voice, we can show that by strengthening all three aspects of
  members’ multi-dimensional well-being (personal, social, and financial
  foundations), people are more likely to achieve greater sustained economic
  mobility and stability. Results will influence other LA social service
  organizations to adopt a more human-centered approach to addressing poverty.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Care: Our approach is driven by a network of volunteer advocates who work to
  help people who often lack the resources and networks of support they need to
  overcome crises and get ahead.
   • Recruit and train a diverse body of 50 advocates serving at least 8 hours/wk on advocacy skills, important and relevant social issues and knowledge of community resources
   • Train volunteer advisors-- professionals who possess valuable financial, legal, and therapeutic expertise, to act as on-call coaches and experts for our advocates 
   • Train former members who have reached their goals to become LIFT advocates –powerful beacons of hope and resiliency 
   • Recognize our volunteer commitment and impact with Appreciation Days 
   • Engage advocate alumni, the best “evangeLIFTs,” to remain involved after their time of service 
   
   Connect: Members build stronger personal, social, and financial foundations that help to lift them out of poverty 
   • Members and advocates build a relationship that is member-led, goal-oriented, strengths-based, and rooted in dignity and respect 
   • Together, members and advocates partner to make progress on goals in housing, education, and/or employment and work to strengthen community connections, supportive relationships, and positive role models 
   • Our online database, Link, helps advocates connect to community resources that meet members’ needs and track progress against goals.The 2nd annual Imaginate! Member Appreciation Day will honor and celebrate community (Imaginate! attracts another 100 volunteer advocates)
   
   Change: We show that designing solutions around what members tell us they need is a powerful way to achieve results
   • Evaluate member feedback through Constituent Voice (CV), using tested customer relationship techniques used in the corporate world, adapted to the context of economic development (where people’s choice is often limited by the predominance of aid agencies and traditional service providers).
   • Members to fill out short online surveys to give feedback on the emotional and social aspects of our model; LIFT collects and analyzes the responses, triangulating economic progress against goals
   • Change the way we design and implement our program to improve performance and more effectively drive better results for our members
   • Share results and program adjustments with other LIFT stakeholders and communicate impact to influence other nonprofits in the area to become more accountable to the people they serve
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Because it’s hard for anyone to find the right tools when navigating a complex
  system on their own, each of our members is paired with an advocate who sticks
  with them as they build the skills and access the resources needed to achieve
  economic stability. Advocates become the social network for disenfranchised
  Angelenos, providing one-on-one support and helping them connect to their
  community. The advocate engages the member in a goal-setting process to chart
  their own path to stability, based on immediate needs (e.g. shelter, food) and
  long-term aspirations (e.g. employment, affordable housing). During the
  process, they help build members’ confidence, connect to resources and support
  networks, and navigate to self-determined success.
   
   LIFT-LA is also training the next generation of leaders and citizen innovators—sending our alumni advocates into civic life with a changed perception of those living in poverty, and a lifelong commitment to social justice. No matter what field a volunteer advocate decides to move on to, their time with LIFT will forever affect their understanding of poverty and the power of community service.
   
   A sense of belonging extends beyond knowledge of community resources. It’s about knowing your voice is valued. In addition to civic engagement in meaningful service, we will also use CV to solicit member feedback and establish the correlation between personal and social foundations and economic stability. CV quantifies the importance of emotional and social supports by asking members to rate factors like: the member-advocate partnership, the tools and support advocates provide, having a role model in the community, and connections to community resources in helping members achieve their goals. 
   
   We believe that if we left prejudgement at the door and reached out to help our neighbor more often, LA would be a very different place. Poor people deserve the same supports that we all need to thrive—people in our corner, self-efficacy, and access to resources. However, systems designed to aid the most vulnerable populations are fragmented, wrought in bureaucracy, and based on false perceptions of the poor. This dichotomy is a contributing factor to LA being one of the poorest yet richest counties in the county. LIFT’s deployment of CV will serve as a cutting-edge model for other human service agencies in LA, helping them reach a new standard of service informed by member feedback that helps Angelenos better connect with their community.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: |-
  LIFT Members:
   One in four Angelenos lives in poverty. In the area surrounding LIFT-LA’s office, the poverty rate is even higher – with 35% of people living below the poverty line. The south LA neighborhood where LIFT-LA is located is also characterized by a 17% unemployment rate (higher than unemployment in LA, California, and the US), substandard housing, and low educational attainment. While the majority of LIFT’s member base comes from this area, LIFT-LA receives members from around the county, reflecting the following demographics: 72% unemployed, 31% homeless or in unstable housing, 46% do not have health insurance, and 41% make less than $500 per month. Many come to LIFT after they have experienced a "shaky ground" moment -- a layoff, illness, eviction. Some were employed for 10 years and lost a job, others fell behind on paying rent. Poverty is a multi-faceted problem and all of its associated issues—unemployment, homelessness, hunger, illiteracy, health problems—are interlinked. 
   
   LIFT welcomes over 1,000 members each year wherever they are on the path to stability, and fills the gap in the social service system by offering individualized support and serving those who do not meet eligibility requirements of other agencies. LIFT members set goals (often within employment, housing, income stabilization, childcare, education) and work with an advocate to take the steps needed to achieve them.
   
   LIFT Volunteer Advocates:
   The majority of our volunteers are college students (from USC, CSUN, Azusa Pacific, College of Mt. St. Mary’s, CalState LA and others) while other volunteers are LA residents with the passion and time to offer. Advocates commit to serving at least 8 hours/week during their engagement, but many serve as many as 20 hours/week. Most LIFT of these advocates are bilingual able to provide services in Spanish to our majority monolingual population. LIFT also engages specialists and community leaders, such as former LIFT members who have achieved their goals, retirees, corporate professionals, veterans, to serve as advisors to advocates at LIFT’s site. 
   
   LIFT-LA stakeholders (advisors) who want to serve but are unable to make the 8-hour minimum commitment, facilitate one-hour specialized group workshops for LIFT members. For instance, in Beyond the Bank, LIFT-LA’s financial literacy workshop series, professionals serve as volunteer instructors alongside Economics students in USC’s Joint Education Program (USC service learning initiative).
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  As one of LIFT’s seminal values is collaboration, an essential part of our
  model is creating reciprocal partnerships with strong social service
  organizations to provide comprehensive member service. We are embedded in the
  LA social service community and often referred to as the “safety net for the
  safety net” by grateful community partners who cannot serve families (due to
  eligibility restrictions) or provide the individualized support LIFT offers.
  LIFT connects members to its base of trusted community partners throughout LA.
  Confirmed collaborators include:
   
   • The Magnolia Place Community Initiative (MCI) unites 75+ organizations in an effort to create scalable community improvement. As many of the organizations in the MCI are focused on supporting children, LIFT fills the gap with a dual-generation approach to poverty alleviation helping parents work towards achieving financial stability to support their family unit. LIFT-LA is truly the partner that MCI has been waiting for— the connective tissue mobilizing the effectiveness and efficiency of the network, and making sure that community members understand, access, and utilize the resources available to them. LIFT-LA will be working with MCI to track these warm hand offs made to other partner agencies.
   
   • Alliance for Children Rights, SAJE, Connect LA, EARN, REDF, 211, Communities in Schools, Pathways for Children, the Rightway Foundation, and HeadStart are additional confirmed partners. All are doing meaningful specialized work within limited service areas. With its nimble approach, LIFT-LA is able to increase the capacity of the social service sector to provide more customized and comprehensive support.
   
   • Colleges and Universities throughout LA. USC awarded LIFT-LA for our partnership in community engagement. 
   
   • Capital Group Companies employees volunteer as Advisors and financial experts with LIFT-LA’s Beyond the Bank workshop series.
   
   • Keystone Accountability works with LIFT to develop and test a system to collect continuous client and volunteer feedback. Keystone is an expert in gathering, analyzing, and amplifying client voices in order to foster a culture of accountability. Keystone’s founder and CEO, David Bonbright, worked with LIFT over the last year to design CV, and will continue working closely with LIFT’s Executive and Program Team to effectively implement CV in LA. We are excited about this partnership and its potential to ensure our responsiveness to the needs of our members in LA.
