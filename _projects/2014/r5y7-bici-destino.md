Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Working with RAC Design Build we are about to what space is available. The
  custom RV is to be built with local Frogtown business ‘The Happier Camper.’
  Beyond being a fantastic neighborhood business, they are at the bleeding edge
  of creating the most sustainable recreational vehicles anywhere in the world.
  Ultralight modern materials, crafted in Los Angeles, mean that there is no
  need for a large truck to transport the trailer, eliminating huge vehicle and
  fuel costs. Propane tanks are being replaced by solar powered generators. This
  allows R5Y7: bici destino to operate completely off the power grid without
  purchasing - or consuming - environmentally damaging fuels. Lights, sound and
  computers will all work like any other modern space. The usually heavy tasks
  of hitching the trailer, installation, maintenance and hauling are light and
  easy enough for usually timid women to handle confidently. We will not need
  power, water or sewer hook ups making the cost of getting started and
  operating significantly lower. Our neighbors have offered to be the go-to
  restroom for any volunteers/staff. For any parties or larger events,
  port-a-potties would need to be temporarily installed. 
   
   At closed hours a permanent bike repair stand would remain available to anyone along the bike path, further increasing our ability to help act as a vital resource beyond the limits of open hours. 
   
   Getting the trailer customized to be able to display art, educational materials and bike products will be the longest and most complicated part of becoming fully operational in the community. Alongside the trailer rental bikes are lined up next to the repair stand and storage shed. Attention to design and aesthetics go into everything, including placement of all materials reinforce our idea of the installation as a creative urban retreat. R5Y7: bici destination - for cyclists, artists and LA river lovers. By evoking a retro camping aesthetic the cost of creating a beautiful installation is far less and the sense of relaxation and oasis is enhanced. We take our inspiration from classic American summer camps, with outdoor hanging lights to signify a special event, access to untamed nature as a way to recharge and a judgement free space to learn, create, explore and experiment. 
   As we begin work we can actively survey local residents, businesses and people along the bike path. This will influence our priorities and focus in scheduling workshops and other outreach in the coming year.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Bicycles & Art make life better. R5Y7: bici destino provides the on the ground
  logistical support to get communities living and moving together, while
  encouraging individual creativity and ambition. Facilitating a ‘car free’ or
  ‘car lite’ lifestyle means that individuals have more money and time to
  develop ideas and relationships.
   
   In using an environmentally advanced mobile trailer customized to inspire fun and imagination, we not only facilitate increasing use of the bike path and surrounding area; but pave the way for other creative endeavors to become possible using the same low-cost/highly creative approach to rapid concept development. We will be the first to use this specific combination of an ultralight mobile structure that is fully solar powered and capable of performing all the rugged tasks of mechanical support while also evoking the playful spirit of a vintage travel trailer.
   
   It is possible that such a project might become so successful, that it moves or expands to other neighborhoods; providing the same active transportation support and creative ‘placemaking’ that is rapidly becoming one of the most effective tools in developing healthy, people-first urban development. Regardless of how the trailer, or the concept of R5Y7: bici destino develops, the positive impact of increasing LA River path usage, active transit, education and recreation will resonate with lasting results.
   
   By providing a strong creative vision that empowers other female entrepreneurs and young people interested in bicycles, art or urban development – we cannot yet imagine the ideas and incomes that naturally happen when other people see what is possible!
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Major beneficiary group: Residents and businesses located in ‘Frogtown’
  neighborhood of central/east LA along the LA River.
   
   Secondary beneficiary group: Cyclists and pedestrians from other areas of Los Angeles utilizing the LA River path for recreation or transit.
   Additional beneficiary groups: visitors and individuals discovering the project via press coverage, online media and word of mouth.
