Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  We are working within three start-up phases. Phase 1 consists of holding
  pop-up adventure playgrounds in the Santa Clarita Valley for awareness
  building of self-directed play, connecting with the community, finding
  partners who support our mission, marketing our initiative, and to purchase
  property for a future permanent adventure playground and play education site. 
   
   Since March of 2014 we have been holding pop-ups on a regular basis in the Santa Clarita Valley in partnership with the City of Santa Clarita, The Art Tree, and Pop-up Adventure Play’s U.S. tour. The pop-ups usually consist of; 2 to 3 devoted playworkers, a small space, loads of boxes, string, fabric, used or recycled materials and a few hours allowing all who come by to make, create, and invent. 
   
   In February 2014 Jeremiah Dockray and Erica Larsen, founders of SCV Adventure Play, purchased a nearly 2 acre, 30 year abandoned, park in Val Verde, CA as the future site of “Eureka Villa” a permanent adventure play space and hopeful hub of study and education in the movement to offer non-product based activity for children and adults alike. 
   
   We are now entering phase 2 which is devoted to developing the park and expanding the pop-ups within and beyond Santa Clarita Valley. Regarding the park, we are researching and quoting various improvements for it to be made available for the public. This includes arborist assessments on the nearly 30 various types of trees on the property, re-fencing the parameter, brush clearance, and hopefully water setup and power accessibility. Once this cleanup is done, we will hold a soft opening of the Adventure Playground. For the Pop-ups, this includes the purchase of a “Pop-up Truck”, a box truck to be used as storage and transportation (currently all materials are stored in the founder’s garage and is loaded and unloaded into their cars for each pop-up). 
   
   Phase 3 is to formalize the park and launch a playwork program. In this phase, our goal is to develop the space as a community, build bathroom facilities on the property, begin an educational program specializing in playworking, and open fully to the public as an adventure playground and gathering space. We were advised by the Pop-up Adventure Play group and Grant Lambie, a play space developer, to keep our evolution organic and allow the community to develop the space as much as possible which means this phase is largely determined by the community surrounding and engaging with the space.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Both children and adults today suffer from a severe lack of play, access to
  nature, measured risk, and free space both geographically and mentally. Many
  studies show how a lack of play can cause obesity, depression, and stunted
  social skills. Playgrounds and parks today only partially fill these needs, as
  they are often geared only toward gross motor play(swings, slides, or monkey
  bars), or structured play (baseball, soccer, etc.) These things are not
  allowing (young) people to fully explore their environment on their own terms,
  and at their own speed. Our lives are commonly scheduled from dawn until dusk
  leaving free time to play absent.
   
   What we can do to make LA the best place to play is provide a space and materials where people can actually engage in play that stretches their abilities, gives them exercise, challenges their problem-solving skills, and encourages socialization. One of the best things about adventure play is that it is ever evolving to the needs of the participants, as projects are created and destroyed, as materials come and go within the landscape, and interests and focus change. Our playwork education program will continually support free play and its benefits by outfitting others with the ability to facilitate more free-play events in numerous communities and homes in L.A. County with the goal of improving the quality of life through play for all. 
   
   In addition, our outreach for play will continue to look for places where we can help facilitate and expand play opportunities in LA County. Our philosophy is that play is a human right, a social issue rather than only a parenting one.
   
   Our Adventure Playground will be aimed at providing to our immediate community (A small working class community) as well as outside groups and schools, and as a place to do play-related research with educators and play advocates across the county, state and nation.
   
   In the future, the upcoming Newhall Ranch housing expansion will be creeping up toward our space (off the 126 freeway toward Ventura), allowing a place for new occupants to grow into, as well as our commitment to cultivating the careers of future playworkers, who would be employed at the Adventure Playground to facilitate play and safety. We hope that this combined with our continued outreach will allow for similar spaces to be developed around LA County.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Overall, this project will benefit not only kids and adults but specifically
  kids on the spectrum, senior citizens, disabled children, and those who have
  limited to no access to nature and wild outdoor space. 
   
   Phase 1-3: Neighborhood kids and families around the Santa Clarita Valley- Kids and families will benefit from additional space to meet in the community and play freely without restriction. Our goal is to have the playground open and staffed in any instance it would be needed; after school, weekends, and holidays for any kids in the area. It will also create jobs for those hired as playworkers, play educators, and maintenance crews (if needed). This will be in addition to our pop-up events and outreach, which will continue to travel to where play is needed. Our outreach is looking to expand into schools, apartment complexes, nature events, and parks that can accommodate our free pop-up events. 
   
   Phase 2-3: Northern Los Angeles County with the potential of entire county. We hope that in time there will be others from outside our immediate community that will come by to see what adventure play can be and take back ideas to their own neighborhoods. Our hope is that we can be a destination for field trips, school projects, parties, and educators interested in free play concepts. With that, we want to work on chartering buses to bring individuals to us. We also hope to have events that will include curious adults that want to learn things like woodworking or structure building, and give them a space to learn and share skills that can enhance their well-being, as well as an inter-generational opportunity for both young and old.
   
   Phase 2-3: Los Angeles County and beyond. We also hope to contribute to the growing network of Adventure Playgrounds that are currently resurging in the USA, and bring an advocacy for play to a policy level. A place where people can be guaranteed play possibilities in school and neighborhood, and a network of spaces across the country that can consult, experiment, and share experiences with each other.
