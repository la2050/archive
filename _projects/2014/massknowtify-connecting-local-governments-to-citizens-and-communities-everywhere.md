    MassKnowtify is dedicated to making communications between government and
    citizens more accessible, valuable, and effective.  MassKnowtify solves
    distinct problems for both citizens and local governments: citizens can be
    connected to important localized information wherever they travel; local
    governments can increase citizen communication and engagement in a more
    direct and cost-effective manner.  To achieve this, MassKnowtify provides a
    location-based public alerting platform to disseminate a variety of public
    alerts and notifications that are timely, accurate, and relevant to one’s
    specific location.  MassKnowtify functions primarily as a mobile application
    but can also be accessed through the web from anywhere on any device.
  implement: "MassKnowtify is currently in a limited release in Los Angeles and we have already partnered with local agencies to bring them on board.  Our current web app is fully functional and accessible on all devices (smartphones, tablets, desktop browsers); however, our next milestone in our roadmap is to launch “native” apps for both iOS and Android operating systems to deliver better performance and reliability.  Most importantly, access and use of MassKnowtify by citizens is completely FREE.  \r\n\r\nIn order to offer MassKnowtify to all public agencies in the entire region, we will implement the following initiatives:\r\n\r\nPlatform development and enhancements\t\t\t\r\n•\tConvert our current web app to native mobile apps for iPhone and Android\r\n•\tCreate an application programming interface (API) to integrate MassKnowtify alerts on city websites and other digital distribution channels\r\n•\tEnhance MassKnowtify’s message analytics capability for public agencies to better assess the effectiveness of their messaging\r\n\r\nLocal government access and usage, and support for training and onboarding\r\n•\tProvide access and use of MassKnowtify to all local governments in the greater LA region\r\n•\tProvide account setup and training for new local agency users\r\n\r\nCitizen and community outreach\t\t\t\t\r\n•\tHost community forums and events, and partner with neighborhood and community based organizations, to drive citizen awareness and usage of MassKnowtify\r\n•\tConduct a variety of outreach efforts to acquire public agencies \r\n"
  impact_connect: "There are 88 separate municipalities in Los Angeles County, each responsible for providing individual city services (police, fire, public works, etc.) through individual agencies within the municipality.  For example, as one drives along Santa Monica Boulevard through West Los Angeles, one will have traveled through the cities of Santa Monica, Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, and West Hollywood all in under 7 miles.   These circumstances make it difficult for a citizen to know which city agencies are responsible for emergency notifications and other essential city services.  There are several other large clusters of cities throughout LA County—such as in the South Bay, San Gabriel Valley, and Southeast Los Angeles—with identical circumstances which present challenges for citizens to be connected to timely and geographically relevant information.\r\n\r\nLooking into the future toward the year 2050, MassKnowtify can provide the basis for greater connectedness and trust in our local governments.  In the wake of the recession, local governments everywhere are experiencing greater pressures to provide services in a more sustainable and cost-effective manner.  In addition, civic engagement is important to the success and vibrancy of our communities which are in tremendous need of innovative solutions to drive greater civic engagement.  By providing a platform to connect local governments to citizens, wherever they may be located, civic engagement can be dramatically increased in many new ways over the long run.  Future extensions of MassKnowtify may include crowd-sourced information and alerts, and greater contextualized notification for various types of local information.\r\n\r\nBuilding upon the 2014 Grant Challenge goals using results of the February 2013 Grants Challenge and My LA2050 Report, MassKnowtify addresses Public Safety as a priority focus area, which  was the area with the least number of submissions in the February 2013 Grants Challenge.  MassKnowtify also addresses cross-indicator trends from the LA2050 Report by addressing Technology to leverage new technology to build LA’s future and a new way of connecting to local government, and addressing Design & Innovation by applying technology and design to deliver a product and service benefitting all in Los Angeles.  Finally, MassKnowtify increases and enhances Social Connectedness by making citizens more connected to their local governments–where they live, work, and spend their free time–in a dramatically new way.\r\n"
  who_benefit: "MassKnowtify is a platform designed to benefit everyone in Los Angeles—residents, visitors, business owners, tourists—by connecting them to local government information that is timely and relevant to their specific location.  Our platform is connecting citizens to government alerts and notifications that are categorized into three contexts: Emergencies, Quality of Life, and Community Services.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency context includes emergency events, natural disasters, and police and fire activity.  The agency users include police, fire, and emergency management agencies.  A key differentiator for MassKnowtify is that other systems are tailored only to the “local” population—the population of residents who have opted in to the system using a fixed address.  MassKnowtify, however, provides notification ability to both the local and “visitor” populations.  The visitor population consists of citizens who have not pre-registered for their local system, which may be for a variety of reasons including: lack of awareness of system, registration is viewed as too cumbersome, they live and work in different cities, or they are visitors from out of town.\r\n\r\nThe Quality of Life context includes street closures, construction activity, power outages, traffic incidents, and public transit delays.  Certain available tools attempt to address this segment but since they are primarily focused on serving the Emergencies segment, they do not emphasize “non-emergency” communications because of the risk of oversaturating messaging and alienating citizens who have subscribed for the system.  MassKnowtify allows each citizen user to custom select the types and frequency of messages to receive, and whether to receive them as a push notification, or by simply accessing the MassKnowtify system on demand.\r\n\r\nThe Community Services context is also an underserved segment of targeting citizens with timely and relevant information.   In talking directly with local agencies, this context is very important to reach constituents that seek out or need their services.  Examples include public events, recreation programs, tourism information, and public outreach campaigns.\r\n\r\nInterest in MassKnowtify shown specifically from YOU through the LA2050 Grants Challenge will help fuel adoption by local governments throughout Los Angeles.  Help us dramatically improve how governments connect to citizens with information that’s timely and relevant to them!"
  collaboration: "We view each and every local government in the greater LA region as a partner with MassKnowtify.  While we already have several local partners which have expressed interest in using and leveraging MassKnowtify in their public communications efforts, we are not identifying any specific partners in the context of this grant application to order to ensure maximum, yet equitable, opportunity for local governments to partner with MassKnowtify in our efforts going forward.\r\n\r\nWe have also assembled a group of key advisors that include former public safety officials and public communications experts, and we will continue to rely on our network of partner agencies and advisors to enable MassKnowtify to serve the needs of all Los Angeles residents.  \r\n\r\nTo better connect with citizens and communities throughout Los Angeles, we will rely on networking with a broad spectrum of groups, including community based organizations, neighborhood councils and associations, local elected officials, and other civic technology providers.\r\n"

  two_lessons: "We’ve conducted extensive research on how local governments connect with their citizens, and the gaps that limit effective citizen communication and engagement.  We’ve discovered two key lessons from our work:  1) local governments have a difficult time connecting directly with significant portions of their constituencies, and 2) citizens are increasingly demanding more accessible and effective ways to receive information from local governments that impacts their daily quality of life.\r\n\r\nFirst, we’ve discovered that local governments have a difficult time connecting directly with significant portions of their constituencies.  The most significant portion is the “daily visitor” population, which we define as people who live and work in different municipal (city) jurisdictions.  According to the US Census Bureau, 60% of the entire population in LA County is a daily visitor to another city.  Despite this significant percentage, there are no tools available to local governments to quickly and effectively target the daily visitor population, or any of their other constituents, while they’re on the go. \r\n\r\nSecond, we’ve conducted extensive market research on the demand for this type of platform from citizens and communities.  Our survey data clearly shows that gaps that exist and what citizens demand.  For example, we asked the following questions to over 100 citizens:\r\n\r\n“How would you rate your city’s ability to communicate directly to you?”\r\nResponses:  Poor – 40%, Fair – 38%, Good – 21%, Excellent – 2%.\r\n\r\n“In the event of In the event of an emergency or disaster, how confident are you in your local city's ability to quickly notify you of important information?”\r\nResponses:  Much Lower Confidence – 10%, Slightly Lower Confidence – 13%, Some Confidence – 47%, Higher Confidence – 23%, Much Higher Confidence – 7%.\r\n\r\nThe responses to these two questions indicate that local governments are not adequately equipped to be communicating directly and when it matters most, during an emergency.\r\n\r\nFurther, these same survey respondents were presented with an overview of MassKnowtify, and were asked to identify on a five-point scale their likelihood of using MassKnowtify as a smartphone app.  According to the scale (1= Very Unlikely, 2=Unlikely, 3=Undecided, 4=Likely, 5=Very Likely), the average response was 4.3 which indicates strong demand for this type of platform. "
  achievable_goal: "Our team has performed extensive research on the needs of local government agencies in their public information and communications efforts.  We have successfully translated this research into the development of the MassKnowtify platform to create what is currently available to local governments and citizens.\r\n\r\nNow, we are no longer in the pilot and development stage, and the service is available to a limited beta group in Los Angeles.  MassKnowtify has received notable recognition in just the past few months with awards and honors from UCLA, Amazon Web Services, and Accela Software.\r\n\r\nThe LA2050 Grant Challenge will add to significant momentum to our effort.  This funding will substantially grow and enhance what we’ve already built, and will provide for continued growth as we expand to all areas of Los Angeles and acquire both local government users and citizen users.  \r\n\r\nPresently, MassKnowtify’s platform development has reached the following milestones:\r\n\r\n•\tJune 2013:  Completed market research with citizen users and public agency users demonstrating the demand for the MassKnowtify platform\r\n•\tSeptember 2013:  Completed our version 1.0 product which includes separate interfaces for public agency users and citizen users\r\n•\tJanuary 2014:  Established a test group of local government partners\r\n•\tMay 2014:  Won 1st Place at UCLA’s Entrepreneur Venture Competition\r\n•\tJune 2014:  Named Finalist at Amazon Web Services’ City on a Cloud Innovation Challenge, a global competition for apps that solve local government challenges\r\n•\tJuly 2014: Won 3rd Place at Accela Software’s App Challenge, a global competition for apps that open up government data for citizens and enable citizens and businesses to connect with local governments\r\n•\tJuly 2014:  Completed our version 2.0 product which incorporates the feedback received from our test group\r\n\r\nOur upcoming milestones are the following:\r\n\r\n•\tFall 2014:  Begin acquiring live content (alerts and notifications) from agency test users\r\n•\tFall 2014:  Launch iPhone App v1 on Apple App Store\r\n•\tFall 2014:  Begin outreach campaigns targeting local governments in limited areas in Los Angeles\r\n•\tWinter 2015:  Begin wider outreach campaign for all of Los Angeles area\r\n•\tWinter 2015:  Launch Android App v1 on Google Play\r\n•\tSpring 2015:  Target date to acquire all 88 cities in LA County as MassKnowtify users\r\n"
  major_challenges: "Challenge 1:  Acquiring two distinct sets of users – citizens and local government agencies.\r\n•\tStrategy:  MassKnowtify is connecting to two distinct groups of users: citizens and local government agencies.  In order to successfully grow these user groups simultaneously, we will focus on building partnerships with smaller areas to create a more complete offering of notifications from all public agencies in a given area.  Examples of these clusters of cities include: the Westside, South Bay, Southeast Los Angeles, and San Gabriel Valley.  We will work with cities on an individual basis to focus on the specific message categories and use cases that can best be addressed with MassKnowtify. \r\n\r\nChallenge 2:  Continuing product enhancements while scaling and reaching new users.\r\n•\tStrategy:  MassKnowtify is built upon the most advanced and most secure server infrastructure available in the market through Amazon Web Services.  The ability to scale our service effectively is critical to our success, so we’ve placed a high priority on system reliability and security.  With the necessary infrastructure in place, our goal is to offer an enhanced user interface and native iOS/Android apps to achieve wider distribution of MassKnowtify.  Funding awarded through this grant opportunity will enable MassKnowtify to scale effectively and serve all of Los Angeles.\r\n"
  competition: "We have two primary groups of competitors:  legacy competitors whose business model relies on selling higher priced services such as telephone and SMS text messaging, and digital competitors which are taking a new, lower cost approach to public communications.  Generally, this field is referred to as emergency/mass notification systems (EMNS); however, MassKnowtify captures the full spectrum of public communications: from emergency events to casual fun.\r\n\r\nLegacy Competitors\r\nThis group includes Everbridge, AtHoc, CodeRed, Cooper Notification, and Blackboard Connect.  These services have pioneered the field of EMNS communications; however, their business model is becoming more and more obsolete in the digital era.  Their primary value proposition is the ability to sell preloaded telephone numbers (based on the publicly available “White Pages”) to municipalities.  This is valuable to municipalities because even if citizens do not “opt in” to their local EMNS system, telephone alerts can still be made in the event of an emergency situation.  However, these systems only have landlines in their preloaded data; no cell phone data is provided.  This is problematic because of the trends for Americans dropping their landlines and relying solely on cell phones for all their telephone needs.\r\n\r\nDigital Competitors\r\nThis group includes Nixle, LiveSafe, Ping4Alerts, NextDoor, and Twitter (to a limited degree).  These services leverage the openness of the web and digital era to create services that are more accessible to citizens and a lower cost (or free) to municipalities.  Nixle, LiveSafe, and Ping4Alerts, all offer a subscription-based model to their government clients.  NextDoor and Twitter are free services designed as true social networks; however, they are not effective at conducting targeted messaging.\r\n\r\nEven with the advent of more digital services, the legacy competitors have not shown an interest in adapting to a new model.  Many of the services remain closed and “undiscoverable” to citizens who are not subscribed to their systems.  In fact, Everbridge, one of the leading players in the EMNS market, indicated to one of its current government customers we interviewed that it will not provide an application programming interface (API) to display data on that customer’s main website, even when asked to do so by the customer.  This short-sided view creates opportunities for digital players to create additional value and meet the needs of local government agencies."
  cost: >-
    $100,000 will enable MassKnowtify to reach all identified milestones and be
    successful in all of LA
  budget: "Platform development and enhancements\t($45,000)\r\n•\tConversion from current mobile web app to iPhone app ($20,000)\r\n•\tConversion from current mobile web app to Android app ($20,000)\r\n•\tEnhanced design of app and user interface ($5,000)\r\n\r\nComments:  Our current web app is fully functional and accessible on all devices (smartphones, tablets, desktop browsers).  Our next milestone in our roadmap is to launch “native” apps for both iOS and Android operating systems to deliver better performance and reliability.  MassKnowtify’s mission is to make information free and open to citizens, so the service will always be free to the general public, and citizens will never be asked to pay for access or to download the app.  \r\n\r\nLocal government support for training and onboarding ($45,000)\r\n•\tUnlimited access and usage of MassKnowtify by LA local agencies ($40,000)\r\n•\tTraining sessions and tutorials for local agency users ($5,000)\r\n\r\nComments:  We incur server and bandwidth costs to operate the system, so this funding will cover the associated costs to support maintenance and reliability uptime and server configuration, as needed.  Agency use of MassKnowtify will be free to input alerts and for citizens to access them on demand.  To sustain our operations over time, local governments will be asked to fund the push notification feature which provides instant alerts straight to mobile devices.  In addition, we will conduct training for local agencies to better familiarize them with how to use MassKnowtify effectively.  User education will not be a significant burden to our success, but we would still like to host in-person sessions to deepen our relationships with our agency partners.  \r\n\r\nCitizen and community outreach ($5,000)\r\n•\tHosting community forums and events to drive awareness of MassKnowtify ($5,000)\r\n\r\nComments:  To acquire citizen users, we will continue efforts already in use (and not requested to be funded by this proposal) such as digital advertising, social media, and leveraging civic partners and collaborators.  We will also host community forums and other events around LA to drive awareness of MassKnowtify in all communities, so that it can serve everyone in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nContingency budget ($5,000)\r\n\r\nComments:  We will reserve a modest (5%) contingency budget for the above activities.  This will likely support additional efforts relating to iOS/Android app development, or covering additional server costs associated with our public agency users.\r\n\r\nTOTAL: $100,000"

  MassKnowtify is dedicated to making communications between government and
  citizens more accessible, valuable, and effective. MassKnowtify solves
  distinct problems for both citizens and local governments: citizens can be
  connected to important localized information wherever they travel; local
  governments can increase citizen communication and engagement in a more direct

What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  MassKnowtify is currently in a limited release in Los Angeles and we have
  already partnered with local agencies to bring them on board. Our current web
  app is fully functional and accessible on all devices (smartphones, tablets,
  desktop browsers); however, our next milestone in our roadmap is to launch
  “native” apps for both iOS and Android operating systems to deliver better
  performance and reliability. Most importantly, access and use of MassKnowtify
  by citizens is completely FREE. 
   
   In order to offer MassKnowtify to all public agencies in the entire region, we will implement the following initiatives:
   
   Platform development and enhancements 
   • Convert our current web app to native mobile apps for iPhone and Android
   • Create an application programming interface (API) to integrate MassKnowtify alerts on city websites and other digital distribution channels
   • Enhance MassKnowtify’s message analytics capability for public agencies to better assess the effectiveness of their messaging
   
   Local government access and usage, and support for training and onboarding
   • Provide access and use of MassKnowtify to all local governments in the greater LA region
   • Provide account setup and training for new local agency users
   
   Citizen and community outreach 
   • Host community forums and events, and partner with neighborhood and community based organizations, to drive citizen awareness and usage of MassKnowtify
   • Conduct a variety of outreach efforts to acquire public agencies
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  There are 88 separate municipalities in Los Angeles County, each responsible
  for providing individual city services (police, fire, public works, etc.)
  through individual agencies within the municipality. For example, as one
  drives along Santa Monica Boulevard through West Los Angeles, one will have
  traveled through the cities of Santa Monica, Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, and
  West Hollywood all in under 7 miles. These circumstances make it difficult for
  a citizen to know which city agencies are responsible for emergency

  clusters of cities throughout LA County—such as in the South Bay, San Gabriel
  Valley, and Southeast Los Angeles—with identical circumstances which present
  challenges for citizens to be connected to timely and geographically relevant
  information.
   
   Looking into the future toward the year 2050, MassKnowtify can provide the basis for greater connectedness and trust in our local governments. In the wake of the recession, local governments everywhere are experiencing greater pressures to provide services in a more sustainable and cost-effective manner. In addition, civic engagement is important to the success and vibrancy of our communities which are in tremendous need of innovative solutions to drive greater civic engagement. By providing a platform to connect local governments to citizens, wherever they may be located, civic engagement can be dramatically increased in many new ways over the long run. Future extensions of MassKnowtify may include crowd-sourced information and alerts, and greater contextualized notification for various types of local information.
   
   Building upon the 2014 Grant Challenge goals using results of the February 2013 Grants Challenge and My LA2050 Report, MassKnowtify addresses Public Safety as a priority focus area, which was the area with the least number of submissions in the February 2013 Grants Challenge. MassKnowtify also addresses cross-indicator trends from the LA2050 Report by addressing Technology to leverage new technology to build LA’s future and a new way of connecting to local government, and addressing Design & Innovation by applying technology and design to deliver a product and service benefitting all in Los Angeles. Finally, MassKnowtify increases and enhances Social Connectedness by making citizens more connected to their local governments–where they live, work, and spend their free time–in a dramatically new way.

MassKnowtify allows each citizen user to custom select the types and frequency of messages to receive, and whether to receive them as a push notification, or by simply accessing the MassKnowtify system on demand.
   
   The Community Services context is also an underserved segment of targeting citizens with timely and relevant information. In talking directly with local agencies, this context is very important to reach constituents that seek out or need their services. Examples include public events, recreation programs, tourism information, and public outreach campaigns.
   
   Interest in MassKnowtify shown specifically from YOU through the LA2050 Grants Challenge will help fuel adoption by local governments throughout Los Angeles. Help us dramatically improve how governments connect to citizens with information that’s timely and relevant to them!
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  We view each and every local government in the greater LA region as a partner
  with MassKnowtify. While we already have several local partners which have
  expressed interest in using and leveraging MassKnowtify in their public
  communications efforts, we are not identifying any specific partners in the
  context of this grant application to order to ensure maximum, yet equitable,
  opportunity for local governments to partner with MassKnowtify in our efforts
