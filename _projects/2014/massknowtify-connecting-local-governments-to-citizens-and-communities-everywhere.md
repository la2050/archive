Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  MassKnowtify is dedicated to making communications between government and
  citizens more accessible, valuable, and effective. MassKnowtify solves
  distinct problems for both citizens and local governments: citizens can be
  connected to important localized information wherever they travel; local
  governments can increase citizen communication and engagement in a more direct
  and cost-effective manner. To achieve this, MassKnowtify provides a
  location-based public alerting platform to disseminate a variety of public
  alerts and notifications that are timely, accurate, and relevant to one’s
  specific location. MassKnowtify functions primarily as a mobile application
  but can also be accessed through the web from anywhere on any device.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  MassKnowtify is currently in a limited release in Los Angeles and we have
  already partnered with local agencies to bring them on board. Our current web
  app is fully functional and accessible on all devices (smartphones, tablets,
  desktop browsers); however, our next milestone in our roadmap is to launch
  “native” apps for both iOS and Android operating systems to deliver better
  performance and reliability. Most importantly, access and use of MassKnowtify
  by citizens is completely FREE. 
   
   In order to offer MassKnowtify to all public agencies in the entire region, we will implement the following initiatives:
   
   Platform development and enhancements 
   • Convert our current web app to native mobile apps for iPhone and Android
   • Create an application programming interface (API) to integrate MassKnowtify alerts on city websites and other digital distribution channels
   • Enhance MassKnowtify’s message analytics capability for public agencies to better assess the effectiveness of their messaging
   
   Local government access and usage, and support for training and onboarding
   • Provide access and use of MassKnowtify to all local governments in the greater LA region
   • Provide account setup and training for new local agency users
   
   Citizen and community outreach 
   • Host community forums and events, and partner with neighborhood and community based organizations, to drive citizen awareness and usage of MassKnowtify
   • Conduct a variety of outreach efforts to acquire public agencies
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  There are 88 separate municipalities in Los Angeles County, each responsible
  for providing individual city services (police, fire, public works, etc.)
  through individual agencies within the municipality. For example, as one
  drives along Santa Monica Boulevard through West Los Angeles, one will have
  traveled through the cities of Santa Monica, Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, and
  West Hollywood all in under 7 miles. These circumstances make it difficult for
  a citizen to know which city agencies are responsible for emergency
  notifications and other essential city services. There are several other large
  clusters of cities throughout LA County—such as in the South Bay, San Gabriel
  Valley, and Southeast Los Angeles—with identical circumstances which present
  challenges for citizens to be connected to timely and geographically relevant
  information.
   
   Looking into the future toward the year 2050, MassKnowtify can provide the basis for greater connectedness and trust in our local governments. In the wake of the recession, local governments everywhere are experiencing greater pressures to provide services in a more sustainable and cost-effective manner. In addition, civic engagement is important to the success and vibrancy of our communities which are in tremendous need of innovative solutions to drive greater civic engagement. By providing a platform to connect local governments to citizens, wherever they may be located, civic engagement can be dramatically increased in many new ways over the long run. Future extensions of MassKnowtify may include crowd-sourced information and alerts, and greater contextualized notification for various types of local information.
   
   Building upon the 2014 Grant Challenge goals using results of the February 2013 Grants Challenge and My LA2050 Report, MassKnowtify addresses Public Safety as a priority focus area, which was the area with the least number of submissions in the February 2013 Grants Challenge. MassKnowtify also addresses cross-indicator trends from the LA2050 Report by addressing Technology to leverage new technology to build LA’s future and a new way of connecting to local government, and addressing Design & Innovation by applying technology and design to deliver a product and service benefitting all in Los Angeles. Finally, MassKnowtify increases and enhances Social Connectedness by making citizens more connected to their local governments–where they live, work, and spend their free time–in a dramatically new way.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  MassKnowtify is a platform designed to benefit everyone in Los
  Angeles—residents, visitors, business owners, tourists—by connecting them to
  local government information that is timely and relevant to their specific
  location. Our platform is connecting citizens to government alerts and
  notifications that are categorized into three contexts: Emergencies, Quality
  of Life, and Community Services.
   
   The Emergency context includes emergency events, natural disasters, and police and fire activity. The agency users include police, fire, and emergency management agencies. A key differentiator for MassKnowtify is that other systems are tailored only to the “local” population—the population of residents who have opted in to the system using a fixed address. MassKnowtify, however, provides notification ability to both the local and “visitor” populations. The visitor population consists of citizens who have not pre-registered for their local system, which may be for a variety of reasons including: lack of awareness of system, registration is viewed as too cumbersome, they live and work in different cities, or they are visitors from out of town.
   
   The Quality of Life context includes street closures, construction activity, power outages, traffic incidents, and public transit delays. Certain available tools attempt to address this segment but since they are primarily focused on serving the Emergencies segment, they do not emphasize “non-emergency” communications because of the risk of oversaturating messaging and alienating citizens who have subscribed for the system. MassKnowtify allows each citizen user to custom select the types and frequency of messages to receive, and whether to receive them as a push notification, or by simply accessing the MassKnowtify system on demand.
   
   The Community Services context is also an underserved segment of targeting citizens with timely and relevant information. In talking directly with local agencies, this context is very important to reach constituents that seek out or need their services. Examples include public events, recreation programs, tourism information, and public outreach campaigns.
   
   Interest in MassKnowtify shown specifically from YOU through the LA2050 Grants Challenge will help fuel adoption by local governments throughout Los Angeles. Help us dramatically improve how governments connect to citizens with information that’s timely and relevant to them!
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  We view each and every local government in the greater LA region as a partner
  with MassKnowtify. While we already have several local partners which have
  expressed interest in using and leveraging MassKnowtify in their public
  communications efforts, we are not identifying any specific partners in the
  context of this grant application to order to ensure maximum, yet equitable,
  opportunity for local governments to partner with MassKnowtify in our efforts
  going forward.
   
   We have also assembled a group of key advisors that include former public safety officials and public communications experts, and we will continue to rely on our network of partner agencies and advisors to enable MassKnowtify to serve the needs of all Los Angeles residents. 
   
   To better connect with citizens and communities throughout Los Angeles, we will rely on networking with a broad spectrum of groups, including community based organizations, neighborhood councils and associations, local elected officials, and other civic technology providers.
