Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  We will gradually build out our support for LA area biotech startups as we
  progress along a five-year development plan. 
   Initial work will focus on identifying a site, opening coworking office and laboratory space, and leveraging further support to reach our goals from philanthropy, investments, and professional services. As this project develops, and the number of tenant startups grows, we plan to develop more hands-on support to new Life Tech businesses in the form of business acceleration and investment opportunities through our partners. 
   
   With support from LA2050, our plan to create and grow LA’s first early-stage Life Science incubator is as follows:
   
   Stage 1 (Year 1) – We will identify locations for the incubator facility, and begin working with developers on a development plan. At first, we will concentrate on opening office-style incubation space that can be ready to rent within one year of initial funding. This will allow us to welcome our first batch of startups from Digital Health and other virtual biotech spaces. Following office space, we will prioritize making shared meeting space available for local science education, citizen science groups, biotech investor networking, and other community-building purposes for the Life Science industry. 
   
   Stage 2 (Years 2-3) – Once office and meeting space is operational and generating facility income through tenancy, we will focus on opening “wet lab” research space (8,000-10,000 square feet), allowing the first biological research-intensive tenants to start up in the incubator. In addition to shared equipment and space, the incubator facility will provide services such as group purchasing, warehousing, and storage, to support the tenant companies and allow them to minimize their costs during their early-stage growth. 
   We will work with our partners, local business professionals, and investors to create a business accelerator program that will provide investment and support for new high-growth Life Science businesses in LA.
   
   Stage 3 (Years 3-5) – Once the incubator is fully operational with tenant companies, we will focus on growing the base of tenant companies with a goal of expanding operations to a permanent facility (40,000+ square feet) this is designed specifically to house a growing number of startup businesses, provide quality training and education space, and a hub for investment and business startup activity for Life Sciences in Los Angeles.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Life Science technologies are predicted to be among the leading growth
  industries of the 21st Century. Innovations in healthcare are leading the way
  to future generations of drugs and health products that will treat illnesses
  earlier and more effectively, prolonging and increasing the quality of human
  health. From healthcare to biofuels, to biosynthetic materials, to providing
  affordable and nutritious food, to creating sustainable habitats for space
  colonization, the life sciences are central to the biggest opportunities of
  the coming decades.
   
   Los Angeles is home to several world-class research universities, and thousands of talented young scientists. The Los Angeles metropolitan area is consistently among the top 5 employers in the Life Sciences nationwide. However, there is no entry-level business incubation space for biotech startups, and the few facilities that exist for more mature, growth-stage companies are consistently at or near full capacity. As a result, many scientists and inventors from Los Angeles are moving to other areas that are perceived as more supportive, such as San Francisco and San Diego, to start their biotech businesses.
   
   Creating an open, affordable space in Los Angeles for Life Science startups, along with business support and access to investors and advisers, is essential to reversing this trend. Our facility will allow research discoveries from Los Angeles’ universities to stay in LA, grow into successful businesses, employ staff from the LA area, and lay down a strong foundation for the economy of the 21st Century. 
   
   By 2050, some of the early startups that were supported by our incubator will have grown into large, successful businesses, employing thousands of people across Los Angeles. The Founders of these successful companies will become the next generation of investors, as they use the profits from their success to invest capital into the next generation of innovation. Through this community of innovators in Life Sciences, we will be able to anchor a self-sustaining cycle of success and innovation in biotechnology here in Los Angeles.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Our focus for this project is on creating business startups in an industry
  that is currently dramatically underrepresented in Los Angeles. Several groups
  are therefore likely to benefit from the creation of this incubator facility
  and its support for startup Life Science businesses:
   
   Students and Faculty from Los Angeles Universities – The most direct and immediate benefit will be to the scientists and trainees of our area’s many institutions of higher learning. Innovators from our local universities and colleges will be able to access facilities and support to develop businesses for their technologies, without leaving the area. Our open meeting space will allow for better networking with other scientists from across LA, as well as investors, business partners, and grantmakers.
   
   Citizen Scientists and Inventors – This project will allow people from across the LA area to access scientific expertise, technical advice, and professional networks to assist them in developing their ideas into practical technologies. With a central location for the life sciences in LA, individuals with limited knowledge of the industry will have access to collaborations and partnership with seasoned professionals and experts under the same roof.
   
   Life Science Industries in Los Angeles – Development of a more vibrant and productive biotech startup environment in Los Angeles would diminish the attraction of rival cities for LA’s startups. As a result, the industry as a whole would benefit in LA, with more jobs being created locally by startup businesses, providing a broader and deeper pool of professional opportunities for biotech professionals in our area.
   
   Communities of Los Angeles – Our goal is to create an incubator that will allow many biotech startups to be successful and develop locally. As these companies grow, they will need staff – a key feature of biotech is that it requires technical precision and adherence to strict safety protocols. In other words, biotech needs skilled labor: investment in the life sciences will create well-paying, professional jobs that will help reinvigorate our middle class.
   
   K-12 Students – By creating an innovation hub for life sciences in LA, we also provide a central repository of expertise for our industry. Meeting space(s) will be available for teaching and other types of educational activities. Our coworking space will enable students to perform research studies that are beyond the capabilities of their own school's facilities.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  The following groups/businesses are confirmed as partners in this project, and
  have committed to provide advice and support for our efforts as follows:
   
   Southern California Biomedical Council (SoCalBio) – The trade association for life sciences in Southern California will provide access to investors and professional services for the startups launched through our incubator. Their regular investors’ events will provide a venue for our tenant companies to pitch their businesses and raise capital, as well as network with other industry professionals. The development of an incubator with coworking and open meeting space will provide groups such as SoCalBio dedicated biotech-themed space to hold meetings and events for industry and investors.
   
   LA Biohackers – This citizen science group maintains a small shared laboratory space in downtown LA for small-scale experiments and group projects. The creation of a permanent biotech startup incubator would provide space for growth of their technologies and discoveries, as well as a venue for them to develop public open-access classes in biotechnology – an activity that they are currently unable to perform due to space constraints in their current location. Our partnership with the LA Biohackers will provide community outreach and independent development of public-centered education programs, while providing independent innovators with a permanent home in Los Angeles to grow their technologies into sustainable businesses.
   
   X-PRIZE Foundation – the Director of Life Science competitions for the X-PRIZE Foundation is a co-founder of this project. This will ensure that LA-based innovators have access to new competitions and opportunities. A new Life Science incubator in LA will form a central role in promoting and supporting LA innovators' responses to new X-Prize challenges in the Life Sciences.
   
   Pasadena Bioscience Collaborative (PBC) – This biotech incubator in Pasadena currently supports 18 companies across three separate locations. The PBC will offer us experienced advice about running a life science incubator, and access to an existing base of investors and supporters of the Life Sciences industry from the San Gabriel Valley. Our collaboration will be mutually beneficial by expanding available space for startups, providing a link between the LA Basin and San Gabriel Valley biotech communities, and enhancing access between innovators and investors across the LA region.
