Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  SEE Fest LA will invite Los Angeles-based film-makers and artists who have
  either emigrated to Los Angeles and/or are residents of Los Angeles who are of
  Balkan descent to present SEE films and related cultural activities, including
  food, dance, music, theatre, the visual arts, etc. Participants of the
  Balkans-LA project will also include Los Angeles-based artists who are not of
  SEE or Balkan descent to properly cross pollinate and collaborate while
  building understanding of SEE cultures as the blend with the diverse cultural
  landscape of Los Angeles. Further, Balkan-LA programming will invite Balkan
  filmmakers and artists who still live in SEE countries to present their works
  to the community of Los Angeles to broaden the horizons and world-wide
  understanding of SEE cultures. 
   
   Balkan-LA will host monthly events (film, music, dance, visual arts, exhibitions, and theatre) during the coming year and hopes that LA2050 will choose to support these ventures. SEE Fest LA believes that the arts have the power to build bridges amongst diverse cultures and communities to build a LA2050 whose residents, although diverse, can engage and appreciate differences while living together in peace and cohesion. Balkan-LA will weave the cultural fabric of Los Angeles through fostering cross-cultural collaboration and discourse on the similarities, dissimilarities, and the ties that bind through education, exposure, and engagement in the arts while encouraging arts participation by all residents of Los Angeles.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  The Balkan cultures have given us geniuses like Serbian-American scientist and
  inventor Nikola Tesla, notorious events like the assassination in Sarajevo in
  1914 which precipitated WWI, Hollywood mythology based on the character of
  Count Dracula, and world figures like Mother Theresa. There is hardly a better
  place than Los Angeles for the very diverse content from a European frontier
  to fit culturally and engage its peers. 
   
   SEEfest wants to put in place a comprehensive year-round program of film screenings and cultural events highlighting the contributions of SEE countries to the world’s cultures. With our Balkans-LA project we will add one missing jewel to the cultural crown of Los Angeles, a development which will not go unnoticed in 15+ countries of the South East European region. We plan to bring the best cultural representatives from SEE countries to visit L.A. and lay the ground work for lasting creative connections between South East Europe and Los Angeles. Our activities will be spread all over L.A. in different communities, engaging people of South East European (SEE) descent, often marginalized because their languages are too small and they are geographically too scattered to register on the larger map of our city. 
   
   Our Project will promote social cohesion among Americans from Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Georgia in the Caucasus, Hungary, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia, Turkey (and other ‘pockets’ of smaller ethnic/linguistic groups from Eastern Europe) and will achieve this with programs that are representative of these cultures and possess qualities that can attract more mainstream American audiences at large. For 10 years SEEfest has been working towards this goal to reach across demographic and ethnic divides, and build social cohesion and mutual understanding within SEE demographics, fostering their integration and sense of pride. The cultural crossroads of the Balkans and surrounding countries resonate with an ethnically, culturally and linguistically diverse city like L.A. Our Project wants to tap into this diversity which is a social capital and resource still little used. This human resource has the desire and potential to burst onto the scene and create new artistic and cultural content, and our Project wants to provide programs for this creativity to be seen and find its place within the creative industries sector of Los Angeles.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  LA2050 grant will enable SEEfest to serve audiences of SEE descent,
  marginalized because their ethnic groups and languages are too small if taken
  individually, promote social cohesion between disparate SEE groups and at the
  same time foster social interaction with American audiences through artistic
  collaborations, programs, events, cross-cultural collaboration and discourse
  on the similarities, dissimilarities, and the ties that bind. By targeting
  culturally isolated groups across Los Angeles County the Project will bring a
  unifying sense of belonging and, we hope, contribute to building their
  L.A.-specific identity. 
   
   Large part of our efforts will be devoted to audience outreach and student-related activities. If funded, the Project will expand opportunities for training and transfer of skills for youth and students from local public schools involved in our partner's career technical education curriculum. We plan to engage them in every aspect of the Project and provide ample opportunities to learn, practice, interact with accomplished artists whose ethnic and cultural background is just as diverse as theirs. We believe that social backgrounds of people involved in the Project and the type of programs we plan to do will convey a sense of inclusiveness to student population from underprivileged communities. For bi-lingual youth with recent immigrant experience there is a stronger sense of identification with our Project's people who are also bi-lingual or tri-lingual emigres, and whose stories, music, films, plays, even jokes mimic the same feeling of displacement and struggle to fit in. 
   
   The best arts programs from South Eastern Europe and rich historical, ethnic and cultural perspective will act as a catalyst for social cohesion between diverse segments of our target population. Student audience is all bi-lingual, Spanish-English, with a small portion of bi-lingual youth from SEE countries. Our programs will resonate with student audience because they speak of experiences that mirror their own, however remote SEE countries may be from South America or southern California. Our youth outreach to date, with participation from Hollywood High School, Duarte HS, and School of Global Studies has proven that we were on the right track. The acorn has been planted. LA2050 funding will make our BalkansLA Project feasible and open the doors to advancement and ultimately job placements for our youth participants.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  We have identified and confirmed collaborative partnerships with KLCS-TV and
  the Los Angeles Unified School District, specifically LAUSD’s career technical
  education in several LAUSD schools. 
   
   These partnerships are two-fold, contributing towards development of our programs and ideas, and channeling student integration in the programs with job training. 
   
   Our partner KLCS-TV is the PBS-affiliated station and a multiple Emmy® Award winner, broadcasting to over sixteen million viewers throughout Southern California on DirecTV, Dish Network, and most cable systems. It is a licensee of the Los Angeles Unified School District, providing over 80,000 hours of instructional/informational content annually. 
   
   SEEfest first partnered with KLCS-TV in 2010 to promote the annual film festival, progressing to SEEfest cultural and business programs, and production of filmed segments. 
   
   Project partner KLCS-TV responsibilities will include broadcasting films and new original Tv program, featuring artists from Los Angeles in lively short segments about musical, folk, dance, literary, craft and food traditions of the Balkan people. KLCS will contribute station staff and technical resources. 
   
   Project partner C.T.E, Career technical education staff, in conjunction with KLCS and LAUSD, will be responsible for local curatorial assistance in developing tailored programs for student demographics, identifying and recruiting from the pool of SEEfest those L.A.-based artists best suited for the transfer of skills needed in the L.A. creative industries marketplace: production jobs, story boarding, editing, composing and scoring music, copy writing, set decoration, lighting, filming. SEEfest will provide access to real-life training for these budding photographers, camera operators, crafts services students all of whom come from underprivileged neighborhoods of L.A. With their bi-lingual background and recent immigrant experience they don't have an easy access to on the job training and SEEfest has a track record of providing opportunities for this student population. 
   
   Three factors critical to the success of our collaboration: sharing similar goals and ideals, willingness to roll up our collective sleeves, and the passion to create new things.
