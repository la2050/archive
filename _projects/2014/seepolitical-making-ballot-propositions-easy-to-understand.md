Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  SeePolitical.com is an interactive website, widget and mobile app providing
  objective, easily understood information about ballot propositions for all
  Angelenos. Trying to understand the complex language found on most ballots is
  frustrating and often results in uninformed voters approving unintended
  consequences. In the case for our region, most voters are not even
  participating. The June 2014 primary turned out an alarmingly record-low
  number of voters in Los Angeles County. 
   
   SeePolitical breaks the mold by offering unbiased entertaining educational content that informs and empowers voters in English and in Spanish.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  SeePolitical is nonprofit organization offering an unprecedented service:
  Concise, unbiased, entertaining information on ballot measures, which we all
  crave. 
   
   Los Angeles is the perfect place for SeePolitical to start educating voters. Voters in this city are confronted multiple times a year with major public policy issues with huge social implications and billions of dollars at stake. SeePolitical’s initial goal is to educate and inform Angelenos about the implications of each statewide ballot measure. 
   
   After a successful trial in Los Angeles, SeePolitical will begin to cover ballot props in other cities and states. SeePolitical has the potential to be the go-to source for voter education and will quickly surpass outdated text heavy formats currently used to inform the public.
   
   We have already built an incredible team in Los Angeles and tested the concept, now it’s time to execute:
   1) SeePolitical and the League of Women Voters have teamed up to conduct expert policy research & analysis for each ballot proposition, ensuring a fair and balanced explanation for both the Yes and No side.
   2) Our Emmy-award winning studio, Imaginary Forces, located in LA translates this research into informative, engaging videos explaining each ballot prop less than 2 minutes.
   3) SeePolitical’s videos will be distributed to partner organizations and media outlets across LA County for mass distribution. 
   4) Voters can watch our videos on the web or from any mobile device, and save their voting preferences on SeePolitical’s mobile app which they can use as their personal cheat sheet on Election Day!
   5) SeePolitical will have unprecedented real-time polling data and insights to localized and aggregate voter behavior and trends.
   
   SeePolitical’s characters clarify what a YES vote entails and what a NO vote entails for each proposition during a 60-90 second animated, audio cartoon clip. Each viewer can save his/her choice by clicking on the YES, NO, or MAYBE button at the bottom of the screen. The viewer then has the option to print or save their selections for easy reference that will be emailed and/or texted to them when it is time to vote.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  SeePolitical will literally connect LA residents to the issues we are expected
  to vote on. SeePolitical strives to increase understanding of major public
  policy issues by reaching target demographics in their environments with
  engaging, interactive and entertaining content.
   
   Our nonprofit organization has developed a novel method to address a major social problem in our city - voter confusion and voter apathy - which are inherently linked. After proving our concept this year in Los Angeles, SeePolitical will provide a platform for all Angelenos to discuss and organize around political issues.
   
   SeePolitical can provide an innovative approach to explaining ballot measures that surpasses the status quo in impact and cost. 
   
   SeePolitical’s integrity is established with completely unbiased and objective explanations. We utilize the Attorney General and Secretary of State’s public voter guide as our primary source of analysis. The popularity of SeePolitical will lie in our ability to convey this information to Angelenos through dynamic animation. The success of SeePolitical lies in our ability to engage potential voters in their online environments, provide cutting edge easy to use tools for understanding and make them care enough to share. The outcome will be a well-informed voting public in this city with a clear understanding of each proposition we encounter in the voting booth. SeePolitical’s bottom line is to increase overall voter turnout at each election and connect Angelenos to some of the most important issues we face as a city and region. 
   
   SeePolitical will engage users in their social environments through custom built social media and mobile applications giving them the ability to interact with each other and share. For instance, your friend in Silver Lake took a SeePolitical poll on Facebook and another one in Boyle Heights shared their thoughts and video via our iPhone application. Our mobile rich media widgets will inform target audiences by offering value added content on partner websites. 
   
   Long term plans include building a walled garden social network for voters in our city to align and organize around issues dear to them, archiving ballot measures and voter behaviors, becoming a valuable source of educational information for students involved with the formulation of public policy and expanding the scope to a national scale.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  SeePolitical will truly benefit everyone in LA. Residents who feel it is their
  civic duty to vote but don’t want to spend too much time learning about
  propositions will be able to enjoy SeePolitical’s entertaining and informative
  content. New U.S. citizens who don’t read English well enough to truly
  understand the legal jargon on each ballot will have an opportunity to watch
  and listen to SeePolitical’s explanations in their native tongue. The seasoned
  voter will also enjoy a new and refreshing take on explaining policy issues,
  in addition to access to links to outside content that can offer more in-depth
  explanations. Teachers in our classrooms will finally have a tool to help
  their students learn about the complex issues that their parents are voting on
  as well as the very process that they too will be expected to participate in
  as adult citizens. When it comes down to it, everyone in our great city will
  benefit from SeePolitical’s content and voter tool.
   
   The organization was started with a goal and a dream four years ago. To date, we have created an ecosystem of partnerships, distribution channels and affiliations to political organizations that led to our beta launch in Summer and Fall 2012 elections. Since 2012 we have secured major partnerships with LA’s own Emmy Award winning animation studio, Imaginary Forces, and the USC's Unruh Institute of Politics (their students assist in our policy analysis research) as well as the Otis College of Art and Design near LAX. 
   
   We intend to impact as much of the population as possible in future elections, but do have some specific segments we are focusing on, such as: African American, Latino and Asian populations; young voters; low-income voters; immigrants; and as part of our dedication to education a subcategory would be students not old enough to vote. 
   
   There are persistent gaps in voter turnout by income and educational attainment. Percentage of eligible youth vote turnout (18-29 years old) is also at a historic low lending to a “political lag” by which the public policies adopted don’t reflect the needs of the citizenry, because most aren’t participating. 
   
   SeePolitical will offer teachers in the classroom a free and easy to use tool to teach their students about the major public policy issues of the day, as well as issues from the past. We can offer a unique and entertaining format to get kids in LAUSD and surrounding school districts interested and involved in the democratic process.
