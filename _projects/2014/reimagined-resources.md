Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  We will work with School districts and public parks to establish the first
  sites. We have already begun the process by engaging Kevin James in the
  Sanitation Department of LA City to explore locations in that region. We are
  reaching out to each school district, we currently work in many Title one
  schools to offer recycling education to students and faculty as well as offer
  professional development to a variety of regions for Common Core, project
  based learning and Next Generation Science Standards. 
   We have built three STEAM Labs to date, one in an expensive private school and two in public schools with room and very little budget. We engage the students in the design of the labs, labeling, shelving decisions and overall management of the lab is developed with the input of the students and teaching staff. Doing this in public areas would offer a broader reach to build community partners and engage the manufacturers and educators in a joint project to offer cost effective options to the creative and scientific minds in under-served populations.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  We already offer this experience to those we are able to find or who find us.
  We don't advertise. We are busy with events and educating teachers through
  word of mouth. Our programs work for the students, the teachers and they have
  a lasting impact according to the research collected over the last year with
  participants.
   We have an open house on Sunday afternoons from Sept. to June where we invite the local community in Gardena to come to the warehouse and create what they are inspired to create and then take it home. There is a donation box out but there is no pressure to put anything in that box. Those who can do and those who can't take home their creation with our blessings. We would like to offer that experience to more communities.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  We currently benefit the students who are on the free or reduced lunch program
  in schools all over this county and others. We travel to school we are invited
  to. Our demographic research from last year tells us:
   African-American 10%
   American Indian/Alaskan Native 1%
   Asian/Pacific Islander 6% 
   Caucasian 9%   
   Latino/Hispanic 74%
   One of our goals is the inspire more young girls to study science and engineering. The effect to date has been impressive and inspires us to continue to look for more schools to work with in more communities. We encourage family time in the warehouse. This isn't a drop off facility. Parents work with their children and families begin to work cooperatively. Friendships form around discovery and accomplishment. Failure is welcome and everyone is encouraged to fail and fail and learn from each failure the way scientists and researchers learn from their failures to inform their success. We encourage second chances for material and for people.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  The three factors that are key to our success are information, letting the
  public know it is there for them, access, having facilities and partners who
  can help fill them and volunteers who will help guide the explorations without
  directing them.
   We currently work with Republic Services in the LAUSD Schools to offer recycling training in a fun relay program for students. We are planning to engage them further in this project to support the facilities and to advertise the program on their trucks driving all over LA County. 
   We are in talks with Kevin James at the LA Sanitation office to find locations and support in the effort to let manufacturers know about option for their waste materials and to inform the public of the opportunities. We will invite LAUSD to be part of the program also to inform the students of the opportunity to explore in the space and to volunteer in the space.
   The only group we have not yet worked with is the Sanitation Dept. and our first meeting was scheduled for the day the water pipe broke in west LA. We are rescheduled for Aug. 6th in Kevin James office.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: ''

    We would establish mini Science Technology Engineering Art and Math (STEAM)
    Ateliers in 15 locations in LA County. Our goal is to partner with local
    community centers and public schools in the county to establish these
    centers and encourage families in LA County to come and take part in the
    creations that are inspired by what manufacturers would be sending to
    landfill in the absence of this option. We currently collect the material
    and make it available in our warehouse. This would allow us to take the
    material to the public in areas where there are few family centered
    opportunities to explore the magic of STEAM!

  evaluate: "We will have surveys as the cost of entry. No fee just fill out three questions when you arrive and another three when you leave. We will work with the manufacturer to help them see the educational value of their waste in communities where the Reimagined Resources facilities are serving families.\r\nWe would be looking for information from children about what they think of science and engineering before they work with us at Reimagined Resources and then asking how they feel after working with us in the space. \r\nWe will be measuring the level of awareness of the students regarding recycling and composting. \r\nWe will invite the students to submit their plans for yearly creation festivals at the sites.

    We have been offering this opportunity to local schools for ten years with
    such great success that we have worked out the management issues around the
    material and have tested the project in more than 500 schools in that time.
    We have touched tens of thousands of students and have developed this
    program out of that success. We have done all this with word of mouth and
    feedback from those who have worked as facilitators, educators, students and
    parents.
  achievable_goal: "We have the infrastructure to implement this project with the staff and volunteers in our sphere currently. We have the interest of the Sanitation Dept and Republic Services. We have the encouragement and support of over 600 members of Trash for Teaching who beg us to be in more locations for easier access for their families and students.\r\nWe are ready to implement. The only thing missing has been budget."
  major_challenges: >-
    Securing the locations and adding to our manufacturer base to insure the
    ability to keep up with the supplies would be our greatest challenges.
    Having said that, we are already working on the solution to this by meeting
    with Kevin James and Republic Services to see where we could be located and
    what support would be possible from both groups. I have been working with
    the LA Chamber of Commerce to arrange an opportunity to present to a group
    of manufacturers in the LA area and I have traveled to Sacramento twice in
    the last two months to work with the California Manufacturers and Technology
    Association toward the same goal of gathering more and more interesting
    materials from around the region.
  competition: "There are a couple of smaller groups collecting materials for art work, ReDiscover Center in West LA and RAFT in Northern California. To our knowledge there isn't anyone doing the kind of professional development for STEAM education with teachers and school districts using up-cycled materials.\r\nWe don't know of anyone doing the interactive art/science exhibits we are proposing. We have been asked by the Great Park in Irvine to propose a budget to come to their site and develop the first of these sites. They told us they have not been able to find anything like what they saw in our warehouse and have asked us to duplicate it on a smaller scale for them in Orange County. "
  cost: "We have built these studios in schools for 5-6 thousand dollars. We believe we can get them up and running with the $100,000 and then work with the Sanitation Dept., Republic Services and local Rotary clubs to keep them open with volunteer staffs and the minimal materials needed like tape, coloring materials and consumables that are not found in the waste cycle.\r\nWe have worked with the local Rotary clubs in our region to finance those costs in our own open house. We have a successful model that we would duplicate in each site using local families and community leaders to manage and support."
  budget: "Materials for each site  2000 lbs of material . 10 sites at $1.00 per lbs.\r\n$2000. per site.\r\nPersonnel/volunteers for the build out 5 people per site at $200. each \r\n$1000. per site.\r\nMisc. costs of the build in lumber, hammers, nails and the like are approx. $1000. per site.\r\nMisc. feeding the crew, cleanup, painting, and getting ready for opening\r\napprox. $1000. per site."

      We have been offering this opportunity to local schools for ten years with
      such great success that we have worked out the management issues around
      the material and have tested the project in more than 500 schools in that
      time. We have touched tens of thousands of students and have developed
      this program out of that success. We have done all this with word of mouth
      and feedback from those who have worked as facilitators, educators,
      students and parents.

    answer: "We have the infrastructure to implement this project with the staff and volunteers in our sphere currently. We have the interest of the Sanitation Dept and Republic Services. We have the encouragement and support of over 600 members of Trash for Teaching who beg us to be in more locations for easier access for their families and students.\r\nWe are ready to implement. The only thing missing has been budget."

      Securing the locations and adding to our manufacturer base to insure the
      ability to keep up with the supplies would be our greatest challenges.
      Having said that, we are already working on the solution to this by
      meeting with Kevin James and Republic Services to see where we could be
      located and what support would be possible from both groups. I have been
      working with the LA Chamber of Commerce to arrange an opportunity to
      present to a group of manufacturers in the LA area and I have traveled to
      Sacramento twice in the last two months to work with the California
      Manufacturers and Technology Association toward the same goal of gathering
      more and more interesting materials from around the region.

    answer: "There are a couple of smaller groups collecting materials for art work, ReDiscover Center in West LA and RAFT in Northern California. To our knowledge there isn't anyone doing the kind of professional development for STEAM education with teachers and school districts using up-cycled materials.\r\nWe don't know of anyone doing the interactive art/science exhibits we are proposing. We have been asked by the Great Park in Irvine to propose a budget to come to their site and develop the first of these sites. They told us they have not been able to find anything like what they saw in our warehouse and have asked us to duplicate it on a smaller scale for them in Orange County. "

    answer: "We have built these studios in schools for 5-6 thousand dollars. We believe we can get them up and running with the $100,000 and then work with the Sanitation Dept., Republic Services and local Rotary clubs to keep them open with volunteer staffs and the minimal materials needed like tape, coloring materials and consumables that are not found in the waste cycle.\r\nWe have worked with the local Rotary clubs in our region to finance those costs in our own open house. We have a successful model that we would duplicate in each site using local families and community leaders to manage and support."
