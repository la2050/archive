Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  We will work with School districts and public parks to establish the first
  sites. We have already begun the process by engaging Kevin James in the
  Sanitation Department of LA City to explore locations in that region. We are
  reaching out to each school district, we currently work in many Title one
  schools to offer recycling education to students and faculty as well as offer
  professional development to a variety of regions for Common Core, project
  based learning and Next Generation Science Standards. 
   We have built three STEAM Labs to date, one in an expensive private school and two in public schools with room and very little budget. We engage the students in the design of the labs, labeling, shelving decisions and overall management of the lab is developed with the input of the students and teaching staff. Doing this in public areas would offer a broader reach to build community partners and engage the manufacturers and educators in a joint project to offer cost effective options to the creative and scientific minds in under-served populations.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  We already offer this experience to those we are able to find or who find us.
  We don't advertise. We are busy with events and educating teachers through
  word of mouth. Our programs work for the students, the teachers and they have
  a lasting impact according to the research collected over the last year with
  participants.
   We have an open house on Sunday afternoons from Sept. to June where we invite the local community in Gardena to come to the warehouse and create what they are inspired to create and then take it home. There is a donation box out but there is no pressure to put anything in that box. Those who can do and those who can't take home their creation with our blessings. We would like to offer that experience to more communities.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  We currently benefit the students who are on the free or reduced lunch program
  in schools all over this county and others. We travel to school we are invited
  to. Our demographic research from last year tells us:
   African-American 10%
   American Indian/Alaskan Native 1%
   Asian/Pacific Islander 6% 
   Caucasian 9%   
   Latino/Hispanic 74%
   One of our goals is the inspire more young girls to study science and engineering. The effect to date has been impressive and inspires us to continue to look for more schools to work with in more communities. We encourage family time in the warehouse. This isn't a drop off facility. Parents work with their children and families begin to work cooperatively. Friendships form around discovery and accomplishment. Failure is welcome and everyone is encouraged to fail and fail and learn from each failure the way scientists and researchers learn from their failures to inform their success. We encourage second chances for material and for people.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  The three factors that are key to our success are information, letting the
  public know it is there for them, access, having facilities and partners who
  can help fill them and volunteers who will help guide the explorations without
  directing them.
   We currently work with Republic Services in the LAUSD Schools to offer recycling training in a fun relay program for students. We are planning to engage them further in this project to support the facilities and to advertise the program on their trucks driving all over LA County. 
   We are in talks with Kevin James at the LA Sanitation office to find locations and support in the effort to let manufacturers know about option for their waste materials and to inform the public of the opportunities. We will invite LAUSD to be part of the program also to inform the students of the opportunity to explore in the space and to volunteer in the space.
   The only group we have not yet worked with is the Sanitation Dept. and our first meeting was scheduled for the day the water pipe broke in west LA. We are rescheduled for Aug. 6th in Kevin James office.
