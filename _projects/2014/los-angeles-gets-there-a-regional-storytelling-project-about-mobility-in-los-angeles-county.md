Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  We have already implemented this project in some school districts in Los
  Angeles County. We work with school district officials to gain permission to
  distribute materials to elementary school children. Our brochures and reply
  cards are given to the schools and sent
   home with children with a plan to have the children's caregivers learn about gun safety and how to TALK about it. We are putting together a coalition of funders to support the project in specific school districts. We have approval of Long Beach Unified, LAUSD and backing of the City of Los Angeles in addition to lawmakers and law enforcement. We just need the financial backing to get the lifesaving materials in place.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: |-
  Programs like this work! The evidence is clear and substantial: public
   education campaigns, such as those for seat belt use and anti-smoking, resulted in significant behavioral change. We believe that The Talk Project will produce the same life-saving results! Here are some interesting facts we include in our TALK brochure from a few
   studies conducted regarding guns: In 2013, in the United States, more than 5 children a month under the age of 12 – more than 1 a week – were killed at a family member’s home or at a friend’s home by guns that were improperly stored and secured. Research shows that storing guns locked and unloaded reduces the risk of both injuries and suicide by about 70%.
   – Journal of the American Medical Association (2005)
   The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that the safest home for a family is a home without guns. If there is a gun in the home, the gun should be stored unloaded and locked, with ammunition stored separately.
   – American Academy of Pediatrics Policy Statement: Firearm-Related Injuries in the Pediatric Population (October 2012)
   22% of children who live in a house with a gun handled a gun without their parents’ knowledge.
   – Misperceptions about Children and Firearms, Archives of Pediatric Adolescent Medicine (2006)
   Half of all unintentional shooting deaths among children occur at home, and almost half occur in the home of a friend or relative.
   – Unintentional firearm deaths: a comparison of other-inflicted and self-inflicted shootings. Accident Analysis and Prevention (2010).
   WAGV not only intends to open an affirmative dialogue about guns and gun safety where proactive and preventative
   discussions did not exist, we expect to save lives as a result of this campaign.
   According to LA County Public Health, firearms-related deaths in our county are higher than the national average.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  In order to reap the benefits of other healthy activities, we must work on
  TALKing about guns to ensure our community is healthy today and in the
  future. 
   Research has shown that we must reach children when they are still in elementary school to be able to make change happen.
   Our education and safety campaign will enable us to assist in opening a dialogue about guns where one does not exist. Our specific audience will be caregivers of young children to help them learn about protecting the children in their care.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  So far, we have collaborated with All Saints Church in Pasadena to launch our
  campaign in Pasadena schools. They provided the funding to make this happen as
  well as opening a door to the school district. We have worked with All Saints
  for 20 years and their partnership has been invaluable. 
   
   Occidental Entertainment Group Holdings is a new partnership formed in 2014. They have provided financial support to distribute materials in school districts in Santa Monica, Malibu and Las Virgenes. They will continue to support WAGV's efforts by introducing us to new potential funders and to reach additional school districts.
   
   We have the support and endorsement of is endorsed by Senator Dianne Feinstein; LA Chief of Police Beck; LA City Councilmembers Krekorian and Koretz; LA City Attorney Feuer; LA County Sheriff Baca, Burbank Chief of Police LaChasse; Dr. Walsh, Director of Public Health for the City of Pasadena; John Torres, former Deputy Assistant Director for the ATF; and Jack Scott, educator and former California legislator.
   
   We are currently seeking support for distribution in Long Beach, Compton, Inglewood, LAUSD, Burbank, and Glendale.
   These relationships are critical to providing financial support to create the materials and to distribute them; each collaborator uses their unique relationships to leverage connections with appropriate personnel in positions of decision-making; and each collaboration validates the need for the TALK Project.
