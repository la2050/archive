  The Avalon Green Alley Network Demonstration Project is leading efforts to
  green the nearly 900 linear miles of alleys in the City of Los Angeles. These
  largely overlooked spaces represent nearly 2,400 acres of potentially open
  space. Project goals include demonstrating innovative and cost-effective means
  to improving water quality, contributing to the restoration of local
  ecosystems through the improvement of water quality and conservation of water
  resources, facilitating investment in green infrastructure through the
  development, implementation, and testing of new methods for urban greening,
  and engaging local residents in the design and development of new green spaces
  within their community.
   
   The project will implement replicable low impact development stormwater management measures in a keystone alley that is included within a larger master plan for a local network of green alleys. The Avalon Green Alley Network will retrofit a network of alleys spanning 6 blocks (approximately 37 acres) of the South Los Angeles neighborhood near Avalon Boulevard for improved pedestrian connectivity and integrated stormwater management.
   
   Within the Avalon Green Alley Network, The Trust for Public Land and partners will conduct extensive renovation and construction on two alleys (Tier 1) and will complete general improvements throughout the rest of the alleys (Tier 2). Improvements will include replacing dark, impervious pavement with porous, light-colored paving stones that reflect heat and allow water to penetrate rather than running off into sewers; planting the edges of alleys with espaliered fruit trees to make them cooler and more inviting; and adding signs, lighting, and pavement markings to encourage residents to use the alleys as green pathways through the neighborhood. Additional improvements will include native and drought tolerant plantings that will green and beautify the neighborhood, a fitness loop, and a range of techniques to capture and infiltrate stormwater from nearby residences and streets. When complete, the network of green alleys and streets will connect two parks, an elementary school, a high school, shops and businesses, bus stops, and a grocery store.
   
   The completion of the Project will serve as a demonstration of stormwater management low impact development interventions that can be replicated in other communities throughout Los Angeles and California.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  The Avalon Green Alley Network Demonstration Project presents a major
  opportunity to transform blighted, polluted, and overlooked spaces into
  walkable, bike-able, and playable green spaces, creating new recreational
  opportunities for residents who have few places for safe outdoor recreation in
  their neighborhood. The project will serve as a practical improvement to
  residents’ daily lives, adaptively re-using existing infrastructure to
  integrate green connecting corridors into the fabric of the neighborhood. The
  alleys will also create safe routes to school for children. These corridors
  will serve as vital links between homes, nearby schools, parks, and services.
  By encouraging walkability within the neighborhood, residents will be less
  likely to drive to reach nearby destinations, leading to increased
  opportunities for physical activity, and effectively reducing greenhouse gas
  emissions and improving air quality.
   
   Enlivening, renovating, and greening these overlooked corridors will lead to increased usage and stewardship from residents, which will have an important impact on decreasing crime, illegal dumping, and pollution. Community art, native plantings, and natural, edible landscaping will create a welcoming community space. Interpretive signage and design-based information inlaid into the paving will highlight for residents a sense of place within the Los Angeles River Watershed, and educate residents about pollution prevention and green infrastructure benefits. A fitness path through the alley network will make this community green space a nexus for outdoor exercise, positive community interaction, and play. The integration of espaliered fruit trees along the alley walls and fences introduces an agricultural element to a heavily urbanized area. Benefits also include opportunities for residents to engage in community building activities, thus fostering community pride and a sense of ownership. 
   
   In addition to these benefits to the immediate community, the project will serve as a model for similar dense and residential low-income communities throughout California, and will break new ground in interagency collaborations for the permitting and construction of low-impact development.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The South Los Angeles neighborhood where this project is located is a Severely
  Disadvantaged Community where the median household income (MHI) within a
  half-mile radius of the project site is $31,256 (53 percent of the statewide
  MHI), and where 6,939 people live below the poverty line. Residents of this
  area are disproportionately affected by poor air and water quality, and suffer
  from high rates of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. According to the
  California State Parks Community Fact Finder, the neighborhood surrounding the
  project site has only one acre of open space per 1,000 people. 
   
   On a broader level, the project’s impact on water quality will benefit all of Los Angeles County. Currently, the alleys are used as dumping grounds, leading to the accumulation of various pollutants during dry months, including oil, heavy metals, nutrients, trash, total suspended solids, and bacteria. During rainy months, untreated and contaminated stormwater runoff flows through the alley into storm drains that lead to the Los Angeles River and out to the ocean. Contaminated stormwater runoff is the number one source of ocean pollution in Southern California. Cleaning up the alleys and implementing stormwater capture technologies in them will eliminate a significant source of water pollution. 
   
   The project will also impact water supply in our drought-stricken region. Los Angeles imports 89% of its water at tremendous environmental and financial cost – the large use of energy in California is pumping water south – and yet we waste almost all of our rainwater. Our city’s stormwater infrastructure was designed with the sole purpose of preventing flooding, and as a result all the rain that falls is quickly funneled into storm drains that empty into the ocean. By implementing stormwater capture elements such as permeable paving in the alleys, rainwater will be able to recharge the local aquifers and increase our local water supply. In the current drought, it is more important than ever to demonstrate sustainable solutions to our water crisis. Ongoing monitoring of the stormwater captured by the alleys will provide valuable information that will be used to inform policy at the local, regional, and state level and will benefit all Californians.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  TPL has facilitated nearly 30 community meetings, platicas and clean-ups since
  April 2010. Through these meetings, planning events, and alley clean-up
  activities, the project has engaged the support of the following groups:
   o Los Angeles Conservation Corps –LACC helped TPL organize alley clean-ups at the project site Partner on the Tree Planting grant and will be helping with outreach, permitting and planting for the new street trees
   o The Coalition for Responsible Community Development: a nonprofit community development organization in South Los Angeles, is working with TPL on alley clean-ups.
   o Community Health Council (CHC)/ Coalition for an Active South Los Angeles: The Avalon Alleys have been highlighted by CASLA as a priority project for improving community health. TPL participates in monthly meetings with CASLA, a branch of CHC, who will continue to advocate for a network of green alleys in South L.A.
   o Food for Less, the closest and largest grocery store to the project site, has assisted TPL with outreach support and has contributed food and refreshments for community meetings and alley clean-ups.
   o Magnolia Missionary Baptist Church – Located on the southwest corner of the T-alley block, the church has provided free space for hosting community meetings and events. 
   o TreePeople, an environmental nonprofit provided support and co-facilitated monthly platicas and co-hosted community tree planting event
   o Jefferson High School – Jefferson High School hosts a Green Design Academy, whose students have partnered with TPL on outreach activities.
