    RUN4YOURLIFE - 10K  Walk/Run where you get paid to participate.  Mobile app
    registration, start training, complete the event and get paid.
  more_detail: "RUN FOR YOUR LIF will host a 10K event to get LA moving!  We believe that if people start to exercise, they will want to continue.  So by signing up via a mobile app, training everyday for a minimum of a month - all documented via the app, then come to the final event day, walk/run 10K and get a check!\r\n\r\nWe truly believe and have seen it happen that if you start to work out, you will start to eat right and you will feel better, and want to continue this healthy lifestyle.  The first event of it's kind, LA will be the leader in taking action against fighting obesity.  Parents will engager the kids, who will get paid too!  What a great way to teach kids the importance of being active.  \r\n\r\nEvent will end with a Health fair and celebration!  "
  implement: "We will create a mobile app that will allow people to sign up and then log their exercise. \r\n\r\nWe will create the 10K walk/run, securing all that logistics and permits.\r\n\r\nWe will hire all necessary government officials to secure a safe event.\r\n\r\nWe will secure all media to be sure LA is in the limelight.\r\n\r\nWe will get volunteers to help with water stations/event day registration etc.\r\n\r\nWe will have tech support for the app.\r\n\r\nWe will have goodie bags and event T-shirts\r\n\r\nWe will have checks read at the end of the finish line instead of medals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
  impact_live: "You kidding me?  This is a no brainer!  This event will without a doubt make LA one of the healthiest places to live.  We will actually be doing something to get people to MOVE and be active - literally for their life.  The city is so focused on automobile transportation.  If we get people to feel better just by walking some where (to train for the RUN FOR YOUR LIFE 10K) then we have made a step in the right direction.  \r\n\r\nResearch shows that the hardest part about getting in shape is starting to work out.  So by giving people an incentive to work out, we are getting them to take that first step. \r\n\r\nLA will be taking the first step in the country to believe that we MUST change the way we live our lives … we will be the first city to really make a culture change … to MOVE.\r\n\r\nEach year we can do the event, making cash prizes larger.  More and more people will sign up.  By 2050, we will have a city that is all about being active, exercising and eating healthy.  This will lead to the change of other cultures in the city such as increased ride sharing, using public transportation more, hopefully we will have a Bike Share Transit system that will be in use by then) in short, LA will have become a health (no smog) active city that everyone will want to live in!"
  who_benefit: "The people of LA.  Anyone who wants to take action and has wended to improve their health but never had a reason to.  This will benefit the mom in South Central and her kids, the man in Santa Monica who wants to run but just has not found the time to start, the grandma who wants to start exercising and now is being asked by her grandson to do it with her.\r\n\r\nEVERYONE!\r\n\r\nWe will come together as a city and community!  Rich, poor, young, old, black, white, we are LA. and LA MOVES - RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!"
  partners_collaboration: "We will need to work with a mobil app company to create the app for this event.  We will also work with an organization who has put on large walk/runs for LA.\r\n\r\nThese have not bee secured but we are in the process now of getting them.  "

  evaluate: "LA MOVES will have an app that is created that will actually log all the miles everyone who is registered accumulates.  This will be mandatory for each participant to complete, in order to receive payment for completion of the event.\r\n\r\nAfter that we will strongly suggest that they maintain using the app so we can document the activity after the event.  Some will.  This will then show us our success rate above and beyond the event timeline.\r\n\r\nMetrics:\r\n\r\n- Minimum of 1,000 people sign up to participate in the event and log their activity for a minimum of 1 month. \r\n\r\n- 1000 people in LA will come together for a one day 10K run/walk\r\n\r\n- 1000 people will change the way they live for a minimum of 1 month to complete this event. "
  two_lessons: "1. The hardest thing in exercising and creating a healthy life style is starting a routine.\r\n\r\n2. Once you start to feel healthy - you will continue to do the actions that make you feel healthy."
  achievable_goal: "The project will take 12 months.  This is achievable as we will need the time to create the app (2 months) and then start to market it.  The biggest piece is the marketing and the app.  Securing the permits and location etc will be easy.  \r\n\r\nSo 2 months for the app set up.  Marketing will start immediately to get it ready to launch the program as soon as the app is ready.  Then market market market… secure all logistics and… done!\r\n\r\nTime frame is easy."
  major_challenges: "1. Full time staff to implement the event. \r\nWe will need a minimum of 1 full time staff to do this event.  Solution, we will pay 1 full time staff to do this.  This will come from the award money.\r\n\r\n2. Finding the best mobile app company to create the app.  Solution: we have our connections.  We will interview all the best mobile app creation companies and hire the best.  \r\n"

    Through exercise the obesity rate will drop, healthy eating will occur,
    mental illness will lower (exercise has proven to improve mental health),
    and more people will choose to walk, bike or ride, improving the transit
    scores for the city.

  The Avalon Green Alley Network Demonstration Project is leading efforts to
  green the nearly 900 linear miles of alleys in the City of Los Angeles. These
  largely overlooked spaces represent nearly 2,400 acres of potentially open
  space. Project goals include demonstrating innovative and cost-effective means
  to improving water quality, contributing to the restoration of local
  ecosystems through the improvement of water quality and conservation of water
  resources, facilitating investment in green infrastructure through the
  development, implementation, and testing of new methods for urban greening,
  and engaging local residents in the design and development of new green spaces
  within their community.
   
   The project will implement replicable low impact development stormwater management measures in a keystone alley that is included within a larger master plan for a local network of green alleys. The Avalon Green Alley Network will retrofit a network of alleys spanning 6 blocks (approximately 37 acres) of the South Los Angeles neighborhood near Avalon Boulevard for improved pedestrian connectivity and integrated stormwater management.
   
   Within the Avalon Green Alley Network, The Trust for Public Land and partners will conduct extensive renovation and construction on two alleys (Tier 1) and will complete general improvements throughout the rest of the alleys (Tier 2). Improvements will include replacing dark, impervious pavement with porous, light-colored paving stones that reflect heat and allow water to penetrate rather than running off into sewers; planting the edges of alleys with espaliered fruit trees to make them cooler and more inviting; and adding signs, lighting, and pavement markings to encourage residents to use the alleys as green pathways through the neighborhood. Additional improvements will include native and drought tolerant plantings that will green and beautify the neighborhood, a fitness loop, and a range of techniques to capture and infiltrate stormwater from nearby residences and streets. When complete, the network of green alleys and streets will connect two parks, an elementary school, a high school, shops and businesses, bus stops, and a grocery store.
   
   The completion of the Project will serve as a demonstration of stormwater management low impact development interventions that can be replicated in other communities throughout Los Angeles and California.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  The Avalon Green Alley Network Demonstration Project presents a major
  opportunity to transform blighted, polluted, and overlooked spaces into
  walkable, bike-able, and playable green spaces, creating new recreational
  opportunities for residents who have few places for safe outdoor recreation in
  their neighborhood. The project will serve as a practical improvement to
  residents’ daily lives, adaptively re-using existing infrastructure to
  integrate green connecting corridors into the fabric of the neighborhood. The
  alleys will also create safe routes to school for children. These corridors
  will serve as vital links between homes, nearby schools, parks, and services.
  By encouraging walkability within the neighborhood, residents will be less
  likely to drive to reach nearby destinations, leading to increased
  opportunities for physical activity, and effectively reducing greenhouse gas
  emissions and improving air quality.
   
   Enlivening, renovating, and greening these overlooked corridors will lead to increased usage and stewardship from residents, which will have an important impact on decreasing crime, illegal dumping, and pollution. Community art, native plantings, and natural, edible landscaping will create a welcoming community space. Interpretive signage and design-based information inlaid into the paving will highlight for residents a sense of place within the Los Angeles River Watershed, and educate residents about pollution prevention and green infrastructure benefits. A fitness path through the alley network will make this community green space a nexus for outdoor exercise, positive community interaction, and play. The integration of espaliered fruit trees along the alley walls and fences introduces an agricultural element to a heavily urbanized area. Benefits also include opportunities for residents to engage in community building activities, thus fostering community pride and a sense of ownership. 
   
   In addition to these benefits to the immediate community, the project will serve as a model for similar dense and residential low-income communities throughout California, and will break new ground in interagency collaborations for the permitting and construction of low-impact development.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The South Los Angeles neighborhood where this project is located is a Severely
  Disadvantaged Community where the median household income (MHI) within a
  half-mile radius of the project site is $31,256 (53 percent of the statewide
  MHI), and where 6,939 people live below the poverty line. Residents of this
  area are disproportionately affected by poor air and water quality, and suffer
  from high rates of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. According to the
  California State Parks Community Fact Finder, the neighborhood surrounding the
  project site has only one acre of open space per 1,000 people. 
   
   On a broader level, the project’s impact on water quality will benefit all of Los Angeles County. Currently, the alleys are used as dumping grounds, leading to the accumulation of various pollutants during dry months, including oil, heavy metals, nutrients, trash, total suspended solids, and bacteria. During rainy months, untreated and contaminated stormwater runoff flows through the alley into storm drains that lead to the Los Angeles River and out to the ocean. Contaminated stormwater runoff is the number one source of ocean pollution in Southern California. Cleaning up the alleys and implementing stormwater capture technologies in them will eliminate a significant source of water pollution. 
   
   The project will also impact water supply in our drought-stricken region. Los Angeles imports 89% of its water at tremendous environmental and financial cost – the large use of energy in California is pumping water south – and yet we waste almost all of our rainwater. Our city’s stormwater infrastructure was designed with the sole purpose of preventing flooding, and as a result all the rain that falls is quickly funneled into storm drains that empty into the ocean. By implementing stormwater capture elements such as permeable paving in the alleys, rainwater will be able to recharge the local aquifers and increase our local water supply. In the current drought, it is more important than ever to demonstrate sustainable solutions to our water crisis. Ongoing monitoring of the stormwater captured by the alleys will provide valuable information that will be used to inform policy at the local, regional, and state level and will benefit all Californians.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  TPL has facilitated nearly 30 community meetings, platicas and clean-ups since
  April 2010. Through these meetings, planning events, and alley clean-up
  activities, the project has engaged the support of the following groups:
