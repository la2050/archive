    Our central location is in Lincoln Heights, but we take our programs to many
    of our partners’ locations throughout LA County.
  more_detail: "Classes, Community, Coworking and More\r\nDroplabs is a low cost, collaborative coworking space, computer lab, classroom and makerspace in Los Angeles, California. We’re also a business incubator, and have services, programs and workspace uniquely designed for entrepreneurs, freelancers, lifelong learners and remote workers. Our community consists of members who support each other personally and professionally in a positive environment. \r\n\r\nTeach & Learn with Droplabs Academy!\r\nDroplabs Academy is community-driven, crowdsourced education. We host classes on all kinds of topics, from Python programming to the underground history of comic books. From alternative currencies to culinary field trips.\r\n\r\nWe have outgrown our space & need to expand."
  implement: "Droplabs is bursting at the seams. Where other coworking spaces cost from $250 - $450 for a monthly membership & up, we charge $25 for a monthly membership, $150 for 24/7 access, or $5 per day. We need to scale without raising prices. \r\n\r\nWe currently have a self-led video mentoring program where visitors can choose from our extensive video library to learn different and advanced web programming skills. We’ve seen people come to Droplabs with the most basic computer skills take on new clients after a couple of months. We would expand this program to include more disciplines.\r\n\r\nWe’re also an incubator. There’s a community at Droplabs to support budding entrepreneurs while they navigate all of the tricky aspects of running their own business, from motivation to how to price their skills. We’ve had about 50 startups run through Droplabs. We’re a natural choice for bootstrapping startups. We would offer more programs for startups, as well as find funding opportunities for them. \r\n\r\nAnother program that we’re particularly fond of is our Barnraisings with Coders with a Cause. For a non-profit we’ll gather a team of developers at different experience levels & from start to finish build or improve the non-profit’s website. \r\n\r\nWe break up into teams pairing experienced developers with less experienced developers, & use the opportunity to teach aspects of how to build a large website, from requirements gathering to deployment, using open source tools, using professional workflows, in a professional team. Everyone benefits. We would expand this program. \r\n\r\nWhile we’ve taught electronics classes at Droplabs & have had members build everything from a hands-free mouse to drones that can go 80 miles an hour, we’re really not set up as a fully fledged makerspace yet, but getting maker equipment is at the top of our wishlist. We already have people who can teach CAD, circuitry, & robotics. We have some of the brightest minds in LA willing to teach all sorts of things in a friendly, fun way.\r\n"
  impact_create: "Droplabs helps people remove the boundaries that stop them from changing their lives. I wish this were something that we could claim as our intention when we started, but it happened as a by-product of growing our community organically. We nurture this whenever we can.\r\n\r\nIt’s a lot of little things. \r\n\r\nIt’s giving each member adult responsibility for the environment they’re working in, and responsibility for what they learn, and sitting back while people take responsibility for the directions of their own lives. It’s respecting the decisions they make.\r\n\r\nIt’s trusting people to put money in a fishbowl when they get snacks. \r\n\r\nIt’s one member getting too much lunch on purpose and sharing it with people he knows don’t have a lot of money. \r\n\r\nIt’s making sure people feel comfortable and welcome when they arrive, and making sure that people feel good about where they are on their journey no matter what their skill level. \r\n\r\nIt’s showing each other that we all have something to teach, as well as learn.\r\n\r\nIt’s taking our programs on the road to people in other neighborhoods. \r\n\r\nIt’s partnering with great organizations with shared values.\r\n\r\nIt’s having people there who have already accomplished a lot who are there to help others gain the necessary skills to operate as a freelancer or run a business. \r\n\r\nIt’s providing a great environment to work, so that the skilled and the curious come.\r\n\r\nIt’s letting people know that there are free tools out there to help them build or learn what they need. \r\n\r\nIt's making decisions by consensus.\r\n\r\nIt’s providing a safe place where people can feel comfortable enough to unleash their imaginations. \r\n\r\nIt’s nurturing a culture of innovation recognizing the wealth that we have around us, just by being alive right now.\r\n"
  who_benefit: "Droplabs started out as a way for freelance & open source programmers to learn from each other & collaborate on projects that were larger & more lucrative than the ones that they could take on alone. We still do this, but Droplabs has grown beyond that in many ways. \r\n\r\nWe want to continue our focus on open source & free tools, where we have had enormous success. From hosting open source meetups & classes to coordinating groups taking free online classes to job & career fairs. We have found that leveraging these in combination & in community to be a huge multiplier for learning effort.  \r\n\r\nNext, the startups came. Droplabs is a no-brainer for entrepreneurs. The cost of most coworking spaces is too luxurious for most bootstrapping startups – especially in the early stage. We are decidedly no-frills. We don’t have Aeron chairs or consciously placed rough granite. We do have free parking & a great community of innovative thinkers who are helpful & kind.  \r\n\r\nThe big thing missing from the free university classes offered online is the motivation & persistence that comes from personal experience with other classmembers. (One of our members’ teams beat out 20,000 other students in the Stanford Entrepreneurship class for their Entrepreneurship challenge. We couldn’t be more proud.)\r\n\r\nAfter that, the unemployed found it. There isn’t a big leap between being unemployed & being an entrepreneur. It’s more of a mindset. Some use their unemployment checks as seed funding to build their startups. Others learned new skills & took on clients. Many have been abused by a harsh system, & find confidence & comradeship in a safe environment, blossoming as individuals.  \r\n\r\nAfter that, the crowdfunders found it. & the business people. & Droplabs became a full-fledged incubator, with a constellation of supportive advisors, attorneys & others. \r\n\r\nPeople who come to Droplabs have basic computer skills already, & bring their own laptops. \r\n\r\nWe want to exp& our services to grow our meager makerspace facilities (we have equipment for electronics) & purchase classroom computers. We already have close partnerships with machine & fabrication shops. We already hold job fairs & career fairs for the software industry. We would like to do the same for other industries as we are able to offer more diversity in skills training, & as we grow our community.\r\n\r\nDroplabs is for community minded individuals who wish to put effort into growing professionally & personally."

  evaluate: "We have a number of different metrics that we will use to track Droplabs’ progress in different areas.\r\nThe most general metric is membership numbers. How many new members do we get? How long do they stay? \r\nEducation metrics: the number of classes taught, the number of students attending.\r\nNumber of freelancers and startups helped: We can ask on our application; we can watch for collaborations.  \r\nNumber of job fairs and the number of jobs that come from these and from introductions. \r\nWe also intend to do a regular membership survey."
  two_lessons: "The initial impulse to create Droplabs came about because learning open source technologies is challenging. Often documentation lags behind the technology so that you need to learn a new way of learning that isn’t taught in school and involves learning from a community of people. It turns out that the techniques that apply in this situation are also good for learning other things too. \r\n\r\nWhile the initial idea was for learning, the most exciting thing about Droplabs was, and still is, the sharing of ideas. There’s a rhythm to working there. People are silent and focused for a while, then a discussion breaks out, then people work silently again. It’s like breathing, this constant flow of ideas. This way of working is so much less stressful and more productive that, at the end of the day, you get more work done than if you had been at home, and you’re still fresh to enjoy your evening. \r\n\r\nDroplabs’ physical location is at Big Art Labs, a large arts complex in Lincoln Heights that is a “haven for creative engineers, a hotbed for wild technology, and a lair of percolating thought”. Putting a technology incubator in the middle of an arts community doesn’t at first seem logical, but it makes sense if you want people to be thinking creatively. \r\n\r\nIt also encourages thought diversity. So many people are specializing now that they don’t know that the solution to their esoteric problem might be someone else’s bread and butter. \r\n\r\nWe’ve learned that people who are in vulnerable positions, are less vulnerable when they have guidance from those who have trod the path before, and can find new goals and collaborators to help them reach those goals. \r\n\r\nThis is a very exciting time to be creating. There are new ways of forming businesses that didn’t even exist ten years ago. The time has arrived where the tools to create have been democratized, and where the free stuff is often better than the products made by companies that have had IPOs. The missing ingredient is a culture to support people navigating this new path.\r\n"
  achievable_goal: "Building a startup usually takes several steps:\r\n\r\n1)\tGet a prototype together; (We did this with our original founders.)\r\n2)\tGet a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and get users;\r\n3)\tEvolve with user input;\r\n4)\tGet funding for growth. \r\n\r\nWhen we started Droplabs three years ago, we decided to follow these steps for the brick and mortar organization that we were building. We are at the end of step three, and have been member led since day one. We’re ready to scale.\r\n\r\nStep three for us looks like this: \r\n•\tWe have a membership and culture that is bright, positive and supportive;\r\n•\tWe have programs that are high value, low cost and repeatable;\r\n•\tWe have a clear plan for how we want to grow; \r\n•\tDroplabs currently exists in a space that is smaller than 1000 square feet.\r\n\r\nWe have had enormous success with our programs and have outgrown our physical infrastructure. We want to continue what we’re doing, and grow to serve more people.\r\n\r\nWith the grant we intend to:\r\n\r\n1)\tExpand our makerspace capabilities;\r\n2)\tMove to larger digs;\r\n3)\tBuild software to manage it using barnraisings;\r\n4)     Build our own furniture, as needed, using the maker machines;\r\n4)\tHire someone part time to manage social media. \r\n\r\nAll of these are very achievable within a year. "
  major_challenges: "Scaling and growth never comes without challenges, and we anticipate a few. \r\n\r\nThe processes we’ve evolved to manage Droplabs will need to scale. These processes include managing classrooms at multiple locations, managing membership, coordinating meetups, and managing maintenance of new equipment. We plan on using some of the money to work with our members to build the software using Barnraisings. \r\nWe also anticipate that we will need to work with professionals for part of this. \r\n\r\nWe also know that managing and maintaining maker equipment and tools in good working order will need to have new processes in place, and new roles in our community to manage them. Again, we have several high quality advisors to help us implement maintenance schedules, and manage staff and volunteers around these. \r\n"
  competition: "There are many coworking spaces in the Los Angeles area, and we have partnered with many of them to host our programs. We’ve also helped another one get started. There are many business models around them as well. The Hub LA, is similar as is Cross Campus. \r\n\r\nThere is a teaching space in New York called the Brooklyn Brainery that has a similar structure to managing classrooms and teachers. \r\n\r\nOur favorite makerspace in Los Angeles is Crashspace. Much of our business model came from their ideas, as they are low cost, run regular membership meetings, collaborate and share their knowledge freely. We also like Los Angeles Makerspace. \r\n\r\nWe were inspired by Boston’s South End Technology Center @ Tent City, where two of our founders worked for a few years. In collaboration with MIT, they had a FabLab where we taught. They also taught many people basic computer skills, including those returning from incarceration. This was founded and run by the brilliant Dr. Mel King and indefatigable Dr. Susan Klimczak.\r\n"
  cost: "We're currently in negotiation with the city to get more space, so that's a variable. We're assuming $25,000 to $50,000\r\n\r\nWe think that a part time social media person will cost around $15,000. \r\n\r\nWe will sink the rest into maker equipment, and the raw materials to make furniture from open source files. \r\n\r\nOur main goal is to be sustainable. "
  budget: "$25,000 - $50,000 - rent and utilities\r\n$20,000 - staffing\r\n$30,000 - equipment"

  impact_metrics: "Employment in creative industries:\r\nWe train people to get or create work. We hold job and career fairs. We collaborate with each other on projects that would go elsewhere. \r\n\r\nArts establishments per capita:\r\nPeople are encouraged to teach and learn everything here. We have had arts classes taught here, and have had artists and designers work here. We also help grow startups. \r\n\r\nConcentration of manufacturing activity in LA:\r\nWe will provide low cost access and training for the cutting edge digital design and digital manufacturing that will make it cost effective to keep manufacturing local. This will be part of our mission when we expand our makerspace capabilities. We have partners with full manufacturing capabilities who want to hire for these skills. Also, we help grow startups. \r\n\r\nFederal research grant funding:\r\nWe have had several Droplabs participants apply and receive federal grants. We will get them to do a workshop on their experiences. (Thanks for the idea!) We will seek affiliation with people who have expertise in this area. \r\n\r\nPatents per capita:\r\nThis will come through our makerspace and through our web and mobile application development training. We also have several IP attorneys who want to provide workshops. \r\n\r\nJobs per capita, Minority- and women-owned firms , the Gini coefficient, Number of high-growth startups:\r\nThese are probably the areas where we have the most impact already. We provide free or low cost training to both members and non-members. We hold job fairs. We help grow startups. \r\n\r\nVenture Capital Investment: \r\nWe are already partnering with an organization who does crowdfunding for equity. We will be bringing in VC’s and Angels to give workshops. We help grow startups.\r\n"

   It’s showing each other that we all have something to teach, as well as learn.
   
   It’s taking our programs on the road to people in other neighborhoods. 
   
   It’s partnering with great organizations with shared values.
   
   It’s having people there who have already accomplished a lot who are there to help others gain the necessary skills to operate as a freelancer or run a business. 
   
   It’s providing a great environment to work, so that the skilled and the curious come.
   
   It’s letting people know that there are free tools out there to help them build or learn what they need. 
   
   It's making decisions by consensus.
   
   It’s providing a safe place where people can feel comfortable enough to unleash their imaginations. 
   
   It’s nurturing a culture of innovation recognizing the wealth that we have around us, just by being alive right now.

   People who come to Droplabs have basic computer skills already, & bring their own laptops.

   Droplabs is for community minded individuals who wish to put effort into growing professionally & personally.
