Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Droplabs is bursting at the seams. Where other coworking spaces cost from $250
  - $450 for a monthly membership & up, we charge $25 for a monthly membership,
  $150 for 24/7 access, or $5 per day. We need to scale without raising prices. 
   
   We currently have a self-led video mentoring program where visitors can choose from our extensive video library to learn different and advanced web programming skills. We’ve seen people come to Droplabs with the most basic computer skills take on new clients after a couple of months. We would expand this program to include more disciplines.
   
   We’re also an incubator. There’s a community at Droplabs to support budding entrepreneurs while they navigate all of the tricky aspects of running their own business, from motivation to how to price their skills. We’ve had about 50 startups run through Droplabs. We’re a natural choice for bootstrapping startups. We would offer more programs for startups, as well as find funding opportunities for them. 
   
   Another program that we’re particularly fond of is our Barnraisings with Coders with a Cause. For a non-profit we’ll gather a team of developers at different experience levels & from start to finish build or improve the non-profit’s website. 
   
   We break up into teams pairing experienced developers with less experienced developers, & use the opportunity to teach aspects of how to build a large website, from requirements gathering to deployment, using open source tools, using professional workflows, in a professional team. Everyone benefits. We would expand this program. 
   
   While we’ve taught electronics classes at Droplabs & have had members build everything from a hands-free mouse to drones that can go 80 miles an hour, we’re really not set up as a fully fledged makerspace yet, but getting maker equipment is at the top of our wishlist. We already have people who can teach CAD, circuitry, & robotics. We have some of the brightest minds in LA willing to teach all sorts of things in a friendly, fun way.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Droplabs helps people remove the boundaries that stop them from changing their
  lives. I wish this were something that we could claim as our intention when we
  started, but it happened as a by-product of growing our community organically.
  We nurture this whenever we can.
   
   It’s a lot of little things. 
   
   It’s giving each member adult responsibility for the environment they’re working in, and responsibility for what they learn, and sitting back while people take responsibility for the directions of their own lives. It’s respecting the decisions they make.
   
   It’s trusting people to put money in a fishbowl when they get snacks. 
   
   It’s one member getting too much lunch on purpose and sharing it with people he knows don’t have a lot of money. 
   
   It’s making sure people feel comfortable and welcome when they arrive, and making sure that people feel good about where they are on their journey no matter what their skill level. 
   
   It’s showing each other that we all have something to teach, as well as learn.
   
   It’s taking our programs on the road to people in other neighborhoods. 
   
   It’s partnering with great organizations with shared values.
   
   It’s having people there who have already accomplished a lot who are there to help others gain the necessary skills to operate as a freelancer or run a business. 
   
   It’s providing a great environment to work, so that the skilled and the curious come.
   
   It’s letting people know that there are free tools out there to help them build or learn what they need. 
   
   It's making decisions by consensus.
   
   It’s providing a safe place where people can feel comfortable enough to unleash their imaginations. 
   
   It’s nurturing a culture of innovation recognizing the wealth that we have around us, just by being alive right now.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Droplabs started out as a way for freelance & open source programmers to learn
  from each other & collaborate on projects that were larger & more lucrative
  than the ones that they could take on alone. We still do this, but Droplabs
  has grown beyond that in many ways. 
   
   We want to continue our focus on open source & free tools, where we have had enormous success. From hosting open source meetups & classes to coordinating groups taking free online classes to job & career fairs. We have found that leveraging these in combination & in community to be a huge multiplier for learning effort. 
   
   Next, the startups came. Droplabs is a no-brainer for entrepreneurs. The cost of most coworking spaces is too luxurious for most bootstrapping startups – especially in the early stage. We are decidedly no-frills. We don’t have Aeron chairs or consciously placed rough granite. We do have free parking & a great community of innovative thinkers who are helpful & kind. 
   
   The big thing missing from the free university classes offered online is the motivation & persistence that comes from personal experience with other classmembers. (One of our members’ teams beat out 20,000 other students in the Stanford Entrepreneurship class for their Entrepreneurship challenge. We couldn’t be more proud.)
   
   After that, the unemployed found it. There isn’t a big leap between being unemployed & being an entrepreneur. It’s more of a mindset. Some use their unemployment checks as seed funding to build their startups. Others learned new skills & took on clients. Many have been abused by a harsh system, & find confidence & comradeship in a safe environment, blossoming as individuals. 
   
   After that, the crowdfunders found it. & the business people. & Droplabs became a full-fledged incubator, with a constellation of supportive advisors, attorneys & others. 
   
   People who come to Droplabs have basic computer skills already, & bring their own laptops. 
   
   We want to exp& our services to grow our meager makerspace facilities (we have equipment for electronics) & purchase classroom computers. We already have close partnerships with machine & fabrication shops. We already hold job fairs & career fairs for the software industry. We would like to do the same for other industries as we are able to offer more diversity in skills training, & as we grow our community.
   
   Droplabs is for community minded individuals who wish to put effort into growing professionally & personally.
