Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  While kids of the past may have tinkered with Lego or Erector Set, kids of
  today tinker with electronics. As a result of the miniaturization and
  decreasing cost of manufacturing, electronics today are more accessible to
  people of all ages than ever before. Kids at the LA Makerspace (and
  makerspaces around the world) build robots, design and solder their own
  electronics, and program computers as a form of entertainment.
   
   Biotech is currently undergoing the same revolution in price and accessibility. While practicing biotech as a hobby is not quite as affordable as electronics, progress is being made and lots of young people are getting involved. We envision a future where kids in LA are just as likely to pick up a pipette as they are a soldering iron. Playing with biology will be as common place as playing with electronics.
   
   LA Biohackers will make this dream a reality before 2050 by getting young people access to laboratory space and advanced biotech equipment in addition to knowledge and guidance. We are currently making this happen but with help we can expand our breadth and scope to include more people of all ages.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Our project will benefit anyone in Los Angeles that is interested in biology
  and biotech. Our laboratory is not limited by age or earned degrees. Anyone
  who can demonstrate the ability to follow safety guidelines can have fun in
  our space.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  LA Biohackers has recently been working closely with LabLaunch, another
  organization submitting a proposal to LA2050 (confirmed, please see their
  proposal). We plan on moving in to their facility and becoming the first
  tenant.
   
   LabLaunch is proposing to create a startup incubator that would help early stage companies. In the biotech world, early stage companies typically already have a proven concept and venture capital backing. LA Biohackers, in addition to serving as a common meeting and work space for the community, would also serve as a “pre incubator” for the LabLaunch incubator. People with a nascent idea can use the pre-incubator to advance their project to the point where it could attract angel investors or venture capital. The company would then move in to the full incubator.
   
   LA Biohackers benefits from this relationship by gaining access to discounted space that is amenable to hosting a biology lab as well as access to some of their resources. LabLaunch benefits by having a source of new companies to feed into their incubator. And we both benefit from the cross pollination of ideas and technical knowledge between the two groups.
   
   Factors that are critical to our success are 1) having a paid employee to work and communicate closely with LabLaunch 2) negotiating a deal that is doable with LA Biohackers’ budget but also compensates LabLaunch appropriately, and 3) working with local universities to get projects from the university into the pre-incubator program.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: '1'
