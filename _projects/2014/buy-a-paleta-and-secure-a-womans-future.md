Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  For the past 3 years, Mujeres has conducted research on the current Paleta
  cart-vending industry in Los Angeles County, travelled to Mexico to get a
  better understanding of the origins of the paleta and current trends in the
  industry, developed an executive team, purchased basic “beginners” equipment
  and utensils to make paletas, contracted with a paleta-maker from Cancun,
  Mexico to teach us to make authentic paletas, investigated the various
  equipment and machinery needed to produce paletas, met with County of Los
  Angeles Health officials to better understand health standards for the making
  and selling of paletas including commissary standards and required
  certifications and licenses, and held a soft launch of La Paletera de Los
  Angeles at Marsh Park located next to the Los Angeles River in Northeast Los
  Angeles. 
   
   We want to take the next steps to launch La Paletera on a manageable scale to be in full operation by summer 2015 as we have venue commitments to sell our paletas. We will be unfolding the project by dividing up the process in 4 quarters of a calendar year:
   
   First Quarter: Administrative and planning 
   
   • Research, order and purchase needed equipment for commissary 
    and paleta production and storage (paleta machine we have 
    identified makes 8,000 paletas an hour)
   
   • Identify a space to set up the paleta-making
    operation/commissary between 2500-3500 sq ft in economically 
    depressed area
   
   • Engage County Department of Public Health and Environmental 
    Health 
   
   • Outreach to community to identify first candidates for La 
    Paletera-10 total
   
   • Develop needed manuals, policies and procedures
   
   • Purchase & design 4 tricycle vending carts
   
   • Create design for vending carts
   
   • Acquire mandatory licenses & certifications
   
   • Negotiate, prepare and finalize agreement with partners
   
   • Secure insurance
   
   Second Quarter: Setting up the commissary and settling-in
   
   • Rent space and prepare for move-in
   
   • Select Paleteras
   
   • Develop training and training materials
   
   Third Quarter: 
   
   • Training Paleteras and making paletas
   
   Fourth Quarter: 
   
   • Sell paletas in designated venues
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  MDLT is poised to launch LA Paletera de Los Angeles in the summer of 2015, a
  social micro-enterprise spinning off the rich food diversity found all over
  neighborhoods in Los Angeles. LA Paletera aims to reclaim a Mexican tradition
  of healthy and nutritious food offerings in the form of frozen fruit bars and
  natural fruit flavored waters. The model provides a creative entrepreneurial
  platform for women to develop healthy paleta and agua fresca recipes by
  drawing from their culinary repertoires brought from their hometowns in Latin
  America and incorporate knowledge of the best health food trends in Los
  Angeles. The idea is to encourage women to innovate by intersecting the
  traditional with the new and create recipes that contain high nutritional
  values that pack a solid dose of vitamins and minerals in one serving. 
   
   This is a win-win situation for residents in LA now and by 2050. LA Paletera hopes to have added the word paleta and agua fresca to the English lexicon just like taco and guacamole has become part of every day speak in the city! Angelenos from all walks of life will have an opportunity to experience the exotic flavors of fruit and vegetables found in Latin American. Angelenos will roll words off their tongues like tamarindo, horchata, mamey, flor de calabaza, nopal, guanabana, nance. More importantly by 2050 Angelenos will understand the nutritional value and cultural significance of all these fruits and vegetables and have an appreciation for the delicacies that make up the paletas and aguas frescas they are consuming. And as it is with any type of food, the crosspollination of ingredients from across the continent will be symbol of how all our cultures cross paths in all over LA County. 
   
   Another exciting community involvement feature that La Paletera will promote is to seek the participation of LA residents to help create flavor combinations that are unique to the surrounding communities, flavors that are associated to the particular neighborhood they live/work/play in. For example, a paleta de elote –corn paleta- will reference the Cornfield, which is the historical name of the Los Angeles Historic Park. Local sports teams and other community groups will be invited to partake in the fun by offering sponsorship opportunities for organizations to name a paleta after their favorite team or a community organization they support. The possibilities for engaging the participation and creativity across town are endless!
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  LA Paletera de Los Angeles will benefit Angelenos across LA County as our
  vision is to expand LA Paletera throughout the city, because after all, who
  doesn’t like frozen treats in LA year round?! By 2050, our solar powered
  bicycle-propelled carts will offer an array of healthy treats around city
  streets in Central, East and South LA as well as the San Gabriel and San
  Fernando Valley’s, the South Bay and last but not least the Westside. 
   
   The goal of LA Paletera is to promote fun and creative ways to help Angelenos visualize and practice the circular connection between healthy eating habits and environmentally friendly practices and show how the synergy of these actions catapults a harmonious environment for the communities we live in. Our paleta and aguas frescas marketing campaigns will be all about taking care of our health, of one another, the communities we live in, and La Madre Tierra! 
   
   By 2050, Angelenos young and old will have a very clear understanding of the importance of being loyal customers to LA Paletera’s healthy product offerings. Residents of the county, by then, will know that their money supports a social micro-enterprise venture owned by women who have made their aspirations and dreams a reality by owning and successfully operating their own micro-enterprise. Women and their families from low-income neighborhoods in Los Angeles will be the primary beneficiaries of the LA Paletera project as they will reap the financial benefits accrued through the business. Angelenos in general will benefit as they can always count on LA Paletera cruising the streets of LA offering paletas and aguas frescas that are good for the health and the soul!
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  We have learned that our work is enhanced and strengthened when we engage and
  involve other non-profits, community organizations, neighborhood groups,
  community stakeholders and leaders. This effort will be no different. We have

  continue to partner with:
