  The Soft Studio aims to be the nexus of collaboration between Los Angeles
  County based junior colleges, four year institutions and startup accelerators
  with the ultimate goal of helping a student contextualize their education and
  actualize their idea. The Soft Studio seeks to be perfectly positioned - both
  literally and figuratively - to increase the mere 13% transfer rate from the
  junior colleges to four year institutions. 
   
   When the Soft Studio sets up shop on a junior college campus the inflatable pop-up research space allows our team of mentors to personally interact with each student and help them identify their inherent strengths and intrinsic motivations. We provide access to the appropriate resources, prompt discussions, plan workshops, facilitate role playing and conduct creative exercises all to invoke self reflection and the forging of new connections.
   
   To generate these insights we guide students through the five stages of design thinking — discovery, interpretation, ideation, experimentation and evolution — as they try to provide a new perspective or propose a solution for the social problem of their focus. 
   
   After the student has taken inventory of their existing skills and knowledge sets, built creative confidence and gone through all the stages of design thinking they can attempt membership to the Soft Studio and become a Junior Fellow. Membership will yield more resources, seed-funding and continually advising until an idea is ready to go to market.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  We’ve heard it all before; the US economy will never be as robust as the last
  generation’s, global competition has lead to the outsourcing of even our white
  collar jobs, the internet has eaten away at every major business model and the
  U.S is lagging in educational rankings but scores highest in student debt. Not
  to mention that we Millennials are rejecting the social conventions that built
  this country while on track to becoming the most educated generation in
  American history with the least amount of “opportunities.”
   
   But, we’re a bit more optimistic than what these catastrophic cliches would have us believe. The Millennials have created a world where we can crowdfund ideas, crowdsource a task, create compelling content in a few strokes with virtually no funding and a wifi signal is all we need to connect and share our lives. We can start a business within days, raise awareness for a cause within hours and delve into the digital archives to learn about any topic at a moment’s notice.
   
   In years prior, money was a major prerequisite to most creation but the economies of scale that the internet has made possible leaves only restrictions of the imagination. How do you teach someone to come up with the next socially disruptive technology? How do you prepare students for jobs that have not been created yet? How do you help someone spot an opportunity?
   
   Currently, as a stopgap measure, we co-teach the Junior Fellows Program, a transdisciplinary research seminar that empowers students to craft new insights into social phenomenons, at Woodbury University. Students are selected after submitting a research proposal making an inquiry about a major societal problem such as food deserts in low income communities, the rise of autism or blatant election fraud in developing countries — social problems that can’t be understood from solely one disciplinary lens making a transdisciplinary approach necessary.
   
   For higher education institutions to remain a viable economic option they have to help students be self-directed learners who use procedural knowledge, analytic abilities and strategy to synthesize prior experience to creatively generate original work that will result in the formation of new knowledge.
   
   The Soft Studio is our attempt to reach beyond our campus and use our methodology to cultivate and empower emerging leaders county-wide. We hope to activate education for the purposes of social innovation.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The Soft Studio targets the crop of millennials who, currently floating in and
  out of junior college, are in a distinct predicament of wanting to pursue
  something of personal significance but feel anxious over the diminishing
  options in this increasingly automated and global economy. 
   
   Our pre-accelerator is a scalable and approachable solution for any junior college student because we first redefine social entrepreneurship as turning “problems into pay.” The Soft Studio is very frank in its approach to the sometimes idealistic notions of social entrepreneurship. We believe students can both provide a very valuable solution to a real world problem and still fulfill their needs for economic stability and growth at the same time.
   
   Often junior community college students on the lower end of GPA spectrum find the front loaded General Education requirements irrelevant or unrelated to their interests which can lead to increased chances of dropping out. Given the recent surge in research on early intervention and its effects on retention, the Soft Studio will focus on students who may not fit comfortably into the sequence of higher education but who may be more entrepreneurial in spirit. 
   
   Although the Soft Studio’s goal is to provide practical and profitable ideas around a student centered problem, we use the studio as an intervention to also establish creative confidence for all participants who complete the workshop.
   
   Our students have gone on to take their research to inform a business plan, serve as the foundation for a non-profit or be the motivation for product design. Ultimately, we want to help them develop a strategic plan for their life’s work that will enable them to be the type of ‘career mash-up artist’ that will thrive in this contemporary environment.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  The Soft Studio seeks to be the intermediary between all the junior colleges
  county-wide, regional four year institutions and the local network of startup
  accelerators to establish a pipeline of support for emerging social
  entrepreneurs.
