    We have held classes, workshops, private tutoring and currently a summer
    program in Los Angeles County. We are scheduled to run continuing programs
    in the fall at several schools and will continue to provide tutoring to all
    students. 
  one_sentence_project: 'We teach HTML, CSS and JavaScript to students in Middle School and up. '
  implement: >-
    Currently we partner with schools and organizations offering bootcamps,
    classes, workshops and private tutoring, which benefits students all over
    Los Angeles County. Furthermore, we offer scholarships to students that
    can't afford our classes. Due to difficulty of finding individuals that
    excel both in coding and teaching, the next goal of our project is to
    develop a web based application that will give us access to a greater
    instructor pool and allow us to teach students all across Los Angeles
    County. 
  impact_learn: "Coding is the single most in-demand and marketable skill in the world today. We are teaching kids to code using the same tools and best practices used by industry professionals. Our program will not only teach students this very useful skill, but helps teach students to think logically and critically about any aspect of their life. \r\n\r\nOur goal is to continue to encourage a whole new group of students that may not have had the resources to pursue this endeavor in the past. \r\n\r\nProgramming will soon be a required literacy of students all over the country and students that start now will put LA among the earliest adopters of this trend."
  who_benefit: "Our project will benefit any student middle school age and up that has a desire to learn more about computer science and the field of computer programming. \r\n\r\nComputer science is America's untapped opportunity. According to code.org, there will be 1,000,000 more jobs than students by 2020, amounting to a $500 billion need. Educating LA's future workforce would ensure LA's place as a global tech hub."
  collaboration: "The City Charter School:\r\n- Confirmed\r\n- Direct access to students for implementation. A location for summer and fall programs. An association with a tech charter school. \r\n- Yes, we have held summer programs in the past and will be holding a fall course in the upcoming term. \r\n- Quality of instruction, student engagement, and administrative/parental support. \r\n\r\nDevPoint Labs\r\n- Confirmed\r\n- DevPoint Labs is an adult coding bootcamp.

  evaluate: "The number of students graduating from our program. \r\n\r\nThe number of students that continue this endeavor beyond the classroom. \r\n\r\nThe number of lines of code written. \r\n\r\nThe number of scholarships given. "
  two_lessons: "1. The ability of kids middle school age to learn and excel at coding. \r\n\r\n2. The importance of giving all people an opportunity to learn and get   excited about a new skill or ability."

    Mushroom Learning started with vision of making coding fun and accessible to
    all students, regardless of socioeconomic status. Our summer camps, classes
    and workshops not only teach coding, but also teach students how to think
    logically and in a critical manner. Our goal is to foster an early interest
    in computer science, while nurturing each students inner creative energy. 
  major_challenges: "1. Lack of talented developers that are also great teachers. Our goal is to use our web application to attract teachers from any location. \r\n\r\n2. Continually teaching the current and most useful coding languages, frameworks and techniques. We have current industry professionals doing code reviews for all the students and providing feedback on our curriculum. "

  What resources does your project need?:
    - Network/relationship support
    - Money (financial capital)
    - Volunteers/staff (human capital)
    - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
    - Community outreach
  impact_metrics: "We are teaching a skill that encourages students to take an active role in their own education. \r\n\r\nCoding helps students foster their creativity and creates a sense of educational purpose. It also teaches a skill that students can immediately use to gain economic viability at an early age.\r\n\r\nStudents that are actively involved in their education and have a concrete goal are much less likely to be suspended or expelled.
