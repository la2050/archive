Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Currently we partner with schools and organizations offering bootcamps,
  classes, workshops and private tutoring, which benefits students all over Los
  Angeles County. Furthermore, we offer scholarships to students that can't
  afford our classes. Due to difficulty of finding individuals that excel both
  in coding and teaching, the next goal of our project is to develop a web based
  application that will give us access to a greater instructor pool and allow us
  to teach students all across Los Angeles County.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Coding is the single most in-demand and marketable skill in the world today.
  We are teaching kids to code using the same tools and best practices used by
  industry professionals. Our program will not only teach students this very
  useful skill, but helps teach students to think logically and critically about
  any aspect of their life. 
   
   Our goal is to continue to encourage a whole new group of students that may not have had the resources to pursue this endeavor in the past. 
   
   Programming will soon be a required literacy of students all over the country and students that start now will put LA among the earliest adopters of this trend.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Our project will benefit any student middle school age and up that has a
  desire to learn more about computer science and the field of computer
  programming. 
   
   Computer science is America's untapped opportunity. According to code.org, there will be 1,000,000 more jobs than students by 2020, amounting to a $500 billion need. Educating LA's future workforce would ensure LA's place as a global tech hub.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: |-
