  achievable_goal: >-
    We can implement the project within the next twelve months because we have
    already been working on and developing Market Match for four years. We have
    leveraged funding from other entities including First 5 LA for families with
    children 5 and under, LA Care for participants with diabetes, Archstone
    Foundation for seniors' benefits, and Kaiser Permanente Foundation for
    logistics and infrastructure. Additional funding for benefits will enable us
    to add the 4 new markets, especially reaching the San Fernando Valley which
    is currently not served by our program.

    Hunger Action LA fights hunger and promotes healthy eating through advocacy,
    education and direct service.
  implement: "Hunger Action Los Angeles will complete the following activities to expand Market Match throughout more portions of Los Angeles County:\r\n1.\tExpanding Market Match to 8 additional markets, with 4 located in areas Hunger Action Los Angeles does not currently serve, especially the San Fernando Valley\r\n2. \tTraining current market operators; recruiting  volunteers; continuing administration of program at 18 markets; conducting meetings to coordinate promotion of Market Match activities with current and future Market Match partners; \r\n3.\tCreating specific outreach materials for seniors, families, and persons with disabilities \r\n"
  impact_live: "Market Match makes Los Angeles a better place to live by producing the following benefits:\r\n\r\n1.\tReduces hunger as vulnerable individuals and families acquire additional resources to obtain more food. \r\n2.\tImproves health as Market Match coupons can only be used on healthy items such as fresh apples, asparagus, beets and broccoli, rather than prepared foods that may be high in fat, salt and sugar. \r\n3.\tBuilds community by facilitating interaction between people in an open community space.\r\n4.\tStimulates the local economy, as participating local farmers gain revenue generated by increased sales at the farmers’ market, rather than the money being sent out of state through the purchase of non-Californian produce. \r\n5.\tExpands the local sustainable agriculture sector, improving the environment in the process.\r\n6.\tCreates connections with other nonprofit organizations working on similar issues, developing a network of readily available resources that participants can conveniently access. \r\n"
  who_benefit: >-
    The project specifically benefits the following populations: Families with
    children aged 5 and under: Seniors: Persons with physical or mental
    disabilities: Families and individuals using the CalFresh ("food stamp")
    program: and persons with diabetes receiving Medi-Cal, who have been advised
    to adjust their diet to include more vegetables.
  partners_collaboration: >-
    Currently participating partners include The Ecology Center, which is
    coordinating several Market Match programs statewide: SEE-LA, who operate 7
    farmers markets in Los Angeles and also administer the program: and our
    partner farmers market organizations who host the program at their markets,
    including: Certified Farmers Market Management (Gardena and Adams/Vermont):
    Harbor Area Farmers Markets (Huntington Park and Long Beach): The Greener
    Good (2 other Long Beach Markets): Model Neighborhood Program (La Cienega
    and Kaiser South Bay markets): VELA (East LA and Valinda markets): Inland
    Valley Hope Partners (Pomona), Sprouts of Promise (Monterey Park), Thai CDC
    (East Hollywood), Altadena Farmers Market, City of Compton, City of Santa
    Monica, and Mar Vista Farmers Market. We also train volunteers to help with
    the program including many obtained through partnership with Cal State LA,
    Cal State Northridge, and Cal Poly Pomona. Partners in outreach to let low
    income people know about the program include Public Health Foundation
    Enterprises WIC Program, Project Angel Food, and SOVA Jewish Food Pantry
    Market
  evaluate: "We plan to measure success in three ways:\r\nCustomer surveys: Are people using the program? Are new customers coming to the farmers market as a result? Are new customers becoming regular customers at the market? Do people continue to purchase more fruits and vegetables even if the incentive match is not available? Have people improved their diets as a result of the program?\r\nFarmer surveys: Are farmers selling at markets experiencing higher income as a result of the program? Due to the income are they able to grow more food, hire more labor, or make needed improvements that further increase the productivity of their farm?\r\nThird evaluation: Objective statistics---do they show increased sales at the farmers markets, increased participation by low income persons, increased usage of CalFresh by people knowing they can get additional bonus dollars for using the program.\r\n"
  two_lessons: "1. Contrary to perception, persons in low income areas are aware of what healthy food is and would like to consumer more but are either too far away or do not have enough money to purchase the food\r\n\r\n2. Programs such as Market Match are not an unsustainable \"giveaway\" program, as they require persons to make a matching purchase from their own resources; people are willing to make this effort in order to maximize what they can obtain"
  more_detail: "Market Match makes fresh food affordable by doubling the purchasing power of individuals and families on government administered voucher or cash aid programs –CalFresh /Supplemental Security Income (SSI)/ Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI)/Social Security and Women, Infants & Children (WIC)– at participating farmers’ markets.  Eligible individuals receive $1 bonus coupons to match up to $10 of their own money or benefits.  For example, an individual on SSI can exchange $10 cash for 20 Market Match vouchers, enabling them to purchase $20 worth of produce.  Vouchers can only be used to purchase fresh fruits and vegetables on the same day recipients receive it. \r\n"
  major_challenges: "The first major barrier is actually having insufficient funding due to the outreach. Our strategy is to use the program's success to attract more funding by demonstrating objective health outcome results from a limited implementation of the program, and how those results would be improved by a more extensive implementation of the program. If we show good health outcomes at  a program serving 18 markets in the county, we can demonstrate that the county would benefit by extension of the program to 22 markets (and further, thereafter.)\r\n\r\nThe second barrier is that farmers markets are often not convenient for low income working people due to the limited days and hours of the markets. We would explore solutions that would accommodate people who would not be able to arrive at markets during their hours of operations, such as assembling bags of produce for distribution at more convenient times for them.

  The Cyber Insecurity Initiative has four main phases: planning, assessment,
  analysis, and recommendations. The planning phase will consist of securing
  appropriate permissions from LA County’s 122 licensed hospitals for
  participation, designing questionnaires and interview guides to conduct the
  vulnerability assessments, and coordinating the logistics to carry out the
  plan. There may be reluctance to have participants do an Internet survey, so
  we will do both a person-to-person as well as a text survey (using text to
  database technology we developed). All information will be confidential and
  not attributed to any one hospital. Only combined data will be shown in any
  report. The assessment phase involves scheduling and conducting interviews
  with five groups that have input. Special emphasis will be placed on achieving
  a balance of each hospital’s EHR buyers, users, emergency managers,
  administrators, and compliance officers. The questionnaires and interviews
  will provide the foundation of the vulnerability assessment, complemented by
  subject matter expert evaluations. The analysis phase requires thorough
  statistical analysis of all data. One key goal is to compare and evaluate
  vulnerability perceptions (as documented in the questionnaires and interviews)
  with actual vulnerabilities (as documented by cybersecurity professionals
  working with us as well as the literature). The recommendations phase begins
  with preparing reports and presentation materials, culminating with the
  presentation of findings with recommendations to improve cybersecurity to the
  entire hospital community. Specific collaborators for the initiative’s
  findings and recommendations are the Hospital Association of Southern
  California, the Hospital Corporation of America (pending), the UCLA Center for
  Public Health and Disasters, the LA County EMS Agency, Red-E Consulting, and
  the California Hospital Association.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  The residents and visitors of LA County deserve and expect a safe, reliable
  healthcare system that protects their personal health information and provides
  unimpeded information to the appropriate provider in a timely manner. We are
  still at the dawn of a rapidly evolving technological age in healthcare. As
  our use of healthcare technology and cyberspace expands, so do the
  cybersecurity threats. The Cyber Insecurity Initiative will proactively
  address these concerns now, guiding our use of new technology in a safe and
  responsible manner. By 2050, healthcare will be totally dependent on
  technology and cyberspace, and the decisions we make now will allow LA to take
  full advantage of benefits offered by reliable, digitized healthcare while
  proactively minimizing the risks to the private health information of every
  individual who uses LA County’s hospitals. 
   
   Furthermore, in a world that is shrinking due to technology, the Cyber Insecurity Initiative will keep Los Angeles at the forefront of healthcare in an increasingly globalized world. LA is a truly global city. As of 2013, there were 3.5 million foreign-born residents in LA County, and there are 135 different languages spoken here. An estimated 1 in 10 residents is undocumented, and we have millions of international visitors every year. LAX is the sixth busiest airport in the world. For the health of our residents and visitors, our economic prosperity requires a world class healthcare system that maximizes the safe and responsible use of EHRs 
   
   Additionally, disasters and public health emergencies (such as biological terrorism and pandemic diseases) must be considered. If used to its potential, our healthcare system can use EHRs to mitigate the effects of a disaster and speed the public health emergency response and recovery. In fact, the effective use of EHRs even has the potential to mitigate a pandemic disease in its tracks. This can only be achieved, however, if the system is safe and secure. 
   
   Finally, the routine and safe use of EHRs will drastically improve the daily lives of all LA County residents and visitors. Healthcare can be provided faster, more effectively, more efficiently, and cheaper thanks to the benefits of digitized healthcare. The Cyber Insecurity Initiative will ensure that we do so in a way that minimizes or negates the potential risks to digitized healthcare as we approach 2050. Residents will feel safer knowing that their medical privacy is secure and the system is working well.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The Los Angeles County healthcare system is an essential public service
  available to all residents and visitors. Whether or not a specific individual
  is using that system at any given point in time, everyone in LA can benefit
  from that public good. While our thoughts go first to the ill or injured who
  currently require hospital care, everyone in LA knows that the emergency
  medical services, emergency rooms, and world class healthcare in general are
  available to them and their families, if needed. Whether directly or
  indirectly, all of us benefit from our healthcare system. A well functioning
  healthcare system is essential to a vibrant, resilient community that can
  continue to thrive. In the new century, a comprehensive, long-term approach to
  healthcare cybersecurity is essential to the reliability and public trust of
  the healthcare system.
   
   The cyber security concerns include security breaches, data loss, data for ransom, data corruption Internet breakdown, electrical breakdown, and other hazards that will negatively impact our population’s health in an environment where we are rapidly becoming more and more dependent on digitized healthcare records. Whether caused by a terrorist, a hacker, an accident, or a disaster, the residents and visitors of LA can be assured that their healthcare information is safer thanks to the Cyber Insecurity Initiative. 
   
   The following examples illustrate the extent of modern security breaches. As healthcare becomes increasingly dependent on digital records, the impact of these breaches will rise. According to a report by a cyber security firm called Redspin, there was a 97% increase in health record breaches from 2010-2011. Ponemon found that these breaches cost the hacked organization approximately $240 per record. In 2011, TRICARE lost their EHR back-up tapes, affecting almost 5 million patients. In 2010, the North Bronx Healthcare Network had 1.7 million EHRs stolen by a hacker. In 2009, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Tennessee had a hard drive with over one million EHRs stolen. These are among many examples of the mounting risks associated with the transition to EHRs. The costs associated with EHR security breaches are tremendous, and the potential impact on the public’s faith in healthcare providers is even greater.
   
   Additionally, the methodology we use can be adapted to other infrastructure, such as public health, public safety (police and fire), emergency management, transportation, electrical grid, public works, etc.
