Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  The Cyber Insecurity Initiative has four main phases: planning, assessment,
  analysis, and recommendations. The planning phase will consist of securing
  appropriate permissions from LA County’s 122 licensed hospitals for
  participation, designing questionnaires and interview guides to conduct the
  vulnerability assessments, and coordinating the logistics to carry out the
  plan. There may be reluctance to have participants do an Internet survey, so
  we will do both a person-to-person as well as a text survey (using text to
  database technology we developed). All information will be confidential and
  not attributed to any one hospital. Only combined data will be shown in any
  report. The assessment phase involves scheduling and conducting interviews
  with five groups that have input. Special emphasis will be placed on achieving
  a balance of each hospital’s EHR buyers, users, emergency managers,
  administrators, and compliance officers. The questionnaires and interviews
  will provide the foundation of the vulnerability assessment, complemented by
  subject matter expert evaluations. The analysis phase requires thorough
  statistical analysis of all data. One key goal is to compare and evaluate
  vulnerability perceptions (as documented in the questionnaires and interviews)
  with actual vulnerabilities (as documented by cybersecurity professionals
  working with us as well as the literature). The recommendations phase begins
  with preparing reports and presentation materials, culminating with the
  presentation of findings with recommendations to improve cybersecurity to the
  entire hospital community. Specific collaborators for the initiative’s
  findings and recommendations are the Hospital Association of Southern
  California, the Hospital Corporation of America (pending), the UCLA Center for
  Public Health and Disasters, the LA County EMS Agency, Red-E Consulting, and
  the California Hospital Association.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  The residents and visitors of LA County deserve and expect a safe, reliable
  healthcare system that protects their personal health information and provides
  unimpeded information to the appropriate provider in a timely manner. We are
  still at the dawn of a rapidly evolving technological age in healthcare. As
  our use of healthcare technology and cyberspace expands, so do the
  cybersecurity threats. The Cyber Insecurity Initiative will proactively
  address these concerns now, guiding our use of new technology in a safe and
  responsible manner. By 2050, healthcare will be totally dependent on
  technology and cyberspace, and the decisions we make now will allow LA to take
  full advantage of benefits offered by reliable, digitized healthcare while
  proactively minimizing the risks to the private health information of every
  individual who uses LA County’s hospitals. 
   
   Furthermore, in a world that is shrinking due to technology, the Cyber Insecurity Initiative will keep Los Angeles at the forefront of healthcare in an increasingly globalized world. LA is a truly global city. As of 2013, there were 3.5 million foreign-born residents in LA County, and there are 135 different languages spoken here. An estimated 1 in 10 residents is undocumented, and we have millions of international visitors every year. LAX is the sixth busiest airport in the world. For the health of our residents and visitors, our economic prosperity requires a world class healthcare system that maximizes the safe and responsible use of EHRs 
   
   Additionally, disasters and public health emergencies (such as biological terrorism and pandemic diseases) must be considered. If used to its potential, our healthcare system can use EHRs to mitigate the effects of a disaster and speed the public health emergency response and recovery. In fact, the effective use of EHRs even has the potential to mitigate a pandemic disease in its tracks. This can only be achieved, however, if the system is safe and secure. 
   
   Finally, the routine and safe use of EHRs will drastically improve the daily lives of all LA County residents and visitors. Healthcare can be provided faster, more effectively, more efficiently, and cheaper thanks to the benefits of digitized healthcare. The Cyber Insecurity Initiative will ensure that we do so in a way that minimizes or negates the potential risks to digitized healthcare as we approach 2050. Residents will feel safer knowing that their medical privacy is secure and the system is working well.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The Los Angeles County healthcare system is an essential public service
  available to all residents and visitors. Whether or not a specific individual
  is using that system at any given point in time, everyone in LA can benefit
  from that public good. While our thoughts go first to the ill or injured who
  currently require hospital care, everyone in LA knows that the emergency
  medical services, emergency rooms, and world class healthcare in general are
  available to them and their families, if needed. Whether directly or
  indirectly, all of us benefit from our healthcare system. A well functioning
  healthcare system is essential to a vibrant, resilient community that can
  continue to thrive. In the new century, a comprehensive, long-term approach to
  healthcare cybersecurity is essential to the reliability and public trust of
  the healthcare system.
   
   The cyber security concerns include security breaches, data loss, data for ransom, data corruption Internet breakdown, electrical breakdown, and other hazards that will negatively impact our population’s health in an environment where we are rapidly becoming more and more dependent on digitized healthcare records. Whether caused by a terrorist, a hacker, an accident, or a disaster, the residents and visitors of LA can be assured that their healthcare information is safer thanks to the Cyber Insecurity Initiative. 
   
   The following examples illustrate the extent of modern security breaches. As healthcare becomes increasingly dependent on digital records, the impact of these breaches will rise. According to a report by a cyber security firm called Redspin, there was a 97% increase in health record breaches from 2010-2011. Ponemon found that these breaches cost the hacked organization approximately $240 per record. In 2011, TRICARE lost their EHR back-up tapes, affecting almost 5 million patients. In 2010, the North Bronx Healthcare Network had 1.7 million EHRs stolen by a hacker. In 2009, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Tennessee had a hard drive with over one million EHRs stolen. These are among many examples of the mounting risks associated with the transition to EHRs. The costs associated with EHR security breaches are tremendous, and the potential impact on the public’s faith in healthcare providers is even greater.
   
   Additionally, the methodology we use can be adapted to other infrastructure, such as public health, public safety (police and fire), emergency management, transportation, electrical grid, public works, etc.
