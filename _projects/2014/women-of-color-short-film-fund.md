LA COUNTY: >-
  LA takes leap to change Hollywood statistics and the future of cinema with a
  series of provocative #shortfilms by #WomenofColor.
OTHER: >-
  We propose to make a series of short films by cutting edge Women of Color in
  LA for the purpose of exposing their talent and capabilities to hiring
  executives, the LA public and online community. We will select the filmmakers,
  help produce, fund, and distribute the films. 
   
   We need more storytelling by Women of Color about their experiences as Angelenos, as they themselves see it. Hollywood definitely has a dearth of Women of Color in film. Only 1 out 500 Top Films in History have ever featured a live action Woman of Color. There's a danger in only being shown LA and the world through the point of view of the status quo. Women of Color in the LA community need to speak for themselves and film is the world's most far reaching media.
Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  If Los Angeles and Hollywood don't nurture and invite new voices as an example
  of an inclusive modern city, then who will? We can lead the diversification of
  cinema and help improve the statistics for women of color creatives in the
  entertainment industry. 
   
   This would be a landmark for other cities to follow and showcase their diverse voices. Women of Color initiatives have never been done this way anywhere before, so why not in the city that makes the most filmed media in the universe? We have the talent but we need support in making a statement to our networks and studios that Women of Color are capable and cutting edge creatives for hire. Statistics say women often leave the film industry, when they are often pushed out for not getting opportunities that men and white people do. We feel it's a shame that LA is such a melting pot of cultures, but our most dominant industry is negligent of this fact. 
   
   As an example- London has better initiatives set up to make films that are made by Londoners that show off multi-cultural voices. Many of their funding initiatives mandate diversity now. We, LA- the seat of Hollywood don't have anything built in like this, yet.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Everyone of every color, creed, age and gender will feel like their lives in
  LA count when they can see diversity accurately represented in the short films
  funded by this program. These films will show LA as a beacon for all to
  express themselves via film (what we're known for). It is also important for
  the future of LA that we send the message to younger generations that their
  voice matters regardless of ethnic background and gender. People everywhere
  will be able to see Los Angeles in a different light, a true modern city where
  opportunities lie for all.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: |-
