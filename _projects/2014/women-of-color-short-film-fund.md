Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  LA takes leap to change Hollywood statistics and the future of cinema with a
  series of provocative #shortfilms by #WomenofColor.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  We propose to make a series of short films by cutting edge Women of Color in
  LA for the purpose of exposing their talent and capabilities to hiring
  executives, the LA public and online community. We will select the filmmakers,
  help produce, fund, and distribute the films. 
   
   We need more storytelling by Women of Color about their experiences as Angelenos, as they themselves see it. Hollywood definitely has a dearth of Women of Color in film. Only 1 out 500 Top Films in History have ever featured a live action Woman of Color. There's a danger in only being shown LA and the world through the point of view of the status quo. Women of Color in the LA community need to speak for themselves and film is the world's most far reaching media.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  If Los Angeles and Hollywood don't nurture and invite new voices as an example
  of an inclusive modern city, then who will? We can lead the diversification of
  cinema and help improve the statistics for women of color creatives in the
  entertainment industry. 
   
   This would be a landmark for other cities to follow and showcase their diverse voices. Women of Color initiatives have never been done this way anywhere before, so why not in the city that makes the most filmed media in the universe? We have the talent but we need support in making a statement to our networks and studios that Women of Color are capable and cutting edge creatives for hire. Statistics say women often leave the film industry, when they are often pushed out for not getting opportunities that men and white people do. We feel it's a shame that LA is such a melting pot of cultures, but our most dominant industry is negligent of this fact. 
   
   As an example- London has better initiatives set up to make films that are made by Londoners that show off multi-cultural voices. Many of their funding initiatives mandate diversity now. We, LA- the seat of Hollywood don't have anything built in like this, yet.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Everyone of every color, creed, age and gender will feel like their lives in
  LA count when they can see diversity accurately represented in the short films
  funded by this program. These films will show LA as a beacon for all to
  express themselves via film (what we're known for). It is also important for
  the future of LA that we send the message to younger generations that their
  voice matters regardless of ethnic background and gender. People everywhere
  will be able to see Los Angeles in a different light, a true modern city where
  opportunities lie for all.

(We hope this project will kickstart a festival in 2016). \r\n\r\nThese short films can encourage tourism, by showing facets of LA only these Women of Color will be able to capture and express!

  evaluate: "Short films made in the program that get into national and international film festivals will lead to positive exposure and possible funding of feature length films to show off The City of Los Angeles. \r\n\r\nMore Women of Color applying and getting into LA film schools\r\n\r\nMore sponsors and hiring initiatives for Women of Color in Hollywood"
  two_lessons: "You have to go upstream to change scripted representation for women and women of color, not sit back and watch dismal numbers come in. We must have intervention to get to hear those who are not given the chances to tell their stories. The talent is out there and ready for opportunities. \r\n\r\nWomen of Color have contributed greatly to the big picture of LA as a city and this should be reflected in things we have the choice of viewing. If all we have is stories about only certain segments of society, how will we ever become cohesive and stronger as a city and have a stronger city-wide identity and brand with one another? The market shoots itself in the foot in that it doesn't care about voices getting a fair shot: http://mic.com/articles/84899/hollywood-s-problem-with-women-of-color-is-even-worse-than-you-realize\r\n\r\n"
  achievable_goal: "One full calendar year is a perfect production cycle for 3-5 short films. We will need 1-2 months for outreach and selection of filmmakers, 1 month for screenwriting and notes, two months for pre-production, a month for production, and 3 months for post production. Our administrators will be connecting resources, maintaining online presence and preparing for distribution throughout the year. We are excited about the 1 year challenge and believe it is consistent with timelines given to film students at top film schools. \r\n\r\nThere will be absolute tangible results in one year."
  major_challenges: "There maybe push-back from those who think helping minorities and women is \"reverse racism\". We will ensure that everyone knows this is a community wide project that can include the support from all types of members. We will encourage a wide variety of volunteers, production workers, and collaborators in order to support the aim of this project. \r\n\r\nWith film production, there are always fires to put out, deadlines and budgets to which to adhere. To ensure things get done, there will be  advisers to attend to production issues. We will also look out for further grants, donors, and crowdfunding opportunities when necessary."
  competition: "There are no other groups doing something like this that we know of. This project is unique because it will involve men and women in uplifting Women of Color.\r\n\r\nThere have been \"women's initiatives\" for female directors sponsored by AFI and the Sundance Institute, but the majority of those chosen turn out each year to be wealthy white women who have been able to afford to make their own short films in the past. We want Women of Color Angelenos who otherwise couldn't afford to put their point of views into film form. \r\n\r\nThere is also an annual Queer Women of Color Film Festival through Outfest that limits the participation of WOC to LGBT members. We want to open the opportunity further and select Women of Color filmmakers by the strength of their point of views. "
  cost: "We intend to keep to the budget of 100k for three to five films. In the event that a film costs more than the allotted amount we will encourage seeking other grant opportunities and crowd funding such as Kickstarter with the leadership of the filmmakers. \r\n\r\nWe hope to cut down the cost of locations and permits with the help of the City of LA where applicable and community partnerships. "
  budget: "Upto 5 projects will receive a modest 15-17k towards making the film. This budget will be broken down more specifically when the details of the project emerge. This will include costs of food, minimum wage where it applies, cast payroll, equipment, transportation, locations, wardrobe and production design. \r\n\r\n10k will be used for administrative expenses, small stipend, publicity, and meeting related costs. \r\n\r\nThe remaining 5k will be used towards online distribution and a community screening event. \r\n\r\nWe will adjust and update the budget accordingly but it is our goal to stay within 100K. \r\n\r\nTotal is 100,000.00 for five films showing the world LA supports diverse stories in film"

    answer: "Our project will encourage more Women of Color to apply to film schools and strengthen their career goals. \r\n\r\nThis project will encourage real and \"reel\" change and find sponsors, not just mentors for Women of Color.\r\n\r\nA film festival dedicated to the creative works of Women of Color would bring revenues to the city as well as corporate partnerships, publicity, workshops, panel events, educational events, and a sense of pride and community. (We hope this project will kickstart a festival in 2016). \r\n\r\nThese short films can encourage tourism, by showing facets of LA only these Women of Color will be able to capture and express! (Much like Sideways created a boom in the Los Olivos area). "

    answer: "You have to go upstream to change scripted representation for women and women of color, not sit back and watch dismal numbers come in. We must have intervention to get to hear those who are not given the chances to tell their stories. The talent is out there and ready for opportunities. \r\n\r\nWomen of Color have contributed greatly to the big picture of LA as a city and this should be reflected in things we have the choice of viewing. If all we have is stories about only certain segments of society, how will we ever become cohesive and stronger as a city and have a stronger city-wide identity and brand with one another? The market shoots itself in the foot in that it doesn't care about voices getting a fair shot: http://mic.com/articles/84899/hollywood-s-problem-with-women-of-color-is-even-worse-than-you-realize\r\n\r\n"

    answer: "One full calendar year is a perfect production cycle for 3-5 short films. We will need 1-2 months for outreach and selection of filmmakers, 1 month for screenwriting and notes, two months for pre-production, a month for production, and 3 months for post production. Our administrators will be connecting resources, maintaining online presence and preparing for distribution throughout the year. We are excited about the 1 year challenge and believe it is consistent with timelines given to film students at top film schools. \r\n\r\nThere will be absolute tangible results in one year."

    answer: "There maybe push-back from those who think helping minorities and women is \"reverse racism\". We will ensure that everyone knows this is a community wide project that can include the support from all types of members. We will encourage a wide variety of volunteers, production workers, and collaborators in order to support the aim of this project. \r\n\r\nWith film production, there are always fires to put out, deadlines and budgets to which to adhere. To ensure things get done, there will be  advisers to attend to production issues. We will also look out for further grants, donors, and crowdfunding opportunities when necessary."

    answer: "There are no other groups doing something like this that we know of. This project is unique because it will involve men and women in uplifting Women of Color.\r\n\r\nThere have been \"women's initiatives\" for female directors sponsored by AFI and the Sundance Institute, but the majority of those chosen turn out each year to be wealthy white women who have been able to afford to make their own short films in the past. We want Women of Color Angelenos who otherwise couldn't afford to put their point of views into film form. \r\n\r\nThere is also an annual Queer Women of Color Film Festival through Outfest that limits the participation of WOC to LGBT members. We want to open the opportunity further and select Women of Color filmmakers by the strength of their point of views. "

    answer: "We intend to keep to the budget of 100k for three to five films. In the event that a film costs more than the allotted amount we will encourage seeking other grant opportunities and crowd funding such as Kickstarter with the leadership of the filmmakers. \r\n\r\nWe hope to cut down the cost of locations and permits with the help of the City of LA where applicable and community partnerships.

    explanation: ''
    answer: "Upto 5 projects will receive a modest 15-17k towards making the film. This budget will be broken down more specifically when the details of the project emerge. This will include costs of food, minimum wage where it applies, cast payroll, equipment, transportation, locations, wardrobe and production design. \r\n\r\n10k will be used for administrative expenses, small stipend, publicity, and meeting related costs. \r\n\r\nThe remaining 5k will be used towards online distribution and a community screening event. \r\n\r\nWe will adjust and update the budget accordingly but it is our goal to stay within 100K. \r\n\r\nTotal is 100,000.00 for five films showing the world LA supports diverse stories in film"
