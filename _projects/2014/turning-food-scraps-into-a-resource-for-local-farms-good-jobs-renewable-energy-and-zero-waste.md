Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Imagine Los Angeles after a major earthquake. Experts predict that the biggest
  risks to LA are the impacts to our aging infrastructure. Broken water pipes,
  downed power lines and collapsed roads could leave Angelenos without water,
  power or access to food for days, weeks or months, undermining the very fabric
  of our city. The more that communities can rely upon alternative sources of
  water and energy, locally grown food, and connections between neighbors, the
  better able we will be to survive without outside support in emergencies, and
  the better our everyday quality of life will be. Our team will develop a
  rating system that leverages existing resilience toolkits to help
  decision-makers implement resilience strategies for projects ranging from new
  construction to existing building operations at the scale of single buildings
  to entire neighborhoods or campuses. 
   
   Well-designed rating systems can change the world. The USGBC’s LEED systems transformed the building industry, moving green building into the mainstream. Enterprise’s Green Communities Criteria (EGC) raised the bar for affordable housing nationwide. We will build on these approaches to design a tool to take projects beyond green to true resilience. 
   
   To do this, we will assemble an Advisory Committee of diverse technical experts and community leaders. We will train two interns from LA Community College District to build capacity in resilience. We will survey two test case projects: the development of an emergency preparedness plan for LACCD, and an urban infill adaptive re-use development near a large regional infrastructure project. We will evaluate the best available existing resources from LEED, EGC, 100Resilient Cities, Los Angeles County Community Disaster Resilience Project, USRC’s CoRE program and Arup’s REDI program and others to ensure that our system builds on and complements work that is already being done. We will reference existing processes or strategies that are relevant to our target audience; where none are available, we will develop them within the scope of this project, or we will pursue additional funds or collaborators to create them. The rating system will include a process for engaging stakeholders and evaluating risks and a library of best practices and performance targets for resilience strategies. The system will balance simplicity and technical specificity so building projects can act, and will reward qualifying projects with third-party certification and recognition
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  LA faces many threats beyond earthquakes. Climate change will bring more
  drought, more heat waves, bigger storms and rising sea levels, as well as
  disruptions in agriculture, energy supply and other economic impacts. Add to
  this our aging infrastructure, rising housing costs and high unemployment.
  Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy have given us a preview of coming attractions of
  what can happen in a disaster. Without taking drastic action, LA is at risk.
  We must prepare for the worst by helping to create the best LA now.
   
   The good news is that resilience strategies can solve more than one problem at a time. The answer lies in making our core systems stronger, our built environment more durable, our infrastructure more distributed, and our communities more connected. For example, using reclaimed water or on-site solar power not only can support what the Resilient Design Institute founder Alex Wilson calls “passive survivability,” they also reduce utility bills and carbon emissions. Community gardens not only support a distributed food supply, they also provide fresh and healthy food, exercise and opportunities for community members to connect. Tree plantings not only provide shade in a warmed climate and help with stormwater management, they also provide cleaner air, habitat and beauty in the short term. Community-based healthcare facilities not only decentralize the location of potential first responders, they also enable broader access and programs that are tailored to local populations. And the work needed to implement all of these strategies for the future can create good jobs today. Moving toward resilience not only will prepare us for disaster, it will provide an opportunity for us to create the LA of our dreams. 
   
   The goal of the of the LA Resilience Rating System is to provide projects with a road map for tackling tough issues in ways that achieve measurable results, prepare them for disasters in the future, and enable them to recover quickly and fully to a place of health and vitality. Investing in preparation for the future means improving quality of life today.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Overall, this project’s implementation will help anyone who lives or works in
  or around a building that employs this rating system, improving quality of
  life in the near term and mitigating catastrophe in the long term. Residents
  and employees at participating buildings will feel the benefits most directly,
  but it will also help achieve the goals of property owners, developers,
  community development corporations and city leaders. With specific processes,
  best practices and performance metrics, this project has the potential to
  elevate the evaluation and implementation of resilience at a range of scales. 
   
   In particular the L.A. Resilience Rating System will:
   • Provide resilience-related technical guidance to our test case projects
   • Give technical guidance and recognitions to anyone working on a building-related project in the region, including building owners, developers, campuses, community groups, planning/design/construction professionals, and facilities operators 
   • Provide a process for project teams to actively engage communities within or adjacent to their projects
   • Provide clear performance criteria that can be used by those involved in evaluating, approving, regulating or funding projects, including local officials, community groups, banks and lenders, or insurance providers, in order to verify that projects reduce risks and serve the public good. 
   • Offer a usable model to other organizations and cities seeking to address resilience
   • Create an opportunity for interdisciplinary collaboration and collective learning among members of the Advisory Committee
   • Support emerging leaders from LACCD campuses and build capacity around resilience
   • Provide a resource for all USGBC and Enterprise stakeholders on topics that are not fully currently addressed by existing rating systems, including social equity and disaster preparedness
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  The US Green Building Council’s LA Chapter (USGBC-LA) will lead this project
  in collaboration with the Enterprise Community Partners Southern California
  office and the LA Community College District. USGBC-LA is a non-profit whose
  mission is to promote sustainability in Southern California’s built
  environment by delivering access to knowledge, resources, recognition and
  networking. The USGBC is the nation’s foremost environmental coalition, and
  innovator of the LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Rating
  System. 
   
   LACCD is the largest community college system in the USA with 9 campuses and 250,000 students. USGBC-LA and LACCD have been in partnership on training, building, and strengthening the green workforce in LA for the past ten years. Projects include yearly conferences, trainings on sustainable facility operations, and the City's Green Business Certification Program. LACCD is about to launch a process to develop emergency preparedness plans for each of its nine campuses. The diverse facilities, communities and programs that each campus represents will provide real world test cases for our team to consider in order to ensure that our final products are feasible, relevant and effective for a wide range of conditions. We will also offer two 6-month funded internships to LACCD students from relevant disciplines.
   
   Enterprise Community Partners is a national nonprofit community investment company providing expertise for developing affordable housing and building sustainable communities. Enterprise has worked closely with USGBC National on a variety of projects including the development of the Enterprise Green Communities Criteria. Enterprise has invested more than $1 billion in Southern California to expand the supply of green, affordable housing and is committed to advancing equitable transit-oriented development. They bring technical expertise in rating systems development as well as the direct and test case projects development, financing and implementation of new construction, adaptive reuse, renewable energy, and green infrastructure projects. 
   
   The keys to the success of this collaboration are open communication, mutual respect and a clear work plan. Ultimately, our shared commitment to the core goals of resilience and our shared vision of the potential of this project to bring positive change to the region underlie all of our interactions and will enable us to be successful.
