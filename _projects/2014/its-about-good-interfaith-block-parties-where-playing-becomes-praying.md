  Partnering with the Interfaith Religious Council of Los Angeles, the Office of
  Religious Life at USC, and local places of worship across Los Angeles, each
  event will require a diverse body of actors to plan it, promote it, and
  execute it. In highlighting the spiritual elements of each community it is in,
  It's About Good Interfaith Block Parties will be family friendly opportunities
  to come together, be educated, dance, have a great time, and celebrate
  religious diversity and pluralism of Los Angeles. The intention behind each
  event will be to mobilize community service across faith-lines in that
  community, as well as educate the local community about different expressions
  of faith and worship. For instance, the Hollywood event would enable a
  Christian church like Mosaic, the Self-Realization Fellowship, Temple of
  Israel Hollywood, and other places of faith to have a common purpose and learn
  from one another. Holy Ghost Global has experience executing such events in
  unique venues like the Burning Man Art Festival, South by Southwest in Austin,
  on the Venice Beach Boardwalk, and other places. 
    
   Holy Ghost Global will serve as the relationship broker and visionary for each event, work to secure venues, artists, vendors, and others that will make the event a success. Each event will be based around a universal concept - Hollywood will celebrate the free flow of information, innovation, social media, and use of technology through a media hackathon and scavenger hunt for filmmakers, technologists, and entrepreneurs across Hollywood Blvd.; Echo Park will focus on creativity, arts, and freedom of expression expressed through a music festival that highlights dance, music, art, and poetry in Echo Park; Wilmington/South Bay will focus on youth involvement, cross-cultural learning, and sports with a kind of spiritual olympics held near the Korean Bell with teachers, parents, and students in the South Bay; Santa Monica will host a healing arts exposition near the Pier to highlight alternative therapies, educate Los Angelenos on health care choices, and hear Ted Talks from Health Care professionals and experts. The Prayer Day event will be on May 7th. Faith leaders on staff at the Office of Religious Life, and many others from across Los Angeles, will join with students and faculty together with city officials, public servants, and citizens for musically-based intercessory prayer for Los Angeles and the globe.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  This project will unite Los Angeles around faith, rather than divide it. Most
  of the world, especially the Middle East and the continent of Africa, is
  increasingly at war because of religious belief. As the most religiously
  diverse city on the face of the earth, Los Angeles has the privilege and
  opportunity to show the broad spectrum of faith expressions. Every human asks
  questions about the existence of God - but we all express this question
  differently. Using geographic location and different mediums, we open up the
  question to individual expression rather than suppress it, ignore it, or
  belittle it. The center of all religion is truth and love. It's About Good
  Interfaith Block Parties help to embolden the conversation and expression of
  faith in Los Angeles for the purpose of serving others and promoting universal
  good. 
   
   The millenial generation is the least religiously involved generation of American history, but the most civically engaged. There are fewer and fewer venues for real, open, honest conversations about faith in God. While religious differences are portrayed more starkly, religious moderates who use their faith to empower their service to the community are marginalized. 
   
   The purpose of these block parties is to bridge generations - baby boomers who were raised in places of worships and are becoming more and more religious as they grow older due to health and other reasons, and millenials who are not in traditional houses of worship, but want to live their faith by their works. 
   
   Furthermore, the context of faith will guarantee family friendly content, supportive and positive energy, and a spirit of brotherly love. We have the opportunity to prepare the next generation, those who will be running the city in 2050, to not abandon faith, but rather see it as necessarily entwined in every aspect of the social and civic spheres of Los Angeles. These events open up the opportunity for morals, ethics, and mores to be instilled in a relevant way rather than through legalistic, deadening codes and creeds. 
   
   Faith has traditionally been at the center of civilization's progress since the beginning of time. It still belongs in the center of Los Angeles whether it is technology, film, education, health care, or community service. Giving people exposure to different faiths enables them to make their own decisions and by doing it out in the open, in public spaces, the people take back the power of a relationship with God.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  It's About Good Interfaith Block Parties will most benefit Angelenos of faith
  in the specific communities where each event will be held (Santa Monica, San
  Pedro, Hollywood, Echo Park, USC). However, the benefit does not end there.
  Having these events will have a ripple effect that will empower other local
  communities to have similar events. 
   
   Also, these events will benefit local faith-organizations that may be struggling in a time of religious decline and technological innovation. This will help to breathe new life into traditional faith-based organizations and give them a reason to rally and move forward. 
   
   This project will also benefit families in the communities since each event will be tailored to be family friendly and intergenerational. 
   
   Law enforcement will be benefitted because of the peaceful, substance-free basis for community gathering and relationship building. 
   
   Local businesses will benefit since these events will attract new people into new districts and encourage participation in the local economy. 
   
   Due to the nature of social events - especially those that are clean and open and accessible to those across generations - interfaith block parties will greatly benefit the entire community.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  The Founder of Holy Ghost Global is a member of the Interfaith Religious
  Council's Future50, a select number of Los Angeles' top faith leaders. This
  organization is committed to promoting peace and harmony across faiths in Los
  Angeles and have pledged to support any project that members of the Future50
  cohort implement. There has been a collaboration with the USC Office of
  Religious Life for several years for Holy Ghost Global projects and they are a
  wonderful flag-bearer for relevant, faith-based expression. As the largest
  private employer in Los Angeles, having USC involved offers an unprecedented
  reach across the Los Angeles community. Because many of its faculty and
  student body are proclaimers of faith, they are a wonderful symbol for the
  power of faith to do good in our city and across the world. The New
  Theological Seminary of the West, the newest Christian seminary in Los
  Angeles, is a great partner for unifying and mobilizing the Los Angeles
  Christian community. Because they are less traditional in structure, they
  afford the ability to connect with houses of faith. American Jewish University
  is another potential supporter along with dozens of places of worship across
  Los Angeles. 
   
   The company Visual.ly will support the project through info graphics and other promotional materials. 
   
   The first factor that is critical to the success of this collaboration is a willingness to work across faiths and with others from different backgrounds. No prejudices, superiority complexes, or hidden agendas allowed! There must be a real openness to learn and listen from others, to look through different lenses and perspectives, and to experiment and set aside assumptions like a scientist. 
   
   The second factor is innovative use of resources and outreach strategies. Translating techniques through social media to reach immigrant populations and non-English speakers, willingness to try bold approaches to connect with local places of faith, savvy use of film and media, and access to celebrities, faith leaders, and other successful individuals will be required to drive attendance to the events. 
   
   The third factor is availability and boldness. Anyone involved should be available to knock on doors, make calls, and attend the actual block parties. In many ways, this is like a series of campaigns for God in Los Angeles. Partners need to be comfortable with their faith, not on the fence, and be willing to stand up and share it with the world!
