  impact_play: "This project will unite Los Angeles around faith, rather than divide it. Most of the world, especially the Middle East and the continent of Africa, is increasingly at war because of religious belief. As the most religiously diverse city on the face of the earth, Los Angeles has the privilege and opportunity to show the broad spectrum of faith expressions. Every human asks questions about the existence of God - but we all express this question differently. Using geographic location and different mediums, we open up the question to individual expression rather than suppress it, ignore it, or belittle it. The center of all religion is truth and love. It's About Good Interfaith Block Parties help to embolden the conversation and expression of faith in Los Angeles for the purpose of serving others and promoting universal good. \r\n\r\nThe millenial generation is the least religiously involved generation of American history, but the most civically engaged. There are fewer and fewer venues for real, open, honest conversations about faith in God. While religious differences are portrayed more starkly, religious moderates who use their faith to empower their service to the community are marginalized. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of these block parties is to bridge generations - baby boomers who were raised in places of worships and are becoming more and more religious as they grow older due to health and other reasons, and millenials who are not in traditional houses of worship, but want to live their faith by their works. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the context of faith will guarantee family friendly content, supportive and positive energy, and a spirit of brotherly love. We have the opportunity to prepare the next generation, those who will be running the city in 2050, to not abandon faith, but rather see it as necessarily entwined in every aspect of the social and civic spheres of Los Angeles. These events open up the opportunity for morals, ethics, and mores to be instilled in a relevant way rather than through legalistic, deadening codes and creeds. \r\n\r\nFaith has traditionally been at the center of civilization's progress since the beginning of time. It still belongs in the center of Los Angeles whether it is technology, film, education, health care, or community service. Giving people exposure to different faiths enables them to make their own decisions and by doing it out in the open, in public spaces, the people take back the power of a relationship with God. "
  who_benefit: "It's About Good Interfaith Block Parties will most benefit Angelenos of faith in the specific communities where each event will be held (Santa Monica, San Pedro, Hollywood, Echo Park, USC). However, the benefit does not end there. Having these events will have a ripple effect that will empower other local communities to have similar events. \r\n\r\nAlso, these events will benefit local faith-organizations that may be struggling in a time of religious decline and technological innovation. This will help to breathe new life into traditional faith-based organizations and give them a reason to rally and move forward. \r\n\r\nThis project will also benefit families in the communities since each event will be tailored to be family friendly and intergenerational. \r\n\r\nLaw enforcement will be benefitted because of the peaceful, substance-free basis for community gathering and relationship building. \r\n\r\nLocal businesses will benefit since these events will attract new people into new districts and encourage participation in the local economy. \r\n\r\nDue to the nature of social events - especially those that are clean and open and accessible to those across generations - interfaith block parties will greatly benefit the entire community.

    It's About Good Interfaith Block Parties would take place across one year in
    the four quarters of Los Angeles: Santa Monica, (Healing),
    (Education/Service), East Side (Arts), and North Side (Media/Technology) and
    on campus at USC on May 7th, 2015. Each event would highlight the cultural,
    economic, and religious diversity of each section through an interactive
    music-based event and community service project. The first would be held in
    Santa Monica and focus on healing through a Healing Arts Fair near the Santa
    Monica pier including yoga studios and practitioners, spiritual healing
    practices, medical facilities, the VA hospital, and local churches,
    synagogues and faith-based recovery centers and programs.  
  implement: "Partnering with the Interfaith Religious Council of Los Angeles, the Office of Religious Life at USC, and local places of worship across Los Angeles, each event will require a diverse body of actors to plan it, promote it, and execute it. In highlighting the spiritual elements of each community it is in, It's About Good Interfaith Block Parties will be family friendly opportunities to come together, be educated, dance, have a great time, and celebrate religious diversity and pluralism of Los Angeles. The intention behind each event will be to mobilize community service across faith-lines in that community, as well as educate the local community about different expressions of faith and worship. For instance, the Hollywood event would enable a Christian church like Mosaic, the Self-Realization Fellowship, Temple of Israel Hollywood, and other places of faith to have a common purpose and learn from one another. Holy Ghost Global has experience executing such events in unique venues like the Burning Man Art Festival, South by Southwest in Austin, on the Venice Beach Boardwalk, and other places. \r\n  \r\nHoly Ghost Global will serve as the relationship broker and visionary for each event, work to secure venues, artists, vendors, and others that will make the event a success. Each event will be based around a universal concept - Hollywood will celebrate the free flow of information, innovation, social media, and use of technology through a media hackathon and scavenger hunt for filmmakers, technologists, and entrepreneurs across Hollywood Blvd.; Echo Park will focus on creativity, arts, and freedom of expression expressed through a music festival that highlights dance, music, art, and poetry in Echo Park; Wilmington/South Bay will focus on youth involvement, cross-cultural learning, and sports with a kind of spiritual olympics held near the Korean Bell with teachers, parents, and students in the South Bay; Santa Monica will host a healing arts exposition near the Pier to highlight alternative therapies, educate Los Angelenos on health care choices, and hear Ted Talks from Health Care professionals and experts. The Prayer Day event will be on May 7th. Faith leaders on staff at the Office of Religious Life, and many others from across Los Angeles, will join with students and faculty together with city officials, public servants, and citizens for musically-based intercessory prayer for Los Angeles and the globe.

  partners_collaboration: "The Founder of Holy Ghost Global is a member of the Interfaith Religious Council's Future50, a select number of Los Angeles' top faith leaders. This organization is committed to promoting peace and harmony across faiths in Los Angeles and have pledged to support any project that members of the Future50 cohort implement. There has been a collaboration with the USC Office of Religious Life for several years for Holy Ghost Global projects and they are a wonderful flag-bearer for relevant, faith-based expression. As the largest private employer in Los Angeles, having USC involved offers an unprecedented reach across the Los Angeles community. Because many of its faculty and student body are proclaimers of faith, they are a wonderful symbol for the power of faith to do good in our city and across the world. The New Theological Seminary of the West, the newest Christian seminary in Los Angeles, is a great partner for unifying and mobilizing the Los Angeles Christian community. Because they are less traditional in structure, they afford the ability to connect with houses of faith. American Jewish University is another potential supporter along with dozens of places of worship across Los Angeles. \r\n\r\nThe company Visual.ly will support the project through info graphics and other promotional materials. \r\n\r\nThe first factor that is critical to the success of this collaboration is a willingness to work across faiths and with others from different backgrounds. No prejudices, superiority complexes, or hidden agendas allowed! There must be a real openness to learn and listen from others, to look through different lenses and perspectives, and to experiment and set aside assumptions like a scientist. \r\n\r\nThe second factor is innovative use of resources and outreach strategies. Translating techniques through social media to reach immigrant populations and non-English speakers, willingness to try bold approaches to connect with local places of faith, savvy use of film and media, and access to celebrities, faith leaders, and other successful individuals will be required to drive attendance to the events. \r\n\r\nThe third factor is availability and boldness. Anyone involved should be available to knock on doors, make calls, and attend the actual block parties. In many ways, this is like a series of campaigns for God in Los Angeles. Partners need to be comfortable with their faith, not on the fence, and be willing to stand up and share it with the world! "

  evaluate: "Success will be measured by each event's attendance, social media interaction, surveying, media, and other digital artifacts captured through each event, and a high level of participation and involvement of local places of worship. \r\n\r\nThe first metric, event attendance, will be measured by on-line reservations through a ticket service like eventbrite. Although tickets will be free, people will still be required to RSVP digitally for the event. \r\n\r\nThe second, social media interaction, will measure tweets, facebook posts, and geolocation tagging that occurs during the events on-site. \r\nThe type of content will be important - if people are discussing and sharing spiritually relevant content then that will be a success. If there are signs of interfaith interaction, ie. instagram pictures of Muslims and Christians having a fun time together, etc., then that will constitute more of a success. \r\n\r\nThe third metric, a high level of participation for places of local worship will be measured by the number of faith-based organizations that are officially sponsoring each event in the community. This can be measured by financial donation, help with promotion, openness to communication, and number of volunteers from each organization. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
  two_lessons: "The two lessons that have most informed this project come from the Holy Ghost Global team's ministry experience in Los Angeles. Whether it has been praise and worship internships with Houses of Prayer in Pasadena, Chaplaincy work in LA County prisons and the V.A. Hospital, church planting in Inglewood, healing classes with churches in Wilmington, feeding the homeless with the Dream Center in Echo Park, or music, street outreach, and Bible studies in Hollywood, there is a starvation for authentic spiritual practice in Los Angeles. \r\n\r\nServing as a religious leader in the Office of Religious Life at USC has also really informed this project. With more faiths represented than just about any other university in the United States, USC is the perfect place to learn about similarities between faiths and then put them into practice. \r\n\r\nBeing without a car for two years while living in Burbank with a full-time ministry at USC forced me bicycle and take the Metro everywhere I went During this time I began to experience the diversity of faith in Los Angeles in a very real, very authentic way. I found myself praying with tons of people - from all faith backgrounds - while on the Metro and seeing a need for alternative events and modes of play rather than lowest common denominator and destructive behaviors such as binge drinking, bar hopping, and clubbing. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, putting together similar events (albeit smaller in scope) at the Burning Man Art Festival and South by Southwest in Austin, Texas has shown me the value of open, spiritual expression that is coordinated and prepared to be open and available to people from all backgrounds. My work at these events helped reveal the \"science\" that exists behind true spiritual practice and the opportunity to unite around the scientific method when applied through events that are enjoyable to many different kinds of people. \r\n\r\nSeeing a universal interest in medicine, education, technology, and art through these events have helped me identify core elements of spirituality that all people share. I have loved seeing conversation elevated, individuality enlarged, and horizons expanded through this work and would truly love to bring these same experiences to my home city of Los Angeles. \r\n\r\n"
  achievable_goal: "Putting these five events on in the next twelve months is absolutely possible. Spacing each event out beginning in the Fall, there could be one event every three months, with the National Day of Prayer event held between the third and fourth event. \r\n\r\nWith many connections already established in these regions, and the generous funding provided by the Goldhirsch Foundation, all that would be required is the mobilization of local faith communities and other participants in order to make it happen. \r\n\r\nThe Interfaith Religious Council of Los Angeles has already pledged support for these types of events and there are over one-hundred people who are on-board, ready and willing to help make them happen.\r\n\r\n"
  major_challenges: "One major barrier/challenge to the Interfaith Block Parties are competition with other events in certain communities on weekends. The key to overcoming this barrier would be communication and logistical work done with local faith-based organizations to coordinate the best possible dates ahead of time that do not conflict with existing events. A massive on-line calendar - infrastructure that could outlive the events and continue existing to keep interfaith dialogue, relationships, and planning alive in Los Angeles - would ensure that schedules are not in conflict and everyone knows when and where the events are happening. \r\n\r\nThe second major barrier/challenge that may impede the interfaith block parties from happening are apathy or hostility of local communities and faith-based organizations. This would be alleviated by diligent door knocking, relationship building, and transparency from the beginning about the project. Training workshops about community outreach, advocacy, and service opportunities in the different communities would help bring together core constituencies that would be ideal for participating in the interfaith block parties. Furthermore, giving rotating leadership responsibilities to different organizations already active in interfaith or ecumenical work - similar to the structure of the Olympics or United Nations - would capitalize on existing interest and involvement happening. "
  competition: "Yes! Ignite-Good (of which Holy Ghost Global members are alumni of) is a non-profit that empowers social justice, entrepreneurship, and spiritual-based solutions to problems in big cities. They held their first workshop for millenials in Los Angeles over the summer and it was a great success. The Interfaith Religious Council is doing a great job of uniting the faith communities in Los Angeles and these block parties would be an extension of their existing infrastructure and work. Local communities host farmer's markets, health fairs, musical events, and hackathons all the time, but none of them are explicitly faith-based. In fact, many of them are completely devoid of faith! This helps to turn the tide away from a fear about open discussions on religion and spirituality and brings them out in the open in a context that is accessible for all. \r\n\r\nNational Day of Prayer events, as well as \"Interdependence 4th of July\", put on by the Interfaith Religious Council, are the most similar projects that I have participated in to the interfaith block parties. The key to the Interfaith Block Parties, however, would be to create a digital infrastructure and strong localized relationships that make these events annual and sustainable in each community. In some ways, these events could be considered seeds for future events that would take shape and develop according to the needs of each community. "
  cost: "Each event would have a budget of approximately $25,000. Any additional expenses would be covered by local faith-based organizations, non-profits, or businesses that want to be involved. \r\n\r\nEach event will also use indiegogo to spread the word and raise additional funding through clever campaigns that will offer rewards based on each event and its context. \r\n\r\nThe USC National Day of Prayer will be funded through the Office of Religious Life and other donors. "
  budget: "Each event will cost $25,000. \r\n\r\n$10,000 will go towards securing talent (musicians, speakers, engineers, stagehands, etc.)\r\n\r\n$10,000 will go towards venue cost and promotion. This includes digital advertising, and paying a small team to run social media strategies and capture each event on film. \r\n\r\n$5,000 will pay for the Holy Ghost Global team to do the foot work needed to make connections, build relationships, and set up a digital infrastructure (website, etc.) for that community to keep using once the event is over. \r\n\r\nAny money brought in from the Indiegogo campaigns will be saved and stored in preparation for the planning and implementation of the following year's event.

  impact_metrics: "The interfaith block parties will almost exclusively take place in public parks and open spaces in Los Angeles. Each event will be family friendly and will connect with students, teachers, and faculty of local schools. Since Holy Ghost Global is involved in prison chaplaincy and ministry, it has found that the majority of convicted offenders are people of faith. Some have been ostracized or disconnected from their faith communities which has made them more at risk for incarceration. These events would help connect attendees to places of faith in their community, strengthening these days and effectively reducing crime and incarceration rates. Some of the speakers and musicians at the events would be former convicts and could speak to issues of social justice and progress. \r\n\r\nThese events would also demonstrate how local citizens could creatively hold church services, worship experiences, and other faith-events in their local parks as expressions of our first amendment rights. \r\n\r\nBy getting citizens to think more about open spaces as existing places of worship, these events will increase outdoor activity as well as intergenerational play opportunities. Furthermore, it inspires them to think outside of the walls of their own denomination, congregation, or church building and utilize the beauty around them. This certainly would increase the number and quality of informal spaces for play, prayer, and worship. \r\n\r\nTo play and to pray, in a deeply spiritual sense, are the same things. Prayer to a God of love is free, safe, loving expression. Placing play within this context is necessary to providing an equilibrium that fosters holistic development in our children and our children's children.  "

What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  This project will unite Los Angeles around faith, rather than divide it. Most
  of the world, especially the Middle East and the continent of Africa, is
  increasingly at war because of religious belief. As the most religiously
  diverse city on the face of the earth, Los Angeles has the privilege and
  opportunity to show the broad spectrum of faith expressions. Every human asks
  questions about the existence of God - but we all express this question
  differently. Using geographic location and different mediums, we open up the
  question to individual expression rather than suppress it, ignore it, or
  belittle it. The center of all religion is truth and love. It's About Good
  Interfaith Block Parties help to embolden the conversation and expression of
  faith in Los Angeles for the purpose of serving others and promoting universal
  good. 
   
   The millenial generation is the least religiously involved generation of American history, but the most civically engaged. There are fewer and fewer venues for real, open, honest conversations about faith in God. While religious differences are portrayed more starkly, religious moderates who use their faith to empower their service to the community are marginalized. 
   
   The purpose of these block parties is to bridge generations - baby boomers who were raised in places of worships and are becoming more and more religious as they grow older due to health and other reasons, and millenials who are not in traditional houses of worship, but want to live their faith by their works. 
   
   Furthermore, the context of faith will guarantee family friendly content, supportive and positive energy, and a spirit of brotherly love. We have the opportunity to prepare the next generation, those who will be running the city in 2050, to not abandon faith, but rather see it as necessarily entwined in every aspect of the social and civic spheres of Los Angeles. These events open up the opportunity for morals, ethics, and mores to be instilled in a relevant way rather than through legalistic, deadening codes and creeds. 
   
   Faith has traditionally been at the center of civilization's progress since the beginning of time. It still belongs in the center of Los Angeles whether it is technology, film, education, health care, or community service. Giving people exposure to different faiths enables them to make their own decisions and by doing it out in the open, in public spaces, the people take back the power of a relationship with God.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  It's About Good Interfaith Block Parties will most benefit Angelenos of faith
  in the specific communities where each event will be held (Santa Monica, San
  Pedro, Hollywood, Echo Park, USC). However, the benefit does not end there.
  Having these events will have a ripple effect that will empower other local
  communities to have similar events. 
   
   Also, these events will benefit local faith-organizations that may be struggling in a time of religious decline and technological innovation. This will help to breathe new life into traditional faith-based organizations and give them a reason to rally and move forward. 
   
   This project will also benefit families in the communities since each event will be tailored to be family friendly and intergenerational. 
   
   Law enforcement will be benefitted because of the peaceful, substance-free basis for community gathering and relationship building. 
   
   Local businesses will benefit since these events will attract new people into new districts and encourage participation in the local economy. 
   
   Due to the nature of social events - especially those that are clean and open and accessible to those across generations - interfaith block parties will greatly benefit the entire community.
