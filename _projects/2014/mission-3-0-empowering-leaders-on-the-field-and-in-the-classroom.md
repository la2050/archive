Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  ITC was founded in 2008 to develop leaders in urban communities through
  empowering families, building support networks, and improving academic
  achievement. We began in Lincoln Heights, one of the most underserved
  communities in all of LA County, and a partnership was quickly established
  with the local high school, Abraham Lincoln High School (LHS). In 2010,
  “Mission 3.0” was created to specifically challenge LHS student-athletes, who
  are historically some of the lowest academic achievers at LHS. Through
  collaboration with the coaches, ITC provided mandatory tutoring sessions for
  the student-athletes, pushing them to strive beyond the minimum 2.0 GPA
  required to play. The success of our “Mission 3.0” program relied on that
  collaboration. In this sense, much of the foundation for the success of our
  program has already been implemented at the institutional level. Our biggest
  push will be to establish a foundation for sustained achievement with our
  students and their families.
   
    
   
   ITC will start by matching students from the JV Football team with our mentors, who are trained to provide guided and up-to-date academic support. The first 10 weeks of the program, which will get students to rethink their perceptions of their education and their community, will coincide with the fall sports season. Our mentoring sessions will be planned around game and practice times—in other words, mentoring will be integrated into the athletics program. At the end of those 10 weeks, those who continue with the mentoring program will meet with their mentor weekly, providing student-athletes with much-needed structure even beyond the season. In addition to providing general guidance on the path to college, mentors will also teach their students very specific skills that will be necessary to get through college and eventually graduate. Workshops on topics as diverse as financial aid, SAT/ACT tests, and time management are part of our program.
   
    
   
   ITC will also hire a Parent Advocate who will be in charge of organizing parents and guardians of the team. Though a committee of parents will be created during the fall sports season, the role of the Parent Advocate will be to sustain parent organization throughout the year. Our vision is for parents to be provided a platform for organizing around the issues they believe need to be addressed in our schools. As our committee becomes stronger, so will our mentoring program, which will rely on heavier parent involvement during the off-season.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  The path to college for many of our students is akin to a long, dark hallway.
  For many of them, the thought of walking down it has not crossed their minds
  at all. For many others, a plethora of fears grips them each time they venture
  to the entrance of that hallway. It feels out of reach. It is too dark; too
  easy to get lost, and too easy to never make it to the other side. These are
  fears that paralyze.
   
   Our program will make LA the BEST place to LEARN today by directly addressing the sense of hopelessness that characterizes public education in our most underserved communities. The approach is two-pronged—to illuminate the future that might exist at the end of the hallway, and to embolden students (and their families) to make it through to the other side. 
   
   Our program will undoubtedly contribute to higher graduation rates, as well as more LHS students attending and graduating from college. More importantly, however, our program will train students to be engaged in their community, to recognize what is at stake in taking ownership of their education. Students will learn to take the fears that previously paralyzed them, and to turn them into motivation.
   
   As we grow, our first move will be to partner with the feeder middle school to LHS so that we can begin to support parents and students even before high school. Eventually, we see our program expanding to neighboring high schools that face many of the same issues in preparing students to be active participants in their schooling. 
   
   It is our vision that by 2050, students throughout Los Angeles will not only have access to the resources and support necessary to get to college, but will also have the skill set needed to graduate and move forward. Parents will be informed, empowered, and organized. Moreover, students and their families will see themselves as part of a larger community, understanding the role that each of them has in making Los Angeles the best place to LIVE, LEARN, CONNECT, CREATE, and PLAY.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The most immediate beneficiaries of our project will be the student-athletes
  of Lincoln High School (LHS). Only 38% of Lincoln students and 29% of LEMA
  students (the pilot Media/Arts school that shares its campus and sports
  program with LHS) are on track to complete their A-G requirements with a C or
  better. For a student body made up of over 1300 students, there is only one
  college counselor. Over 95% of our students are categorized as economically
  disadvantaged and participate in the federal school meal program, and the
  majority of our students’ parents have not received a college education (only
  5.5% of adults in Lincoln Heights have earned a college degree). All of these
  conditions contribute to a learning environment in which college-readiness is
  the exception rather than the rule. 
   
   Our ultimate goal is to transform the sports culture in Lincoln Heights to one in which college-readiness is considered just as vital to team success as physical training. Of course, the athletics program is just the start. As a heavier college-going culture is established at LHS, students outside of the athletics program will benefit from college-readiness being normalized on campus. 
   
   Parents of our student-athletes will also benefit from our project. The Parent Committee, headed by our Parent Advocate, will be an important resource for parents in learning how to best advocate for their children. In a preliminary meeting with parents of the JV Football team, we heard from many parents who expressed frustration with the difficulty in establishing communication with teachers and administrators. Our project will serve as an avenue for parents to become more involved, more informed, and more connected.
    
   As mentioned above, LHS is severely understaffed in terms of college counselors. Our project will immediately alleviate some of the pressure put on LHS' college counselor by getting students to start planning for life after high school as early as 9th grade. We aim for students to become their own best advocates, to get them to take ownership of their schooling. Teachers will also benefit from having students who are more engaged, curious, and motivated. 
   
   Finally, Los Angeles will benefit when the students and parents if its most undeserved communities are provided the necessary tools to participate in sustainable community engagement.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  ITC currently collaborates with Abraham Lincoln High School. We work closely
  with administrators, coaches, teachers, and the parents of the community every
  day to ensure program effectiveness. Dialogue regarding implementing Mission
  3.0 at surrounding middle and high schools has begun, and it is only a matter
  of funding and time before ITC’s Mission 3.0 program infiltrates the LAUSD.
  EduCare provides our program with afterschool snacks necessary during our
  tutoring and mentoring sessions
  (http://educarefoundation.com/after-school-programs). 
   
   We also collaborate with professionals within Los Angeles to better enhance the delivery of our services, through avenues of guest speaking, workshop facilitation, and tutoring and mentoring. These individuals include professors from Cal State systems, local pastors, pro bono lawyers, and financial consultants from highly ranked corporations.
   
   Moving forward, ITC will strengthen existing partnerships as well as establish new collaborations with surrounding colleges and universities, mentoring agencies, and parent advocacy agencies in East Los Angeles. These partnerships will be successful insofar as we see each other as vital in holistically impacting the trajectory of lives in East Los Angelenos; we can not view each other as competition, but must be able to share and utilize resources conducive to growth.
