  more_detail: "To provide digital training and content creation tools via community-based workshops and online learning to emerging voices and storytellers in diverse and underrepresented LA communities.  NALIP and its proposed partners would provide access to established community-based content creators working in film, TV, documentaries and new media.\r\n"
  achievable_goal: "NALIP has had a solid track record of developing, executing and evaluating empowerment programs. For the last fifteen years, NALIP has had success holding fourteen National Conferences, plus six other National Initiatives: a Latino Writer's Lab™, a Latino Producers Academy™ and a published/on-line Latino Media Resource Guide™, our\"Doing your Doc: Diverse Visions, Regional Voices\" documentary development workshops plus the Latino Media Market™ held during our National Conference and the Latino Artist Mentoring Program. We are now fundraising to support and expand these programs in 2014, plus solidify the infrastructure of our organization to better serve our community. NALIP has the plan, infrastructure, partnerships to successfully carry out Digitize LA. We are currently in discussion with our proposed partners on how the project could be expanded beyond the initial year and become a permanent development track for NALIP.\r\n"
