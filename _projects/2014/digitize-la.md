  achievable_goal: "NALIP has had a solid track record of developing, executing and evaluating empowerment programs. For the last fifteen years, NALIP has had success holding fourteen National Conferences, plus six other National Initiatives: a Latino Writer's Lab™, a Latino Producers Academy™ and a published/on-line Latino Media Resource Guide™, our\"Doing your Doc: Diverse Visions, Regional Voices\" documentary development workshops plus the Latino Media Market™ held during our National Conference and the Latino Artist Mentoring Program. We are now fundraising to support and expand these programs in 2014, plus solidify the infrastructure of our organization to better serve our community. NALIP has the plan, infrastructure, partnerships to successfully carry out Digitize LA. We are currently in discussion with our proposed partners on how the project could be expanded beyond the initial year and become a permanent development track for NALIP.\r\n"
  major_challenges: "1. Funds to carry out project. NALIP is currently writing other grants and fundraising from our partners.\r\n\r\n2. Infrastructure. "
  competition: "Sundance and Film Independent carry out similar work to support independent filmmakers in the USA. We collaborate with both organizations in many of our programs including the NALIP Media Summit, Latino Producers Academy, Latino Writers Lab and Doing Your Doc. For the last ten to fifteen years, we have shared our mentors and resources and access to our development programs. Since its inception, NALIP has focused on Latino content creators. \r\n"
