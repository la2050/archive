Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  We use dance as a means of transforming the future for at-risk children and
  youth, instilling in them the life skills – resiliency, self-discipline,
  teamwork and respect for themselves and others – that we want them to carry
  over to their personal, family and community lives.
   
   In the 2014-2015 school year, everybody dance! will provide over 200 in-school and after-school dance classes per week at six sites in Central and South Los Angeles. 
   
   Instruction is enriched with master classes taught by leading companies such as Alvin Ailey and Diavolo, field trips to view professional performances, and frequent performances at community events and annual sold-out performances at USC’s Bing and Bovard Theaters. 
   
   We work hard to create a culture of high expectations. Students are expected to be punctual, attend class consistently, respect their teachers and classmates, and understand the value of a strong work ethic. Dance requires effort and dedication and our students learn quickly that there are no shortcuts. 
   
   Parent engagement makes our program thrive. We build commitment to everybody dance! by requiring families to volunteer 15 hours annually. The benefit of prioritizing family engagement is that parents bond together across ethnicities while working together even as they model the value of ‘giving back’ for their children. The result is a tight-knit community of parents and young dancers in neighborhoods traditionally split by gang affiliations and racial divisions. In annual surveys, many students and parents describe everybody dance! as "family." 
   
   These combined elements – program breadth and quality, high expectations, consistent instruction and parental engagement – are what we believe make our program succeed.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  A growing body of research confirms that arts education plays an integral role
  in children’s lives. With relatively low household incomes, most inner-city
  residents cannot afford to enroll their children in costly private arts
  programs. Arts education budget cuts of nearly 50% in Los Angeles Unified
  School District over the past six years [1][2] have increased the need for
  accessible programs in the city’s underserved neighborhoods.
   
   As a result of their participation in our dance program, students will demonstrate: 
   
   • Increased proficiency in the language and skills of dance; 
   • Increased appreciation for the arts;
   • Increased sense of community; and 
   • Increased positive self-development.
   
   
   For the nominal fee of five dollars per month, everybody dance! students have access to a range of dance classes – in ballet, jazz, tap, hip hop, choreography, boys’ aerobics and modern– taught by our team of dance educators, heralded by the Los Angeles Times as “some of the best children’s dance instructors in the world.”
   
   Our students dance an average of 2.5 hours per week and some attend class daily. For the majority of our students, everybody dance! provides not only an opportunity to engage in art and practice dance, but also a safe haven from the crime and poverty they face in their neighborhoods. Within this safe, nurturing community, students are supported by our dedicated staff as they develop the skills necessary to succeed academically and professionally.

What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  everybody dance! serves children and youth (ages 4-19) who reside in the
  densely-populated neighborhoods near downtown Los Angeles, including Echo
  Park, Pico-Union, Westlake, Highland Park, Koreatown, East Los Angeles and
  South Los Angeles. The student population is approximately 90% Latino, 5%
  Asian American, 2% African American, 1% Caucasian and 2% other ethnicities.
  Approximately 58% of students are female, 42% male. In the communities served
  by everybody dance!, median annual household income ranges from $25,767 -
  $49,082; between 17% to 49% of people do not own a car; and between 30 to 52%
  of adults aged 25 and over lack a high school diploma. The population per
  square mile ranges from 13,545-50,125, a vast difference from the population
  per square mile for the County (2,480) or State (247).
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  everybody dance! will work with three long-term key collaborators to implement
  the proposed project. 
   
   1) Gabriella Charter School: We provide daily dance instruction during the school year to 436 K-8 students at Gabriella Charter School, a dance-themed Title 1 elementary and middle public school. As the School was formerly a program of The Gabriella Foundation,, this is an especially close partnership. The School provides us with studio space and shares administrative resources.
   
   2) Camino Nuevo Charter Academy: Since 2000, we have provided weekly school-day classes to Camino Nuevo Charter Academy. This year, we expect to provide 45 weekly classes to over 1000 students in the summer/fall and 25 weekly classes to nearly 400 students in the winter/spring at the three K-8 campuses of Camino Nuevo Charter Academy, a Title 1 public inner-city charter management organization. In return, Camino Nuevo Charter Academy provides us with studio space, for our after-school program, shares resources and allows us to reach even more underserved areas of Los Angeles’ inner-city.
   
   3) LAUSD’s Ramón C. Cortines School of Visual and Performing Arts (the School District’s downtown arts high school): Last year, we began providing dance classes after-school at LAUSD’s downtown arts high school. We plan to increase enrollment in FY 14-15. The School provides us studio space and shares resources. This collaboration allows us to reach more students and to expand our reach in the City’s downtown core.
   
   Critical to the success of these collaborations is open communication between dance program and school staff, mutual commitment to the project and a shared belief in the importance of arts education to academic success.
