Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Hop on the bus and we’ll do the rest! Here at the Do Good Bus, we deliver an
  exciting and engaging opportunity to get involved with your community and to
  do GOOD in the city of Los Angeles. Each trip is different and the
  location/cause is kept a secret until we arrive. We currently host a monthly
  community ride to give Los Angelenos the opportunity to learn about local
  causes, experience giving back and most importantly, connect with other people
  in their city. Over the past three years, we’ve visited dozens of causes and
  connected hundreds of volunteers and are proud to say each passenger left
  feeling accomplished and connected to one another.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  With the word spreading about our project, we need funding to keep up with the
  demand and implement our additional ideas.
   
   OUR OWN BUS!
   We recently purchased our own bus but have some final repairs and upgrades to make before we can get it on the road. We will also have new costs to cover (ie. maintenance, fuel, driver training, storage, etc.).
   
   FREE RIDES
   We believe there is true value in a Do Good Bus ticket, but we know purchasing a ticket can be a barrier for some, so we would like the opportunity to provide a free community ride every other month and get more people on the bus.
   
   KIDS AND GIVING BACK
   In line with the LA2050 report about the direct connection between education and social connectedness, we’ve been working on ideas to engage students via the Do Good Bus. We are committed to teaching our youth the importance of giving back and connecting with their community. In fact, we’ve hosted FAMILY RIDES to give families access to kid-friendly volunteer activities and teach kids the vocabulary and concepts of giving back. We would love to offer the same experience to students in Los Angeles schools - giving teachers an opportunity to incorporate volunteerism into their curriculums.
   
   The LA2050 report also suggests education levels are directly related to social connectedness levels. While we don’t have the resources to ensure kids make it to their senior year, we think exposing kids to unique experiences on a Do Good Field Trip, will give them a chance to connect with each other and with a world outside of the classroom. In addition, a Do Good Field Trip would expose students to unique career options (ie. Non-profit CEO or Do Good Bus tour guide) - potentially giving them new motivation to make it through school.
   
   There are two important factors to ensure we can implement our idea: hire a part-time staff member and finish outfitting our bus. Specifically, outfitting the bus includes: registration, permitting, insurance, final mechanical tune up, new seating, driver training and storage.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Today, there are numerous ways that the Do Good Bus will help make LA the best
  place to connect. With our busy schedules and hectic lives, taking the time to
  volunteer and do good by others is not always factored in. Our engaging and
  unique approach to volunteering truly sets us apart and attracts many Los
  Angelenos who may have not considered getting involved in their community
  before. 
    
   Another way that our efforts will help connect is through one of our goals on the bus, encouraging continued support. For us, that doesn’t always mean returning to the same cause we may have just visited. During a ride, passengers are not only exposed to meaningful causes they are also introduced to what it FEELS like to give back. We encourage them to harness that feeling and search for ways to find it again in their everyday lives. We strongly believe that inspiration in people will continue to shape Los Angeles into a more connected place.
    
   By 2050, we see the future of the Do Good Bus much bigger than before. One of our goals is to collaborate with schools to implement Do Good Bus field trips for students. Children will be exposed to our unique and different way of doing good as well as understanding the importance of getting involved in their community. With that said, we can expect that the future generation of doGOODers will use what they’ve learned and create more innovative ways to connect to one another in Los Angeles.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  The wonderful thing about our project is that it will benefit so many other
  causes who are also committed to making LA the best it can be by 2050. By
  transporting volunteers to causes all over LA and bringing awareness to those
  causes - we’re collaborating with potentially hundreds of charitable
  foundations! We saw this first hand this year when Do Good Bus collaborated
  with No Right Brain Left Behind by bringing multiple groups of volunteers to
  help complete their LA2050 Grant Project (2013). In addition to No Right Brain
  Left Behind, some of the causes our project has and will benefit are: MEND
  Poverty, the LA Food Bank, Best Friends Animal Society, EnrichLA and so many
  more. 
   
   If Do Good Bus can host multiple rides per month and offer a handful of free rides, we can give more Los Angelenos an opportunity to connect and give back. In one year, over 1,000 people will be newly connected and if we add Do Good Field Trips to that number, we end up with over 1,000 newly connected kids as well.
   
   In addition to free rides and Do Good Field Trips, with our own bus we now have a unique opportunity to help Los Angeles in a hyper-local capacity. With 24-hour access to a vehicle equipped with supplies and enough seats for 30 willing volunteers, we’d have the capability to coordinate last minute trips to help our neighbors in a time of emergency or disaster relief. This might be the most exciting element of owning our own vehicle.
   
   Not only does our project benefit the causes we visit, but each and every passenger on the Do Good Bus is also benefited through the relationships they build during the ride. We ensure a captivating and interactive experience that brings like-minded individuals together in a city where it can be challenging to connect with one another. We’re a party bus with a purpose and there is no better alternative to make new friends than by taking this journey with us! 
   
   One ride at a time, Do Good Bus can begin to shape Los Angeles into a more connected city; one with informed and inspired residents who can help one another.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  One of our confirmed overall collaborators is Dogeared Jewelry, who has been a
  supporter of the Do Good Bus since the beginning. They are a B Corp and are
  extremely committed to giving back. The added benefit provided is their help
  retrofitting our new bus and their ability to build our awareness.
   
   Some other partnerships who will be working with us are:
   
   BUS PARTNERS
   For the nitty gritty logistics, Townride, Inc. is interested in using their expertise to help us through the refurbishing process of creating the coolest Do Good Bus possible. We are also working on a plan to partner with Townride for storage and maintenance.
   
   EDUCATION PARTNERS
   As for causes and organizations who can help us make Do Good Field Trips a reality, we’re looking forward to working with No Right Brain Left Behind, Green Dot Schools, Breakaway Education and Zimmer Children’s Museum.
