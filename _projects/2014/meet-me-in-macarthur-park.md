Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  The LA Neighborhood Land Trust is working to revitalize MacArthur Park as a
  thriving community hub that connects Angelenos. This year, we engaged over
  1,000 residents, with over 600 community members participating in our park
  beautification days. We conducted community research through surveys, focus
  groups, interviews, and mapping exercises, and are documenting resident
  concerns in a report with recommendations for the improvement of the park. In
  2015, we will continue our collaborative efforts to revive the park into a
  vibrant community space for connection in the center of LA. We’ve heard what
  community members have to say, and now we’re putting it into action!
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Informed by our 2014 research, we will revive MacArthur Park through outreach,
  leadership development, events and programming, beautification, and social
  media messaging. 
   
   OUTREACH: Our model of park improvement is based on community outreach and resident engagement. We invite Angelenos to help revive MacArthur Park through door-to-door outreach, presentations at partner schools and organizations, volunteering at community events, and participating in beautification of the park. 
   
   LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT: In 2015, we will equip MacArthur Park residents with skills and knowledge of the public process so they can advocate for park resources, ensuring that elected officials are more responsive to their concerns. We will continue developing leaders by training them to lead clean up squads, facilitate community meetings, and collect surveys. 
   
   EVENTS/PROGRAMS: Park users have asked for more programming and events. In 2015, we will hold 2 community events that celebrate diversity, creativity, and connectivity. These cultural events will highlight the park’s potential to be a hub for community interaction, civic engagement, and healthy living for all Angelenos. 
   
   The success and safety of a park is heavily reliant on community-desired programs. We are asking for community input on activities they would like to see at the park. Based on their requests, we will bring year-round programming to supplement existing programs. 
   
   BEAUTIFICATION: Our research has shown that beautification is a priority. This year, we focused on addressing litter at the park by supporting Councilmember Cedillo’s Keep It Clean campaign. We held clean ups to educate residents about litter and emphasize the importance of caring for the park. We have a solid and enthusiastic group of volunteers, and will continue to engage them around beautification efforts involving landscaping, signage, and maintenance improvements.
   
   SOCIAL MEDIA MESSAGING: Later this year, MacArthur Park will become the first city park equipped with free Wifi! We will capitalize on this opportunity to rebrand the park. 
   
   We find that Angelenos are unaware of the resources and programs available at the park, and instead dwell on negative perceptions. We will develop a social media plan to tell a new story. By broadcasting the positive activities in MacArthur Park and highlighting volunteer opportunities, programs, events, and community involvement, a more positive view of the park will unfold.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Whoever said Angelenos don’t walk has never visited South Alvarado Street.
  Every day, this thoroughfare is busy with people on foot passing through, or
  on the way to the nearby metro stop. Today, pedestrians hurry past MacArthur
  Park without a second glance toward the lake, the soccer field, or the
  historic recreation center. We envision reviving the park through programming,
  events, leadership development and social media branding, so that MacArthur
  Park is no longer an ignored backdrop and instead, becomes a destination for
  connecting with nature, connecting with one another, and connecting with
  history. Local residents will be more aware of park programs where they can
  interact with their neighbors and build support networks. Local youth will no
  longer seek out programming at other, farther parks, but will instead attend
  movie-nights at MacArthur Park and connect to the community resources
  available at the rec center. We also expect the free wifi (to be installed in
  2014) to draw people out of their houses and into the park to stay connected
  with current events, local news, or social media friends. This is all
  possible, and we can make it happen together. 
   
   Sustainability and longevity of a project are reliant on community involvement. Successful parks have engaged residents. By involving community members and encouraging their leadership in the process to revive this park, we know that it will contribute to a healthier Los Angeles in the year 2050. Perfectly situated in central Los Angeles with easy access to downtown and the west side, “Meet me at MacArthur Park,” will be a trending phrase. In 2050, Angelenos will put the park at the top of their lists for connecting with friends or business partners, catching an outdoor movie, relaxing, getting some exercise, or attending a cultural event. Tourists will make it a must-see destination spot and artists will convene there to display and sell their art. Our project in 2015 will help us get there.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  This community-driven project will first and foremost directly benefit the
  residents of Westlake, an underserved neighborhood in central Los Angeles, who
  currently suffer from a lack of green space, resources, social capital,
  support networks, and connection to decision-makers and each other. 
   
   The park is a historical landmark in the city, used by a wide range of Angelenos across the city. Once revitalized and rebranded, the park will serve an even greater number of people through its compelling and interactive programming and be a vibrant city hub for cultural connection and community activity. With its central location and public transit access, in addition to free WiFi, it will also serve as a green reprieve from the urban bustle. People who come from all over the County to attend the Levitt Pavilion summer concerts at MacArthur Park will benefit from this transformative project. Nearby businesses will thrive with increased patrons and a new point of community pride.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  MacArthur Park represents a prime opportunity for connecting and engaging
  Angelenos, and investment in the park and its promise is on the rise. Today,
  more community-based organizations, elected officials, and activist networks
  are turning their attention to this neglected historic landmark. In 2014, we
  forged meaningful relationships with other organizations and agencies and we
  intend to continue working collectively to enact change in this area of Los
  Angeles. We work closely with the City Department of Recreation and Parks to
  ensure our work supports the Park Director and his efforts to bring programs
  to MacArthur Park. Other key partners include Praise Chapel Los Angeles, Heart
  of Los Angeles, Camino Nuevo Charter Academy, Esperanza Housing Corporation,
  Rediscover MacArthur Park Alliance and two neighborhood councils. The
  collaborative energy and transformative spirit persists, and we need to
  capitalize on this moment. We believe our project can serve as a catalyst to
  unite various efforts and turn MacArthur Park into a real resource that spurs
  local and city-wide opportunities for connection.
