Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): |-
  3 targeted workshop groups:
   1. SENIORS currently “playing” in local parks, recreation areas and senior centers, beaches and other public recreational areas
   
   2. AT RISK TEENS and foster youth needing safe and enjoyable public “play” spaces to gather and engage in creative and educational activities.
   
   3. LATCH KEY KIDS in downtown LA currently enrolled in after school programs who frequent recreational centers for interactive, creative and educational “play” activities. 
   
   COLLABORATION/TEAM BUILDING
   The initial steps for this project will be to solidify partnerships and collaborations and develop a pilot strategy. 
   
   CREATIVE DEVELOPMENT
   We’ll work with partners to host a series of workshops based on a Play in LA theme. Workshops encourage individuals to share visions for “play” venues in the foreseeable future and building systematically to target goal in 2050. 
   
   Each group will have 50-70 participants. Workshops will be facilitated in a series of 1-3 sessions. Each participant will have an opportunity to paint a vision of the perfect “Play in LA” area using paint and canvases. Local volunteers will help recruit, engage and motivate artist participants. 
   
   Participants will initial their paintings, including their age in a format that replicates the labeling on the periodic table, thereby contributing their own personal "element" to the human story and Play in LA concept. A written statement from each participant will accompany each painting.
   
   INSTALLATION
   All paintings are combined into a full-sized art installation. The center art element will be commissioned to an LA artist and will serve as a “statement” piece reflecting the sentiment of the collective artwork. The collaborative artworks will be displayed in civic buildings: schools, libraries, museums, airports, train/bus stations. All individual paintings with accompanying statements will be posted on the Human Element Project’s and partner’s websites.
   
   FORUMS
   Installations will inspire public forums and discussions on future vision and strategy for community capacity building and can be held at the USC IGM Art Gallery or installation venues employing USC IGM AG forum format. 
   
   RECEPTION
   Opening receptions for each of three installations will be organized to honor participants, sponsors, and supporters. Receptions will boost self-esteem of participants and ensure their ideas are heard and honored. Events will be coordinated and documented by artAngls.org and the USC IGM Art Gallery.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  By enabling ownership, community pride, mindful stewardship, collaboration
  strategies, and personal and professional empowerment. 
   The Human Element Project: Play in LA will attract residents to work together, using existing resources to enhance
   • Access to open spaces and park facilities 
   • Number of children enrolled in afterschool programs 
   • Percentage of residents who feel safe in their neighborhoods 
   • Enhance the transportation experience for attendance at major league sporting events 
   • Residents within 1⁄4 mile of a park 
   • Number of residents with easy access to a “vibrant” park 
   • Number of parks with intergenerational play opportunities 
   • Number (and quality) of informal spaces for play 
   • Decrease per capita crime rates
   
   The Human Element Project: 
   Play in LA workshops will significantly impact these metrics by collaboratively conceptualizing and displaying a sustainable “play” space for young adults and seniors. Installations and receptions will attract those who are empowered to realize the dream, and to better understand the “blueprint” of the people’s vision of their neighborhood now and leading into 2050.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  1) Leaders from the Public, Private, Nonprofit, Faith-based, Academic and
  Media sectors. 
   
   2) The constituents of these leaders who will, as a result of The Human Element Project: Play in LA, work in systematic collaboration with their elected officials and institutions to facilitate cross departmental, cross organizational, peer to peer sharing and leveraging of existing resources. With a top down/bottom up system that employs tested and true infrastructure from the past while being flexible enough to innovate, and creatively invent a bright future for the next generation and those yet unborn, the citizens of LA County will develop a world class model safe for children, everyone and local and global business.
