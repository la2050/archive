Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): |-
  3 targeted workshop groups:
   1. SENIORS currently “playing” in local parks, recreation areas and senior centers, beaches and other public recreational areas
   
   2. AT RISK TEENS and foster youth needing safe and enjoyable public “play” spaces to gather and engage in creative and educational activities.
   
   3. LATCH KEY KIDS in downtown LA currently enrolled in after school programs who frequent recreational centers for interactive, creative and educational “play” activities. 
   
   COLLABORATION/TEAM BUILDING
   The initial steps for this project will be to solidify partnerships and collaborations and develop a pilot strategy. 
   
   CREATIVE DEVELOPMENT
   We’ll work with partners to host a series of workshops based on a Play in LA theme. Workshops encourage individuals to share visions for “play” venues in the foreseeable future and building systematically to target goal in 2050. 
   
   Each group will have 50-70 participants. Workshops will be facilitated in a series of 1-3 sessions. Each participant will have an opportunity to paint a vision of the perfect “Play in LA” area using paint and canvases. Local volunteers will help recruit, engage and motivate artist participants. 
   
   Participants will initial their paintings, including their age in a format that replicates the labeling on the periodic table, thereby contributing their own personal "element" to the human story and Play in LA concept. A written statement from each participant will accompany each painting.
   
   INSTALLATION
   All paintings are combined into a full-sized art installation. The center art element will be commissioned to an LA artist and will serve as a “statement” piece reflecting the sentiment of the collective artwork. The collaborative artworks will be displayed in civic buildings: schools, libraries, museums, airports, train/bus stations. All individual paintings with accompanying statements will be posted on the Human Element Project’s and partner’s websites.
   
   FORUMS
   Installations will inspire public forums and discussions on future vision and strategy for community capacity building and can be held at the USC IGM Art Gallery or installation venues employing USC IGM AG forum format. 
   
   RECEPTION
   Opening receptions for each of three installations will be organized to honor participants, sponsors, and supporters. Receptions will boost self-esteem of participants and ensure their ideas are heard and honored. Events will be coordinated and documented by artAngls.org and the USC IGM Art Gallery.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  By enabling ownership, community pride, mindful stewardship, collaboration
  strategies, and personal and professional empowerment. 
   The Human Element Project: Play in LA will attract residents to work together, using existing resources to enhance
   • Access to open spaces and park facilities 
   • Number of children enrolled in afterschool programs 
   • Percentage of residents who feel safe in their neighborhoods 
   • Enhance the transportation experience for attendance at major league sporting events 
   • Residents within 1⁄4 mile of a park 
   • Number of residents with easy access to a “vibrant” park 
   • Number of parks with intergenerational play opportunities 
   • Number (and quality) of informal spaces for play 
   • Decrease per capita crime rates
   
   The Human Element Project: 
   Play in LA workshops will significantly impact these metrics by collaboratively conceptualizing and displaying a sustainable “play” space for young adults and seniors. Installations and receptions will attract those who are empowered to realize the dream, and to better understand the “blueprint” of the people’s vision of their neighborhood now and leading into 2050.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  1) Leaders from the Public, Private, Nonprofit, Faith-based, Academic and
  Media sectors. 
   
   2) The constituents of these leaders who will, as a result of The Human Element Project: Play in LA, work in systematic collaboration with their elected officials and institutions to facilitate cross departmental, cross organizational, peer to peer sharing and leveraging of existing resources. With a top down/bottom up system that employs tested and true infrastructure from the past while being flexible enough to innovate, and creatively invent a bright future for the next generation and those yet unborn, the citizens of LA County will develop a world class model safe for children, everyone and local and global business.

  more_detail: "Play in LA recruits, informs, empowers LA County residents (targeting children and seniors), city agencies, artists, architects, teachers and caregivers to facilitate workshops that inspire participants to paint and express verbally their dreams of ideal neighborhood “play” venues (parks, beaches, senior centers and recreation centers). \r\n\r\nWorkshops produce collaborative, substantive art installations of participants’ visions for site use.

  two_lessons: "Our experiences with similar projects have lead to this proposed project.\r\n\r\n1.\tOrganizing the Molecular and Social Systems: Learning through Creative Exploration exhibition at the USC IGM Art Gallery provided us a rich experience that sharpened our understanding of self and others. A partnership among the Human Element Project and the Soft Machine Project artists with the IGM AG Advisory Council Members, weathered a process of problem solving from a diverse variety of logical, intuitive, creative, academic and traditional points of view. We learned important lessons from the interaction of conflicting human agents and their technology assistants as well as all of us becoming more informed in the process of planning, funding, implementing, contracting communicating and inter-dependent process and responsibilities.  The end result was an interesting, dynamic public art opening with speakers, video interviews, partner presentation tables, a refreshment table and a youth art presentation. The audience included public, private, nonprofit/faith-based, academic and media leaders.  The outcomes included a photo and deep caption of the event in the USC Health Sciences Campus Weekly News, a speaking engagement for our youth presenter, contracts and sales for several of the business attendees, the sale of an artwork and the self-confidence and trust in our team to move forward to prepare this application together!\r\n\r\n2.\tOur experience holding workshops with patients at Westminster Free Clinic has shown us the best way to involve a group of people in a project based upon a single theme, leading to an effective final installation. We asked our participant patients to paint a picture that illustrates what they have learned about how to effectively participate in managing their medical challenges. The enthusiastic responses were a testimony to how creative expression can inform, engage, educate and heal. The patients loved the experience, and it was a testament to the effectiveness of the clinic's work.\r\n\r\nSee the following websites for examples of other projects:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.thehumanelementproject.com/integrative-health.html\r\n\r\nhttp://artangels.org/press/molecular-and-social-systems-learning-through-creative-exploration\r\n\r\nhttp://hscnews.usc.edu/?s=Molecular+and+Social+Systems\r\n\r\nhttp://www.toacorn.com/news/2014-06-19/Health_%28and%29_Wellness/Art_installation_highlights_the_Human_Element.html\r\n\r\nhttp://hardcoremesorah.wordpress.com/2014/06/24/experiencing-intersection-artists-at\r\n\r\n\r\n"
  achievable_goal: "Once funds are approved, we will begin to work with Los Angeles based facilities to organize a series of workshops and installations. With the help of our partners at artAngls.org and the USC IGM Art Gallery and the workshop sponsors, we will recruit participants in groups of 50-70 per workshop. Each final installation will have 50-75 pieces plus the commissioned centerpiece. It will take approximately 3-4 months to complete each installation. By the end of the year, 3 public events will have taken place in celebration of the work of the participants and sponsor. \r\n\r\nProposed timeline\r\n\r\nOctober 1 – October 31, 2015: \r\nSolidify partners. Obtain letters of endorsement and distribute timeline \r\nBook three workshop venues, one for each of the three proposed categories. \r\nReview portfolios for 3 local artists to paint the statement piece for each installation.\r\nLocate possible installation venues.\r\nDebrief on workshops and collaboration partner meeting\r\n\r\nNovember 1 – 30, 2014\r\nWorkshop 1 to be held at a designated location (several sessions may be needed to obtain enough panels for the final installation)\r\nReview artists submission for commissioned statement piece\r\nContinue working on possible installation venues\r\nBegin to prepare artist panels for inclusion on websites\r\nPrepare for workshop 2 & 3\r\n\r\nDecember 1, 1014 – January 31, 2015\r\nWorkshop 2 & 3\r\nCommission artists for the three statement pieces\r\nCommit to at least 1 installation venue and schedule installation and reception date of workshop 1\r\nBegin to prepare graphics for catalog and promotional pieces\r\nBegin to work with PR and press partners\r\nContinue to work on website uploads\r\nCollaboration partner meeting to discuss reception, forums, PR, video\r\n\r\n\r\nFebruary 1 – March 31, 2015\r\nHold first reception for Workshop 1\r\nBegin video documentation\r\nContinue to prepare for installations of workshop 2 and 3\r\nContinue to prepare graphics to catalog and promotional pieces\r\nContinue to work with PR and press partners\r\nContinue to work on website uploads\r\nDebrief on workshops 2 & 3, discuss next installations\r\nCollaboration partner meeting to discuss reception, forums, PR, video\r\n\r\nApril 1 – July 31, 2015\r\nInstallation and reception events for workshops 2 & 3\r\nContinue video documentation\r\nPrinting of final catalog\r\n"
  major_challenges: "Working with diverse groups of people across the great distances of LA, communication, even with the technology will be difficult.  There are still multiple gaps in technology, PCs and Mac’s can’t always communicate and some people are still without.  \r\n\r\nRapid changes in staff within institutions that are often letting people go and/or hiring new staff with the relationship building time requirements. Diversity of comprehension in organizational infrastructure and reporting process.  Confusion related to funding and cross organizational management.\r\n\r\nThe best strategy for success is a strong leader that keeps her eyes on the big picture and the overall global result of a creative collaboration such as LA2050.  Successful implementation depends on one that can delegate, motivate and inspire a team. Organization and refined management skills are crucial for success. I have 30+ years of experience as a vice-president of creative marketing, advertising and interactive media for a well-known billion dollar cosmetic company in Los Angeles. I have managed teams of up to 30 employees and contractors that included administration, sales, copywriters, social media and video experts and creatives. I feel absolutely confident that I can oversee this project and recruit and retain enthusiastic and motivated partners. "
  competition: "Yes, there are many organizations doing similar work: USC School of Social Work and Roski School of Fine Art, Inner City Arts, A Window Between Worlds, a number of the organizations in Encounter, Some of the Flex teams in the LAWF, FPC to name a few.  They are all complementary and we would be delighted to share and leverage resources with them.\r\n\r\nWe are unique in that we are 100 percent inclusive, noncompetitive, transparent and accountable.  We problem solve our way to collaborative outcomes and achieve the personal and professional development of all participants.\r\n"

    answer: "Play in LA recruits, informs, empowers LA County residents (targeting children and seniors), city agencies, artists, architects, teachers and caregivers to facilitate workshops that inspire participants to paint and express verbally their dreams of ideal neighborhood “play” venues (parks, beaches, senior centers and recreation centers). \r\n\r\nWorkshops produce collaborative, substantive art installations of participants’ visions for site use.  Dialogues will explore and develop solutions greater than the sum of their parts. Participants will take pride in conceptualizing, implementing and sustaining, green, safe and vibrant places to live and play, building in phases to 2050 intended outcomes.\r\n"

    answer: "3 targeted workshop groups:\r\n1. SENIORS currently “playing” in local parks, recreation areas and senior centers, beaches and other public recreational areas\r\n\r\n2. AT RISK TEENS and foster youth needing safe and enjoyable public “play” spaces to gather and engage in creative and educational activities.\r\n\r\n3. LATCH KEY KIDS in downtown LA currently enrolled in after school programs who frequent recreational centers for interactive, creative and educational “play” activities. \r\n\r\nCOLLABORATION/TEAM BUILDING\r\nThe initial steps for this project will be to solidify partnerships and collaborations and develop a pilot strategy. \r\n\r\nCREATIVE DEVELOPMENT\r\nWe’ll work with partners to host a series of workshops based on a Play in LA theme. Workshops encourage individuals to share visions for “play” venues in the foreseeable future and building systematically to target goal in 2050. \r\n\r\nEach group will have 50-70 participants.  Workshops will be facilitated in a series of 1-3 sessions. Each participant will have an opportunity to paint a vision of the perfect “Play in LA” area using paint and canvases. Local volunteers will help recruit, engage and motivate artist participants. \r\n\r\nParticipants will initial their paintings, including their age in a format that replicates the labeling on the periodic table, thereby contributing their own personal \"element\" to the human story and Play in LA concept. A written statement from each participant will accompany each painting.\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION\r\nAll paintings are combined into a full-sized art installation. The center art element will be commissioned to an LA artist and will serve as a “statement” piece reflecting the sentiment of the collective artwork. The collaborative artworks will be displayed in civic buildings: schools, libraries, museums, airports, train/bus stations. All individual paintings with accompanying statements will be posted on the Human Element Project’s and partner’s websites.\r\n\r\nFORUMS\r\nInstallations will inspire public forums and discussions on future vision and strategy for community capacity building and can be held at the USC IGM Art Gallery or installation venues employing USC IGM AG forum format. \r\n\r\nRECEPTION\r\nOpening receptions for each of three installations will be organized to honor participants, sponsors, and supporters. Receptions will boost self-esteem of participants and ensure their ideas are heard and honored. Events will be coordinated and documented by artAngls.org and the USC IGM Art Gallery.\r\n"

    answer: "Our experiences with similar projects have lead to this proposed project.\r\n\r\n1.\tOrganizing the Molecular and Social Systems: Learning through Creative Exploration exhibition at the USC IGM Art Gallery provided us a rich experience that sharpened our understanding of self and others. A partnership among the Human Element Project and the Soft Machine Project artists with the IGM AG Advisory Council Members, weathered a process of problem solving from a diverse variety of logical, intuitive, creative, academic and traditional points of view. We learned important lessons from the interaction of conflicting human agents and their technology assistants as well as all of us becoming more informed in the process of planning, funding, implementing, contracting communicating and inter-dependent process and responsibilities.  The end result was an interesting, dynamic public art opening with speakers, video interviews, partner presentation tables, a refreshment table and a youth art presentation. The audience included public, private, nonprofit/faith-based, academic and media leaders.  The outcomes included a photo and deep caption of the event in the USC Health Sciences Campus Weekly News, a speaking engagement for our youth presenter, contracts and sales for several of the business attendees, the sale of an artwork and the self-confidence and trust in our team to move forward to prepare this application together!\r\n\r\n2.\tOur experience holding workshops with patients at Westminster Free Clinic has shown us the best way to involve a group of people in a project based upon a single theme, leading to an effective final installation. We asked our participant patients to paint a picture that illustrates what they have learned about how to effectively participate in managing their medical challenges. The enthusiastic responses were a testimony to how creative expression can inform, engage, educate and heal. The patients loved the experience, and it was a testament to the effectiveness of the clinic's work.\r\n\r\nSee the following websites for examples of other projects:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.thehumanelementproject.com/integrative-health.html\r\n\r\nhttp://artangels.org/press/molecular-and-social-systems-learning-through-creative-exploration\r\n\r\nhttp://hscnews.usc.edu/?s=Molecular+and+Social+Systems\r\n\r\nhttp://www.toacorn.com/news/2014-06-19/Health_%28and%29_Wellness/Art_installation_highlights_the_Human_Element.html\r\n\r\nhttp://hardcoremesorah.wordpress.com/2014/06/24/experiencing-intersection-artists-at\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    answer: "Working with diverse groups of people across the great distances of LA, communication, even with the technology will be difficult.  There are still multiple gaps in technology, PCs and Mac’s can’t always communicate and some people are still without.  \r\n\r\nRapid changes in staff within institutions that are often letting people go and/or hiring new staff with the relationship building time requirements. Diversity of comprehension in organizational infrastructure and reporting process.  Confusion related to funding and cross organizational management.\r\n\r\nThe best strategy for success is a strong leader that keeps her eyes on the big picture and the overall global result of a creative collaboration such as LA2050.  Successful implementation depends on one that can delegate, motivate and inspire a team. Organization and refined management skills are crucial for success. I have 30+ years of experience as a vice-president of creative marketing, advertising and interactive media for a well-known billion dollar cosmetic company in Los Angeles.
