Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Clothes The Deal has established several collaborations. Partnering agencies
  that refer clients have provided needs assessments to estimate the number of
  clients needing services as well as funding available to cost match service
  expenses. Collaborating organizations involved in the project have also
  pledged to raise internal funding to sustain services after the project period
  ends. Clothes The Deal currently has two programs that we would like to
  expand: the Business Clothing Program and the Dress to Impress Workshops. 
   
   Business Clothing Program: Through a network of corporate clothing drives, donation drop-off locations, and donations directly from local manufacturers and retailers, Clothes The Deal collects ready-to-wear items for thousands of job ready clients. Clothes The Deal continually looks for new clothing drive sponsors by outreaching to local businesses and organizations throughout the LA community for clothing donations. 
   
   Dress To Impress Workshops: Workshops are designed to help educate and enhance the participant's self-esteem and professional image for job interviews. Topics include professional image, business etiquette, self-confidence, hygiene, skin and hair care. Workshops are interactive public forums for discussion of dress codes in various work environments. Workshops also address non-verbal and visual communication between coworkers/customers/clients, sample scenarios, problem solving situations and team building activities. Clothes The Deal makes it easy for participants to attend a workshop by bringing the clothing and services to them.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  The majority of Clothes the Deal’s clients have endured traumatic events
  resulting in psychological barriers. Common traumatic events include abuse,
  post traumatic stress, foster care, domestic violence, substance abuse, and
  mental health impairments. Clothes The Deal’s services and the care provided
  within the network of nonprofit organizations break down barriers to
  employment and provide a boost of self-confidence during critical moments of
  our clients’ lives.
   
   Today, Clothes The Deal’s services help clients get back on their feet and gain employment by removing any barriers that may be in their way. Subsequently, our work will help decrease the number of people living on the streets and the number of families who live below the poverty threshold. In addition to higher living wages, clients served will ultimately achieve a higher quality of life for themselves and their families by obtaining health insurance, purchasing healthy foods, and providing/obtaining a quality education.
   
   The more people that Clothes The Deal empowers today, the more community leaders we’ll have giving back to low-income communities tomorrow. By 2050, services will help reduce the number of disadvantages and barriers to employment faced by most low-income individuals. Clothes The Deal will also help more businesses and community organizations invest in their communities by hold clothing drives and volunteering. As a result of the project, Clothes The Deal envisions safer neighborhoods and a higher quality of life for families in low-income communities.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Clothes The Deal serves low-income individuals in all of Los Angeles County.
  Men and women, old and young, people of all nationalities qualify for our
  services. The majority of our services are focused in communities with above
  average poverty and unemployment rates. 
   
   Clients must meet the following requirements: 
   1) Low-income (according to the Federal Health & Human Services poverty guidelines) 
   2) Currently unemployed 
   3) Enrolled in an employment program, vocational training or educational institution
   
   Some of the clients that we have had and currently have include veterans, homeless individuals, at-risk youth, mentally or physically disabled individuals, those recovering from mental illness or substance abuse, and foster youth.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Over the past 19 years, Clothes The Deal has built partnerships with many
  programs and non-profits throughout the county. The majority of collaborating
  organizations are in need of Clothes The Deal’s services but do not have
  funding available for service expenses. Some of the partnering organizations
  include Community Career Development Center, Enki Mental Health Services,
  Friends Outside Los Angeles, L.A. Works, Children's Institute Inc., Puente
  Learning Center, The Salvation Army Bell Shelter, Single Room Occupancy Inc.,
  Skid Row Development Corp, Substance Abuse Foundation, U.S. Veterans
  Initiative, Volunteers of America, Weingart Center, the Workforce Investment
  Board, and Youth Opportunity Movement Watts (YO WATTS).
   
   Partners provide clients referrals and help with client intake procedures to ensure all clients are low-income and ready for employment. By partnering with employment and vocational agencies, services are provided to a diverse population of people coming from different backgrounds and cultures. A small percentage of collaborating partners will provide a cost match of percentage of service expenses during the project. All collaborating organizations have pledged to raise funding for service expenses once the project period ends. 
   
   Clothes the Deal also collaborates with the community and service leaders. A few examples of how we accomplish this: 
   1) Attend networking events focused on employment and vocational programs, including those hosted by POWER (Providing Opportunities with Essential Resources), LA United Job Creation Council and the Department of Mental Health Case Manager Meetings. 
   2) Build relationships with local businesses and organizations that in turn provide clothing donations and host clothing drives to generate donations for us. 
   3) Annually, we have about 40 volunteers serve a total of 5,550 hours. Volunteers include youth interns from youth employment programs such as YO Watts, community service volunteers, philanthropy groups, Temporary Subsidized Employees, and ReEmployability employees.
