What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  The life of a dancer in Los Angeles is economically challenging and many
  non-commercial dancers must work 2 or more jobs to support themselves while
  pursuing their dream. 
   
   Additionally, the women we work with our self-taught dancers because of the economic challenges they’ve experienced. Our dancers have encountered financial obstacles growing up and/or in young adulthood that have prevented them from receiving extensive dance training. Having low-income has created an economic barrier to becoming a working dancer in Los Angeles.
   
   CMDC seeks to provide economic growth opportunities to our participants that increase their income. By training our participants to become professional dancers with CMDC and by paying our dancers for their ongoing rehearsal and performance time, we hope to provide one model of what it looks like to help dancers thrive. 
   
   Additionally, CMDC's Dance Leadership Program offers young dancers the opportunity to receive holistic professional development training that supports them as leaders in whatever job or field they choose:
   
   As one dancer states: "CMDC gives me a comfortable space to explore that outlet and grow... It is constantly challenging me to be the best version of myself and pushes me to move outside of my own comfort zone. Dancing with CMDC has been transformative, healing, and radiantly inspiring. CMDC is a safe space where I have stepped into my power and gained confidence in my abilities. " ~Ginger Alleyne

What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  We work with a diverse group of women from Los Angeles, ages 20-40. Our
  participants are a diverse group of LGBT, low-income, and/or women of color.
  Many are self-taught dancers who have had limited dance experience or
  training. Due to financial barriers growing up and/or in young adulthood, most
  of our dancers come to us with little to no formal dance training. Yet all
  possess a love for dance, a natural gift for movement and a passion for dance
  as a tool for healing and transformation. 
   
   CMDC's Dance Leadership Program helps women develop themselves as dancers, leaders, and agents of social change. Through our Dance Leadership Program, CMDC works with two diverse cohorts of women annually to:
   • Improve their creative expression as dancers
   • Support their personal growth as leaders
   • Increase their social impact as community activists
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  From 2010-2013, we partnered with Immanuel Presbyterian Church in Koreatown.
  Through our residency there, we practiced at their studio in exchange for
  offering free classes and performing for their congregants. CMDC was able to
  pilot our Dance Leadership Program due to the incredible in-kind donation of
  space provided to us by IPC. In 2013, due to financial challenges, the church
  could no longer continue our partnership. In looking for new space, we reached
  out to Studio A Dance in Silverlake. We began holding our self-produced shows
  at Studio A in 2011. Finding an appropriate theater venue that was affordable
  was our biggest challenge. Unless a dance company is booking or touring, it
  must self-produce its own work and self-producing can be a very expensive
  undertaking in Los Angeles. Studio A was affordable and the studio owner
  worked with us on a low-cost rate. We decided to partner up again with Studio
  A this year to and now hold all our classes and rehearsals there. Although we
  must now rent space, Studio A has made it possible to continue our program and
  develop our work for our upcoming debut performance of Amaterra this Fall.
