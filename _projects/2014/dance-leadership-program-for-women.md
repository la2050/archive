impact_create: "The life of a dancer in Los Angeles is economically challenging and many non-commercial dancers must work 2 or more jobs to support themselves while pursuing their dream. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the women we work with our self-taught dancers because of the economic challenges they’ve experienced. Our dancers have encountered financial obstacles growing up and/or in young adulthood that have prevented them from receiving extensive dance training. Having low-income has created an economic barrier to becoming a working dancer in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nCMDC seeks to provide economic growth opportunities to our participants that increase their income. By training our participants to become professional dancers with CMDC and by paying our dancers for their ongoing rehearsal and performance time, we hope to provide one model of what it looks like to help dancers thrive. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, CMDC's Dance Leadership Program offers young dancers the opportunity to receive holistic professional development training that supports them as leaders in whatever job or field they choose:\r\n\r\nAs one dancer states: \"CMDC gives me a comfortable space to explore that outlet and grow... It is constantly challenging me to be the best version of myself and pushes me to move outside of my own comfort zone. Dancing with CMDC has been transformative, healing, and radiantly inspiring. CMDC is a safe space where I have stepped into my power and gained confidence in my abilities. \" ~Ginger Alleyne\r\n\r\nTo meet the dancers and learn more about the program, please watch our video: http://www.criticalmassdancecompany.org/dance-leadership-program.html\r\n"
who_benefit: "We work with a diverse group of women from Los Angeles, ages 20-40. Our participants are a diverse group of LGBT, low-income, and/or women of color. Many are self-taught dancers who have had limited dance experience or training. Due to financial barriers growing up and/or in young adulthood, most of our dancers come to us with little to no formal dance training. Yet all possess a love for dance, a natural gift for movement and a passion for dance as a tool for healing and transformation. \r\n\r\nCMDC's Dance Leadership Program helps women develop themselves as dancers, leaders, and agents of social change. Through our Dance Leadership Program, CMDC works with two diverse cohorts of women annually to:\r\n•\tImprove their creative expression as dancers\r\n•\tSupport their personal growth as leaders\r\n•\tIncrease their social impact as community activists\r\n"
partners_collaboration: >-
  From 2010-2013, we partnered with Immanuel Presbyterian Church in Koreatown.
  Through our residency there, we practiced at their studio in exchange for
  offering free classes and performing for their congregants. CMDC was able to
  pilot our Dance Leadership Program due to the incredible in-kind donation of
  space provided to us by IPC.  In 2013, due to financial challenges, the church
  could no longer continue our partnership. In looking for new space, we reached
  out to Studio A Dance in Silverlake. We began holding our self-produced shows
  at Studio A in 2011. Finding an appropriate theater venue that was affordable
  was our biggest challenge. Unless a dance company is booking or touring, it
  must self-produce its own work and self-producing can be a very expensive
  undertaking in Los Angeles. Studio A was affordable and the studio owner
  worked with us on a low-cost rate. We decided to partner up again with Studio
  A this year to and now hold all our classes and rehearsals there. Although we
  must now rent space, Studio A has made it possible to continue our program and
  develop our work for our upcoming debut performance of Amaterra this Fall.

evaluate: "Creative Expression and Dance Ability\r\nGoal #1: Our first goal is increasing our participants’ dance knowledge and skills, as measured by:\r\n\r\n•\tObjective #1: Demonstrate mastery of 10 core dance concepts that help with strength, extension, balance and flexibility\r\n•\tObjective #2: Demonstrate mastery in 3 or more CMDC props\r\n\r\nEvaluation tool:  Pre and post assessment of skill and knowledge acquisition\r\n\r\nPersonal Growth and Self-Esteem\r\nGoal #2: Our second goal is to increase our dancers’ sense of self- confidence and self-awareness, as measured by:\r\n•\tObjective #1: Improve self-confidence as a dancer \r\n•\tObjective #2: Reduce performance-related anxiety \r\n\r\nEvaluation tool: Pre- and post-survey to be filled out by dancers\r\n\r\nSocial Awareness and Leadership\r\nGoal #7: Our final goal is to expand dancers’ social awareness and expression of community leadership, as measured by:\r\n\r\n•\tObjective #1: Taking up leadership within CMDC\r\n•\tObjective #2: Educating the public about social issues using movement as a tool\r\n\r\nEvaluation tools: Existing data and data collected over time regarding dancers' volunteerism and performance time.

Dancers educate the public through their performances, which raise awareness and inspire social action.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
two_lessons: "We have learned several lessons about the healing power of dance that is community-based and focused on empowerment and growth.  These lessons have informed our project to such a degree that we’ve identified them as core values that we share in our organization\r\nCatalyzing social change: Dance helps people to understand the world and inspire social action \r\n\r\nTransforming from within: Dance helps people shift their thoughts and feelings, which can change the world\r\n\r\nDancing is healing: Dance supports health, wellness and personal growth on the physical, emotional, spiritual and mental levels. \r\n\r\nFull creative expression of all people: Through dance, we can encourage all\r\nhuman beings to unleash their creative potential and share their healing gifts \r\n\r\nRespecting the inherent value in all: Through dance, we can affirm that everyone has something\r\nimportant to contribute. \r\n\r\nCreating community: through dance, we can build strong, lasting relationships with each other that promote the personal, cultural social and economic well-being of all.\r\n"
achievable_goal: "We’ve been able to accomplish a lot in the last four years. We piloted the program on a volunteer-basis and with an in-kind space donation. Since the program's inception in 2010, the program has served @ 50 women in Los Angeles. We have created 3 new full-length works, self-produced 6 shows, and performed at many venues in and around Central Los Angeles. \r\n\r\nWe have laid a strong foundation and have a proven track record of success. We now request the funds to rent a formal dance studio space where we can practice, to stipend our dancers for their rehearsal and performance time, to increase the production value of our shows, and to compensate the Dance Leadership Program Director for her time coordinating the program. With your support, CMDC is confident that we can reach our goals in the next 12 months. \r\n"
major_challenges: >-
  A major barrier or challenge for CMDC has been finding affordable space in the
  midst of lean funding. As stated earlier, CMDC overcame that challenge by
  reaching out and creating mutually beneficial partnerships with other
  community organizations that shared our mission and values. Moving forward,
  CMDC will continue to face each challenge by remembering that we are not
  alone.  By connecting with and collaborating with other like-minded
  organizations, we can get our needs met, help others do the same and most
  importantly, extend beyond the reaches of our own organizations' capacities to
  make a difference in society. We are greater than the sum of our parts when we
  work together.
What resources does your project need?:
  - Network/relationship support
  - Money (financial capital)
  - Volunteers/staff (human capital)
  - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
  - 'Technical infrastructure (computers, etc.)'
  - Community outreach
