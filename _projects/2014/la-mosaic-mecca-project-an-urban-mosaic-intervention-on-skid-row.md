Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  To implement the Project, Piece by Piece will direct its resources and
  networks of support toward the planning and design for a major mosaic
  installation in Skid Row. Our partner, the Trust, enjoys deep connections in
  the downtown community and will assist our effort to identify an appropriate
  location for the LA Mosaic Mecca installation. Our training programs will
  focus on skill sets and special topics that prepare participants to serve as
  Artisans for Mosaic design, fabrication and installation. We will engage more
  than 60 Visiting Artists, including both from among the roster of Mosaic,
  Design and Public Art professionals who have previously served Piece by Piece
  and outreach to new artists supplying knowledge, skill and talent to the
  project. We will form new partnerships, including with the Digital Mural Lab
  of UCLA SPARC, a unique research and teaching facility that brings state of
  the art computer technology to the production of community-based art. We will
  engage our Social Media Manager toward the end of connecting Los Angeles,
  city-wide, to our Mosaic Mecca ambitions. We will gain the support of
  representatives of the City, and of the local business community that is
  rapidly expanding within downtown neighborhoods in and surrounding the Skid
  Row area, including both the Spring Street Arts Corridor and the Arts
  District. To provide full public access to the Mosaic Mecca activity, we will
  open a storefront withing Arts District Flea, and take part in events
  organized through Grand Performances, Renegade Craft Fair and KCRW Summer
  Nights, among others. Our outreach will include extensive search for
  volunteers to assist the Mosaic Mecca Project at every level – from planning
  and design to prep and installations. 
   Steps toward completing the LA Mosaic Mecca project are in keeping with the daily operations of Piece by Piece. Operations include learning workshops for participants at every level, training labs for participants advancing toward Artisan achievement, special topics instruction from Visiting Artists in Piece by Piece studio, and professional development for Piece by Piece Artist Instructors charged with design and fabrication challenges. Our Program Director and Instructional staff will engage in advanced technology training to support their role in leading planning and design of a public art mosaic of scale that is suited to the chosen site.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  The idea of transformative art is not new: The Urban Mosaic Intervention
  conducted in Chile by Isadora Paz Lopez was manifested for a town bisected by
  concrete rails. Photos at www.mosaicartnow are not easily forgotten. In Chile
  the need was for transforming an ugly landscape. In Los Angeles the need is
  toward recognizing the resource of artists for addressing urban problems
  within systems of education, social service, workforce development, government
  and urban planning.
   
   The project will put artists to work. It has been established through research that artists can be a creative engine for a thriving society, yet opportunities for engagement remains limited. The project offers work for artists that connects them with a broader community and brings recognition to their contributions as change-makers. The visibility of the project in promoting the role of artists as not only creators but also problem-solvers, collaborators, community-builders, teachers, leaders and agents for change can guide the future of LA in recognizing the role of artists as a critical to education, urban development, and social needs at every level. In 2050, LA can be the best place for artists to work and to live and to be recognized for how their contributions impact the community at every level. 
   
   The proposed mosaic intervention will manifest as an outcome of training extended to residents of Skid Row who are vulnerable to homelessness. These participants, paired and mentored by a large corp of professional artists, will perform the labor as a culminating thesis for their own advancement in creative learning and skill. Following a training that includes both soft skills (working in teams, following instruction, complying with rules) and hard skills (design, craft and mosaic fabrication technique), participants succeed in not only directly producing a lasting work of art that brings beauty to their immediate surrounding, but also job experience that strongly lends to their potential for future employment. Skid Row Residents often share the characteristic of poor education, limited opportunity and other conditions stemming from poverty. The potential for creating opportunity through artmaking among this population helps to reduce the divide that has made homelessness a realty in our city. Art as a vehicle to individual security and success will make LA a better place to create in 2050, and a better place for everyone to live.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  More than 60 artists will benefit through their role as change-agents, more
  than doubling the roster of artists currently with Piece by Piece. More than
  100 Skid Row Residents will benefit through arts learning, skills training and
  transitional employment. Some among these will springboard toward their own
  career as artists. Others will attain permanent employment as a result of the
  job experience impact on their resume. 300 community volunteers will gain
  connection with artists and with their own creativity and deepen their
  commitment to ending homelessness and making LA a better place for all of its
  residents. Those who live, work or frequent the site chosen for the LA Mosaic
  Mecca will benefit from the beautification. The many groups currently working
  to develop economy and culture in districts that comprise the city’s core will
  benefit from enhanced connectivity stemming from the project’s implementation
  and broad outreach for inputs and support. 
   
   The Project will transition Piece by Piece to a next level, solidifying its practices and metrics toward becoming a robust arts establishment. As a social enterprise centered on arts-training and transitional employment that lends to career development both within the arts and in other industries, the advancement of the organization brings to Los Angeles a new model for engaging art to meet workforce development needs and achieve social ends.
   
   The project re-thinks the purposes of a skills training program. It is heavily inspired by expansive research that has proven that art learning can advance skill, knowledge, problem-solving and critical thinking at a rate that academic learning does not. Arts learning speaks to multiple modes: practicing concrete experience and active experimentation as well as reflection and conceptualization. Art offers learning that is accessible to people of all backgrounds, and ethnicities, and is a learning that is not impaired by language barriers. Making art central to workforce development offers participants, many with little education and limited employment experience, the opportunity to grow soft skills -- such as following instruction, complying with rules, and working in teams – while simultaneously developing hard skills in mosaic design, technique and fabrication. The innovation is with applying arts learning to workforce development practice. The model offers transitional employment as well as skills training for income earned as trained Artisan.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  This strategic partnership with Skid Row Housing Trust brings to Piece by
  Piece the resource of direct collaboration with personnel working within each
  of the Trust’s 24 buildings in Skid Row, the resource of administrative
  staffing, and a permanent studio space for located in the Trust’s Star
  Apartment Complex.
   
   Access to quality artists and state-of-the-art design and fabrication resources allows Piece by Piece team to “go big” in their vision for creating public art. The project will be formed from a spirit of city-wide collaboration and will cultivate new strategic partnerships with key Los Angeles art resources such as the Social and Public Art Resource Center (SPARC) in Venice and the Self Help Graphics & Art in East Los Angeles. Both organizations offer deep knowledge and extensive resources that lend to creative transformation in Los Angeles urban environments. 
   
   Our social enterprise partners include corporations, small businesses, and other agencies who support our Job Readiness Program through quantity order of mosaic pieces, for large-scale project commissions, as well as by carrying our product line in retail environments. These partners include Universal Studios, Irvine College, CRA/LA among many others.
   
   Other partners will include a wide range of volunteers, including students, working professionals, retirees, and corporate groups as well as engagement with other Skid Row agencies that share our objectives toward addressing needs among vulnerable populations. A partnership in place with the Downtown Women’s Center engages the Center’s Job Developer in assisting human resources role in recruiting Skid Row candidates for permanent job placement within the Piece by Piece social-enterprise as studio and sales associates.
   Factors critical to success: (1) Partnership with SRHT -- brings to bear an extensive network of private and public resources and connections that make the project possible, (2) Artist Involvement -- Through funding support from the NEA and others, Piece by Piece engages a roster of more than 25 professional artists, and will expand this roster significantly; (3) Arts-Network -- The Project will form meaningful partnership with individual artists, and also arts organizations with the talent and resources for lending support toward successful planning, design and coordination of a large Public Art installation.
