Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  We will meet with local and state administrators to educate them on the
  financial and educational benefits of GENE. There are many costs associated
  with technology in the classroom that are eliminated through GENE, so most
  will purchase their two year license with a portion of their savings. 
   
   We will institute a program of training the trainer. We will train educators in each of the districts on the features of GENE and work with them to create projects, programs and resources to benefit all the educators in their area. 
   
   The GENE Technology Team will assist the technology departments on the connection process and walk them through the connection process. All students, teachers and administrators will be provided unique usernames and passwords to gain access from anywhere at any time.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  GENE provides a secure, exclusive network for the exchange of ideas, resources
  and communications among schools globally at all levels.
   
   It enables the mentoring and coaching to improve professional development in the classroom. GENE expands curriculum choices by enabling students to take advantage of distance learning courses offered by other schools. 
   
   Institutions can share technologies and resources reducing costs well into the billions of dollars each year. 
   
   As schools save money in traditional areas such as textbooks, they can expand the technological devices in the classroom.
   
   The security of the GENE network provides a safe environment for administrators, teachers and students to grow, share and develop a better classroom for today and tomorrow.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Students, teachers and administrators will benefit from the educational
  resources, features and communications. 
   Parents will be able to 'connect' & access progress reports & key communications from the schools.
   
   Taxpayers will benefit from the amount of money schools will save and utilize towards future educational resources such as teachers, programs or benefits, instead of tax increases.
   
   School districts have the potential to recoup thousands of dollars from reducing the dropout rate as well as material savings on additional software products.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  We will partner with the State Department of Education, the local
  administrators, the teachers and higher education institutions in your area.
   
   In an effort to enable the diverse student population to have the maximum opportunity for learning, we have also been in touch with the LAUSA Department for Gifted and Talented Students and the LAUSD Multilingual and Multicultural Education Department, as we believe both of these departments serve students who have great potential, and need to have resources and opportunities to enable the maximal learning potential of every child.
   
   We are committed to help these diverse learners thrive and hope to have your support in helping to meet their instructional needs.
