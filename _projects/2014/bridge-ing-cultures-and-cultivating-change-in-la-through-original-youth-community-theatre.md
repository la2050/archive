  BRIDGE Theatre Project began in 2009 as an international theatre program
  offering worldwide exchange opportunities for youth to connect through
  original plays. Our name, BRIDGE, is an acronym for Building Relationships and
  Inspiring Dialogue through Global (or Grassroots) Exchange. We have had hugely
  successful programs here in LA and in severely impoverished areas of Ecuador
  and Nepal.
   
   We have been offered an opportunity to further develop our mission with the Lynwood Unified School District. With LA2050 support, we will expand our program goals to connect LA youth of different cultural backgrounds while promoting change within their communities by exploring solutions to local problems, all through storytelling and original theatre.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Our first goal is to connect students to themselves. Through writing prompts
  and sharing personal stories in a supportive environment, students explore
  their own dreams and struggles on a deeper level. Identifying commonalities
  among one another breaks down perceived barriers and preconceived notions
  among the group, leading to the important understanding that we are all more
  alike than different. We deepen this idea by learning about the cultural
  diversity found all around Los Angeles, demystifying stereotypes and gaining
  appreciation for the unique qualities we all possess.
   
   Through this process of writing, open sharing, and interactive theatre activities, we also begin creating an awareness of students’ own personal struggles, as well as those in the community at-large. Through theatre, we engage students to imagine: What would our lives look like without these struggles? And how do we make that happen? We also impart the importance of setting attainable goals, challenge students how to manage long-term problems and consider compromises that may be necessary (give and take).
   
   The next step is collaboration: How do we work together to make a better community? How do we unite our commonalities and utilize our unique and wonderful differences to do that? To that end, students work in small groups to combine their individual stories and solutions to create a collaborative work of art: an original, group-written play. The students then have an opportunity to perform one of the other small groups’ plays, allowing them to “try on” and “act out” other solutions that may differ from their own. This further demonstrates that there is no one way to tackle a problem – there are many great ideas, and by working together we can develop practical solutions to attain them.
   
   From there we invite the community to participate in the change-making process. Students perform their plays and share their stories in a culminating production for their families, teachers and other members of the community. We engage the audience in discussion and even bring them on stage to “perform” their ideas for creating a better society. We invite neighborhood councils, civic leaders and social service agencies to facilitate the conversation of how to make real change right now. Sustainable efforts provide the community with tools to continue the conversation after the program ends and brainstorm ways to continue motivating one another to move forward with their goals.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Despite the myriad of diverse cultures in Los Angeles, we are surprisingly
  disconnected. BRIDGE Theatre Project offers an artistic means to correct this.
  We target the youth community, because children are the key to creating
  lasting change.
   
   First and foremost, we must have a deeper understanding of who we are as individuals. Once we attain that, we can then identify what we have in common with those around us. BRIDGE expands this idea further by facilitating conversation about the diverse people and cultures prevalent in LA County, even if they have little to no current interaction with them. Opening their world view and allowing them to identify and connect with others outside their culture is a crucial component to our program. Through that means, the students can begin working together. It also prepares them for future cross-cultural interactions. The idea that we are more alike than different is paramount to unifying our society and creating positive change on the macro level.
   
   Once students foster a stronger connection to themselves, then to one another, then to other populations within LA, they connect on a working level by collaborating with their peers in small groups to write a play. They gain an understanding of the democratic process (not every idea will be used, but the group will decide as a whole). Then, to gain an appreciation for other collaborative ideas, each small group rehearses and performs another group’s play. Through this connection, each student gains a broader perspective of how society can tackle different problems.
   
   Children inspire us, and we rely on that for a successful culmination of the BRIDGE program. Families, teachers and other adults in the community will see the tangible connections made between the youth. Their progress and ability to dissolve barriers will inspire them to make a change, right here and now. Connecting them with civic leaders and service providers makes it possible for them to build a better community for themselves immediately. And the lasting effects are evident. By working with children, we plant the seeds for building a better future. We encourage students to get involved in their communities and civic processes now, and educate them how to do so even more in their adult years. BRIDGE nurtures in our youth the desire and know-how to make a change. By 2050, these students will be leaders in the community and active participants in local decision-making.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  This BRIDGE project will benefit the Lynwood community of Los Angeles County,
  particularly elementary (grades 4 & 5), middle and high school youth in the
  Lynwood Unified School District (LUSD). The potential for expanding to other
  areas of LA County is very viable, with the only factors being capital and
  greater teaching artist support. BRIDGE programs in other LA regions are part
  of our strategic plan over the next 2-3 years.
   
   There are 12 elementary, 3 middle and 3 high schools in LUSD. With LA2050 support, we will be able to conduct a 10-week BRIDGE program (2 after-school workshops per week) at each of Lynwood’s 18 schools. We anticipate that 25-35 students will participate at each school site, for an estimated total of 500-600 students served in the 2014-15 school year. An integral part of the program is also involving parents, teachers and other members of the community, linking them with civic leaders and empowering them to make positive changes.
   
   Every school in LUSD is Title I, the majority of all students coming from low-income families. Lynwood High and Lynwood Middle Schools are both in the lowest-achieving 5% for all of California, according to the CA Department of Education. Demographically, the Lynwood region is 86% Latino, 10% African American, 1% Native American, 1% Asian/Pacific Islander, and 2% White, with 24% living below the federal poverty line (2010 US Census). Bordering other high-crime neighborhoods Compton and South Gate, Lynwood also has a prevalence of gang activity. Extracurricular programs like BRIDGE, geared to making a lasting change in the community, would be of tremendous benefit, and could cause a positive ripple-effect in surrounding communities.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  Lynwood Unified School District is a confirmed collaborator on this project.
  BRIDGE was approached by LUSD’s Assistant Superintendent of Educational
  Services to implement this program in all 18 schools within the district. It
  will mark our first collaboration with LUSD.
   
   The great benefit of working directly with the school district is the ability to swiftly begin our program at each individual school without having to first establish in-roads at every site. Another advantage in our partnership with LUSD is access to limited district funding allocated for arts programming. (Please note, however, that this district funding alone is not sufficient enough to execute the full scope of our program as described here.)
   
   Our chief administrative staff includes myself, Adam Kalesperis, and Joe Quintero, co-founding directors of BRIDGE Theatre Project. We have both worked as professional artists and educators, with over 20 years combined teaching and arts management experience. As co-founding directors of BRIDGE Theatre Project, we have worked together since 2009 (and since 2008 in previous teaching capacities), sharing responsibility for all BRIDGE program decisions both here in LA and abroad.
   
   Additional partners will include teaching artists needed to execute the program at the schools. Having worked alongside many teaching artists with a variety of other LA arts organizations, we have a large pool of colleagues whom we’ve known for several years. We can attest to the quality and caliber of our network of teaching artists, and we will only approach the best of the best to be a part of this program.
   
   The following guideposts are critical to a successful collaboration with all aforementioned partners:
   1. A comprehensive understanding of our programmatic goals and benchmarks.
   2. A strong passion for working with underserved youth.
   3. A shared vision in shaping a positive future for all communities in Los Angeles.
