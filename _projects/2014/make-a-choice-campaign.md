  Ongoing: Youth leaders have developed a Tumblr for the campaign and meet twice
  a month as a group to discuss its content, which is populated with a campaign
  overview, messaging, and user-generated photography. 
   
   The September-June 2014: The school wide distribution of campaign posters will begin in September shortly after the school session begins. The campaign posters’ hashtag will lead students to Tumblr, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter where students receive prevention education information—this includes monthly prompts to use an additional hashtag that expands the dialogue to include other topics related to teen dating violence and its prevention (i.e. #silenceisviolence is an opportunity to discuss the importance of speaking out against dating violence and a prompt to break the silence and stigma around these issues). 
   
   February 2015: The community wide print roll out (billboards, street posters, bus shelters) of the campaign will be implemented in February 2015. February is nationally recognized as Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month. This will afford the campaign heightened visibility, media coverage and prime opportunities to elevate the dialogue on teen dating violence and the promotion of healthy relationships. After several months of engaging youth on these issues, the campaign will widen to engage community members who are cued by the print campaign to connect online about how they can support youth and model healthy relationships.
   
   Ongoing: Youth leaders continue to participate in a weekly segment of The Beautiful Struggle on KPFK to speak about the issues impacting them, with a specific focus on preventing relationship violence. The teen dating violence PSAs they created will continue to run throughout the year, with heavy rotation in February.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  This project will engage students and adult allies through creative outreach
  and social media strategies. Together; youth and those who care about youth,
  will create communities and campuses that promote safety, nonviolence and
  support for youth who have experienced interpersonal violence. The campaign
  empowers youth and provides them with tools to build healthy relationships, to
  prevent dating and sexual violence and to educate adult allies on how to
  support them in building lives free from violence. 
   
   Beyond educating youth and adults, the campaign’s call to action: Make A Choice will mobilize students, parents, educators and community members to support the implementation of LAUSD’s Resolution to Promote Healthy Relationships and Prevent Teen Dating Violence. This resolution was passed in October 2012 following the murder of Cindi Santana, a LAUSD student, by her boyfriend on their school campus. The resolution, which calls for the development of a district wide policy on how to respond to teen dating and sexual violence, as well as an across the board training for staff on these issues, is currently being piloted in three schools (a formal collaborative project between Peace Over Violence and LAUSD). This campaign has the capacity to garner attention for implementation across the entire school district, which will create systems change and ultimately, climates of safety and support for youth so that they can succeed on a social-emotional and academic level.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  This project will directly benefit students of the Los Angeles Unified School
  District (over 671,000 students). Dating and sexual violence continue to
  impact youth in the U.S. at rates higher than any other form of violence in
  this age group. One in three adolescents in the U.S. is a victim of physical,
  sexual, emotional or verbal abuse from a dating partner— a figure that far
  exceeds rates of other types of youth violence. Additionally, young people, 12
  to 19 years old, experience the highest rates of rape and sexual assault (U.S.
  Department of Justice-2009). Experiencing teen dating violence and sexual
  assault has severe consequences for youth; these forms of violence are
  associated with higher levels of substance abuse, violence, victimization, as
  well as lower school achievement. Dating violence victims present a strong,
  consistent pattern of exposure to, and participation in, a broad range of
  high-risk behaviors, including eating disorders, sexual risk behavior,
  pregnancy, and suicidal ideation. This project will support the development of
  healthy relationships and healthy lives for this target population at LAUSD
  schools campuses and surrounding communities.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: |-
  Los Angeles Unified School District-confirmed
   Peace Over Violence has worked in collaboration with LAUSD since 1991, implementing its In Touch With Teens relationship violence prevention curriculum and youth leadership development activities throughout middle and high school campuses. POV & LAUSD are currently partners on a Department of Justice federal grant (STEP), piloting a violence prevention policy, campus wide staff training and response protocols in three schools in Highland Park, LA. This is the second largest school district in the U.S. and a key partner in engaging youth, parents, educators and stakeholders. 
   
   KPFK 90.7 Beautiful Struggle-confirmed. 
   Youth leaders continue to participate in The Beautiful Struggle’s weekly segments. TBS commits to running the Campaign PSAs with heavy rotation in February for Teen Dating Violence Prevention and Awareness Month. 
   
   Dawn Faelner & John Park-confirmed
   Dawn and John have come on the project as design consultants, working with youth to develop their ideas into design elements for print, social media, and digital distribution. They are formally trained by Rebeca Mendez, who developed Peace Over Violence's signature brand and brand guidelines. They have been involved with the agency throughout Summer 2014 and will ensure campaign brand consistency. 
   
   The three critical factors in these partnerships are: 1. school buy-in and support for campaign implementation and dissemination, 2. continuous radio distribution/coverage of campaign, and 3. on going campaign design mentorship and brand development with youth.
