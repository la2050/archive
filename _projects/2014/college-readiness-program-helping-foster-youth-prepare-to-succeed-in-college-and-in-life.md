  Central to UFC’s approach is providing the foster youth in our programs with
  long-term relationships with UFC staff members, who serve as the source of
  consistent support that many foster youth lack in their lives. Counselors act
  as mentors and advisors to each student, and also encourage the youth to
  advocate for themselves. This support extends to caregivers as well, who
  benefit from workshops and activities focused on creating a college-bound
  atmosphere in their home. 
    Counselors follow participants through whatever home and school placement changes they may experience. As the average California foster youth experiences at least three placement changes during their time in foster care, this component is key to their success. Program activities include:
   Academic Preparation
   Students attend monthly weekend workshops that provide the essential information to create a clear path to college. Counselors work with students to help them set academic and personal goals and create an academic plan to meet those goals. Students are provided with supplemental services that may include tutoring, SAT preparation, and referrals to other services. 
   Educational Advocacy
   Counselors work with youth to provide educational advocacy in areas surrounding IEPs, TILPs and TDMs in addition to coordinating access to support services with CSWs.
   Workshops & College Tours
   Through workshops and tours of local college campuses, students explore college and career options, develop cultural awareness and enhance their academic skills. In addition, monthly workshops support eligible seniors in the program as they apply to colleges, and to assist them in making application for financial aid. 
   Enrichment Activities
   A host of summer programs and unique activities are offered to the youth to support their personal development and expose them to career opportunities.
   For the coming year, CRP has begun creating and implementing two new initiatives: an Alternate Track for to prepare non-four-year college bound students for success through a year-long workshop series, college visits and specialized services; and a six-month extension of services for all CRP graduates - including access to the usual services e.g. tutoring, as well as one-on-one support in the preparation of personal transition plans.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Almost one seventh of the 400,000 children in foster care in the US reside in
  the state of California, and one third of those are in Los Angeles County
  (AFCARS and CCWIP, 2012). Over 8,000 of the 18,700 children in care in Los
  Angeles County are between the ages of 11 and 21 (CCWIP, 2012), and it is
  these children and youth whose futures UFC seeks to improve through its
  programs. Compared with their peers in the general population, foster youth
  experience poor outcomes in a number of areas of their life. When foster youth
  leave care, they are on their own with little to no support system to help
  them navigate the difficult path to adulthood. The informal safety net built
  by familial bonds that so many of us take for granted does not exist for many
  former foster youth. There is no grace period and no safe place to return when
  things do not go as planned. As a result, foster youth are perhaps one of the
  most vulnerable populations in our communities. The statistics, especially
  those related to educational attainment, show that the majority of Los Angeles
  County foster youth exiting care will not become successfully independent as
  adults:
   • Only about one half of students in foster care pass California’s high school exit exam in grade 10, compared to 76% of all 10th graders 
   • High school students in foster care in California have the highest dropout rate at 8%, compared to 3 to 5% for other at-risk student subgroups
   • The high school graduation rate for students in foster care in California is lower, at 58%, than other at-risk student subgroups, whose rates range from 60 to 79%
   • In Los Angeles, less than half of foster youth enroll in community college, and in one study, only 2% of these received Associate’s degrees and 2% met criteria for transfer to a four-year program in the University of California or California State University systems 
   The perpetuation of these poor educational outcomes for foster youth results in (1) the personal potential of thousands of individuals going unrealized; (2) great stores of energy, experience, and talent that could benefit our communities, going untapped; and (3) many of these individuals using disproportionate amounts of public services, either through welfare assistance or incarceration. UFC’s model interventions have proven that a relatively small, well-timed investment in foster youth can unlock the potential of this vulnerable population to become an invaluable asset to our communities.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  UFC's programs serve foster youth throughout Los Angeles County. We currently
  serve approximately 1,300 foster children and youth annually, including 500
  individuals in the Readiness program. The CRP is open to any student in Los
  Angeles County foster care interested in taking advantage of the services UFC
  has to offer and is not enrolled in a Special Day Class. New students are
  recruited in grades seven through nine to ensure the possibility of at least
  four years of participation. Students are referred by DCFS social workers,
  advocates, partner schools, or siblings of CRP students.
   
   Of CRP program participants:
   
   • 58% are female and 42% are male;
   • 44% are African American, 42% Hispanic, 2% Caucasian, 1% Asian, 2% Bi Racial, and 9% Other/NA; and
   • 61% are in high school and 39% are in middle school.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  One of UFC’s greatest strengths is our partnerships and service linkage with
  other organizations. Due to the frequency and intimacy of our contact with
  youth we serve and when applicable, their caregivers, UFC is in a unique
  position to assess the particular gaps in services and/or needs of individual
  foster youth. The College Readiness program works with many partners,
  including the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services
  (DCFS), UCLA Connecting Communities, Coalition for Engaged Education’s Forward
  Program, CASA, iFoster, LACOE Foster Youth Services, Public Counsel, Green
  Dot, SoCalCAN, Education Coordinating Council, Court Scholars, L.A. Compact,
  Children’s Law Center, Success in Degrees, Camp Felix, First Star UCLA Bruin
  Guardian Academy, Alliance for Children’s Rights, and numerous Foster Family
  Agencies and Group Homes.
