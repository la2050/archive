  Through beautiful, unstructured dinner parties hosted by friends for friends,
  we invite those who’ve experienced significant loss--a parent, a partner, a
  sibling, a friend--to dive into long-tabooed territory. 
   
   With the help of a growing network of hosts, we’re creating spaces that are warm, inviting & conducive to sharing the part of ourselves we otherwise keep hidden. Rather than treat loss as a conversation-killer, we’re using it to inspire our most profound conversations & deepest relationships. 
   
   And we're working to tackle cultural taboos head-on, by creating spaces & tools through which those who've yet to experience this level of loss can gain insights about how to be better friends to those who have.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: |-
  Our strategy is three-fold: 
   
   1. Network-building: At the core of our work is a growing network of Dinner Party tables, each powered by 1-2 hosts, who are in turn supported by a combination of training retreats, open-source toolkits, and on-going coaching. 
   Goal: 
   - Grow # of LA Dinner Party tables from 4 to 15; 
   - Find and support local Host Mentor to serve as the primary point-of-contact for local hosts, and an LA City Coordinator, responsible for matching participants & hosts; 
   - Hold quarterly dinners among local Dinner Party hosts 
   
   2. Collect & share healthy habits, practices, & rituals: A 2013 study by researchers at the Harvard Business School revealed that people who had found a way to move forward had discovered and embraced what they called, "personal rituals." We are working to surface and share the practices and resources that emerge around our tables, in order to capture stories and tools to inspire self-care.
   Goal: 
   - Publish digital and print copies of Finding What Feeds Us, a photo journal featuring recorded stories & rituals shared by wide range of Dinner Partiers, currently in process;
   - Develop and execute LA-focused digital activation campaign, as a reminder to live boldly each and every day. 
   
   3. Break down taboos: We’ve all got stories to tell: funny stories, gut-punching stories, stories that tell us who we are, and allow us to hold on to the people who live only in memory. All too often, however, those stories are invisible: something we keep hidden even from ourselves. We want to invite Angelenos to find and share their own stories of #lifeafterloss, and to remind them that they’re not as alone as they might think. 
   Goal: 
   - In the spirit of The Moth and Vagina Monologues, we’ll host a public event featuring live readings, exploring loss and its role as part of our common currency: the subject that binds us across socio-economic, cultural, and generational lines. The event will feature voices and stories from folks at our tables, along with participants and members of partnering organizations, who share a commitment to breaking down taboos around life after loss.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  LA is a big, vibrant community where it can be easy to get lost and to feel
  isolated; a place where finding your tribe takes time. It’s a city of thriving
  micro-communities that don’t always intersect, where connecting across lines
  of difference requires more than simply walking down the street. 
   
   But LA is also a city of unique and, if we may be so bold, extraordinary potential. It’s a city whose food culture is the product of the unique backgrounds & family histories we bring to it. It’s a city of yoga studios, community gardens, where wellness is taken seriously. It’s a city where entrepreneurs and communities reshape cultural boundaries so we can live better together, from Home Boy Industry’s Father Greg to TreePeople’s Andy Lipkis. It’s a city that’s mastered the art of telling stories, and changing the way we look at issues. We believe we can change the way we choose to connect here, and by doing it here, change the way we connect everywhere. 
   
   In the short-term, we want to make it easier to find people with a particular shared experience, and to treat loss not as the ultimate conversation-killer, but instead as a door-opener---one that can lead to profound conversations and deep relationships. 
   
   In the long-term, we want to to dismantle prevailing taboos, and to establish a new set of norms among young people who’ve experienced significant loss. We want to realize a day in which young people everywhere can easily find a Dinner Party near them, or else start one of their own: a day in which it’s perfectly normal to get together with people you know who’ve lived through similar experiences, and talk openly over dinner about subjects we otherwise keep under lock and key. We’d like to see increases in the number of people replicating our strategy, measured by toolkit downloads, and evidence of impact on the local dialogue, measured by everything from the number of people reached online and off, to the number of local influencers engaged. 
   
   We foresee a day in which Dinner Parties in LA are as pervasive as AA meetings, and as culturally acceptable and readily accessible as yoga and meditation classes: a day in which young people who have experienced loss are recognized not as objects of pity, but as better listeners and better leaders, characterized by profound empathy, resilience, and agency.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Ours is a community of mostly 20- and 30-somethings, who’ve each experienced
  significant loss, and get together over Dinner Parties to talk about it and
  the ways in which continues to affect our lives. Some of us have lost parents;
  others, siblings, partners, or friends. For some of us, it’s been six months,
  for others, sixteen years. Some of us are actively grieving, others not. Our
  identities and labels include gay, straight, women, men, unmarried, married,
  of varying backgrounds, creeds, and economic strata. Some of us have struggled
  in visible ways, grappling with depression, or eating disorders, or general
  listlessness. Others were simply leading what author Parker Palmer calls,
  “divided lives”: compelled to cover up a key part of themselves. 
   
   What binds us together is a refusal to subsist on platitudes: a promise to one another to abstain from bullshit, and to speak our own truth, as others speak theirs. We’re not trying to “fix” each other: we’re creating a space where it’s okay to be not okay, where it’s easy to swap therapists’ contact info, where we can cheer each other on on our good days, and be the person to call on the bad. 
   
   Over the coming year, we’d like to develop partnerships with individuals and organizations working in parts of LA where loss and trauma is daily reality. We have no grand illusions about bringing candles and flowers and potluck dinner parties into neighborhoods where crime rates run high and children are more likely to attend funerals than graduation ceremonies. Yet we’ve found that loss can serve as an extraordinary bridge-builder across lines of difference, be they cultural, economic, or age-based. While our stories may be different, each of us knows what it is to be alone. In naming that, we believe we can learn to see one another not as “other,” but by what we have in common below the surface. We want to work with those already on the ground, and to help create tools that make it easier to talk openly about shared experiences of loss. 
   
   We’re inspired by the possibilities latent in bringing people together from across cultural lines who may appear to be leagues apart, but through a dinner party conversation, discover parallel experiences. We see a future of advocacy and action enabled by these connections, and fueled by the epiphany often had around the Dinner Party table that we’re not so different after all, and that the pressure points felt in one of our neighborhoods need to be solved by us all.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  Our advisors and collaborators currently include the Center for Courage and
  Renewal (www.couragerenewal.org), and a number of individuals and
  organizations practiced in the art of #realtalk and opening up spaces where
  people can express vulnerability, as well as Hope After Project
  (http://www.hopeafterproject.com/). We can envision significant collaboration
  opportunities with others in the grief support space, including Camp Erin
  (http://www.ourhouse-grief.org/programs/camp-erin-los-angeles/) , where
  several Dinner Partiers have volunteered, and/or Our House, which several have
  attended. 
   
   Confirmed event partners include EngAGE (www.engagedaging.org) and Experience Talks (http://www.experiencetalks.org/), and we are currently in conversation with several other potential organizations with a passion for story. Finally, regarding a digital campaign, the Harry Potter Alliance (thehpalliance.org) is already on board, and it’s something we’d like to explore with several existing friends in this space as well, including ModernLoss (www.modernloss.org).
