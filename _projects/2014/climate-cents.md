Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Divining LA will convert cutting-edge research on stormwater resources,
  groundwater augmentation, water recycling, and water conservation into
  planning and design strategies for neighborhoods across Los Angeles. Divining
  LA will pair economically and culturally diverse community-based organizations
  with teams of university and professional designers. Each team will be
  challenged and supported to invent a water-smart future for specific
  neighborhoods. Teams will generate design visions and policy recommendations
  for their own small-scale, distributed approaches to a localized water future,
  appropriate to the scale, tempo, and flavor of their neighborhood, and the
  greater hydrologic function of the LA basin. 
   
   Divining LA provides an opportunity not only to residents and business owners to visualize climate adaptation and mitigation strategies; it also provides a much-needed, real-time opportunity for Los Angelesâ€™ rich design culture to advance water-smart planning policy and building systems for a resilient future.
   
   Divining LA will bring together faculty, graduate and undergraduate researchers from Woodbury, asmall, private Hispanic-serving university, and collaborator design programs from around the region. Teams will have the support and involvement of engineers from public water agencies and leading global firms; NGOs with long track records of service to the communities of Los Angeles; and multidisciplinary research and design teams from universities and the design professions. In year one, Divining LA partners will build on existing relationships throughout its collaborator network to identify specific neighborhoods and community-based organizations for partnerships. Divining LA will partner with a range of communities facing specific hydrologic, economic, and cultural challenges that would most benefit from being paired with Divining LA planning and design teams. The goal is to generate a set of visionary water-management strategies for each of the disparate communities engaged, and to propose and advocate for new policies suggested by the design challenge. From these, a small number of projects will be selected as possible demonstration projects. Divining LA will widely publicize, encourage debate, document and disseminate the results of all projects.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  LA benefits today in engaging citizens to design their own destiny. LA
  benefits tomorrow with water, energy, and carbon savings. Los Angeles River
  Watershed area, at 864 square miles and 65% impermeability, generates 350,000
  acre feet of storm water runoff per year, enough for 2,100,000 people per year
  at current usage rates or with conservation measures in place, enough for
  2,625,000 people. That translates to a gross energy savings of 700 gigawatt
  hours or the equivalent of taking 130,000 passenger vehicles off the road.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Divining LA outreach has the potential to bring advanced geospatial research
  to public benefit rapidly. It has the potential to optimize the hydrologic
  function of the arid built environment; uncouple the water-energy nexus;
  produce hydrologic planning, zoning, building code reforms; encourage small
  scale distributed water infrastructures as design opportunities that respect
  the cultural and biophysical attributes of communities and watersheds; promote
  building-integrated water systems innovation for the global marketplace;
  retool science and design curricula to creatively engage the challenges of
  climate adaptation; and increase participation of underrepresented
  communities. Divining LA outputs are scaleable and transferable to
  water-stressed environments affecting 30 million people in the US West, and
  1.2 billion people worldwide.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Partners who have confirmed their participation and support include
  TreePeople, ARUP
   City of LA Bureau of Engineering, City of LA Bureau of Sanitation/Watershed Protection Program, County of LA Flood Control/Watershed Management program, LADWP Stormwater Management, UCLA Water Resources Group, American Institute of Architects | Los Angeles, Perkins + Will Architects, AC Martin Architects, and Mia Lehrer + Associates. ALI has secured the preliminary interest of design leaders at USC, UCLA, CalPoly Pomona, Art Center College of Design, SCI-Arc, and of course Woodbury School of Architecture.
