  Project SPIN’s main focus areas include Policy and Advocacy (developing
  inclusive policies and best practices for systemic change), Mental Health Care
  Coordination and Support (support LGBT students with crisis support and
  resources), Safe Schools (continuing to work with schools to develop a
  comprehensive approach to addressing hostile environments, promoting
  connectedness, and building a culture of kindness), Transgender Support
  (support districts in developing policies that enumerate gender identity and
  gender expression), and Capacity Building (build capacity to create safe and
  affirming school environments). 
   One of the most prominent of these programmatic elements is the 2013 launch the Out for Safe Schools Campaign – a collaboration between LAUSD, The California Endowment, and other organizations to create OUT for Safe Schools badges to demonstrate visible support of the LGBTQ community by LAUSD staff. The badges have the word “ally” in seven languages, which provide an opportunity for school site personnel to declare that they support LGBTQ youth. With last year’s launch of OUT for Safe Schools, nearly 50 LAUSD staff and students filmed I’m Coming OUT for Safe Schools Public Service Announcements, including the LAUSD Superintendent, chief of school police, bus drivers, students, teachers, principals, parents, grandparents and many more – reaching an audience of 15 million with national media exposure. More than 30,000 badges distributed to 1/3 of all LAUSD staff and administration. 
   
   The District and the Center recognize the critical importance of SPIN’s anti-bullying education and programs in addressing these issues. But we also know that the bullying of LGBTQ youths and other psychological acts of brutality in school are usually at the end of a long chain of societal homophobia and transphobia that has battered the self-esteem of young people long before they arrive at the schoolyard. A serious approach to protecting all students and decreasing suicidal ideation requires a comprehensive approach by school systems that incorporates anti-bullying efforts as well as collaborative partnerships with parents, mental health providers, social services agencies, and law enforcement and religious organizations. This is exactly the approach that Project SPIN is taking, closing in on its goal of genuine systemic change that can be replicated across the nation.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  LAUSD is the nation’s second largest school district and has been a leader in
  addressing issues facing LGBTQ youth for many years and has initiated
  innovative programs in this area. The Los Angeles LGBT Center is the largest
  LGBT organization in the world and has been at the forefront in offering
  services to LGBTQ youth and, in particular, at-risk youth. By working with
  LAUSD and in collaboration with a variety of other organizations and
  communities, Project SPIN will collectively create an environment in all
  district schools where students feel safe to come to school, be true to
  themselves, and advance in both their education and careers. Project SPIN’s
  curriculum and response training, systemic and policy restructuring, and
  unified support of all people in our community can create a 2050 Los Angeles
  where mindsets are shifted, equality is achieved, and internal happiness and
  justice is restored for the marginalized youth that are presently suffering so
  many deficits. Our staff works relentlessly and with the utmost passion to
  create transformational impact that will allow our youth to be given the
  opportunity to reach their fullest potential and to become future leaders one
  day.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  This project will benefit all lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning
  (LGBTQ) youth, as well as other youth in LAUSD who will benefit from the
  creation of a genuine safe space in their school community. LGBTQ students in
  particular are at far greater risk of dropping out of school and they
  experience depression, violence, harassment, substance use and addiction,
  homelessness, HIV infection, and the ultimate tragedy – suicide – at much
  higher rates than their heterosexual counterparts. Together with LAUSD, we
  want to ensure we are working collaboratively to support our students and
  staff sending the message that it’s safe to be you in our schools. In
  addition, Project SPIN will benefit many other members of our community –
  teachers, principals, families, police officers, bus drivers, and the other
  individuals that will be given the tools necessary to create a safe and
  inclusive environment for LGBTQ youth.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Project SPIN's main collaboration partner is the Los Angeles Unified School
  District –a partner since the beginning of its existence. Working with LAUSD
  allows us to take our mission for Project SPIN and implement it in the more
  than 1,200 schools that are a part of the District. With their support, we are
  able to create systemic changes on a larger platform, leaving a lasting impact
  for future generations in the public school system. The factors critical to
  the success of our collaboration include funding for resources and
  implementation, prior success in the work that we do, and a unified belief in
  Project SPIN's mission.
   
   In addition to LAUSD and The Los Angeles LGBT Center, the SPIN effort includes the collaboration of the GSA Network, the Trevor Project, Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles, Trans Youth Family Allies, the ACLU of Southern California, the Latino Equality Alliance, PFLAG, the L.A. County Dept. of Mental Health (DMH), the Los Angeles Police Dept. and a dozen other organizations. Representatives of these groups meet regularly and developing an action plans to reduce homophobia and transphobia in district schools and get young people the support they need. Project SPIN brings together agencies that are primarily focused on mental health (DidiHirsch and DMH) as well as LGBTQ-specific agencies to bridge the gaps in supporting schools and build stronger collaborations. 
   
   We have also partnered bargaining units (SEIU, UTLA, and ALAA), GSA Network, and others to produce our OUT for Safe Schools badges – part of the OUT for Safe Schools Campaign. All of the partners listed are confirmed and were part of last year’s Project SPIN campaign. 
   
   Lastly, Project SPIN has recently partnered with ONE National Gay & Lesbian Archives at the University of Southern California to develop educational materials for implementation of the California FAIR Education Act (2011). In June of 2014, Project SPIN created a resource guide of inclusive curriculum that teachers can use as supplement to textbooks.
