Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Recognizing that LA is a place where no life or space is wasted, ABF creates
  opportunities for the formerly incarcerated to build up the health of
  communities by growing healthy food in and for these communities. 
   
   The impact of ABF with its seasoned staff proposes real solutions to the growing problems of California’s overcrowded prisons and food injustice in LA’s low-income neighborhoods. 
   
   ABF aims to grow the scale of its operations by forging partnerships with existing reentry housing programs for the formerly incarcerated throughout the region of LA in order to create more urban farms for growing organic food, training and employing urban farmers, and gathering and synergizing community members around this effort.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  ABF supports the formerly incarcerated in their transition from prison
  isolation to community integration. In order to successfully reintegrate,
  people require the chance for community, productivity and the experience of
  self-worth. 
   
   Through ABF, women and men have an opportunity to develop a variety of job and life skills as urban farmers. They serve the community by growing food for families in need and for restaurants providing locally sourced and organic food. They serve their own families through education about healthy nutrition and through developing strong work ethic and habits in an organization that prioritizes ethical business practices and excellence in the work we deliver. 
   
   The manifestation of this idea to create an LA of reintegration through urban farming is a dynamic process of DIALOGUING, DIGGING, and DELIVERING. This project of creating opportunities for the formerly incarcerated begins with dialogue between ABF and its partner-organizations and partner-landowners. Mindful of the particular and distinct roles among organizations that work with and for the formerly incarcerated, ABF listens carefully to its partners’ needs. This ensures careful planning for the creation of a sustainable urban farm. 
   
   Following dialogue is digging – the process of turning over soil and uncovering the potential of the land. This project phase of digging includes designing and implementing the edible landscape and water-wise irrigation made up of raised beds for vegetables, pollinator beds with California-friendly plants, and drip irrigation systems for efficient watering. 
   
   The third phase of project implementation is delivering harvest for two primary reasons, outreach and revenue. A portion of the harvest from these urban farms will provide individuals and families in low-income neighborhoods with affordable and healthy seasonal food while an allotment supplies seasonal ingredients to restaurants for revenue to sustain this endeavor. 
   
   This project of community-supported reintegration of the formerly incarcerated is a reminder that all in LA are stakeholders for making LA the best place in the world to create, learn, play, connect and be the healthiest place to live. The interdependence of lives and landscapes in LA consolidates a collective voice that exclaims a sense of shared ownership that this is OUR LA.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  With its partner-organizations, ABF will make LA the best place to create
  today because its collaborative urban farming project proactively engages and
  empowers the diversity of lives and landscapes to hold a stake in making LA
  the best place to create a better tomorrow. 
   
   Today’s headlines of the ever-increasing levels of incarceration and overcrowded prisons, the escalating health challenges of overweight and obese children and adults, and the proliferation of food deserts that lack ready access to fresh, healthy and affordable foods in LA’s urban neighborhoods are intertwined symptoms stemming from the devastation of human isolation. 
   
   Like preparing soil for seed sowing, ABF and its partners work to integrate the formerly incarcerated into the larger community by continually amending the attitude of the larger community through opportunities for interaction around the activity of urban farming, food delivery and nutrition education in addition to continuing advocacy efforts. 
   
   This is a necessary step taken for preparing the larger community to extend its welcome. ABF, along with our urban farmers and partners, will also be transforming landscapes within communities, helping to shift the relationships between residents and the spaces they inhabit. 
   
   Through urban farming today, persons – formerly incarcerated and not – integrate into renewed spaces: backyards re-created into urban farms and drought-tolerant landscapes that welcome home birds, bees, and bugs that we all rely upon for LA’s well being.
   
   The LA of 2050 holds promise as LA today participates actively and consciously in the process of reintegrating and welcoming home the prisoner, re-purposing backyards into urban farms and, ultimately, creating an ecology of interdependence. 
   
   According to James Jiler in Doing Time in the Garden, “Many of the ‘pristine’ forests in the Central American jungles are nothing more than overgrown kitchen gardens established by the Mayan Indians centuries ago.” LA today could leave its legacy for the LA in 2050 and future generations by integrating the diversity of life and installing urban farms that will provide for LA’s fruitful future. Reintegrating the formerly incarcerated creates greater diversity in the LA community while repurposing backyards into urban farms is the beginning to the 2050 LA food forest.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  The complexity of interdependent relationships connected to ABF’s vision for
  LA speaks to some of the beneficiaries. We anticipate the primary
  beneficiaries of this project will include the diverse population of the
  formerly incarcerated who, with the support of ABF and its partners, have a
  new opportunity as urban farmers to pursue their dreams of becoming
  productive, creative members of the community on their return home. The urban
  farmers participating in ABF will bring benefits to their families and
  neighbors through setting alternate examples for behavior, productivity and
  creativity within the community. 
   
   While this opportunity in urban farming provides immediate job and life skills, this project gradually unlocks the potential of persons once in the custody of the criminal justice system to serve as custodians and caretakers of the communities in which they live. The ripple effect of reintegrating those who were formerly incarcerated restores their identity as family members and community contributors.
   
   Extending benefits beyond the personal lives of the formerly incarcerated, this project has a larger and direct impact within the communities that welcome urban farming. More specifically, there is an outreach component of this project that impacts low-income neighborhoods. 
   
   Additionally, the impact of this project benefits local chefs and restaurants by supplying restaurants with locally sourced, organic seasonal ingredients. Chefs will get to know their grower personally, source their ingredients locally, and more importantly participate in the promotion of this project to a wider audience. One example of the long-term benefits of more restaurants sourcing locally and organically grown produce is the generation of more urban farming jobs in LA. 
   
   The organic method of growing food honors the social contract between our life and the land. Introducing organic amendments to nourish the soil creates another world or beneficial microbes that, in turn, make soil healthy and fertile for plant growth. The organic method of managing pests with companion planting and habitat restoration for birds, bees, and bugs pays attention to the smaller life forms often overlooked but crucially relied upon for the healthy growth of plants. 
   
   This project honors the complex of interdependent relationships between life in its many diverse forms and landscapes.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  ABF has both confirmed and pending collaborators on this project. These
  partner organizations include restorative justice ministries, reentry housing
  programs, local businesses, schools and churches. 
   
   Notably, ABF’s new partnership with The Francisco Homes (TFH), a transitional housing for the formerly incarcerated, provides an opportunity for a larger impact. The singular impact of this collaboration between ABF and TFH rests upon these three factors that ensure the success of this endeavor: 1) combination of resources, 2) complementary services for the formerly incarcerated, and 3) consolidation of support to reintegrate the formerly incarcerated into community.
   
   While ABF emphasizes reintegration through urban farming, and TFH places emphasis on reentry housing, both ABF and TFH work complementarily. The work of reintegration through this collaboration mutually strengthens our respective missions and creates greater impact for those who were locked up to become productive members of our communities. 
   
   Both ABF and TFH have supportive networks to help address both immediate and long-term needs of those recently released from prison. Working collaboratively and sharing these supportive networks consolidates support services to ensure successful reentry while preserving public safety, and further, promoting the overall public health. The ABF and TFH collaboration creates a larger impact by empowering those who were incarcerated to restart their lives in the setting of a new home and to reintegrate their lives into communities through urban farming.
   
   ABF continues to collaborate with local businesses. Most notably, we collaborate with local restaurant Good Girl Dinette in Highland Park by identifying and growing vegetables for seasonal specials on their menu. 
   
   ABF also collaborates with schools and churches. Most notably, ABF’s collaboration with staff and students from Cal Poly Pomona’s Department of Landscape Architecture has developed a system for chicken coop installations that will increase the variety of food produced in ABF’s urban farms. 
   
   ABF’s partnerships with reentry housing programs, local restaurants and businesses, schools and churches create more opportunities to scale up the scope of support services for the reintegration of the lives of those who were locked up and the empowerment of communities where urban farming takes place.
