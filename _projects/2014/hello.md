Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): |-
  LASC will implement this idea through the following activities:
   a. Senior Fellows: Hire four temporary or part time “Senior Fellows” to be managed and coached by LASC Board and staff to oversee research and programs under each initiative area. Senior Fellows will be young professionals or graduate students, with demonstrated interest in Southern California sustainability issues. Each Senior Fellow’s job description is as follows:
   i. Perform continual oversight over multiple Research Fellows.
   ii. Identify and propose outreach and advocacy campaigns to advance each initiative area.
   iii. Work with current partner organizations and agencies to identify next steps, outreach opportunities, and additional research needed.
   iv. Identify/draft at least two new research ideas per initiative, network with potential partners, and solicit student interest.
   b. New Leaders in Sustainability (NLS)
   i. The NLS Program will fill a critical need in Southern California by helping train, empower, and launch new leaders within the environmental community. This would be the region’s first program of its kind. The NLS program will provide participants with access to leading industry experts, policy makers, and advocates; opportunities to attend and participate in policy briefings with regional stakeholders; and professional mentoring. 
   ii. NLS will provide participants with: 
   1. access to experts , policy makers, and other professionals; 
   2. one-on-one mentoring opportunities; 
   3. access to leadership and advocacy training seminars and meetings; and 
   4. an opportunity to organize policy/community briefings in collaboration with partner organizations. NLS participants will be selected from applicants with demonstrated interest in local sustainability and environmental advocacy. 
   c. Organizational Development
   i. Expand awareness of LASC’s mission and impact through increased education, fundraising, and public outreach
   ii. Support a 2-day strategic planning workshop for LASC Board, staff, and partners to 
   develop and start implementing new 5-year strategy. This will allow us to analyze our growth over the last 5 years and identify how best to advance LASC’s mission and sustainability in Los Angeles in the future.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  LASC’s mission is directly in line with the goals and metrics of LA2050. We
  are not only making LA the best place to live, but also to play, connect,
  create, and learn today and into the future. We prepare our region’s future
  leaders with the tools and guidance needed to transform LA into a place with
  low obesity rates; clean air and water; access to local and healthy food; and
  plenty of green space Furthermore, our collaborations with academia, local
  government, non-governmental organizations, private businesses, and community
  groups, create invaluable partnerships which attract young and up-and-coming
  researchers and thought-leaders to Los Angeles’s growing environmental
  movement. By doing so, we will encourage innovative thinking, creative
  solutions, and exciting new partnerships to ensure LA will be more sustainable
  in 2050 than ever before.
   
   To date, LASC has funded and coached 17 graduate Fellows to research emerging, current, and local environmental issues. Each Fellow is required to identify opportunities to use their research to educate the public and advance our initiatives. Current projects include research on how to improve local food policy, create ways (including using alleys and freeways) to increase the number of urban parks, and identify best practices to conserve and protect water resources. Previous fellows identified how to reform parking policies, increase biking, and minimize air pollution exposure through urban design and traffic management strategies. Additionally, Fellows identified specific strategies emergency response and coastal agencies ought to employ to prevent and address the threat of a major oil spill off our coast. 
   
   All of our past and current Fellows’ research helps make LA the best place to be today and in the future. In the next year, with your support, LASC will create four new quality entry-level LA-based green jobs, fund 8-10 new research Fellowships, and pilot our New Leaders in Sustainability Program, which will provide our region’s future leaders with the tools and guidance needed to make LA the healthiest place to live by 2050. By then, LASC will have supported hundreds, if not thousands, of student research Fellowships, provided working experience and mentorship to our region’s young professionals, and training new sustainability leaders to make LA a healthy and vibrant environment. Additionally, LASC will lead the nation with the original model and headquarters for numerous Sustainability Collaboratives.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Over the next year, expanded LASC operations will benefit current fellows, a
  new class of 12-15 NLS participants, as well as LASC’s current and future
  partners and staff, which includes 4 Senior Fellows and 8-10 Research Fellows.
  With your support, LASC will create original research and policy
  recommendations, which will advance our initiatives and benefit all those who
  live, work, learn and play in the City of LA. 
   
   Current Research Fellows, students at 5 southern California based universities, will benefit from expanded support to educate the public and advocate for change based on their findings. These projects include how to improve demand side water management, increase wetlands resiliency in the face of climate change, reduce air pollution through urban design, and create a revitalized network of green alleyways. Current partners include the LA Food Policy Council and South Park BID. 
    
   New hires, new fellowship recipients, and participants of the NLS program will receive a valuable opportunity to develop their careers by working with preeminent experts in their fields of interest, actively engaging and contributing to the missions of respected environmental organizations in the region, and making a direct and substantive impact.
   
   In the long term, your support allows LASC’s work to benefit Angelenos, and also helps LA continue to lead the nation with innovative solutions, best management practices, quality research, top environmental professionals, and a successful model to create a resilient, healthy, vibrant, and sustainable city.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  LASC collaborates with professionals in academia, government and the
  non-profit sector to identify current and emerging environmental and
  sustainability issues that impact the Los Angeles region and pinpoint research
  needed to address those issues. We then partner with those experts to fund and
  guide student Research Fellows, to identify and advocate for solutions
  revealed through their research. Current partnerships include Los Angeles City
  Council District 7, UCLA Institute of Environment and Sustainability, UCLA
  Luskin School of Pubic Affairs, Los Angeles Food Policy Council, and South
  Park Business Improvement District.
   
   Future partnerships depend on which issues are identified through topics/issues we decide to address, and can vary accordingly. We are currently exploring opportunities to collaborate with the LA Unified School District to update their sustainability plans. Some organizations we have partnered with in the past and would do so again include: Los Angeles Waterkeeper, Environment Now, City of Los Angeles City Council, UCLA Luskin Center for Innovation, USC Center for Sustainable Cities, CicLAvia, Los Angeles River Revitalization Corporation, Environmental Defense Fund, Natural Resources Defense Council, California Center for Sustainable Communities, The Bay Foundation, Heal the Bay, TreePeople, and EarthJustice.
   
   Collaboration, as our name suggests, is the foundation of our work. Our mission to create a more sustainable LA cannot be done alone and we strive to establish long lasting relationships with leaders in government, nonprofits, academia, and businesses. 
   
   While we have yet to identify partners for this grant period, we expect they will be confirmed within one to three months after the grant is awarded. Three factors that are critical to the success of our proposed collaborations are 1) adequate funding to staff our initiative areas with Senior Fellows; 2) growth and expansion in the number of Research Fellowships; and 3) sufficient operational revenue to support growing staffing needs.
