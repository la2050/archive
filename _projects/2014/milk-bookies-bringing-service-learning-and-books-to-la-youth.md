Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  In conjunction with the Mayor's office, we will select 1,000 Los Angeles
  classrooms to implement our pilot program for the 2014-2015 school year. M+B
  will provide these Los Angeles classrooms with a comprehensive instructional
  outline of our service learning project. Each aspect of our project is
  designed to make it easy for the teachers and fun for the students. Before the
  teachers present this service learning project to their classrooms, M+B will
  lead an assembly at the schools explaining the program in detail. We will
  supply each teacher with all of the products and tools needed to implement the
  project and help distribute the books collected from the students to local
  in-need recipients. M+B will provide a small reserve of books in each
  classroom for children who are unable to donate a book on their own. It is
  just as important to experience giving so we want to make sure that all
  children have this opportunity.
   After the program takes place, M+B will stay involved with organizing transport of the books from the schools to the local children in need.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  The sustainability of a literate society largely depends on the accessibility
  of books (Education Insider)."Getting books into the homes of children is
  what's important,"(Celia Yusem, LAUSD teacher of 40 years). There are books in
  the school libraries but students who read at home are better, more efficient
  readers and have higher math scores according to the National Education
  Association. Having books in the home is important for children to master
  literacy skills. Additionally, according to the National Service Learning
  Clearinghouse, exposing children to service learning increases acceptance of
  diversity, development of ethics, development of caring, and other social
  emotional learning. Bringing the Milk+Bookies service learning project to Los
  Angeles schools will give all students important skills in life that will
  foster Los Angeles children to feel empowered, equip them with the basic
  skills needed for academic challenges and encourage them to be socially-minded
  citizens.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Our project will benefit children, teachers, schools and ultimately Los
  Angeles.
    
   By exposing children to how great giving feels, they will want to do it again and again. With a purposeful format to impact each child, we aim to make a real imprint on their lives and watch as they set out to recreate that “do good” feeling.
   
   With this grant, 1,000 classrooms - approximately 30,000 children - will be impacted by our program. More than 30,000 books will be distributed to at-risk, in-need children. The byproduct of our organization's mission is getting underprivileged children age appropriate books to help them with literacy, help them dream bigger and help them feel inspired.
   
   Los Angeles teachers and schools will also benefit because we have the resources and materials ready for them. Their service learning project comes ready-made and will be distributed without any extra time and energy on their end. With all of the budget shortfalls, there is no extra time or money for classrooms to supply the children with all of these materials let alone carry out steps for finding recipients and helping organize distribution.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  It has been M+B's dream to share our service learning project with LAUSD's
  third grade classrooms. We have had the OPPORTUNITY to work with many other
  classrooms both in LA and nationwide and see the successful outcomes. We will
  focus all of our efforts on Los Angeles and double the amount of children
  being able to give and get.
   
   We have had the opportunity to explain our project to the Mayor's office and discuss our program. We have spoken with LAUSD teachers and know that there is a NEED FOR SERVICE LEARNING PROJECTS that are not time consuming for them. Everything will be in place for the classrooms including supplies, teacher outlines and lesson plans, and volunteers and recipients.
   
   Having the opportunity for EVALUATION within the schools and classrooms is another key factor to determine the success of the collaboration. We will collect as many surveys and information as possible from the children and the teachers after their "book raisers."
