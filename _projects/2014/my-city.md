Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  MyCity is a web & mobile app that bridges Travelers with local Tour
  Specialists. Mass commercialized tours are prevalent as a one-size fits all
  solution. MyCity democratizes commercialized tours by providing Travelers
  curated & personalized tours based on the Traveler's interests. Tour
  Specialists will provide curated tours that would be exciting & engaging for
  the Travelers. Tour Specialists can also offer transportation & lodging by
  linking existing accounts with AirBnb, Uber, or similar apps. We would
  incorporate social networking as a tool to bridge Travelers & Tour Specialists
  based on mutual interests & friends. Users can create profiles on themselves &
  what makes LA special - from lists of their favorite restaurants to beaches.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  To implement this idea, we will first develop the mobile app so that it is
  accessible, aesthetically pleasing & easy to use. As a User Experience / User
  Interface Designer & Developer, Ray has experience in designing & building
  small-scale to large-scale consumer & enterprise applications, which will help
  with the development of the technology. 
   
   Once we have a working product, we will then start marketing the product & build our user base. Mitchel is experienced in video marketing & digital content, which will help promote the product to LA locals & tourists, & make it easy for users to understand the capabilities & benefits of using MyCity. Also, we will reach out to the tourism department of LA to get support from the city & help bring more revenue to local businesses & residents. 
   
   Technically, we would implement this project by using a leading edge tech stack for both web & mobile application. Since Ray is also a full-stack engineer, we can rapidly deploy this on a Ruby on Rails stack which can include Node.JS, PostgresSQL, & Backbone.JS front-end. Alternatively, we're open to using a different tech stack such a Go, Erlang, Scala, etc. For mobile development, we can deploy using Android & Swift. We have many options.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  MyCity can help make LA the best place to connect today by bridging Tourists
  with Angelenos in more deep & diverse experiences around the city. Locals will
  have the ability to share their favorite places in LA & give travelers a more
  immersive experience with the city. This type of interaction between tourists
  & locals would provide breadth that brings more awareness about the local
  areas in Los Angeles that mass commercialized tour packages & buses do not do.
  Thus, promoting small LA businesses to eager travelers & connecting tourists
  with the city’s diverse cultures & communities.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  MyCity would benefit Angelenos & anyone living in Los Angeles. Angelenos would
  make money as Tour Specialists by providing phenomenal & personalized
  experiences to Travelers. Additionally, locals can also pair up with other
  locals who have new ideas to share, since there's always something new that
  Angelenos can learn from each other about this city.
   
   Angelenos & Locals would also benefit by making money full time or part time by rendering their services as Tour Specialists. Also, tourists would benefit immensely from this app by getting diverse & personalized tours of Los Angeles through the simplicity of a mobile app - as well as the opportunity to meet new friends. This in turn benefits Los Angeles by bringing in more tourism into the city & helping local businesses. Though, just as important as generating revenue in LA, we are showing travelers from around the world a deeper & more authentic look of the City of Angels.

    Rates of volunteerism will rise since locals will be driven to clean up
    their communities and neighborhoods to attract tourists.  Adults will get
    sufficient social and emotional support due to the social networking aspect
    of the app, allowing adults to connect with other adults and share their
    experiences with Los Angeles with outsiders and locals.  Tourists will
    attend more cultural events since tour specialists will want to include
    these type of exciting activities in their itineraries.  Users of the app
    will be compelled to explore the city and will use public transportation to
    fully immerse themselves in the experience.  My City aims to expose tourists
    to parts of LA that are otherwise unknown to travelers, thus giving small
    neighborhoods the opportunity to gain more business by promoting their
    communities on the app.  Users of the app would join neighborhood councils
    to create marketing campaigns to attract more tourists to their community. 
    My City will give locals a chance to make money part or full time, without
    having to drive to or have an office.   Thus users are able to work from
    home and not have to worry about transit.  The social networking aspect of
    the app will also help generate more social media friends.  Tourists will
    attend more public/open street gatherings as part of tours.

  evaluate: "We will measure success in terms of active users (travelers & tour specialists), month-to-month growth, quarterly growth, year-to-date (YTD), customer satisfaction, & quality of product. \r\n\r\nWe will focus on design & functionality. We will also have friends & family use & evaluate the app to make sure it’s a user friendly product.  At the same time, we will also consult with our colleagues & business professionals to analyze the project & ensure that our app is both innovative & viable. "
  two_lessons: "Traveling abroad & not having the ability to speak the language or explore foreign cities with a local to get a more authentic experience.  \r\n\r\nThe idea of contingent work & allowing regular people to transfer money between each other like AirBnB & Uber, creating more opportunities to curb unemployment."
  achievable_goal: >-
    It’s highly likely that we can build & deploy this app within a span of 6-7
    months, while using the remaining 5-6 months fine tuning the details &
    making any adjustments based on market demand. Ray brings the business,
    technical, & design know-how, while Mitchel has experience in digital
    marketing & organizational growth, thus making sure that a quality product
    is made & is marketed properly.  
  major_challenges: "Challenges that we participate:\r\n1. Engineering & design costs spiraling out of hand. \r\n2. Competitors creating similar products. \r\n\r\nOur strategy is to build & manage an effective & talented team while constantly monitoring our costs.  We will be running lean & agile methodologies to help stay on track.  We will also keep up to date with tech & business news to ensure that there’s no similar products being made concurrently with ours.   "
  competition: >-
    AirBnB has developed a similar concept within their app & website.  
    Although, we will provide a social networking component to create a much
    more interactive experience, as well as the opportunity for tourists to post
    their travel itineraries so that tour specialists can bid & offer their
    services & suggestions to create a more personalized experience.  
  cost: $100k is adequate to complete the project.
  budget: "$50k for mobile development (hiring a team of coders to build the back-end of the app).\r\n\r\n$50k between Mitchel & Ray (costs for marketing, management, creative direction, design, administrative work, supplies, & miscellaneous work for overseeing the project for 1 year)"

      Rates of volunteerism will rise since locals will be driven to clean up
      their communities and neighborhoods to attract tourists.  Adults will get
      sufficient social and emotional support due to the social networking
      aspect of the app, allowing adults to connect with other adults and share
      their experiences with Los Angeles with outsiders and locals.  Tourists
      will attend more cultural events since tour specialists will want to
      include these type of exciting activities in their itineraries.  Users of
      the app will be compelled to explore the city and will use public
      transportation to fully immerse themselves in the experience.  My City
      aims to expose tourists to parts of LA that are otherwise unknown to
      travelers, thus giving small neighborhoods the opportunity to gain more
      business by promoting their communities on the app.  Users of the app
      would join neighborhood councils to create marketing campaigns to attract
      more tourists to their community.  My City will give locals a chance to
      make money part or full time, without having to drive to or have an
      office.   Thus users are able to work from home and not have to worry
      about transit.  The social networking aspect of the app will also help
      generate more social media friends.  Tourists will attend more public/open
      street gatherings as part of tours.

      AirBnB has developed a similar concept within their app & website.
