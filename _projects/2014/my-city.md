Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  MyCity is a web & mobile app that bridges Travelers with local Tour
  Specialists. Mass commercialized tours are prevalent as a one-size fits all
  solution. MyCity democratizes commercialized tours by providing Travelers
  curated & personalized tours based on the Traveler's interests. Tour
  Specialists will provide curated tours that would be exciting & engaging for
  the Travelers. Tour Specialists can also offer transportation & lodging by
  linking existing accounts with AirBnb, Uber, or similar apps. We would
  incorporate social networking as a tool to bridge Travelers & Tour Specialists
  based on mutual interests & friends. Users can create profiles on themselves &
  what makes LA special - from lists of their favorite restaurants to beaches.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  To implement this idea, we will first develop the mobile app so that it is
  accessible, aesthetically pleasing & easy to use. As a User Experience / User
  Interface Designer & Developer, Ray has experience in designing & building
  small-scale to large-scale consumer & enterprise applications, which will help
  with the development of the technology. 
   
   Once we have a working product, we will then start marketing the product & build our user base. Mitchel is experienced in video marketing & digital content, which will help promote the product to LA locals & tourists, & make it easy for users to understand the capabilities & benefits of using MyCity. Also, we will reach out to the tourism department of LA to get support from the city & help bring more revenue to local businesses & residents. 
   
   Technically, we would implement this project by using a leading edge tech stack for both web & mobile application. Since Ray is also a full-stack engineer, we can rapidly deploy this on a Ruby on Rails stack which can include Node.JS, PostgresSQL, & Backbone.JS front-end. Alternatively, we're open to using a different tech stack such a Go, Erlang, Scala, etc. For mobile development, we can deploy using Android & Swift. We have many options.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  MyCity can help make LA the best place to connect today by bridging Tourists
  with Angelenos in more deep & diverse experiences around the city. Locals will
  have the ability to share their favorite places in LA & give travelers a more
  immersive experience with the city. This type of interaction between tourists
  & locals would provide breadth that brings more awareness about the local
  areas in Los Angeles that mass commercialized tour packages & buses do not do.
  Thus, promoting small LA businesses to eager travelers & connecting tourists
  with the city’s diverse cultures & communities.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  MyCity would benefit Angelenos & anyone living in Los Angeles. Angelenos would
  make money as Tour Specialists by providing phenomenal & personalized
  experiences to Travelers. Additionally, locals can also pair up with other
  locals who have new ideas to share, since there's always something new that
  Angelenos can learn from each other about this city.
   
   Angelenos & Locals would also benefit by making money full time or part time by rendering their services as Tour Specialists. Also, tourists would benefit immensely from this app by getting diverse & personalized tours of Los Angeles through the simplicity of a mobile app - as well as the opportunity to meet new friends. This in turn benefits Los Angeles by bringing in more tourism into the city & helping local businesses. Though, just as important as generating revenue in LA, we are showing travelers from around the world a deeper & more authentic look of the City of Angels.
