  Play as a Uniting Force: The school based aspect of the Together We Play L.A.!
  initiative will directly impact over 3,000 children in over 50 schools. Our
  children of today will be our leaders of tomorrow in 2050. We need future
  leaders that can see beyond our differences, and who are able to unite their
  communities by building common ground. To that end, Shane’s Inspiration will
  unite approximately 1000 children with disabilities with 2,000 typically
  developing children for a day of play on an inclusive playground over a series
  of 40 field trips. These children will have an opportunity to dissolve their
  misconceptions, find their similarities, and discover respect, friendship and
  understanding. This experiential play opportunity will be combined with pre
  and post educational presentations that explore the barriers that divide us
  based on common misconceptions. The uniting principals learned through this
  process can then be applied across race, ability and cultural divides. This
  aspect of the initiative will run concurrent with the school year, September
  through June.
   
   Building Common Ground®: The community events will be held on the last Saturday of the month and will alternate locations throughout Los Angeles. Each event will be held at a Shane’s Inspiration inclusive playground location. These events will draw individuals, families, and children of all abilities and will feature “play artisans” that will create interactive play presentations that promote play in unique and inspiring ways. Each event will have a theme and feature the diverse ways in which Angelenos play such as Art, Magic, Sports, Music, etc. One month, renowned wheelchair artist, Tommy Hollenstein will teach the art of painting with wheels. Community members will bring their bicycles, scooters, roller blades or wheelchairs and discover play through art. Water sports for people of all abilities can be featured at Lake Balboa, next to our inclusive playground. Professional, Olympic and Paralympic athletes will present their triumphant stories and engage community members in their sport of choice. 
   
   The initiative will culminate in Griffith Park at the Shane’s Inspiration flagship playground in conjunction with a Nickelodeon Worldwide Day of Play! This event will feature performances of prominent play artisans, a resource fair of organizations that promote play in L.A., and a Walk n’ Roll 5K event that will secure the funding to support the initiative’s on-going success.

  "By playing with my buddy, I learned that I can open myself up to other people
  who may be different than I am...that I should try harder to get to know
  people because we are all people and we should give each other a chance."

   The Together We Play L.A.! initiative will dissolve the barriers that divide us by bringing individuals and communities together through play. Shane's Inspiration has been dedicated to making L.A. the best place to play since 1998 through the creation of the first fully inclusive playground in Griffith Park, to the opening of our 37th Los Angeles playground in Sun Valley. This initiative would build on our prior success in this area in the following ways: 
   
   *Developing 5 new community driven conceptual designs for 5 future inclusive playgrounds and parks. 
   
   *Including access to play for ALL! 
   
   *Bringing 3000 children of all abilities together through play and education to replace damaging misconceptions about one another with friendship and understanding. 
   
   * Showcasing interactive and innovative ways in which communities can come together through play. 
   
   * Promoting park usage through community based play programs that broaden our perspective of one another.
   
   We are only as resilient as we are united. Los Angeles prides itself on our diversity. However, it is often that diversity that keeps us apart. Play is the great equalizer, connecting people through common ground and creating opportunities to discover our similarities, instead of our differences. We bully, fight, and divide because we are afraid, because we feel we are distinctly different. By discovering our commonalities, we are able to weave a more inclusive fabric across our great city. Evan Beachy, former teacher at New Roads Elementary says, "Working with Shane's Inspiration was just that; an inspirational experience for myself and my students. To see their attitudes change from fear, to understanding, to compassion, to friendship was truly something special." 
   
   By 2050, we will be facing many challenges that will only be surmountable through a strongly united community. The seeds for that unity will be planted in part through the Together We Play L.A.! initiative that will redefine the way we play together, redefine our perspectives about one another and strengthen our ties that bind. Together we can face the challenges that await us. Together we can build a resilient tomorrow. One play connection at a time.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The Together We Play L.A.! initiative will directly impact 3,000 children,
  approximately 1,000 of these children will have some form of disability. Most
  of the children we reach are between the ages of 1 and 13 and come from a
  variety of socio-economic circumstances. Within our school-based programs,
  over 80% of the schools we serve are classified as Title I, which is an
  indicator of poverty among the student population. Each student that
  participates in the school program will take home a family guide on inclusion,
  providing the potential to reach an additional 5,000+ family members. This
  guide will be printed in English and Spanish. 
   
   We estimate an additional 2,500 individuals will be directly impacted by the community based monthly programming. We will utilize our base of 37 inclusive playgrounds throughout the city of Los Angeles in some of the most under served and at risk communities, promoting play and recreational usage at local parks. The goal is to inform the communities that these parks, inclusive playgrounds and programs are available to the families to help promote and engage on-going community usage beyond the one year goal. 
   
   We will also utilize print, radio, television, and social media avenues to promote this initiative, raising a broader understanding of the importance of dissolving the barriers that divide us and the opportunities to connect. 
   
   On a broader impact scale, Los Angeles is currently a shining example for other communities of how to create play environments that unite the whole of the community. Shane's Inspiration and the City of Los Angeles Recreation and Parks Department travel nationally and internationally to promote the replication of these playgrounds and programs to a global audience. The 37 playgrounds developed in Los Angeles have sparked a world wide movement in inclusive play, generating Shane's Inspiration projects in 15 states, as well as in Mexico, Ecuador, Israel and four in conjunction with the 2010 and 2014 Winter Olympics in Canada and Russia. As members of the Clinton Global Initiative, Shane's Inspiration is participating in conversations with the Rockefeller Resilient Cities initiative regarding the importance of inclusive play environments as they pertain to city resiliency. The Together We Play L.A.! initiative will provide another important opportunity for Los Angeles to lead the way in play - today - tomorrow - into 2050 and beyond!
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Shane's Inspiration owes the success of our programs in great part to the
  collaborative partners that we have been fortunate enough to have had through
  the years. Shane's Inspiration has always approached partnership with a
  win/win strategy which has yielded strong, loyal and long lasting
  relationships. We will work collaboratively with many partners on this
  initiative but will rely heavily on two key partnerships, one of which is the
  City of Los Angeles Recreation and Parks Department. From the first project
  which opened in 2000, to the 30th and beyond, this partnership is at the
  foundation of the organization's success. This department will work very
  closely with Shane's Inspiration to support the success of our goals as all 50
  events will take place at parks throughout the City of Los Angeles. The parks
  are managed and maintained by City staff so the contribution of this
  department will be substantial. 
   
   The other key to success of this project will be our partnership with schools. We have over 150 Los Angeles schools from which to draw from for the school aspect of the initiative. The programs we will offer to the schools will be free of charge and have been proven to be of substantial educational value to the students. We have been partnering with local schools for over 10 years and currently have a waiting list of schools who would like to participate in our programming opportunities. 
   
   Outreach and Community Event partners of Shane's Inspiration programs include the Exceptional Children's Foundation; Regional Centers; Disney; Wells Fargo Capital Finance; Seesaw Studios; Kiwanis; Newman Grace Inc. 
   
   Promoting this initiative will be key and our partners at Newman Grace Publishing will be featuring each step of this initiative in the Inspiring Play Magazine - www.inspiringplay.com. They will also use Google Ad Words to get the word out. 
   
   The three factors that are critical to the success of our proposed collaboration are: 
   
   Advanced planning with key partners; 
   Consistent and clear communication between all project partners;
   Delivering on proposed goals and commitments. 
   
   We have a track record of success in these areas with our partners which provides a strong foundation for the roll out and successful implementation of this initiative. As with any new initiative, we anticipate hurdles as we navigate somewhat unfamiliar territory. Our confidence lies in the strength of our partnership history in overcoming obstacles.
