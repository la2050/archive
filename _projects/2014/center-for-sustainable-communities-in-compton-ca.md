Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  The vision driving our Center for Sustainable Communities involves a broad
  spectrum of issues, and at the center of this focus is the need to pursue
  sustainability and help create resilient neighborhoods. Tying employment,
  housing, place, business, and lifestyle is critical to building
  sustainability, and the Center will serve as a catalyst for achieving broader
  community and personal empowerment goals that will help low income families in
  South LA most adversely impacted by economic divestment.
    
   As landowner, NHS will serve as lead partner with the City of Compton, METRO CDC, and the Pacific Coast Regional Small Business Development Corporation. NHS acquired the 28,283 sq ft building and surrounding parcel in early March 2014 and we have entered the site planning and renovation phase of the project. One of our main priorities is to repurpose the facility and provide highly needed economic development, healthy living, and job training services for the Compton community. NHS plans to house 5-8 initial non-profit groups by fall 2014 with full tenancy by the end of 2014 if possible. As a part of that plan, our one year goals and implementation timelines include:
   • Upgrade the existing facility to accommodate 5-8 tenants (August - Dec 2014);
   • Subcontract to create Computer Training and Technology Center (August - Oct 2014);
   • Partner with Metro CDC to create office for youth job training/entrepreneurship programs (August - Sept 2014);
   • Partner with Pacific Coast Regional Small Business Development Corporation (PCR) to establish on-site Business Incubator Program (Sept – Nov 2014);
   • Phase in green technology upgrades (solar electric panels, low-water fixtures, solar hot water) and community garden plots as a part of the structural retrofits and property rehab (Sept 2014 – March 2015).
   
   Short term (1-2 years) goals and the implementation timeline for the CSC include:
   • Finalize a local land use plan with community partners and adjacent land owners (Fall 2014);
   • Establish Health & Fitness rooms, a Healthy Living Café, free library, child play area, and permanent organic gardens (Summer 2015).
   • Create a Community Green Education & Conservation Center (Summer 2015);
   • Create a farmer’s market enterprise to support the Center (Fall 2015);
   • Serve approximately 250 families (Sept – Dec 2014);
   • Serve approximately 5,000 families (Jan – Dec 2015).
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  As low income communities in South LA continue to struggle with ongoing blight
  and work towards long-term neighborhood revitalization, the focus becomes how
  to help reverse the significant environmental, social, health, and economic
  impacts of long term divestment on residents and families. Of primary concern
  is how to deal with the growing challenges among these neighborhoods regarding
  chronic unemployment/underemployment, reduced capital access for small
  business development, the ongoing threat of food insecurity, substandard
  transit options, skyrocketing housing costs, educational disparities, and
  youth disengagement. Decades of studies confirm that these problems
  disproportionately affect underserved and impoverished communities. For
  example, the current surge in home purchase and rental costs means housing now
  consumes over 65% of average median income on average in LMI communities. Add
  to that consistently high unemployment (15%), a nearly 3 to 1 ratio in loan
  denial rates, and limited access to mass transit and healthy food - which has
  been proven to impact employment and educational performance – and the need
  for greater resources to meet basic economic demands and achieve a moderate
  living standard becomes evident.
   
   In response, the Center for Sustainable Communities will provide the people of Compton in South LA a facility that will serve as a hub to build a solid foundation for creating neighborhood sustainability over the next decades. Specific impacts include 1) Improving the job readiness and overall skills base of local workforce; 2) Providing healthy living services and resources to residents; 3) Reaching and training residents in IT and tech skills; 4) Increasing lending access and originating loans for small business owners; 5) Engaging youth (ages 5-24) in on-site green education and mentoring programs; 6) Assisting families through our CSC Homeownership Center; 7) Establishing community garden projects in surrounding neighborhoods; 8) Establishing home garden projects with youth workers. 
   
   In addition to meeting crucial resource access needs for families, the Center will allow its partners to share sustainability concepts that drive planning approaches in other impacted communities throughout South Los Angeles and LA County.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The Center will serve hundreds of low income families in a region that has
  endured many of the worst impacts of the economic downturn and decades of
  blight. NHS has a long and very successful history of serving low-to-moderate
  income neighborhoods. For 30 years, 90% of our client base has been low income
  families residing in the poorest and most neglected neighborhoods of LA
  County. In 2013, 95% of the people we help were considered low income and 84%
  were ethnic minorities. 
   
   As the facility grows, the Center will expand to help hundreds of small business owners, neighborhood non-profit groups, and homeowners through on-site services and regional partnerships with community service groups, community development agencies, green organizations, health providers, technology professionals, schools, and municipalities. At least 50% of our tenants will be service-driven. By 2015 we expect to partner with the adjacent Los Angeles Conservation Corps Campus to magnify our regional impact, collaborate to attract a wide range of volunteers for our municipal water and green projects, and reach out to the educational community as the Compton Creek Project evolves.
   
   With respect to our community outreach efforts, engaging surrounding neighborhoods in the early stages of the planning process has already yielded an overwhelmingly positive response by critical stakeholders and the community toward the development of the Center. As a part of our initial outreach plan, NHS is hosting a series of summer BBQs with its new neighbors to meet, assess community needs, and clarify the focus for the project from the community perspective. The project and landscape architects are deeply involved with this process so that they can adapt community strategies into the program and facility design more effectively. The more this vision evolves, the more we see that establishing the Center will serve and help the people and the City of Compton while also creating sustainable jobs for residents.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  NHS has entered into agreements with the City of Compton, METRO CDC, and the
  Pacific Coast Regional Small Business Development Corporation as primary
  partners and is formalizing arrangements with the Los Angeles Conservation
  Corps, the LA County Department of Health, the LA Food Policy Council,
  Community Services Unlimited, and the Los Angeles Department of Neighborhood
  Empowerment to provide expertise, customized services, training opportunities,
  and cross-collaborative projects through the Center. 
   
   Critical factors include: 1) a commitment to build sustainability in Compton/South LA, 2) eliminating “silo organizing” on common regional issues, and 3) applying skills gained from managing eight years of neighborhood revitalization consortia during the economic crisis to assist in better serving low income communities. 
   
   Each partner brings unique experience and value:
   • City of Compton – Compton contributed bond funds to acquire the property and will facilitate project approvals, general public outreach, and program advocacy. 
   • METRO CDC – Providing neighborhood outreach, employment training, community engagement, and referral services for youth and young adults. 
   • Pacific Coast Regional Small Business Development Corporation – As a tenant, PCR offers financial, educational and consulting services to small business owners and start-ups. 
   • Los Angeles Conservation Corps – LACC will partner on environmental and urban reclamation projects in the Compton Creek watershed and surrounding area and will provide training, education, and mentoring for youth.
   • Community Services Unlimited – As one of the largest urban Community Supported Agriculture food distributors in South LA, CSU will offer urban gardening, green business resources, and cross training expertise. 
   • Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors – Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas’ office provides project level funding opportunities and overall support for the Center. 
   • LA Food Policy Council – Has agreed to help NHS coordinate events, outreach, and advocacy through the Center in addition to serving as a partner in creating community gardens. 
   • Los Angeles Department of Neighborhood Empowerment – As the oversight agency of neighborhood councils, LADNE will provide extensive outreach, special project coordination, and a grassroots connection to regional community groups. 
   • LA County Department of Health – Committed to helping us create living projects and support our clinic plan.
