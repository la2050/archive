Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  EveryoneOn will leverage our existing platform of low-cost offers to provide
  Internet service and computers. The funds received for this grant will provide
  free routers and low-cost home Internet service (valued at $10/month). We will
  partner with human-I-T staff and volunteers to provide donated, refurbished
  computers with customized software that includes digital literacy content and
  Windows 7 Professional. 
   
   We will work with Centro Latino for Literacy to provide these benefits to the adult graduates of their Leamos(TM) ("Let’s Read") Basic and Functional Pre-ESL literacy courses. These courses teach adults with zero to three years of primary schooling how to read, write, perform math functions, and overcome their fear of technology; skills that are necessary to be functional in today’s world.
   
   Collectively will leverage all of our partners on the ground in LA to promote awareness of this pilot to nonprofits and prospective volunteers.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  The detrimental effects of illiteracy are often compounded because of a lack
  of resources, geographic isolation, or underdeveloped education programs. Many
  schools and educational institutions lack the resources and materials for
  comprehensive literacy programs, and library systems and many teachers are
  under-trained. As a result, the children of low- to non-literate parents are
  at risk of growing up illiterate, without ever having the opportunity to
  develop an appreciation for reading. A report released by the National
  Institute of Child Health and Human Development found that “a mother’s reading
  skill is the greatest determinant of her children’s future academic success,
  outweighing other factors such as neighborhood and family income.”
   
   There are over 1.6 million non-literate Spanish-speaking adults in the U.S.; 222,320 are in Los Angeles County. Leamos was designed by Centro Latino for Literacy to help non-literate Spanish-speaking adults become literate in Spanish first, thereby preparing them to learn ESL. Leamos Basic is a mouse-driven, audio-visual, online course that teaches non-literate Spanish speakers to read and write at a basic level. Graduates proceed to the second--a classroom-based functional literacy course that teaches basic grammar, math and financial education. In 2013, 96% of adults enrolled in the Centro Latino's courses were parents and more than 70% had between zero and two years of schooling. 
   
   Our collaborative pilot project will help make LA the best place to learn by encouraging reading comprehension and providing Spanish-speaking parents with the skills and technology needed to help them and their children succeed. This program will be transformative for its participants by leveling the digital divide while simultaneously improving parent reading and digital literacy rates, which will lead to improved educational outcomes for both parents and students.
   
   We are also encouraging volunteerism in LA with technology and providing free technical and vocational skills to participating volunteers in the local community. By providing some of LA’s most marginalized populations access to literacy software and home Internet service, we are seeking to bridge the opportunity gap for parents, students and volunteers. 
   
   Following the successful implementation of this pilot program, we will be able to improve and replicate this program making LA a national model for learning, a national model for learning and connecting by 2050.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  This is an opportunity for working age adults; a vast majority of whom are
  parents, who have never had any formal primary schooling. One third of Centro
  Latino students are indigenous speakers with Spanish as their second language.
  The ultimate goal of these students is to learn English. We want to encourage
  them and their children to value and retain their primary and secondary
  languages as they learn English. Recent research has shown both the health and
  economic value of having multilingual skills.
   
   Volunteers without home internet access that participate in this project will also benefit from free equipment and home Internet access. The Volunteer Corps at Centro Latino consists mainly of first generation college students and professionals, and about 60% of human-I-T volunteers/interns are late high school to early college age (17-23); both of which will greatly benefit from vocational skills and free home access to the Internet.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Our partners Centro Latino for Literacy and Human-I-T are confirmed partners
  for this pilot project. Since 1991, Centro Latino for Literacy has been
  putting non-to-low literate adults on the pathway to learning English as a
  second language (ESL) through its unique and innovative courses. Centro
  Latino’s approach builds the foundational skills and confidence needed for
  native Spanish speakers to learn English and pursue greater educational and
  income opportunities.
   
   human-I-T is a nonprofit organization working transform unwanted or inoperative laptops and computers into operational education tools for the millions in need. human-I-T strives to go beyond recycling by taking a progressive approach to e-waste management, vocational training, and the digital divide.
   
   EveryoneOn works with outreach and enrollment partner organizations to provide free digital literacy content and pre-qualify low-income, unconnected families for our low-cost technology and home Internet service offers. We have worked with these organizations and many others to drive technology adoption in LA and across the country.
   
   The two factors that are critical to the success of this collaboration are funding and outreach/community awareness. Once funding has been secured, we will collectively leverage our networks and partners on the ground in LA to drive outreach and awareness.
