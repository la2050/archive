Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): |-
  Phase 1: Call For Participation
   Through our partnerships with LAUSD, Santa Monica Unified School District, Los Angeles Science Teachers Network, Pearson Foundation, New Learning Institute, LA Summer of Learning program from Mayor Garcetti’s office, and the Children’s Services Department of Los Angeles Public Library, The Exploratory: Maker Guilds will circulate a Call For Participation which will include: 
   - Tinker.Make.Innovate Challenge information 
   - Orientation Workshop information 
   - Intent to Participate FormsThe first 100 educators who return Intent to Participate forms will receive registration information for 1 of 3 Orientation Workshops. 
   Educators beyond the first 100 will receive the following: 
   - Tinker.Make.Innovate. Challenge instruction packet
   - Link to Google + community site with instructional videos, list of materials, and other resources. 
   
   Phase 2: Orientation Workshops and Training
   The first 100 educators will be invited to attend one of the 3 orientation workshops. These workshops will walk the educators through how to implement Tinker.Make.Innovate curriculum in their classrooms or library programming. This workshop will cover: 
   - Basic electronics, prototyping techniques, 3D modeling for 3D printing & laser cutting, electronics for textiles, engineering with paper, and other making techniques. 
   - How to incorporate Next Generation Science Standards and Common Core Standards into the Challenge
   - The use of Design Thinking process to encourage design and innovative thinking 
   Each participant will then be provided with a Make-It box full of tools and materials that will help them facilitate the challenge with their students. * the exact tools and materials will be determined by donations in kind. 
   Phase 3: Ongoing Development and Documentation
   Educators will receive further development and support through monthly Google Community Hangouts. These Google Hangouts will serve as an online community for the challenge participants to share tips and techniques, document their students’ progress, and receive assistance/mentorship from Maker Guild’s professional staff. The online community will serve as a way for us to continue to inspire and learn from one another. 
   Phase 4: Showcase
    During the first week of May 2015, educators will submit their students projects to be showcase
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  The current structure of our education system is failing our students which
  in-turn is failing LA. According to the National Assessment of Educational
  Progress in 2013, only 22% of California students tested proficient or above
  in science. We also know that science, technology, engineering, arts, and math
  (STEAM) equip students with the skills they need to be innovative thinkers.
  With the implementation of this program today: 
   
   - We will empower our teachers and librarians by providing the tools they need to feel confident integrating STEAM into their programs. 
   
   - We will support our educators to grow too. More than 85% of elementary educators have not received science-related professional development in the last three years. In the Orientation Workshops, and through our Google Community, educators and librarians will receive mentorship and ongoing professional support. 
   
   - We will expand the reach of the classroom. If we provide libraries with these tools, students will not have to stop their learning when they leave school. 
   
   - We will lessen truancy and expulsion rates. When students are engaged in their learning they are excited about going to school.
   
   - We will build a culture of entrepreneurship, innovation, and problem-solving. Through this challenge, our students will be immersed in real world applications of STEAM, design thinking, and an innovative mindset. This will open them up to the possibilities of high-school electives, college degrees, and even careers in STEAM. 
   
   Changes in the way LA students learn today will lead to a brighter LA in year 2050:
   
    - Where students work with their hands, hearts, and minds to create innovative solutions to real-world problems. 
   
   - Where the way Los Angeles students learn and the way our teachers teach becomes a model for school districts throughout the nation. 
   
   - Where libraries are not merely places to read a good book, but are also innovation hubs where students and families are introduced to new technologies and ways of learning. 
   
   - Where students are well prepared for universities and even their careers, and leave high school with a portfolio of innovative projects under their belts. 
   
   - Where student showcases involve the larger community and are a regular tradition with hundreds of submissions from students of all ages, backgrounds, and demographics.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The Tinker.Make.Innovate Challenge will directly benefit 100 librarians and
  educators, and 3000+ students throughout Los Angeles. Through the Google
  community and the challenge manual, thousands more students will be able to
  take part in the challenge in their schools and libraries. The showcase has
  the potential to benefit 40,000 students, families, educators, and community
  members by inspiring them and opening their eyes to the possibilities of STEM.
  As this program continues beyond the 2015 funding year, it has the power to
  inspire the 687,534 students enrolled in LAUSD schools, over 30,000 teachers,
  and more than 100 librarians in Los Angeles County directly.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  The Exploratory: Maker Guilds will work with the Los Angeles Unified Public
  School District, Santa Monica Unified School District, Science Teachers
  Network, and Los Angeles Public Libraries to inform teachers and librarians
  about the challenge and curriculum toolkit. Our collaboration with Pearson
  Education Corporation will enable us to make our curriculum and project ideas
  easily accessible to teachers and librarians to integrate in their programs. 
   
   Through our partnership with The Summer/City of Learning, students connected with our program will have the opportunity to participate in digital badging, a program sponsored by Mayor Garcetti’s Office. This program will enable students to map their progress through their projects and show skills gained to colleges and future employers.
