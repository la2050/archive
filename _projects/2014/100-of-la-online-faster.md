Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Get 100% of LA online faster! Allow citizens, institutions, and small biz to
  build our own networks and connections together!
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  A lot of the open standards hardware and open source software required for
  these private network deployments already exist. We just need to package it
  all together, in a way that makes it easy for anyone without network expertise
  to install it in their own homes or offices. 
   
   We will also provide legal templates for communities to incorporate their own 501c12 cooperatives or 501c4 community welfare networks, so that local experts can be paid for their professional services in connecting and maintaining these neighborhood networks. We have a pilot 501c4 project starting in the Northeast Los Angeles region, NELA-ISC.Net, where we will test our templates and open source tools in real world deployments. We welcome all other LA region communities to start their own neighborhood networks as well, and connect directly with each other. The downtown LA community in particular has great access to multiple global carrier transit providers, at carrier neutral facilities like One Wilshire, where connecting through neighbors directly will be much cheaper than AT&T or Time Warner.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Global competitive market access today requires fast broadband Internet
  connections. South Koreans visit major American cities and feel like they're
  in a remote rural area, where Internet speeds slow down to a crawl. If the US
  and its largest global cities (like LA) want to catch up, or at least attract
  digerati tourism, then they need to explore every option to connect all their
  citizens to gigabit or faster speeds. Renting this core infrastructure from
  cable and telco monopolists will simply not suffice. Silicon Beach will not
  wait.
   
   If LA wants to become a global startup hub by 2050, a Silicon Beach to truly rival the Valley farther north, then it needs to start getting connected now. We can't wait on stodgy old monopolist business models to support new markets or civic innovations. If we're lucky, we wont have any need for the old cable and telco monopolists at all before 2050. Their anti-neutrality extortionist tricks will no longer extract anything from our local economy.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  LA area residents will benefit from faster Internet services at lower costs.
  Some families who couldn't afford any Internet access at all under cable and
  telco duopoly pricing will gain cost effective network access at home for the
  first time. 
   
   The poorest neighborhood families will receive network hardware and cooperative membership donations and subsidies, so that their home communications infrastructure can be built for them by local experts at little to no cost. 
   
   Local telecommunications experts will have a wider range of employment opportunities, in community-run networks closer to home.
   
   Civic and nonprofit institutions will benefit from more direct local constituent access online. 
   
   Local businesses will benefit from more direct access to their customer base, with less costly and annoying dependencies on remote third party service providers.
   
   New innovative startups will thrive in any area of LA where open Internet access is fast, cheap, and ubiquitous. Civic and social startups may see the most benefits from direct connections to potential customers nearby.
   
   LA tourism, especially by the well funded global digerati, will benefit from fast ubiquitous access in all the local vacation spots. Our great weather and global branding status will bring them in for vacation, but free WiFi and gigabit broadband will help keep them here while they work remotely.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  Any local nonprofit or government institution can transform their own offices,
  buildings, and campuses into institutional hubs for local community network
  mesh peer connections and online services. Modern low cost and power-sipping
  hardware designed for laptops and tablets can easily be transformed into core
  router and data services infrastructure, all at lower gross long-term costs
  than any remote Internet cloud services. These online services can be situated
  directly within the places where they are most used. This both lowers online
  request latency and increases service reliability. During disasters of any
  form, in situ renewable power generation and backup batteries can keep this
  community infrastructure operational while the metropolitan infrastructure is
  being restored. These institutions and services should always reside at the
  core of our community networks, not at remote data centers far north or east
  of Los Angeles County.
   
   Open standards hardware and open source software vendors can each contribute to designs for low cost reliable community network infrastructure. Data Roads Foundation constituents in each community can serve as a "standards group", to determine the open standards most appropriate for implementation in their local area.
   
   Data Roads Foundation is already partnering with several open source and mesh hardware projects like Internet-In-A-Box.org, Commotion Wireless, Freedom Stack, Freedom Box, Open Telco, Guardian Project, Calyx Institute, and several open source mesh routing software projects. We are currently negotiating collaborations with several California based network hardware and maintenance service vendors. Anything that proprietary vendors refuse to provide can be created by and for ourselves, by using open technologies in our own communities.
