Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Get 100% of LA online faster! Allow citizens, institutions, and small biz to
  build our own networks and connections together!
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  A lot of the open standards hardware and open source software required for
  these private network deployments already exist. We just need to package it
  all together, in a way that makes it easy for anyone without network expertise
  to install it in their own homes or offices. 
   
   We will also provide legal templates for communities to incorporate their own 501c12 cooperatives or 501c4 community welfare networks, so that local experts can be paid for their professional services in connecting and maintaining these neighborhood networks. We have a pilot 501c4 project starting in the Northeast Los Angeles region, NELA-ISC.Net, where we will test our templates and open source tools in real world deployments. We welcome all other LA region communities to start their own neighborhood networks as well, and connect directly with each other. The downtown LA community in particular has great access to multiple global carrier transit providers, at carrier neutral facilities like One Wilshire, where connecting through neighbors directly will be much cheaper than AT&T or Time Warner.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Global competitive market access today requires fast broadband Internet
  connections. South Koreans visit major American cities and feel like they're
  in a remote rural area, where Internet speeds slow down to a crawl. If the US
  and its largest global cities (like LA) want to catch up, or at least attract
  digerati tourism, then they need to explore every option to connect all their
  citizens to gigabit or faster speeds. Renting this core infrastructure from
  cable and telco monopolists will simply not suffice. Silicon Beach will not
  wait.
   
   If LA wants to become a global startup hub by 2050, a Silicon Beach to truly rival the Valley farther north, then it needs to start getting connected now. We can't wait on stodgy old monopolist business models to support new markets or civic innovations. If we're lucky, we wont have any need for the old cable and telco monopolists at all before 2050. Their anti-neutrality extortionist tricks will no longer extract anything from our local economy.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  LA area residents will benefit from faster Internet services at lower costs.
  Some families who couldn't afford any Internet access at all under cable and
  telco duopoly pricing will gain cost effective network access at home for the
  first time. 
   
   The poorest neighborhood families will receive network hardware and cooperative membership donations and subsidies, so that their home communications infrastructure can be built for them by local experts at little to no cost. 
   
   Local telecommunications experts will have a wider range of employment opportunities, in community-run networks closer to home.
   
   Civic and nonprofit institutions will benefit from more direct local constituent access online. 
   
   Local businesses will benefit from more direct access to their customer base, with less costly and annoying dependencies on remote third party service providers.
   
   New innovative startups will thrive in any area of LA where open Internet access is fast, cheap, and ubiquitous. Civic and social startups may see the most benefits from direct connections to potential customers nearby.
   
   LA tourism, especially by the well funded global digerati, will benefit from fast ubiquitous access in all the local vacation spots. Our great weather and global branding status will bring them in for vacation, but free WiFi and gigabit broadband will help keep them here while they work remotely.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  Any local nonprofit or government institution can transform their own offices,
  buildings, and campuses into institutional hubs for local community network
  mesh peer connections and online services. Modern low cost and power-sipping
  hardware designed for laptops and tablets can easily be transformed into core
  router and data services infrastructure, all at lower gross long-term costs
  than any remote Internet cloud services. These online services can be situated
  directly within the places where they are most used. This both lowers online
  request latency and increases service reliability. During disasters of any
  form, in situ renewable power generation and backup batteries can keep this
  community infrastructure operational while the metropolitan infrastructure is
  being restored. These institutions and services should always reside at the
  core of our community networks, not at remote data centers far north or east
  of Los Angeles County.
   
   Open standards hardware and open source software vendors can each contribute to designs for low cost reliable community network infrastructure. Data Roads Foundation constituents in each community can serve as a "standards group", to determine the open standards most appropriate for implementation in their local area.
   
   Data Roads Foundation is already partnering with several open source and mesh hardware projects like Internet-In-A-Box.org, Commotion Wireless, Freedom Stack, Freedom Box, Open Telco, Guardian Project, Calyx Institute, and several open source mesh routing software projects. We are currently negotiating collaborations with several California based network hardware and maintenance service vendors. Anything that proprietary vendors refuse to provide can be created by and for ourselves, by using open technologies in our own communities.

    Get 100% of LA online faster! Allow citizens, institutions, and small biz to
    build our own networks and connections together!
  more_detail: >-
    The word "Internet" is just short for "interconnected networks". Anyone can
    build their own home network, encourage all their neighbors to do the same,
    and once they connect with each other over   shared fence lines (the global
    network industry calls this "peering"), they are suddenly part of their own
    community internet! By sharing in this property of all networks, we can have
    the biggest contiguous mesh of Internet connection points in the country. We
    only each pay for our own network's installation, maintenance costs, and
    long distance transit. Today we are paying up to 20 times that much, just to
    rent temporary access from a cable or telephone company's proprietary
    network. We should each have our own internet instead.

  metrics_connect_blank: Telecommuting offset to all other travel infrastructure loads.
  impact_metrics: "Pervasive Internet connectivity and local online community services affect every single metric in every LA 2050 goal. \r\n\r\nEven when workers do not telecommute from home, higher speed connections allow businesses to utilize coworking offices in multiple regions near transit hubs, which allow groups of workers to come together in places more convenient and transit friendly than any one office next to a full parking lot. \r\n\r\nThe net offsets to transportation system loads created by telecommuting and co-working hubs provide huge benefits to the local environment and infrastructure maintenance loads. \r\n\r\nStudies show that anyone who commutes more than 45 minutes in each direction is less satisfied with their life overall, so reduced congestion and less stressful commutes have positive effects on both home life and general productivity. Reducing commutes just 5 minutes each way gives a worker back up to 20 hours of their private life each year. Public transit commutes enabled by coworking hubs gives them much more time to read and have fun than sit behind a wheel. They are also much more likely to stay fit by walking or biking to their closest transit stops.\r\n\r\nCommunications networks are the backbone of every civic and business organizing effort in the city. This application process itself requires a computer with Internet access! \r\n\r\nCivic engagement, education, volunteerism, informed voters, government response time, employment, and socialization are all much easier to plan and coordinate online. None of this can happen for every LA citizen equally unless Internet access is ubiquitous to every home, family, and institution in the region."

  evaluate: "1. Number of new family homes with online access to local civic and market resources, where such access was nonexistent or unaffordable before.\r\n\r\n2. Cost reductions amortized over life of network hardware, especially for local civic and nonprofit institutions and infrastructure.\r\n\r\n3. Increased number of well paying technology jobs from community networks, and the new startup businesses they attract.\r\n\r\n4. Number of civic, social, and business startups that declare community broadband networks as a primary reason for local office location selection.\r\n\r\n5. Increases in tourism and technical conferences, especially among the new global digerati.\r\n\r\n6. Increases in telecommuting and public transportation use, due to community high speed networks enabling efficient remote work and coworking near transportation hubs.\r\n\r\n7. Lower response times for government services, due to fast and efficient online communications with constituents -- instead of slow and inefficient onsite interviews, paperwork, or phone trees.\r\n\r\n8. Lower safety and emergency service response times, due to reliable and ubiquitous community network alerts and feedback systems.\r\n\r\n9. Higher rates of volunteerism, due to more free time saved from long commutes.\r\n\r\n10. Higher charitable donations per capita from better income reliability, due to increased local technology industry education and hiring.\r\n\r\n11. Higher voter turnout due to greater education on the issues, and more frequent constituent communications online.\r\n\r\n12. Additional square meters of public area where limited WiFi is freely available, with no bandwidth throttling for community cooperative members or mesh route contributors."
  two_lessons: "1. Communications systems are core business and home infrastructure.\r\n    I have set up and maintained over 5 development studio networks and 3 home networks. Whenever any network gets disconnected, either internally or from the outside global Internet, office and home productivity all plummets. The Internet is vital infrastructure on par with water and electricity in the 21st century. It is absolutely necessary today for doing any business in technology or online retail.\r\n\r\n2. Owning durable goods is always better than renting them.\r\n    Rentier monopolist middlemen extract resources from the economy without investing much of it back in quality improvements. Multiple reports have shown that cable franchise monopolies like Comcast extract as much as 95% margins from cable and Internet subscriptions as profit, with little to no reinvestment in infrastructure. Regardless of their reinvestment rates, all their investments are taken as private gains and never provided as public goods. This means building our own network infrastructure is always more cost effective, even if the required loans extract a ridiculous amount of interest. Even at 95% interest loss per loan payment, that's still infinitely greater equity return than rental payments."
  achievable_goal: "The core of the global Internet already runs on mesh routing software systems like OSPF, and ad hoc wireless mesh routing software like OLSR has already been tested internationally. This open source software all runs on open standards hardware like desktop computers and laptops -- the same hardware that is being shrunk into low power tablets, phones, and embedded systems today. The only remaining task is to package up all these innovations together, in a way that anyone can easily install and maintain these connections in their own homes and offices at falling costs.\r\n\r\nOnce we start deploying these legal and technology tools packages to all LA residents and institutions, the network will grow very quickly. Each new wire on a fence line or radio on a roof is another mesh connection point in our own community Internet. We don't need any big remote controlled cable or telco company to come in to build our networks for us. Their limited full-time maintenance staff can only install new infrastructure at a very slow pace. We can each simultaneously build networks for ourselves in our own homes and offices, and connect them to each other immediately upon completion. We don't have to wait for anybody else. "
  major_challenges: "The US FCC has been a captured regulator since inception, or before inception if you count their predecessor FRA as a separate entity. They may try to limit our ability to connect with each other directly, in favor of the incumbent telco and cable monopolists they serve exclusively today. Their auctions of our public commons resources have never been in our collective public interests. We will use existing open spectrum license and \"light license\" structures to avoid proprietary exclusive spectrum, as previously allocated by the FCC to invisible private fiefdoms against all public interests. Partner organizations with less restrictions on their political activities can also petition their US government to force the FCC to start acting in public interests, instead of for their own \"post regulator career\" private gains.\r\n\r\nLA City officials have been begging the cable and telco incumbents to install a new exclusive fiber franchise, in the guise of the LACBN RFP process. They may fight against our ability to build better networks for ourselves and our neighbor communities, because their lobbyist monopolists don't like to see any remote form of \"competition\" on the horizon, especially not from their own indentured customers. They claim that they can only make \"affordable infrastructure investments\" if they are given monopoly market powers in return. We will reveal these fallacious claims for what they are: fear of any real market alternatives to their inferior service provision. They pay your government representatives to pick them as communications market winners, and everyone else as losers. We will reveal the truth behind their political lies: they don't want any real \"free market\" that they can't control entirely.\r\n\r\nHerd mentality and basic network market ignorance may keep LA residents and business owners from adopting community network ownership over perpetual rentier access. People may continue to rent mere Internet access, instead of buying their own networks, more out of stagnant momentum than any actual costs. We can provide everyone with cooperative memberships and equity finance payment plans that resemble their current subscriptions, but still save them a great deal in long term costs. If T-Mobile can call themselves an \"un-carrier\" without irony, then we can certainly call each of our local community network partners an \"un-ISP\"."
  competition: "Big Cable and Telco duopolies with franchise wire monopolies in the LA region will claim to compete with us and our cooperative network partners. Due to economic properties inherent to all networks, like Metcalfe's Law, all claims of Internet competition anywhere are invalid. Additional network participants and connections are always supportive and complementary to each other. Redundant and load balanced network connections can never serve as complete market substitutes for each other, because they each incrementally increase net speed and reliability at the point of connection.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple mesh wireless and open source router projects in different regions of North America, Europe, Africa, Oceania, and South America. All these projects have varying underlying cultures and goals driving them, and they each serve as complements to our technological and public education work. We would like to consider them all partners, in friendly coopetition rather than redundant competition. Wired and wireless mesh network topologies provide greater coverage and reliability together than either transit medium can provide alone. Multiple wireless radios coordinated via wireline links can also exploit the physics of light in unique ways, such as MegaMIMO based multiple user roving signal isolation.\r\n\r\nData Roads Foundation has existing partnerships with NELA-ISC.Net, LA Mesh, Internet-In-A-Box.org, and other local open source innovation groups. We are always looking for more diverse partnerships throughout LA and online."
  cost: "Roughly 80% of this seed funding will go towards dedicated open source developer salaries. This will accelerate all Data Roads Foundation open material packaging and standards document releases. \r\n    Most open source developers are paid by corporations to create and maintain vital software infrastructure for their parent companies. These corporations utilize open source licenses to keep them \"free as in liberty\" from proprietary vendors, never just \"free as in not paying for beer\". Open source developer volunteerism is always welcomed, but never required to meet project goals.\r\n\r\nThe remaining funds will buy development and test cluster hardware for all related open source projects to utilize. Most of this hardware can later be donated to low income families and nonprofit institutions for their home and office networks, after it is no longer needed for development purposes.\r\n\r\nTotal project net cost calculations assume a zero-sum market game, which does not exist for any Data Roads Foundation project. Any seed funding we receive will help accelerate initial development, never create dependencies on future funding streams. We utilize existing open source tools and open markets in novel packaging, which actually lowers net purchase costs when compared to continued Internet access rental. \r\n    We can exploit these net positive market effects by taking the margins for router hardware sales that would previously be squandered away as profits, and instead reinvest them directly into poor and disadvantaged community network infrastructure. GOGO (give one, get one) style programs can be utilized to make sure that every Data Roads mesh router equipment sale to a rich LA household can equally impact access by a poor LA household to the same net benefits."
  budget: "$40,000 x2 = $80,000 for at least 2 dedicated open source and standards developer salaries, for approximately 6 person-months.\r\n    Even if they do not perform the majority of project programming tasks themselves, these developers will still be required to coordinate and resolve issues with open source development community output and build infrastructure.\r\n\r\n$1000 x10 = $10,000 for about 10 open mesh routers for development, testing, and deployment. \r\n    Once initial development and testing phases are completed, up to 6 of these routers can help seed network deployment in any charitable class LA neighborhood's 501c4 community welfare network.\r\n\r\n$5,000 x2 = $10,000 for 2 software defined radio (SDR) lab experimentation boxes (probably from Per Vices). \r\n    These lab boxes can be used to develop new forward-looking mesh wireless hardware and firmware standards, and to prepare for upcoming FCC licensing changes. A very recent example is expanded unlicensed access to spectrum and radio amplification power between the 5 and 6GHz frequencies, which can be utilized by new 802.11ac multi-user multi-input/output (MU-MIMO) WiFi radios to create faster simultaneous beamformed connections at longer distances. Ultra-wideband (UWB) SDR MIMO technologies can be used to spread similar advantages across all unlicensed and \"light licensed\" spectrum bands dynamically and simultaneously, all without violating any FCC rules.\r\n\r\nTotal: $100,000\r\n"

    answer: >-
      The word "Internet" is just short for "interconnected networks". Anyone
      can build their own home network, encourage all their neighbors to do the
      same, and once they connect with each other over   shared fence lines (the
      global network industry calls this "peering"), they are suddenly part of
      their own community internet! By sharing in this property of all networks,
      we can have the biggest contiguous mesh of Internet connection points in
      the country. We only each pay for our own network's installation,
      maintenance costs, and long distance transit. Today we are paying up to 20
      times that much, just to rent temporary access from a cable or telephone
      company's proprietary network. We should each have our own internet
      instead.

    answer: "A lot of the open standards hardware and open source software required for these private network deployments already exist. We just need to package it all together, in a way that makes it easy for anyone without network expertise to install it in their own homes or offices. \r\n\r\nWe will also provide legal templates for communities to incorporate their own 501c12 cooperatives or 501c4 community welfare networks, so that local experts can be paid for their professional services in connecting and maintaining these neighborhood networks. We have a pilot 501c4 project starting in the Northeast Los Angeles region, NELA-ISC.Net, where we will test our templates and open source tools in real world deployments. We welcome all other LA region communities to start their own neighborhood networks as well, and connect directly with each other. The downtown LA community in particular has great access to multiple global carrier transit providers, at carrier neutral facilities like One Wilshire, where connecting through neighbors directly will be much cheaper than AT&T or Time Warner."

    answer: "Global competitive market access today requires fast broadband Internet connections. South Koreans visit major American cities and feel like they're in a remote rural area, where Internet speeds slow down to a crawl. If the US and its largest global cities (like LA) want to catch up, or at least attract digerati tourism, then they need to explore every option to connect all their citizens to gigabit or faster speeds. Renting this core infrastructure from cable and telco monopolists will simply not suffice. Silicon Beach will not wait.\r\n\r\nIf LA wants to become a global startup hub by 2050, a Silicon Beach to  truly rival the Valley farther north, then it needs to start getting connected now. We can't wait on stodgy old monopolist business models to support new markets or civic innovations. If we're lucky, we wont have any need for the old cable and telco monopolists at all before 2050. Their anti-neutrality extortionist tricks will no longer extract anything from our local economy."
  - name: who_benefit
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "LA area residents will benefit from faster Internet services at lower costs. Some families who couldn't afford any Internet access at all under cable and telco duopoly pricing will gain cost effective network access at home for the first time. \r\n\r\nThe poorest neighborhood families will receive network hardware and cooperative membership donations and subsidies, so that their home communications infrastructure can be built for them by local experts at little to no cost. \r\n\r\nLocal telecommunications experts will have a wider range of employment opportunities, in community-run networks closer to home.\r\n\r\nCivic and nonprofit institutions will benefit from more direct local constituent  access online. \r\n\r\nLocal businesses will benefit from more direct access to their customer base, with less costly and annoying dependencies on remote third party service providers.\r\n\r\nNew innovative startups will thrive in any area of LA where open Internet access is fast, cheap, and ubiquitous. Civic and social startups may see the most benefits from direct connections to potential customers nearby.\r\n\r\nLA tourism, especially by the well funded global digerati, will benefit from fast ubiquitous access in all the local vacation spots. Our great weather and global branding status will bring them in for vacation, but free WiFi and gigabit broadband will help keep them here while they work remotely."

    answer: "Any local nonprofit or government institution can transform their own offices, buildings, and campuses into institutional hubs for local community network mesh peer connections and online services. Modern low cost and power-sipping hardware designed for laptops and tablets can easily be transformed into core router and data services infrastructure, all at lower gross long-term costs than any remote Internet cloud services. These online services can be situated directly within the places where they are most used. This both lowers online request latency and increases service reliability. During disasters of any form, in situ renewable power generation and backup batteries can keep this community infrastructure operational while the metropolitan infrastructure is being restored. These institutions and services should always reside at the core of our community networks, not at remote data centers far north or east of Los Angeles County.\r\n\r\nOpen standards hardware and open source software vendors can each contribute to designs for low cost reliable community network infrastructure. Data Roads Foundation constituents in each community can serve as a \"standards group\", to determine the open standards most appropriate for implementation in their local area.\r\n\r\nData Roads Foundation is already partnering with several open source and mesh hardware projects like Internet-In-A-Box.org, Commotion Wireless, Freedom Stack, Freedom Box, Open Telco, Guardian Project,  Calyx Institute, and several open source mesh routing software projects. We are currently negotiating collaborations with several California based network hardware and maintenance service vendors. Anything that proprietary vendors refuse to provide can be created by and for ourselves, by using open technologies in our own communities."

    explanation: Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.
    answer: "Pervasive Internet connectivity and local online community services affect every single metric in every LA 2050 goal. \r\n\r\nEven when workers do not telecommute from home, higher speed connections allow businesses to utilize coworking offices in multiple regions near transit hubs, which allow groups of workers to come together in places more convenient and transit friendly than any one office next to a full parking lot. \r\n\r\nThe net offsets to transportation system loads created by telecommuting and co-working hubs provide huge benefits to the local environment and infrastructure maintenance loads. \r\n\r\nStudies show that anyone who commutes more than 45 minutes in each direction is less satisfied with their life overall, so reduced congestion and less stressful commutes have positive effects on both home life and general productivity. Reducing commutes just 5 minutes each way gives a worker back up to 20 hours of their private life each year. Public transit commutes enabled by coworking hubs gives them much more time to read and have fun than sit behind a wheel. They are also much more likely to stay fit by walking or biking to their closest transit stops.\r\n\r\nCommunications networks are the backbone of every civic and business organizing effort in the city. This application process itself requires a computer with Internet access! \r\n\r\nCivic engagement, education, volunteerism, informed voters, government response time, employment, and socialization are all much easier to plan and coordinate online. None of this can happen for every LA citizen equally unless Internet access is ubiquitous to every home, family, and institution in the region."

    answer: "1. Communications systems are core business and home infrastructure.\r\n    I have set up and maintained over 5 development studio networks and 3 home networks. Whenever any network gets disconnected, either internally or from the outside global Internet, office and home productivity all plummets. The Internet is vital infrastructure on par with water and electricity in the 21st century. It is absolutely necessary today for doing any business in technology or online retail.\r\n\r\n2. Owning durable goods is always better than renting them.\r\n    Rentier monopolist middlemen extract resources from the economy without investing much of it back in quality improvements. Multiple reports have shown that cable franchise monopolies like Comcast extract as much as 95% margins from cable and Internet subscriptions as profit, with little to no reinvestment in infrastructure. Regardless of their reinvestment rates, all their investments are taken as private gains and never provided as public goods. This means building our own network infrastructure is always more cost effective, even if the required loans extract a ridiculous amount of interest. Even at 95% interest loss per loan payment, that's still infinitely greater equity return than rental payments."
  - name: achievable_goal
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "The core of the global Internet already runs on mesh routing software systems like OSPF, and ad hoc wireless mesh routing software like OLSR has already been tested internationally. This open source software all runs on open standards hardware like desktop computers and laptops -- the same hardware that is being shrunk into low power tablets, phones, and embedded systems today. The only remaining task is to package up all these innovations together, in a way that anyone can easily install and maintain these connections in their own homes and offices at falling costs.\r\n\r\nOnce we start deploying these legal and technology tools packages to all LA residents and institutions, the network will grow very quickly. Each new wire on a fence line or radio on a roof is another mesh connection point in our own community Internet. We don't need any big remote controlled cable or telco company to come in to build our networks for us. Their limited full-time maintenance staff can only install new infrastructure at a very slow pace. We can each simultaneously build networks for ourselves in our own homes and offices, and connect them to each other immediately upon completion. We don't have to wait for anybody else. "

    answer: "The US FCC has been a captured regulator since inception, or before inception if you count their predecessor FRA as a separate entity. They may try to limit our ability to connect with each other directly, in favor of the incumbent telco and cable monopolists they serve exclusively today. Their auctions of our public commons resources have never been in our collective public interests. We will use existing open spectrum license and \"light license\" structures to avoid proprietary exclusive spectrum, as previously allocated by the FCC to invisible private fiefdoms against all public interests. Partner organizations with less restrictions on their political activities can also petition their US government to force the FCC to start acting in public interests, instead of for their own \"post regulator career\" private gains.\r\n\r\nLA City officials have been begging the cable and telco incumbents to install a new exclusive fiber franchise, in the guise of the LACBN RFP process. They may fight against our ability to build better networks for ourselves and our neighbor communities, because their lobbyist monopolists don't like to see any remote form of \"competition\" on the horizon, especially not from their own indentured customers. They claim that they can only make \"affordable infrastructure investments\" if they are given monopoly market powers in return. We will reveal these fallacious claims for what they are: fear of any real market alternatives to their inferior service provision. They pay your government representatives to pick them as communications market winners, and everyone else as losers. We will reveal the truth behind their political lies: they don't want any real \"free market\" that they can't control entirely.\r\n\r\nHerd mentality and basic network market ignorance may keep LA residents and business owners from adopting community network ownership over perpetual rentier access. People may continue to rent mere Internet access, instead of buying their own networks, more out of stagnant momentum than any actual costs. We can provide everyone with cooperative memberships and equity finance payment plans that resemble their current subscriptions, but still save them a great deal in long term costs. If T-Mobile can call themselves an \"un-carrier\" without irony, then we can certainly call each of our local community network partners an \"un-ISP\"."
  - name: competition
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Big Cable and Telco duopolies with franchise wire monopolies in the LA region will claim to compete with us and our cooperative network partners. Due to economic properties inherent to all networks, like Metcalfe's Law, all claims of Internet competition anywhere are invalid. Additional network participants and connections are always supportive and complementary to each other. Redundant and load balanced network connections can never serve as complete market substitutes for each other, because they each incrementally increase net speed and reliability at the point of connection.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple mesh wireless and open source router projects in different regions of North America, Europe, Africa, Oceania, and South America. All these projects have varying underlying cultures and goals driving them, and they each serve as complements to our technological and public education work. We would like to consider them all partners, in friendly coopetition rather than redundant competition. Wired and wireless mesh network topologies provide greater coverage and reliability together than either transit medium can provide alone. Multiple wireless radios coordinated via wireline links can also exploit the physics of light in unique ways, such as MegaMIMO based multiple user roving signal isolation.\r\n\r\nData Roads Foundation has existing partnerships with NELA-ISC.Net, LA Mesh, Internet-In-A-Box.org, and other local open source innovation groups. We are always looking for more diverse partnerships throughout LA and online."
  - name: cost
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Roughly 80% of this seed funding will go towards dedicated open source developer salaries. This will accelerate all Data Roads Foundation open material packaging and standards document releases. \r\n    Most open source developers are paid by corporations to create and maintain vital software infrastructure for their parent companies. These corporations utilize open source licenses to keep them \"free as in liberty\" from proprietary vendors, never just \"free as in not paying for beer\". Open source developer volunteerism is always welcomed, but never required to meet project goals.\r\n\r\nThe remaining funds will buy development and test cluster hardware for all related open source projects to utilize. Most of this hardware can later be donated to low income families and nonprofit institutions for their home and office networks, after it is no longer needed for development purposes.\r\n\r\nTotal project net cost calculations assume a zero-sum market game, which does not exist for any Data Roads Foundation project. Any seed funding we receive will help accelerate initial development, never create dependencies on future funding streams. We utilize existing open source tools and open markets in novel packaging, which actually lowers net purchase costs when compared to continued Internet access rental. \r\n    We can exploit these net positive market effects by taking the margins for router hardware sales that would previously be squandered away as profits, and instead reinvest them directly into poor and disadvantaged community network infrastructure. GOGO (give one, get one) style programs can be utilized to make sure that every Data Roads mesh router equipment sale to a rich LA household can equally impact access by a poor LA household to the same net benefits."

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "$40,000 x2 = $80,000 for at least 2 dedicated open source and standards developer salaries, for approximately 6 person-months.\r\n    Even if they do not perform the majority of project programming tasks themselves, these developers will still be required to coordinate and resolve issues with open source development community output and build infrastructure.\r\n\r\n$1000 x10 = $10,000 for about 10 open mesh routers for development, testing, and deployment. \r\n    Once initial development and testing phases are completed, up to 6 of these routers can help seed network deployment in any charitable class LA neighborhood's 501c4 community welfare network.\r\n\r\n$5,000 x2 = $10,000 for 2 software defined radio (SDR) lab experimentation boxes (probably from Per Vices). \r\n    These lab boxes can be used to develop new forward-looking mesh wireless hardware and firmware standards, and to prepare for upcoming FCC licensing changes. A very recent example is expanded unlicensed access to spectrum and radio amplification power between the 5 and 6GHz frequencies, which can be utilized by new 802.11ac multi-user multi-input/output (MU-MIMO) WiFi radios to create faster simultaneous beamformed connections at longer distances. Ultra-wideband (UWB) SDR MIMO technologies can be used to spread similar advantages across all unlicensed and \"light licensed\" spectrum bands dynamically and simultaneously, all without violating any FCC rules.\r\n\r\nTotal: $100,000\r\n"
