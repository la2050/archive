  Shockingly, in an age when many view the Internet as ubiquitous and a
  demographic leveler, 92% of riders use cell phones (75% of those are smart
  phones), while 33% still lack other Internet access. Phones are their
  Internet! Out the Window will foster a multi-directional nexus of ideas,
  images and thought-based entertainment accessible to nearly all, regardless of
  economic status, neighborhood of residence or cultural affiliation.
  Functioning across social media and “live” screenings on the buses, a powerful
  and almost infinitely expandable vector for vital dialogs by, about and in Los
  Angeles will be created. 
    
   In 2013-14 Out the Window presented videos, (6 per week) each with an open-ended, pointed question in English and Spanish to which viewers responded via social media. In 2015 Freewaves will spearhead a multicultural, multi-aesthetic, county-wide coalition to bring a little media sunshine to all L.A. Metro buses. These videos will be: 
    • 1/3 by artists on the full breadth of issues of concern to them; 
    • 1/3 about community health such as access to nutritious food,  obesity amelioration, and promotion of healthful lifestyles; 
    • 1/3 about other issues, such as environmental, educational and social, produced by LA nonprofit organizations; 
    • heavily represented with creative videos by LA youth enrolled in video programs;
    • available for viewing on out-the-window.org and Freewaves’ Facebook page daily for viewers’ comments and sharing. 
   
   Out the Window uses Transit TV’s video system on all 2,000 L.A. Metro buses, reaching Los Angeles’s residents with creative and essential messages while providing free culture on the largest art distribution system in the country to the nation’s most populous county. 
   
   This program is ready to be fully established this year. It launched in 2010 with a MacArthur grant; it tested technologies, networks, programming, and surveyed viewers in 2011. It gathered resources in 2012 and now is ready to expand with all elements in place!
What is your idea/project in more detail?: |-
  Today: 
    • Create a network of video across the County.
    • Communication of urgent and long-term issues in hard to reach communities.
    • Develop an interactive video and social media network.
   
   2050
    • Firmly establish a cohesive system in which community members and artists can exchange visual ideas, images and information impacting life in Los Angeles County.
   • Creation of a network capable of adapting to the quickly  evolving platforms and aesthetics of social media and image- making.
    • Add to the cool factor of riding the bus. 
   
   Art is passing from isolation, to intervention, to participation, to engagement, to a glorious ubiquity in which currently accepted and recognized disciplines and aesthetics evolve into new forms of public communication. With the blazingly fast developments in technology, we have witnessed an integration of disciplines, in which computing and telecommunication devices have fostered a new hybrid of public and private art, one that, by 2050, will have taken forms beyond prediction. Art will be everywhere, an integrated member of society for all. 
   
   Out the Window will play a significant role in that evolution, hastening the democratization of art and communication through its daily dissemination to the bus riding public and, in the future, to other constituencies whose daily lives bring them into contact with videos, mobile devices and means of sound and image distribution birthed by today’s technologies.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Out the Window will reach a bus riding demographic that is 66% Latino, equally
  divided in gender, 50% under 30 and 66% low income. Freewaves current web
  activities reach an international core of media artists, aficionados,
  curiosity seekers and curators seeking the latest in artist-made videos. Out
  the Window will democratize that web to input from a demographic rarely
  included in the media world’s discussions, to the benefit of all. 
   
   Freewaves’ Multicultural Curatorial Process brings together media artists and activists from many of the County’s diverse arts and media organizations, plus independent artists and curators from diverse social, economic, ethnic, sexual orientation, aesthetic and age demographics. This has been made possible by Freewaves’ 25-year commitment to an all-inclusive media democracy, created and maintained by vigorous, ongoing outreach throughout our community. 
   
   Freewaves is no newcomer to outreach through media arts. In 2001, as part of its festival, it produced three half-hour educational videos, elucidating media arts in Los Angeles over the last ten years from Freewaves’ perspective. These documentaries aired on KCET-TV at the beginning and middle of the festival, providing audiences and students with background material for the festival. These programs were also donated to 250 high school art and media teachers throughout the Los Angeles Unified School District and the 75 Los Angeles City and County libraries. Curriculum Guides were written to facilitate classroom presentations by teachers. 
   
   Freewaves also responds to its constituencies’ needs with ongoing workshops designed to bring technology to media artists and activists in underserved communities. In 1999, the fruits of its workshops in Internet use and web design premiered on dozens of artists’ and arts organization web sites throughout the region. Along with the workshops, technical support facilitated their going on line and, if desired, they also received a free web site and eMail accounts for one year.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Freewaves will continue its partnership with Transit TV whose video monitors
  display a continuous one-hour loop on all L.A. Metro buses. Transit TV is in
  contract with Metro through 2015. 
   
   Major collaborators include the following: 
   
   ECHO PARK FILM CENTER programs and services are positive catalysts for at-risk students’ opportunities and interactions through media arts. 
   
   PUBLIC MATTERS is an interdisciplinary enterprise of artists, media professionals and educators who create new media, education and civic engagement projects yielding long-term community benefits. 
   
   USC’S PRICE SCHOOL OF PUBLIC POLICY AND ANNENBERG SCHOOL OF COMMUNICATION are two of the leading schools within one of LA’s best and world renowned academic institutions. Faculty and Students from both programs will advise on health content and sharpen the evaluation process.
