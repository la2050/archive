  more_detail: '            MEND has become a recognized leader in providing basic services in the northeast San Fernando Valley, and MEND’s Medical Clinic is the only free clinic in their portion of the Valley. Medical and vision care, as well as health education, are provided by volunteer health professionals to patients who are low income, have no health insurance and are not entitled to Medicare or Medical benefits. The Medical Clinic provides family practice, chiropractic, acupuncture and chronic disease care to thousands of people each year. When more specialized services are needed, the patients are given referrals to appropriate facilities nearby and free bus tokens are offered to help patients obtain these services. If needed, medications are pres'
  implement: "           Through the volunteer health volunteers, it provides basic ambulatory, hypertension, diabetic, vision, women’s health, acupuncture and chiropractic care to adults. The Eye Clinic provides eye exams, glaucoma testing and prescription glasses free of charge to all patients. Vision services are also provided to children. When more specialized services are needed, the patients are given referrals to appropriate nearby facilities.\r\n           While the MEND health service programs extend over the wide range of illnesses and treatments of young children through seniors, a significant percentage of MEND’s medical activity is extended to the diagnosis and the treatment of hypertension and diabetes prevalent in the dominantly Hispanic population of the northeast San Fernando Valley. Nearly one-third of the MEND medical cash budget is directed to diabetic medications. The MEND Medical Volunteers have designed and implemented a comprehensive medical program that provides health care to poor uninsured families living in the northeast San Fernando Valley. The group includes physicians, doctors of optometry, a doctor of chiropractic, an acupuncturist, nurse practitioners and RN's, \r\n           Through a Holistic Approach, the Medical Clinic provides health education and exercise classes, including specialty clinics for diabetes, hypertension, women’s health and healthy aging; and has recently launched a 4-month Weight Management Course, the objective of which is to educate obese patients on nutrition and exercise, in a culturally-sensitive manner while helping them adopt lifestyle changes that can help them lose the excess weight. Our plan is to rotate 15 patients every 4 months through the course with the goal of helping them lose 10 pounds or lower their BMI score by one point.\r\n"
  impact_live: "           From its humble beginnings in 1971, MEND – Meet Each Need with Dignity – has become one of the most comprehensive and empowering poverty relief agencies in Los Angeles County, serving in thousands of individuals each month with a full range of services designed to meet basic needs and move recipients on to self-reliance.  Named the 2012 California Nonprofit of the Year by the Governor’s Office, MEND, to better meet the growing number client applications, has strategically worked to expand its volunteer workforce to more than 5,300 individuals supported by approximately 31 experienced employees, who gave the equivalent hours of almost 95 full-time employees in 2013. On-going collaborations are part of this leveraged manpower, with more than 300 universities and colleges, businesses, nonprofit and government agencies and community groups regularly working in MEND departments. MEND has a reputation for exceptional management, emphasizing high quality and innovative service delivery.\r\n\r\nAs we move closer to 2050, MEND can strengthen its abilities to provide health options for individuals and families and to break the bonds of hunger, disease, and poverty providing a future-serving as a pathway to self-reliance.\r\n"
  who_benefit: >-
    For over 40 years, MEND—Meet Each Need with Dignity has been providing
    services that meet the basic human needs of individuals, many Hispanic, who
    reside in the northeast San Fernando Valley.  All of MEND’s clients are
    below the Federal poverty areas of Los Angeles County. Many of MENDS’s
    clients are “working poor,” often holding down several minimum wage jobs and
    spending more than 70% of their income on rent. Others are single parents
    with small children who cannot afford childcare to enable then to work
    outside the home and, thus, must rely on welfare. Still others are
    individuals who suddenly find themselves unemployed and without financial
    resources. While some clients live in government subsidized housing, a large
    percentage share the rental of a house with other families and many still
    live in garages, shacks, trailers or other forms of substandard housing.
    MEND is the largest and most comprehensive poverty-relief agency in the San
    Fernando Valley and makes a significant difference in the lives of 3,100
    people who, in 2013, turned to MEND for medical help.

    1) By June 30, 2015, MEND will increase the current percentage of 30%
    diabetics with controlled diabetes and improve HbA1c to 50% by providing
    screenings and health education. 2) A Quality Assurance Committee of health
    professionals meets quarterly to review 15 charts to ensure that appropriate
    treatment is being provided to MEND patients. 3) Implementing a Weight
    Management Pilot Course, that works with 15 obese patients, three times a
    year, to lower BMI scores by 1 point or more. 
  two_lessons: "Years ago when MEND was forming its mission, it learned two lessons. Initially, it learned it really had to bonds of poverty by providing basic human needs and evaluating them. They had to look at all aspects which made up each client and thus help him or her with individual needs – a holistic approach. This manifested into a broad array of services provided and the opportunity to access these services through many client entry points. It was through these entry points that MEND could realistically break the bonds of poverty. . For one, to combat obesity and poor health habits, a comprehensive health education program is being developed that provides exercise courses, a health education library and health-related classes and seminars\r\n\r\nThe other lesson learned was the critical need to get clients on a road to being self- reliant, so they didn’t become totally dependent on MEND to live. For MEND there is a “pathway to self-reliance”.  As an example, through the efforts of its many volunteers and dedicated staff of professionals, MEND has been able effectively to provide for the human needs of its clients and offer a pathway to self-reliance through its educational programs. As an example, MEND has a course on Diabetic Health Education. Classes in this subject teach healthy eating and diabetic health management through diet and exercise while emphasizing the importance of living a healthy lifestyle to prevent diabetic health complications in the future. \r\n"
  achievable_goal: "Since the late 1960’s, our founders have been concerned about the plight of impoverished individuals living in this part of the San Fernando Valley.  Although they began in their garage, the need was so great for food, clothing and furniture that, in 1971, they formed MEND. From office space on Van Nuys Boulevard, to a warehouse that was purchased in the early 1980’s and expanded after the Northridge earthquake to an additional 40,000 square foot community center, MEND has kept pace with the needs of its clients every year and is prepared to do so in the coming 12 months.\r\n"
  major_challenges: >-
    One major challenge is manpower, however MEND’s exceptional management,
    emphasizing high quality and innovative service delivery enabled a 400%
    growth in critical departments during the Great Recession. Ninety-nine
    percent of our collective work is done by volunteers and our operating
    expense remains below 5% (in fiscal year 2013).  The other challenge is
    program funding, but we make it happen. MEND solicits no government grants
    and is funded through the generosity of foundations, businesses and
    individual donors. It also maintains a low overhead of approximately 30 full
    and part time employees in 2013. On-going collaborations are MEND, to better
    meet the growing number client applications, has strategically worked to
    expand its volunteer workforce to more than 5,300 individuals. For example,
    through MEND’s Medical and Eye Care Clinics, volunteer health professionals
    serve low-income patients who have no health insurance and are not entitled
    to Medicare or Medi-Cal benefits. 
  competition: "There is no other single organization in Los Angeles that has as many comprehensive services to a community as MEND.  Operationally MEND is unique. It’s privately funded – no regular government funding. There is low overhead cost, generally less than six percent (MEND is 99% volunteer driven). Staff is hired only when programs grow too large for volunteers to handle.\r\n\r\nMEND has become a recognized leader in providing basic services, including the second largest foodbank in LA County; a clothing distribution center that looks like an attractive retail \r\nstore; a holistic Health Clinic that includes medical, dental, vision, and counseling services; needs assessment through home visiting; information plus referral and a large Christmas basket \r\nprogram.  But more importantly, MEND’s mission compels the organization to provide empowerment services that include an Education and Training Center with classes and tutoring for adults and neighborhood children; a gardening training program through its foodbank intended to alleviate hunger and food insecurity; a wide range of health service programs; and special events held throughout the year, each of which includes educational components enabling clients to lead healthier, more productive lives.  All this is unique in several other respects: There is a holistic approach to relieving the effect of poverty, as evidenced by the broad array of services provided under one roof and the opportunity to access these services through many client entry points. Secondly, every service MEND provides has a “pathway to self-reliance.” so clients are shown how to incorporate the service into their lives to live better and contribute to society as caring human beings. Finally, on-going valued collaborations (covered earlier) are part of MEND’s leveraged manpower.\r\n"

    MEND has become a recognized leader in providing basic services to only
    households below the self-sufficiency standard.  A holistic Health Clinic
    that includes medical, vision, and counseling services; needs assessment
    through home visiting and information. MEND is the largest and most
    comprehensive poverty-relief agency in the San Fernando Valley and makes a
    significant difference in the lives of 3,100 people who, in 2013, turned to
    MEND for medical help. This is nearly 3% of the population of city of
    Pacoima alone
Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  We will implement this project through a four-pronged approach, 1) scale up a
  network of community-based organizations (CBOs) that directly serve target
  populations, 2) cultivate partnerships with aligned corporations to secure
  critical gear for families in need, 3) work with communities to “recycle”
  gently used items, and 3) tailor donations to specific needs. 
   
   Baby Buggy has operated in New York for 13 years using this proven approach. Recently, the organization merged with LA Diaper Drive, the nation’s largest diaper bank, to expand its efforts into LA to serve one of America’s most vulnerable cities. Though we currently work with several CBOs in LA, we will scale up a network of organizations that are concentrated in low-income neighborhoods and offer programs designed to give individuals the skills necessary to become self-sufficient. These programs include job skills training, GED prep, and financial literacy classes. With additional resources, we would have the capacity to more actively secure CBOs that meet our standards, while closely monitoring these anti-poverty programs. 
   
   Secondly, we will cultivate relationships with product manufacturers to secure critical gear. Using our NY program as a model, we will communicate needs to corporate representatives to funnel excess inventory through LA, thereby saving on shipping costs, or in unique cases, secure a non-profit discount to purchase product at cost. Baby Buggy will also provide a mechanism for the community to recycle items their child has outgrown. We will work with local businesses to operate as “drop off sites,” where individuals can donate gently used items in exchange for a tax deduction. 
   
   Lastly, we will tailor donations specific to an agency’s needs so that items are instrumental in increasing parental participation. Nearly all of our CBO partners in NY report that using donated items as incentives helps them leverage the impact of their programs. One partner found, for example, that they were able to increase the number of families accessing their services by 26% simply by providing a free pack of diapers to those who came in for benefits screenings. Once an individual gets in the door, they are then more likely to feel empowered to change their situation. We plan to do quarterly check-ins with these organizations to take an inventory of their needs, with a goal of fulfilling at least 60% of requests by end of year one. Our NY counterpart currently achieves an 84% success rate.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  We believe our initiative will help to make LA the healthiest place to live by
  1) improving the health and safety of children living in poverty in LA, 2)
  lowering the prevalence of children impacted by adverse childhood experiences,
  and 3) lowering the number of households living below the self-sufficiency
  standard by offering resources that help to halt the cycle of poverty. 
   
   First, our idea will improve the health and safety of children living in low-income households by providing parents with resources to safeguard a child from harm. Families cannot purchase items such as diapers, strollers, or cribs with food stamps, so children living in poverty often lack access to basic needs. Children without a crib often sleep in drawers or between parents or can be strapped into a car seat not designed to fit their size; both can lead to severe injury or death. Meanwhile, when a parent cannot afford diapers—an adequate supply costs roughly $100 or more per month—they report keeping infants in a single diaper for a day or longer. This can lead to infection and hygiene issues, while putting children at risk for social, emotional, and behavioral problems down the line. 
   
   Our initiative is also structured to lower the prevalence of children whose lives are impacted by adverse childhood experiences. When a single mother has basic needs met, she is more likely to leave an abusive relationship or avoid incarceration, which ultimately impact her children. In the same right, research shows that when a father can provide for a child, he’s more likely to have greater access to his child and play a greater role in his/her life. Aside from basic infant needs, our model also supports healthy child development by giving children tools like books and school supplies to get the most from their education. 
   
   Lastly, our initiative helps to lower the number of households living below the self-sufficiency standard, today and by 2050, by giving families resources to halt the cycle of poverty. For instance, most daycare centers require a week’s worth of diapers for enrollment. If a parent cannot afford a week of diapers, they may not be able to enroll their child in daycare, and thereby cannot work to support their family. Eventually, their children join the poverty cycle. We not only meet immediate needs to help families succeed, but also support long-term goals through life-improving programs.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Through a network of carefully selected CBOs, we will aim to benefit
  low-income families with children who live in LA’s most challenged
  neighborhoods. Neighborhoods of focus include East LA (Boyle Heights), San
  Fernando Valley (North Hollywood, Pacoima, Panorama City, Sunland), San
  Gabriel Valley (Alhamabra, El Monte, Glendale, and Pasadena), South Central
  (Jefferson Park, Watts), and parts of Central LA (Downtown and Hollywood) and
  South Bay (Inglewood, Torrance). We serve a large population of single and
  first-time mothers, predominantly from Latino and African American
  communities. We also serve refugee children from Iraq, Somalia and Afghanistan
  through a partnership with the Tiyya Foundation. Here is a snapshot of the
  children, parents and families we serve:
   
   43% are single mothers
   30% are homeless or live in a shelter
   27% of the children have special needs
   21% live below the federal poverty line of $22,350 for a family of 4 
   25% are working poor 
   12% are domestic violence survivors
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  It is inherent to our mission to collaborate with other non-profit
  organizations in LA to achieve our goals. While our goal is to expand our
  network, we currently collaborate with organizations such as Children’s
  Institute International (CII), Tiyya Foundation, Nurse-Family Partnership, and
  Black Infant Health to operate life-improving programs that meet our goals of
  helping low-income families become more self-sufficient. Through our
  partnership, we offer incentives to increase participation in these programs
  and classes. We also recently merged with LA Diaper Drive, an organization
  founded in LA in 2005, to expand our resources and deepen our impact in the LA
  community. 
   
   Here are three factors that are critical to the success of our collaboration:
   
   Factor #1 - Highly effective programs: In order for us to be successful in achieving our objectives, partners need to have highly functioning and independent programs in place to support individuals in improving their life situations. These programs must be run by trained and educated individuals who have experience dealing with the economic issues that plague these communities. 
   
   Factor #2 - Donated items: To improve the health, safety and well-being of children living in poverty, and in turn, the sustainability of our partners’ services, we need to have access to essential gear, products and services that will positively impact the lives of children and families we serve. 
   
   Factor #3: - Communication: Because we are not working directly with the individuals we serve, it is imperative that we have an open and reciprocal line of communication with partner CBOs. We must respond to their needs in a timely fashion, and they must strongly communicate the impact of our donations so we can continue to obtain items from generous corporations, retailers, and individuals.
