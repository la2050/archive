Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  We will implement this project through a four-pronged approach, 1) scale up a
  network of community-based organizations (CBOs) that directly serve target
  populations, 2) cultivate partnerships with aligned corporations to secure
  critical gear for families in need, 3) work with communities to “recycle”
  gently used items, and 3) tailor donations to specific needs. 
   
   Baby Buggy has operated in New York for 13 years using this proven approach. Recently, the organization merged with LA Diaper Drive, the nation’s largest diaper bank, to expand its efforts into LA to serve one of America’s most vulnerable cities. Though we currently work with several CBOs in LA, we will scale up a network of organizations that are concentrated in low-income neighborhoods and offer programs designed to give individuals the skills necessary to become self-sufficient. These programs include job skills training, GED prep, and financial literacy classes. With additional resources, we would have the capacity to more actively secure CBOs that meet our standards, while closely monitoring these anti-poverty programs. 
   
   Secondly, we will cultivate relationships with product manufacturers to secure critical gear. Using our NY program as a model, we will communicate needs to corporate representatives to funnel excess inventory through LA, thereby saving on shipping costs, or in unique cases, secure a non-profit discount to purchase product at cost. Baby Buggy will also provide a mechanism for the community to recycle items their child has outgrown. We will work with local businesses to operate as “drop off sites,” where individuals can donate gently used items in exchange for a tax deduction. 
   
   Lastly, we will tailor donations specific to an agency’s needs so that items are instrumental in increasing parental participation. Nearly all of our CBO partners in NY report that using donated items as incentives helps them leverage the impact of their programs. One partner found, for example, that they were able to increase the number of families accessing their services by 26% simply by providing a free pack of diapers to those who came in for benefits screenings. Once an individual gets in the door, they are then more likely to feel empowered to change their situation. We plan to do quarterly check-ins with these organizations to take an inventory of their needs, with a goal of fulfilling at least 60% of requests by end of year one. Our NY counterpart currently achieves an 84% success rate.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  We believe our initiative will help to make LA the healthiest place to live by
  1) improving the health and safety of children living in poverty in LA, 2)
  lowering the prevalence of children impacted by adverse childhood experiences,
  and 3) lowering the number of households living below the self-sufficiency
  standard by offering resources that help to halt the cycle of poverty. 
   
   First, our idea will improve the health and safety of children living in low-income households by providing parents with resources to safeguard a child from harm. Families cannot purchase items such as diapers, strollers, or cribs with food stamps, so children living in poverty often lack access to basic needs. Children without a crib often sleep in drawers or between parents or can be strapped into a car seat not designed to fit their size; both can lead to severe injury or death. Meanwhile, when a parent cannot afford diapers—an adequate supply costs roughly $100 or more per month—they report keeping infants in a single diaper for a day or longer. This can lead to infection and hygiene issues, while putting children at risk for social, emotional, and behavioral problems down the line. 
   
   Our initiative is also structured to lower the prevalence of children whose lives are impacted by adverse childhood experiences. When a single mother has basic needs met, she is more likely to leave an abusive relationship or avoid incarceration, which ultimately impact her children. In the same right, research shows that when a father can provide for a child, he’s more likely to have greater access to his child and play a greater role in his/her life. Aside from basic infant needs, our model also supports healthy child development by giving children tools like books and school supplies to get the most from their education. 
   
   Lastly, our initiative helps to lower the number of households living below the self-sufficiency standard, today and by 2050, by giving families resources to halt the cycle of poverty. For instance, most daycare centers require a week’s worth of diapers for enrollment. If a parent cannot afford a week of diapers, they may not be able to enroll their child in daycare, and thereby cannot work to support their family. Eventually, their children join the poverty cycle. We not only meet immediate needs to help families succeed, but also support long-term goals through life-improving programs.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Through a network of carefully selected CBOs, we will aim to benefit
  low-income families with children who live in LA’s most challenged
  neighborhoods. Neighborhoods of focus include East LA (Boyle Heights), San
  Fernando Valley (North Hollywood, Pacoima, Panorama City, Sunland), San
  Gabriel Valley (Alhamabra, El Monte, Glendale, and Pasadena), South Central
  (Jefferson Park, Watts), and parts of Central LA (Downtown and Hollywood) and
  South Bay (Inglewood, Torrance). We serve a large population of single and
  first-time mothers, predominantly from Latino and African American
  communities. We also serve refugee children from Iraq, Somalia and Afghanistan
  through a partnership with the Tiyya Foundation. Here is a snapshot of the
  children, parents and families we serve:
   
   43% are single mothers
   30% are homeless or live in a shelter
   27% of the children have special needs
   21% live below the federal poverty line of $22,350 for a family of 4 
   25% are working poor 
   12% are domestic violence survivors
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  It is inherent to our mission to collaborate with other non-profit
  organizations in LA to achieve our goals. While our goal is to expand our
  network, we currently collaborate with organizations such as Children’s
  Institute International (CII), Tiyya Foundation, Nurse-Family Partnership, and
  Black Infant Health to operate life-improving programs that meet our goals of
  helping low-income families become more self-sufficient. Through our
  partnership, we offer incentives to increase participation in these programs
  and classes. We also recently merged with LA Diaper Drive, an organization
  founded in LA in 2005, to expand our resources and deepen our impact in the LA
  community. 
   
   Here are three factors that are critical to the success of our collaboration:
   
   Factor #1 - Highly effective programs: In order for us to be successful in achieving our objectives, partners need to have highly functioning and independent programs in place to support individuals in improving their life situations. These programs must be run by trained and educated individuals who have experience dealing with the economic issues that plague these communities. 
   
   Factor #2 - Donated items: To improve the health, safety and well-being of children living in poverty, and in turn, the sustainability of our partners’ services, we need to have access to essential gear, products and services that will positively impact the lives of children and families we serve. 
   
   Factor #3: - Communication: Because we are not working directly with the individuals we serve, it is imperative that we have an open and reciprocal line of communication with partner CBOs. We must respond to their needs in a timely fashion, and they must strongly communicate the impact of our donations so we can continue to obtain items from generous corporations, retailers, and individuals.
