  Our game FREEQ did a lot of cool thins - it created an audio world and a
  mystery to solve that was highly reactive to the choices players made. It’s
  the kind of game anyone can play (in fact, even the blind can play FREEQ with
  just their ears and their fingers) – and one that rewards exploration and
  discovery. It’s a game, yes, but it’s also a mobile journey. We think it’s
  what Playing in LA2050 is all about. 
   
   The game we built last year isn’t location sensitive. We want to build in some GPS hooks to not only hide clues and content but also provide guidance. Even if you don’t want to get too deep into the game, we want to build some “tour modes” that take the idea of a museum audio tour and crank it up to 11. We also plan to expand the device compatibility of the project so that anyone with a phone they bought in the last few years can definitely experience and enjoy it. 
   
   iBeacons are an example of a new technology that uses low-power Bluetooth to recognize when a user is close to the Beacon to trigger unique content. We plan to, with the participation of various locations, install iBeacons throughout DTLA that will add additional hooks for the game experience. 
   
   But that’s the technology side. On the practical side, we have a game to design, new audio content to write, and exciting new partners we want to work with who are as versed in the history of the area as they are experienced in using unconventional technology to experience it. 
   
   Finally, we know there are other storytellers out there and other experts who could give their own fascinating tours. We plan to use some of the funding to make our authoring system open source – allowing other LA denizens to put together their own adventures and tours accessible via download inside the mobile application.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  For the past ten years we’ve made our home in DTLA and become immersed in the
  history of it. This is extra amazing because some of us weren’t totally
  enthusiastic about locating our office in such a questionable neighborhood.
  But then a funny thing happened - we walked the streets and discovered and
  explored. And soon it wasn’t so questionable and we didn’t feel as unsafe.
  Other artists and creatives also discovered the neighborhood and also went out
  and explored and that also made everyone feel safer and more connected. Now
  more people live there. There are parks and cafes and monthly celebrations of
  art and culture – and we still can’t convince terrified suburbanites to come
  and visit us. We think they need a reason to walk the streets and see and
  learn. 
   
   For a young city on the global scale, Los Angeles has a rich history and some of the most interesting architecture in America. It’s also got its secrets. Small parks hidden away. Delicious food down an alley you’d never think to traverse. One-of-a-kind things in one-of-a-kind shops. We think FLIGHT OF THE ANGELS is absolutely a way to help people discover that great opportunities to play are already all around them. Hopefully we point out a few new ones.
   
   Playing the game itself will also be incredibly rewarding. DTLA has such a colorful and diverse history, and it has a future that now makes us more excited than ever to be a part of it. Science fiction used to be inspiring – we think we could tap that and inspire new play and new experiences through the narrative and visions the game projects over the world the players already live in. By 2050, layered experiences with the digital world overlaid on the physical one look to be more and more likely – this project represents an important opportunity for Los Angeles to take a step forward towards being a city of the future.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Flight of the Angels benefits the people and business of DTLA and its
  surrounding neighborhoods, first and foremost. It’s a way we can give back to
  our neighborhood by inviting more people to experience its vibrant rebirth and
  see the potential for future growth and beautification. 
   
   It also benefits anyone who has ever lived in the city but wants to know more – or wants to share more. We’re very excited about having the ability to open up the content creation process to passionate knowledgeable Angelenos to see what they create and add to the repository of play experiences.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: |-
  We’re partnering with two important collaborators on this project:
   Firstly, our good friends at Wise Guys Events are geniuses when it comes to creating live play experiences that bring people together for an unexpected good time. We’ve had the pleasure of exhibiting games next to them at a number of games festivals, and hold each other in high regard. Last fall they came up with a brilliant play experience set in DTLA and rooted in the history of the place – they were not able to secure funding, but we’re kindred spirits on wanting to do something cool about DTLA, and we’ve agreed to join forces if the project gets a green light.
   
   Another confirmed collaborator – Nathan Masters is a writer specializing in Los Angeles history. He’s written for KCET, Gizmodo, Los Angeles magazine, and is manager of academic events and programming for the USC Libraries. We worked with Nathan on a previous pervasive media experiment and we’re excited he’s agreed to collaborate with us on this. 
   
   Three critical success factors: communication, participation, and balancing of interests. The game needs to be fun, we want it to be informative, and it should have the right mix. We’re pretty sure the three of us work well together – it’s all about balancing what we each bring to the table.
