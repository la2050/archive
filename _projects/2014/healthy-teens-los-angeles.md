Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  We will begin to implement this project by establishing a solid community
  networking platform through social media, initiating a construction project at
  the park of an urban permaculture exploration and learning center,
  simultaneously developing effective and creative expression workshops for the
  community taught by accountable community members, and then facilitating
  access to the use of this space for purposeful creative endeavors to promote a
  sense of community and accountability to the park.

What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  There are many interpretations of what living in a healthy place means. To us,
  it is an integration of all of the different concepts in a way that they
  overlap and flow seamlessly to support one aspect that also supports the next
  one. A holistic approach. Our project is aimed at facilitating access to a
  space in which we can integrate all of our different ideas about the notion of
  living healthy lives and scaffold a conscious awareness amongst community
  members of how to apply them to their own lives by experiencing them here at
  the park. We will make Los Angeles the healthiest place to live by promoting a
  connection and appreciation for healthy foods, disseminating information about
  how to access these foods either through feasible outlets or growing them at
  home (even without significant access to space or resources), increasing
  canopy cover (reducing air toxins) at the park and beyond using fruit bearing
  trees, hosting physical engagement activities to fight obesity (and improve
  the bike/transit score through mobility), combating violent acts through
  restorative justice programming (guiding responsibility for actions that have
  hurt or harmed someone else rather than focusing on punishment and isolation
  from the community), exemplifying conscientious use of water resources and
  ways of reducing polluted waterways (through water diversion methods, reducing
  run-off, and and reducing use of harmful chemicals), while simultaneously
  engaging peopleâ€™s need for interaction and creativity to sustain a healthy
  approach to life in the face of adversity and the prevalent socio-economic
  disparities that are rampant in Los Angeles.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The project will benefit young children in the vicinity with access to an open
  park space, it will benefit high school and college students who need an
  outlet for civic engagement to build skillsets for their future, low-income
  families seeking access to healthy food and preventive health information,
  families looking for a place to spend time together and enjoy cultural events,
  everyone in Los Angeles wanting to explore urban permaculture in a hands-on
  setting, community members seeking involvement in sustainable living issues,
  at-risk youth in the area needing mentoring and financial support, as well as
  creative and professional community members needing a supportive space (as
  well as stipends and materials) in which to share their expertise with others.
