    Healthy Teens LA is a transformative approach to healthcare where the
    emphasis is on being well. Youth (Grades 6-12) will be recruited from local
    schools and youth groups to create a Wellness Council. MHS social workers,
    staff, and other health professionals will mentor our teen leaders. Wellness
    Council members will create and coordinate age-specific activity nights open
    to all local youth. Social programs are combined with fun to bring active
    learning on health-related, youth-selected topics. Activities could include
    nutrition, sexual health, mental stability, balancing academic and home
    life, and other relevant topics. 
  implement: "Step 1: Partner with local schools and youth groups\r\n     - Reach out to school administrators, councilors, and teachers, as well as youth group leaders from local churches and community centers.\r\n     - Utilize our existing network of leaders to establish support partnerships\r\n     - Establish a community of sponsors and collaborators\r\n     - Work with teachers and school administrators to give school credit for \"Wellness Council\" membership\r\nStep 2: Invite youth to become part of Wellness Council\r\n     - Through references from our partners\r\n     - Visiting school sites\r\n     - Use of community outreach collaterals\r\n     - Social media\r\nStep 3: Staff will assist youth to identify the needs of their peers and train them in project planning\r\n     - Weekly meetings of Wellness Council\r\n     - Establish a framework to guide council in implementing events\r\n     - Recruit guest leaders from local community\r\n     - Develop time management, communication, teamwork, and additional skills needed for project planning and success in life\r\nStep 4: Youth will work with staff to plan and host free health/wellness/pro-social educational events\r\n     - Decide upon topics and plan relevant activities/speakers\r\n     - Create work groups to foster creative brainstorming and collaboration\r\n     - Delegation skills are learned and refined through the practice of giving each group specific roles in the event planning\r\nStep 5: Staff will provide ongoing leadership training and mentorship to this growing youth community\r\n     - Provide a curriculum focused towards each individual's needs\r\n     - Staff serve as mentors and role models to the work groups\r\n     - Local and community contacts establish a support network\r\nStep 6: Youth and staff will collaborate to evaluate and celebrate their accomplishments in learning to live, learn, create, and play in wellness-minded ways."
  impact_live: "TODAY:\r\nToday, we know that activities that engage the body and mind have greater impact on what a person learns today but more importantly are retained throughout life. Our program empowers youth to embrace a life-long learning approach to health & wellness.Through education and discussion, this project will increase youth awareness that choices made today effect both present and later-life health and wellness. \r\nOur focus will be based on MetroHealth Station's \"whole-person\" approach to health and wellness, which includes:\r\n     PHYSICAL HEALTH\r\n     - Nutrition and how it affects cognition, physicality, and exercise\r\n     - Obesity prevention\r\n     - Physical health and wellness\r\n     ORAL HEALTH\r\n     - The importance of oral hygiene\r\n     - How nutrition affects teeth, tongue, and gums\r\n     MEDICAL HEALTH\r\n     - Diabetes prevention\r\n     - Sexual and reproductive health\r\n     - Nutrition, the immune system, and health\r\n     - Medical health and wellness\r\n     EMOTIONAL HEALTH\r\n     - Anger management\r\n     - Bullying/Violence\r\n     - Sexual respect and responsibility\r\n     - Self Esteem\r\n     - Healthy Body, Healthy Mind (connection between nutrition/physical health and mental health)\r\n     - Effective communication and listening\r\n     - Comfort with one's self and with others\r\n\r\nWe expect that our positive model of health and wellness will be associated with:\r\n     - Creation of a sense of community and camaraderie within local youth\r\n     - Reduction of gang participation by offering community and responsibility\r\n     - Reduction in crime\r\n     - Increase in school attendance\r\n     - Reduction of violence and bullying\r\n     - Reduction in teen pregnancy (increased awareness and practice of safe sexual practices, including abstinence as an option)\r\n\r\n2050:\r\nOver time, as students internalize the ideas and apply them to their own lives while helping others to adopt them as well, the effect will amplify. We see our project having long term goals of:\r\n     - Reduction in overall gang presence\r\n     - Reduction in drug use and overdose\r\n     - Increased school truancy/dropout prevention\r\n     - Instilling mindfulness of personal wellness, helping them to avoid joblessness, homelessness, addiction, and incarceration\r\n     - Students' passing of skills they have learned to the next generation\r\n\r\nSuccessful implementation of this project will lead to its reproduction in other locations, spreading wellness and health across all of Los Angeles."
  who_benefit: "Health & wellness affects everyone! Each life stage from infancy, through grade school and high school to young and older adulthood is associated with health benefits and health risks. The Healthy Teens LA program will focus on the health of youth 12-17 yrs but teens will learn health information that will affect them, their friends and family, and the community.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, we expect that our youth leaders will be health ambassadors for their own school. In addition, our youth leaders will be part of our community outreach activities used to recruit other youth from other schools.\r\n\r\nAll youth participants will be involved in mentoring programs where older youth supervise younger students in lower grades. Our past programs sponsored with LAUSD Foshay Learning Center has taught us that youth are the best health advocates....especially for other youth and their families. "
  partners_collaboration: "Confirmed partners include:\r\n\r\nSCHOOLS:\r\nLAUSD Foshay Learning Center - We have cultivated relationships with the local schools in the Southern LA area, with the strongest connection being with LAUSD Foshay Learning Center. This school, home to 1st through 12th grades, has partnered with MetroHealth Station on many occasions, ranging from a 5k fun run, to a very successful health education activity night. Foshay Leaning Center is a confirmed collaborator that will contribute students, faculty insight, advertising and outreach support, and organizational support. They will also act as a key contact point when we are reaching out to other schools to join in the project. Other area schools have expressed interest and agreements are in discussion.\r\n\r\nCHURCHES & NON_PROFIT PARTNERS:\r\nWest Angeles CDC & the West Angeles Church of God in Christ - MHS is located on the northeast corner of W Jefferson Blvd and Crenshaw Blvd. The Church is not only our landlord but a supportive advocate for our work. West Angeles Plaza  has been instrumental in our outreach efforts with the MetroHealth Station thus far, and will continue to collaborate with us on this project. The church of over 22,000 members, as well as multiple social outreach organizations and groups, has offered to publicize on our behalf, advertising in their church services, youth groups, and social outreach groups. The church is a hugely influential and well respected presence in South Los Angeles, and together we will be able to reach a very large and diverse population. Each day, more partners ask to join our efforts at building a healthier South LA.\r\n\r\nBUSINESS COMMUNITY:\r\nMHS is a member of both the Crenshaw Chamber of Commerce and Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce. Both chambers support our efforts and recognize the value that healthy youth become healthy workers. Our relationship with Foshay Learning Center was fostered though the Pillar \"Principal for a Day\" program. We expect continued support in workforce and youth development from our Chamber partners who we will involved in this project."

  evaluate: "Success will be:\r\n1. Healthy Teens LA youth enrollment rates increase from Oct 2014 compared to end of school year in June 2015.\r\n2. Self-assessment health scores improve in youth participants from initial enrollment compared to end of Healthy Teens LA program.\r\n3. Community satisfaction scores of Healthy Teens LA sponsored events are good to high."
  two_lessons: "LESSON 1: Youth will participate in mentoring activities related to health & wellness. \r\nIn December 2013, MetroHealth Station - Jefferson Park staff put on a health education activity night for the K-8th Foshay students where the Health Academy High School students 9-12th grades supervised the health stations.  of the Foshay Learning Center. Different games and activities were planned for the two hour event, with each station having a tie-in to one of the four areas of primary care health: oral, medical, physical, and mental. This event was an overwhelming success, with around 200 students attending and staying for the entire 2 hours. \r\nLESSON 2: Teens learn health behavior changes best from other youth.\r\nOur engagement with Foshay for the health activity fair, Foshay 5K, science fair and other events at the school has reinforced that students who engaged with us in December are still working and available for our ongoing events today. The success we have experienced with Fabulous Foshay demonstrates to us the need for active health education in this area of Los Angeles. "
  achievable_goal: >-
    Our goal is achievable because MetroHealth Station is a new health facility
    that is open now for community activity. Our mission is to increase access
    to health services and to welcome our community to participate in
    community-related health activity. We are budgeted to support our social
    work team to develop youth engagement programs. The funds will allow us to
    kick-start this process.
  major_challenges: "Potential challenge: What if you build it and nobody comes?! We are a new kid on the block. It will take time to earn the trust of those around us who have a distinguished and long history in the South LA community.\r\nWe creating as many connections and collaborative relationships through our community outreach and ongoing youth engagement activities. We have reached out and established firm contacts with major school, community, and local government entities. It is only when we link together that we are able to provide a true safety net.\r\n\r\nPotential challenge: What if you build it and too many come?! A second potential problem we see occurring is a recruitment of too many participants to be housed in MHS - Jefferson Park. This is another reason we have reached out to existing community groups and entities. In the case that we run out of room, we have \"back-up\" facilities with larger capacities."
  competition: "To our knowledge, we are the first interprofessional private practice of medical, dental, rehabilitation, and mental health professionals who are placing as much value on keeping people health and happy vs treating people who are sick and sad.\r\n\r\nWhile other projects may focus on health promotion and educational activity such as healthy eating, exercising, and community service, we incorporate how healthcare is a part of your daily life. We welcome all health-related community groups to join us as we build a healthier LA together ...starting with the power of South LA youth. "

Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  We will begin to implement this project by establishing a solid community
  networking platform through social media, initiating a construction project at
  the park of an urban permaculture exploration and learning center,
  simultaneously developing effective and creative expression workshops for the
  community taught by accountable community members, and then facilitating
  access to the use of this space for purposeful creative endeavors to promote a
  sense of community and accountability to the park.
   
   For more information, please visit our facebook page.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  There are many interpretations of what living in a healthy place means. To us,
  it is an integration of all of the different concepts in a way that they
  overlap and flow seamlessly to support one aspect that also supports the next
  one. A holistic approach. Our project is aimed at facilitating access to a
  space in which we can integrate all of our different ideas about the notion of
  living healthy lives and scaffold a conscious awareness amongst community
  members of how to apply them to their own lives by experiencing them here at
  the park. We will make Los Angeles the healthiest place to live by promoting a
  connection and appreciation for healthy foods, disseminating information about
  how to access these foods either through feasible outlets or growing them at
  home (even without significant access to space or resources), increasing
  canopy cover (reducing air toxins) at the park and beyond using fruit bearing
  trees, hosting physical engagement activities to fight obesity (and improve
  the bike/transit score through mobility), combating violent acts through
  restorative justice programming (guiding responsibility for actions that have
  hurt or harmed someone else rather than focusing on punishment and isolation
  from the community), exemplifying conscientious use of water resources and
  ways of reducing polluted waterways (through water diversion methods, reducing
  run-off, and and reducing use of harmful chemicals), while simultaneously
  engaging people’s need for interaction and creativity to sustain a healthy
  approach to life in the face of adversity and the prevalent socio-economic
  disparities that are rampant in Los Angeles.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The project will benefit young children in the vicinity with access to an open
  park space, it will benefit high school and college students who need an
  outlet for civic engagement to build skillsets for their future, low-income
  families seeking access to healthy food and preventive health information,
  families looking for a place to spend time together and enjoy cultural events,
  everyone in Los Angeles wanting to explore urban permaculture in a hands-on
  setting, community members seeking involvement in sustainable living issues,
  at-risk youth in the area needing mentoring and financial support, as well as
  creative and professional community members needing a supportive space (as
  well as stipends and materials) in which to share their expertise with others.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: |-
