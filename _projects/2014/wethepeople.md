  #WeThePeople utilizes an innovative program that helps people form powerful
  and lasting civic movements that address the needs of their community through
  training, leadership development, and strong collaboration. 
   The core of the project will focus on increasing civic engagement among the County’s most disenfranchised, disadvantaged, & discriminated communities to empower them to interact with, and change their civic, business, and cultural systems and improve the policies and programs that most impact their lives.
   Future leaders will go through a series of dynamic, interactive and life changing trainings and receive support and resources they can use to engage their communities and form #WeThePeople teams to build towards our #LA2050.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  The #LA2050 Challenge Grant would allow members from our communities to work
  together to develop an overarching strategy and curriculum that can be used by
  #WeThePeople teams, made up of neighbors, friends, and other community
  members, as they tackle local issues and build towards #LA2050. Staff will
  help to cultivate leaders from these community members that will then recruit
  others who would form the #WeThePeople teams and go through a separate
  training program. 
   Through the trainings, teams will learn 4 key skills that will help them develop and carry out their community engagement strategies: 
   1. Create Shared Story
    a. Tell his/her personal story, story of us and now
   2. Create Shared Structure
    a. Create shared commitment and relationship building
    b. Identify teams and roles 
   3. Create Shared Strategy
    a. How to build a clear strategic plan and why it’s important to have one
    b. How to make group decisions around a strategy
    c. How to utilize resources to adopt a strategy
   4. Create Shared Measurable Actions
    a. Systems to facilitate action
    b. How to create shared, motivational action
    c. How to use action to develop and expand resources
   Additionally #WeThePeople teams will work to develop elements around each of the 4 key skills, including:
   1. Story-
    a. An aspirational message, or a common narrative for the team and/or campaign
    b. A message plan for their initial action
   2. Structure- 
    a. Clear team roles, expectations and norms
    b. A clear structure for additional volunteer roles
   3. Strategy-
    a. A strategic outline through September 2015
    b. A detailed strategic plan that includes goals, measurable outcomes, and activities
   4. Action-
    a. Simulated actions to exercise newly learned skills
    b. Develop a clear action plan for their first action
   As #WeThePeople teams return from trainings they will be prepared to implement their first action and motivate their communities to re-engage with their civic environment and demand that their voices be heard. 
   Upon completion of the training sessions, community leaders will meet regularly with their teams and each other to ensure progress and learning is continuous. A system of team reviews and strategy evaluations will be implemented that allows community leaders and teams to constantly address issues that arise and get the assistance and resources they need to successfully accomplish their goals of building a more connected LA2050
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The #LA2050 goals are the representation of the beliefs, needs, and desires of
  the people of Los Angeles. Who then is a better driver of the change we need
  to get us there? The LA2050 Grant will enable the empowerment of LA's most
  disadvantaged and most impoverished communities, also communities that are
  younger and growing at a faster rate than any other. These are the communities
  that are the least represented, and least engaged in our civic environment.
   
   According to the Public Policy Institute of California’s California Poverty Measure, 26.9% of Los Angeles County residents are living in poverty and studies show that kids that grow up in poverty are more likely to live in poverty as an adult. If we don’t break this cycle of inequality and poverty now, Los Angeles cannot and will not be the best place to play, connect, live, create, and learn in 2050. We must break the cycle of poverty that is gripping our future NOW by empowering and inspiring those who are most disenfranchised and apathetic. 
   
   Our communities face extreme challenges and need victories to continue the momentum for greater systemic changes. The implementation of #WeThePeople will result in a network of new leaders who already understand from personal experience the challenges poverty presents to communities. They will be equipped with skills and will have opportunities to connect with others facing similar struggles. By strengthening their own leadership and a network of these communities, we will cultivate change makers and build greater civic awareness in our communities. 
   
   #WeThePeople volunteers and the people they train will bring change to our city and to our systems that have been slow to respond to the changing face of LA. Our Leaders and the #WeThePeople teams will create a self-replicating system of empowerment that will cut through the enormous apathy and disillusionment and will instead inspire communities to get involved, identify and solve problems that matter to them, and create an engine that will power LA to 2050. 
   
   #WeThePeople will make Los Angeles the best place to connect by bringing people from different paths of life that are all facing similar challenges together and empowering them with the tools and skills they need to make change.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  #WeThePeople will benefit everyone in Los Angeles by empowering people who are
  struggling in the shadows to reengage with our civic and economic systems.
  Growing poverty and inequality is weakening our city and weakening our sense
  of pride and optimism to do big things and participate in our system. If we
  continue to ignore the more than 2.6 million people who are suffering by
  living in poverty in Los Angeles County and ignore the growing trend of
  further disenfranchisement, we cannot become the best place to play, connect,
  live, create, and learn by 2050.
   
   The growing problems of economic and social injustice we are facing reach beyond income levels, geographic boundaries, or racial lines. For many, it is easy to ignore the growing poverty crisis, but it doesn’t make the crisis less real. It doesn’t stop eroding our civic systems and threatening our future. The best way to build the momentum needed to tackle this problem is by building connections across demographics, both social and economic. This will create opportunities for new ideas to flourish and it will force everyone to confront the issues that are putting all of our hopes of a prosperous future at risk. 
   
   We all do better when we all do better. 
   
   Our initial #WeThePeople teams will be based in the Latino LGBT community, the Hunger and Homeless community, immigrants, and in communities of people who are living with a disability. The #WeThePeople teams will utilize the Story of Self, Us, and Now, to build connections between, and inspire our friends, neighbors, and the community of Los Angeles to build a movement for our LA2050.
   
   California Partnership has been empowering people from low-income communities for nearly a decade to engage with their civic environment. Our members are community based organizations representing people from low-income communities who seek progressive change and seek the strategic tools and partners to get it done. Through our collaborative, coalition based structure we have been able to build understanding across a diverse range of people from low-income communities and we are able to connect the diverse range of issues affecting them to a common struggle and create a movement. 
   
   #WeThePeople is about creating power among those who feel powerless. When people have the support, the information and the tools they need to engage they can turn an “I” into “We,” and “Me” into “Us.” This creates a more connected LA.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  Currently our confirmed collaborators include The Wall Las Memorias, Hunger
  Action Los Angeles, Communities Actively Living Independent and Free (CALIF)
  and Southern California Resource Services for Independent Living (SCRS-IL.) We
  will also engage our Los Angeles Chapter, which includes nearly 40 members
  ranging from very small community groups to the ACLU-Southern California, to
  maximize the effectiveness of the program. 
   The Wall-Las Memorias Project educates community members on the importance of HIV/AIDS, substance abuse prevention and community building in the LGBT community. 
   3 Critical Factors:
   1) The Wall founder Richard Zaldivar and his staff are established leaders in the community of some of the most impoverished and hardest to reach populations in LA
   2) The organization understands that connections between people to increase awareness and understanding are important catalysts for change. 
   3) The organization has experience in breaking down barriers between communities, and holding cultural events that help deepen our sense of community.
   We have worked together on a project to establish a community taskforce that meets with the Department of Health Services in Los Angeles County. The taskforce has trained community leaders to speak to government officials, to plan actions, and to speak and share stories with media and others. 
   
   Hunger Action Los Angeles (HALA) is a long-time member of our LA Chapter. HALA works to end hunger through advocacy and organizing and is confirmed for this project.
   3 Critical Factors:
   1)HALA has dedicated members who struggle with chronic homelessness and hunger. These dedicated core members have become leaders despite the great challenges they face. 
   2)HALA leaders have built trust among their fellow community members and they are highly aware of issues and policies that work and do not work. 
   3)HALA is an established presence at more than a dozen farmer’s markets where they operate a program called Market Match. This is an important access point to an expanded community and a great opportunity for a #WeThePeople team to work with. 
   We have worked together numerous times over the course of years. 
   
   SCRS-IL and CALIF represent people who are living with a disability and are longtime members of California Partnership and they are confirmed for this project.
   3 Critical Factors:
   1)Highly motivated membership
   2)Experienced with advocacy and leadership training
   3)Often ignored and misunderstood community
