    When originally built the 3 boulevards served the needs of the residents in
    what was then the premier neighborhood of the movers and shakers of late
    19th and early 20th century LA.  While many of the historic and diverse
    homes and apartments in the neighborhood are  being lovingly restored, the
    same cannot be said for the commercial enterprises on these key boulevards. 
    We want to revitalize the commercial nature of the boulevards by attracting
    new types of businesses to better serve the needs of the residents.  We want
    to create a neighborhood-serving commercial zone that is pedestrian friendly
    and easily accessible to local residents in one of the most diverse and
    dynamic communities in Los Angeles.
  implement: >-
    The project is going to be a grass roots effort of volunteers and
    stakeholders who are residents, business operators and property owners in
    the neighborhood.  It will be a collaboration of residents, artists,
    merchants and owners who share a common vision of an improved and better
    neighborhood.  It will be a bottom up effort to get individuals to take
    action to improve their properties and to own the improvements.  It will
    rely on sweat equity and donations to plant trees, renovate or install
    street landscaping, paint buildings and beautify signage to provide an
    esthetically pleasing environment that serves the needs of the adjacent
    residents.
  impact_create: >-
    The current businesses do not reflect the diversity of the current residents
    and serve only a narrow spectrum of the population.  There is ample space
    available to provide incubator space at affordable rents and to broaden the
    offering of services, provide creative spaces for artists and vary the types
    of businesses present.  This is the critical combination necessary to create
    dynamic and attractive  city environments as described by Jane Jacobs in her
    landmark book "The life and death of great American cities".  The objective
    is not to "gentrify" the neighborhood by displacing current residents and
    merchants but to enhance what is already here by using vacant or
    underutilized commercial space and vacant properties to expand services and
    the types of economic activities and employment opportunities currently
    available in order to reflect the diversity of the residents to its fullest
    extent. 
  who_benefit: >-
    The residents, both current and future, will benefit from the greater
    diversity and beauty of these key corridors that are adjacent to downtown LA
    and serve as connectors to the West Side.  It will enhance and expand
    revitalization efforts occurring in downtown, South Park  and La Brea Ave. 
    Greater presence of people and foot traffic also enhances safety and the
    sense of community of the residents.  The City of LA will benefit as the
    volunteers will perform many of the services the City can no longer afford
    to provide at adequate service levels and will result in a better tax base
    for the City as well.  It will also provide more employment opportunities
    for residents and greater incomes for the merchants.  We also expect to
    enhance the cultural offerings of the  neighborhood with the attraction of
    additional artists and artisans to  the neighborhood.
  partners_collaboration: >-
    There are a number of organizations and individuals currently active in the
    types of endeavors we intend to foster as a grassroots incubator and
    provider of information, talent and support for the improvement efforts.  
    The West Adams Heritage Association has been active in the area for 30+
    years, we have a very strong neighborhood council presence in the community
    and many individuals are already sponsoring and/or paying out of their own
    pocket for key preservation, restoration and revitalization activities. The
    idea of our organization is to bring all of these groups together who have
    until now  not acted in concert.  In particular there has not been a
    conscious and organized effort to reach out to merchants and the owners of
    the properties.  Most revitalization and restoration efforts have focused on
    the residential aspects of the neighborhood and have not forged the critical
    link to the business community and commercial property owners, both groups 
    whom we intend to integrate into these projects.  As a grassroots effort, we
    intend to rely on the sweat equity of those in the community.  This is to be
    a bottoms-up effort that will gain momentum from actions taken by others
    that will inspire new efforts by others.  We want the participants to "own"
    the improvements and to inspire others to  do their small part that will
    make an enormous contribution to the community.

    1) More street trees planted and enhanced landscaping, 2) buildings
    painted/spruced up to enhance visual appeal and 3) increase in the number of
    merchants, artists and incubator spaces locating in the community.  We will
    use our site to acknowledge the efforts of individuals in these areas and to
    give them kudos for their efforts.  We will visually document progress with
    before and after photos and/or videos.
  two_lessons: "1) Top-down efforts have not worked.  If the ideas and efforts do not percolate from the bottom up they will not get any traction.\r\n2) Reform/revitalization by committee does not work.  Individuals will take on these improvements and \"own\" them.  What we want to inspire are activities that are small scale, manageable and that do not require permitting and/or lengthy approval  processes."
  achievable_goal: >-
    We have already been canvassing merchants in the community and they have
    expressed enthusiasm and support.  Many have already started improvement
    projects and individual residents have adopted trees, parkways and other
    areas, preserving and improving the plantings and enhancing the ambiance of
    the area.  We will intensify and expand these activities. 
  major_challenges: "1) There will be a fair number of individuals who will not want to take action initially.  Our strategy is to identify blocks with a critical mass of interested individuals, who will make the improvements and inspire others by the success of their efforts.\r\n2) Cost will be a limiting factor for many.  We intend to disseminate information on where trees can be obtained for free or at low cost, find local nurseries who will sell plants at discounts, artists, landscapers and consultants who will provide services pro bono or at affordable cost and to solicit donations from sponsors to pay for materials.  Sweat equity will be the basis of the painting and planting and maintenance activities necessary to implement the improvements."
  competition: >-
    There are other organizations conducting similar activities in the community
    but they have focused  on the residential areas not the commercial ones. 
    There is no organization that wants to be an umbrella organization that will
    foster communication and activities between residents, merchants,
    artists/artisans and commercial property owners as we do.  We will also be a
    clearing house using our website, Facebook, flyers, newsletters and news
    media as a source of information and resources for those wishing to engage
    in the improvement activities.  We will also acknowledge and give kudos to
    those who successfully implement projects on our site, through print media
    and possibly signage at the improvement location.
  cost: >-
    We are projecting a budget of $100,000 for the initial year, which will be
    seed money to get the project up and running by building out the website,
    providing funding for materials as specified below.  We will also be
    soliciting sponsors, donations and volunteers to provide additional funding
    and the necessary labor to implement the projects.  Recognition of
    achievements will assist in soliciting additional funds and volunteers.
  budget: "Website design, development and maintenance $15,000\r\nTrees $20,000\r\nLandscaping plants, fertilizer, soil amendments $20,000\r\nStreetscape elements, such as benches, tree surrounds, pavement enhancements, etc. $40,000\r\nPublishing, publicity and media $5,000"

    By empowering current residents and businesses, expanding  the range and 
    types of business, attracting new incubator activities and artistic
    endeavors, the economic prosperity of the area will improve.  Currently,
    residents spend a great portion of their discretionary income in other areas
    of the City due to a lack of local business that serve the resident's
    needs.  By diversification and expansion of the businesses, we will create
    more jobs, more employment and more economic prosperity for residents,
    artists and merchants alike.  We are already one of the most ethnically and
    age diverse communities in the City and this diversity will be a foundation
    stone in making the community one of the most desirable in the City.
