Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  When originally built the 3 boulevards served the needs of the residents in
  what was then the premier neighborhood of the movers and shakers of late 19th
  and early 20th century LA. While many of the historic and diverse homes and
  apartments in the neighborhood are being lovingly restored, the same cannot be
  said for the commercial enterprises on these key boulevards. We want to
  revitalize the commercial nature of the boulevards by attracting new types of
  businesses to better serve the needs of the residents. We want to create a
  neighborhood-serving commercial zone that is pedestrian friendly and easily
  accessible to local residents in one of the most diverse and dynamic
  communities in Los Angeles.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  The project is going to be a grass roots effort of volunteers and stakeholders
  who are residents, business operators and property owners in the neighborhood.
  It will be a collaboration of residents, artists, merchants and owners who
  share a common vision of an improved and better neighborhood. It will be a
  bottom up effort to get individuals to take action to improve their properties
  and to own the improvements. It will rely on sweat equity and donations to
  plant trees, renovate or install street landscaping, paint buildings and
  beautify signage to provide an esthetically pleasing environment that serves
  the needs of the adjacent residents.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The current businesses do not reflect the diversity of the current residents
  and serve only a narrow spectrum of the population. There is ample space
  available to provide incubator space at affordable rents and to broaden the
  offering of services, provide creative spaces for artists and vary the types
  of businesses present. This is the critical combination necessary to create
  dynamic and attractive city environments as described by Jane Jacobs in her
  landmark book "The life and death of great American cities". The objective is
  not to "gentrify" the neighborhood by displacing current residents and
  merchants but to enhance what is already here by using vacant or underutilized
  commercial space and vacant properties to expand services and the types of
  economic activities and employment opportunities currently available in order
  to reflect the diversity of the residents to its fullest extent.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  The residents, both current and future, will benefit from the greater
  diversity and beauty of these key corridors that are adjacent to downtown LA
  and serve as connectors to the West Side. It will enhance and expand
  revitalization efforts occurring in downtown, South Park and La Brea Ave.
  Greater presence of people and foot traffic also enhances safety and the sense
  of community of the residents. The City of LA will benefit as the volunteers
  will perform many of the services the City can no longer afford to provide at
  adequate service levels and will result in a better tax base for the City as
  well. It will also provide more employment opportunities for residents and
  greater incomes for the merchants. We also expect to enhance the cultural
  offerings of the neighborhood with the attraction of additional artists and
  artisans to the neighborhood.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  There are a number of organizations and individuals currently active in the
  types of endeavors we intend to foster as a grassroots incubator and provider
  of information, talent and support for the improvement efforts. The West Adams
  Heritage Association has been active in the area for 30+ years, we have a very
  strong neighborhood council presence in the community and many individuals are
  already sponsoring and/or paying out of their own pocket for key preservation,
  restoration and revitalization activities. The idea of our organization is to
  bring all of these groups together who have until now not acted in concert. In
  particular there has not been a conscious and organized effort to reach out to
  merchants and the owners of the properties. Most revitalization and
  restoration efforts have focused on the residential aspects of the
  neighborhood and have not forged the critical link to the business community
  and commercial property owners, both groups whom we intend to integrate into
  these projects. As a grassroots effort, we intend to rely on the sweat equity
  of those in the community. This is to be a bottoms-up effort that will gain
  momentum from actions taken by others that will inspire new efforts by others.
  We want the participants to "own" the improvements and to inspire others to do
  their small part that will make an enormous contribution to the community.

    By empowering current residents and businesses, expanding  the range and 
    types of business, attracting new incubator activities and artistic
    endeavors, the economic prosperity of the area will improve.  Currently,
    residents spend a great portion of their discretionary income in other areas
    of the City due to a lack of local business that serve the resident's
    needs.  By diversification and expansion of the businesses, we will create
    more jobs, more employment and more economic prosperity for residents,
    artists and merchants alike.  We are already one of the most ethnically and
    age diverse communities in the City and this diversity will be a foundation
    stone in making the community one of the most desirable in the City.

    1) More street trees planted and enhanced landscaping, 2) buildings
    painted/spruced up to enhance visual appeal and 3) increase in the number of
    merchants, artists and incubator spaces locating in the community.  We will
    use our site to acknowledge the efforts of individuals in these areas and to
    give them kudos for their efforts.  We will visually document progress with
    before and after photos and/or videos.
  two_lessons: "1) Top-down efforts have not worked.  If the ideas and efforts do not percolate from the bottom up they will not get any traction.\r\n2) Reform/revitalization by committee does not work.  Individuals will take on these improvements and \"own\" them.  What we want to inspire are activities that are small scale, manageable and that do not require permitting and/or lengthy approval  processes."
  achievable_goal: >-
    We have already been canvassing merchants in the community and they have
    expressed enthusiasm and support.  Many have already started improvement
    projects and individual residents have adopted trees, parkways and other
    areas, preserving and improving the plantings and enhancing the ambiance of
    the area.  We will intensify and expand these activities. 
  major_challenges: "1) There will be a fair number of individuals who will not want to take action initially.  Our strategy is to identify blocks with a critical mass of interested individuals, who will make the improvements and inspire others by the success of their efforts.\r\n2) Cost will be a limiting factor for many.  We intend to disseminate information on where trees can be obtained for free or at low cost, find local nurseries who will sell plants at discounts, artists, landscapers and consultants who will provide services pro bono or at affordable cost and to solicit donations from sponsors to pay for materials.  Sweat equity will be the basis of the painting and planting and maintenance activities necessary to implement the improvements."
  competition: >-
    There are other organizations conducting similar activities in the community
    but they have focused  on the residential areas not the commercial ones. 
    There is no organization that wants to be an umbrella organization that will
    foster communication and activities between residents, merchants,
    artists/artisans and commercial property owners as we do.  We will also be a
    clearing house using our website, Facebook, flyers, newsletters and news
    media as a source of information and resources for those wishing to engage
    in the improvement activities.  We will also acknowledge and give kudos to
    those who successfully implement projects on our site, through print media
    and possibly signage at the improvement location.
  cost: >-
    We are projecting a budget of $100,000 for the initial year, which will be
    seed money to get the project up and running by building out the website,
    providing funding for materials as specified below.  We will also be
    soliciting sponsors, donations and volunteers to provide additional funding
    and the necessary labor to implement the projects.  Recognition of
    achievements will assist in soliciting additional funds and volunteers.
  budget: "Website design, development and maintenance $15,000\r\nTrees $20,000\r\nLandscaping plants, fertilizer, soil amendments $20,000\r\nStreetscape elements, such as benches, tree surrounds, pavement enhancements, etc. $40,000\r\nPublishing, publicity and media $5,000"

      By empowering current residents and businesses, expanding  the range and 
      types of business, attracting new incubator activities and artistic
      endeavors, the economic prosperity of the area will improve.  Currently,
      residents spend a great portion of their discretionary income in other
      areas of the City due to a lack of local business that serve the
      resident's needs.  By diversification and expansion of the businesses, we
      will create more jobs, more employment and more economic prosperity for
      residents, artists and merchants alike.  We are already one of the most
      ethnically and age diverse communities in the City and this diversity will
      be a foundation stone in making the community one of the most desirable in
      the City.

      1) More street trees planted and enhanced landscaping, 2) buildings
      painted/spruced up to enhance visual appeal and 3) increase in the number
      of merchants, artists and incubator spaces locating in the community.  We
      will use our site to acknowledge the efforts of individuals in these areas
      and to give them kudos for their efforts.  We will visually document
      progress with before and after photos and/or videos.

    answer: "1) Top-down efforts have not worked.  If the ideas and efforts do not percolate from the bottom up they will not get any traction.\r\n2) Reform/revitalization by committee does not work.  Individuals will take on these improvements and \"own\" them.  What we want to inspire are activities that are small scale, manageable and that do not require permitting and/or lengthy approval  processes."

      We have already been canvassing merchants in the community and they have
      expressed enthusiasm and support.  Many have already started improvement
      projects and individual residents have adopted trees, parkways and other
      areas, preserving and improving the plantings and enhancing the ambiance
      of the area.  We will intensify and expand these activities.

    answer: "1) There will be a fair number of individuals who will not want to take action initially.  Our strategy is to identify blocks with a critical mass of interested individuals, who will make the improvements and inspire others by the success of their efforts.\r\n2) Cost will be a limiting factor for many.  We intend to disseminate information on where trees can be obtained for free or at low cost, find local nurseries who will sell plants at discounts, artists, landscapers and consultants who will provide services pro bono or at affordable cost and to solicit donations from sponsors to pay for materials.  Sweat equity will be the basis of the painting and planting and maintenance activities necessary to implement the improvements."

      There are other organizations conducting similar activities in the
      community but they have focused  on the residential areas not the
      commercial ones.  There is no organization that wants to be an umbrella
      organization that will foster communication and activities between
      residents, merchants, artists/artisans and commercial property owners as
      we do.  We will also be a clearing house using our website, Facebook,
      flyers, newsletters and news media as a source of information and
      resources for those wishing to engage in the improvement activities.  We
      will also acknowledge and give kudos to those who successfully implement
      projects on our site, through print media and possibly signage at the
      improvement location.
