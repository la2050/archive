Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  When originally built the 3 boulevards served the needs of the residents in
  what was then the premier neighborhood of the movers and shakers of late 19th
  and early 20th century LA. While many of the historic and diverse homes and
  apartments in the neighborhood are being lovingly restored, the same cannot be
  said for the commercial enterprises on these key boulevards. We want to
  revitalize the commercial nature of the boulevards by attracting new types of
  businesses to better serve the needs of the residents. We want to create a
  neighborhood-serving commercial zone that is pedestrian friendly and easily
  accessible to local residents in one of the most diverse and dynamic
  communities in Los Angeles.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  The project is going to be a grass roots effort of volunteers and stakeholders
  who are residents, business operators and property owners in the neighborhood.
  It will be a collaboration of residents, artists, merchants and owners who
  share a common vision of an improved and better neighborhood. It will be a
  bottom up effort to get individuals to take action to improve their properties
  and to own the improvements. It will rely on sweat equity and donations to
  plant trees, renovate or install street landscaping, paint buildings and
  beautify signage to provide an esthetically pleasing environment that serves
  the needs of the adjacent residents.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The current businesses do not reflect the diversity of the current residents
  and serve only a narrow spectrum of the population. There is ample space
  available to provide incubator space at affordable rents and to broaden the
  offering of services, provide creative spaces for artists and vary the types
  of businesses present. This is the critical combination necessary to create
  dynamic and attractive city environments as described by Jane Jacobs in her
  landmark book "The life and death of great American cities". The objective is
  not to "gentrify" the neighborhood by displacing current residents and
  merchants but to enhance what is already here by using vacant or underutilized
  commercial space and vacant properties to expand services and the types of
  economic activities and employment opportunities currently available in order
  to reflect the diversity of the residents to its fullest extent.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  The residents, both current and future, will benefit from the greater
  diversity and beauty of these key corridors that are adjacent to downtown LA
  and serve as connectors to the West Side. It will enhance and expand
  revitalization efforts occurring in downtown, South Park and La Brea Ave.
  Greater presence of people and foot traffic also enhances safety and the sense
  of community of the residents. The City of LA will benefit as the volunteers
  will perform many of the services the City can no longer afford to provide at
  adequate service levels and will result in a better tax base for the City as
  well. It will also provide more employment opportunities for residents and
  greater incomes for the merchants. We also expect to enhance the cultural
  offerings of the neighborhood with the attraction of additional artists and
  artisans to the neighborhood.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  There are a number of organizations and individuals currently active in the
  types of endeavors we intend to foster as a grassroots incubator and provider
  of information, talent and support for the improvement efforts. The West Adams
  Heritage Association has been active in the area for 30+ years, we have a very
  strong neighborhood council presence in the community and many individuals are
  already sponsoring and/or paying out of their own pocket for key preservation,
  restoration and revitalization activities. The idea of our organization is to
  bring all of these groups together who have until now not acted in concert. In
  particular there has not been a conscious and organized effort to reach out to
  merchants and the owners of the properties. Most revitalization and
  restoration efforts have focused on the residential aspects of the
  neighborhood and have not forged the critical link to the business community
  and commercial property owners, both groups whom we intend to integrate into
  these projects. As a grassroots effort, we intend to rely on the sweat equity
  of those in the community. This is to be a bottoms-up effort that will gain
  momentum from actions taken by others that will inspire new efforts by others.
  We want the participants to "own" the improvements and to inspire others to do
  their small part that will make an enormous contribution to the community.
