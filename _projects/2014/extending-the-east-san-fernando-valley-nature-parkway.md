Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  We currently have a feasibility study pending at CSUN, which, once completed,
  would enable us to win private financing that would fund engineering,
  acquisition of rights-of-way, and actual construction. Our team comprises
  designers, engineers, outreach specialists, logistics experts, and former
  terminal managers. We have also engaged in extensive outreach to local and
  national labor unions, environmental organizations, and local citizens groups,
  as well as municipal, state, and federal agencies and organizations. We will
  continue to integrate all possible stakeholders in the region to ensure that
  GRID truly improves life for ordinary citizens as well as government and
  business entities.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Between now and 2050, GRID will inexorably reduce freight truck traffic on
  local and regional roads and freeways, reducing the pollution and congestion
  that afflict communities rich and poor along the 710 corridor in eastern Los
  Angeles County. At the same time, GRID will support increase export/import
  traffic, which will bring more solid middle-class jobs to
  economically-challenged communities.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  *All cities along the 710 corridor, from Long Beach to Santa Fe Springs to
  Pasadena
   *Inland Empire cities where distribution centers and major railyards are sited (eg, Colton, San Bernardino)
   *Residents of 710 corridor cities, who now suffer grave health effects from diesel pollution and intense traffic congestion
   *Working people in a broad area, who will have more access to middle-skill jobs that pay well in warehousing and distribution, as well as the docks and railyards.
   *The Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, who will suffer less truck traffic and will find new developable land in areas no longer needed for container storage
   *Anyone who commutes by car, bus, or bicycle through the 710 corridor, since GRID will take large numbers of heavy trucks off the roads and freeways
   *City, county, and state agencies who will enjoy extended road maintenance intervals as truck traffic is thinned out
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: |-
  Sierra Club (letters of support; confirmed)
   CSUN (feasibility study awaiting funding; confirmed & enthusiastic)
   USC (analysis; unconfirmed)
