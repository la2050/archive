Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Law Soup LA is a web-based resource that provides news and information for
  L.A. County residents and visitors about their legal rights and
  responsibilities, and empowers the public to participate in the democratic
  process. Primarily, it involves a website which contains L.A. County focused
  news stories and blog posts related to law and government; a database of key
  laws that affect L.A. area residents most, and useful information about such
  laws; as well as interactive features. One such feature allows users of the
  site to draft and post a law they believe should be enacted, and others in the
  community can “like” the proposed law and comment on it. Proposed laws are
  ranked by "likes" and those with the most likes are prominently displayed!
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  We have already taken preliminary steps to implement the project, including
  creating a sample of the basic structure of the website and much of the
  content, and developing a detailed plan to complete the initial
  implementation. To fully implement the project, we will hire a web designer, a
  communications/community outreach director, and content editors. We will then
  finish the initial design and content of the website, and begin outreach,
  using social media and print media, as well as local events to create buzz
  about the project. We will continue to add content to the website
  indefinitely.
   
   Towards the goal of promoting access to justice for all, most of the content will be free and will be easily accessible to anyone who can access an internet connection. The content will be written in an accessible and engaging format, in plain language.
   
   To sustain the project beyond September 2015, advertisements will be displayed, and revenue will be collected from companies or organizations that advertise on the site. We may also later establish a subscription-based portion of the site geared towards professionals, which would provide more extensive information for a small fee.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Law Soup LA will help people quickly understand what the law entitles them to
  and what the law expects of them, as well as how they can take action to
  exercise their rights and advocate for an expansion of rights. By providing
  this information in an easily accessible, fun and engaging way, and empowering
  people to take part in proposing and advancing their own ideas about laws for
  their community, the project is likely to have great success in making LA the
  best place to connect, today and in the future.
   
   People want to participate, but often feel it is difficult to do so when they don’t know the basics, especially when it comes to local government which can be opaque and complex, and receives less coverage by the media. Law Soup LA can quickly get people up to speed, and build community discussions based around facts rather than rhetoric, so that discussions are as civil and productive as possible. While online interaction can be very productive and make people feel connected to the community, we know face to face interaction is even better. Law Soup LA will encourage users to take the conversation offline and to show up at community events and neighborhood council meetings to discuss important issues. 
   
   Also, the website will enable people to be creative and take ownership of their society by proposing their own laws. The feedback they will get from the community will certainly be a great learning experience, and the potential support from the community of one’s proposed laws can truly be an exciting and affirming experience. In addition, the interactive facebook page and twitter account, and other social media will all work towards the goal of engaging with people to help them understand their rights and responsibilities, and to feel connected to their community and their government. 
   
   All of this will help make LA the best place to connect today, and will allow this connectivity to expand over the years, as people become more comfortable and confident with their understanding of the laws and legal and political system. Law Soup LA intends to create the conditions that spawn a new way of thinking that is passed down to future generations, so that by 2050 most people in LA County will have the knowledge and confidence to assert their rights and participate in their communities more fully. 
   
   In addition, the project is designed to be dynamic and self-sustaining to endure through 2050 and beyond.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Law Soup LA is designed to benefit all people within L.A. County, and does so
  by making its information about the law and government free and accessible to
  all those who can access an internet connection. However, because lower-income
  and lesser-educated people often have minimal access to justice and have less
  information about their rights, Law Soup LA stands to benefit these groups the
  most.
   
   The project is also designed to benefit society as a whole, so that as people begin to feel more empowered and connected to their community and government, they will be inspired to work to make it a better place. We will continually evaluate the project to ensure that it is indeed benefiting all possible people, and if we find it is not, will make the changes necessary to achieve this goal.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  We are open to working with any and all partners who share our values of
  promoting access to justice and providing accurate, useful legal information
  to the public.
