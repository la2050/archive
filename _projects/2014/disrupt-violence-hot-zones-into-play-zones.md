Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  In L.A.’s gang violence hot zones people are too afraid to play, or ride their
  bikes, or go to the park. But there are unexpected neighborhood heroes that
  disrupt the deadly cycle of violence: former gang members who have had enough.
  When there’s a 3 am shooting, a gang interventionist is there to comfort the
  survivors, control rumors, stop retaliation, broker peace, and connect
  families to much-needed services. Advancement Project’s Urban Peace Academy
  partners with them to effectively disrupt violence through a rigorous training
  program. The Academy also trains other frontline people in hot zones, such as
  social workers, hospital staffers, and therapists – all necessary to change
  the future of gang-involved youth and their families.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Advancement Project’s Urban Peace Academy will train at least 60 gang
  interventionists in cutting-edge violence disruption. There will be seven
  training sessions over 12 months: two 12-week training sessions for
  entry-level gang interventionists; and five one-day intensive workshops
  provided with our partner gang intervention organization, V2K HELPER
  Foundation, for at least 250 professionals who want to build skills in
  engaging gang-involved youth and families. 
   
   Launched in 2008, the Urban Peace Academy focuses on relationship-based gang intervention: using a worker’s “License to Operate”, or street credibility, to intervene in a neighborhood to reduce violence. Interventionists can only serve communities in which they have a License to Operate, and through this project the Urban Peace Academy will develop interventionists from neighborhoods in need across L.A.
   
   The trainings for gang interventionists will focus on a wide array of topics: Mediation & Conflict Resolution; Incident Response; Interaction with Law Enforcement; Victim Services; Experiences with Trauma; Ethnic Dynamics; Hospital- and School-Based Intervention; Gangs, Technology & Social Media; and more.
   
   The training also emphasizes working in collaboration with professionals in other sectors to maximize violence reduction efforts, e.g., community-based organizations, emergency room personnel, mental health providers. The second set of trainings in this project will address these and other stakeholders. Working with our partner, V2K HELPER Foundation, we will recruit and train diverse groups of professionals to understand gangs in L.A., with a strong emphasis on building the skills needed to engage gang-involved youth and their families. Successful disruption of the cycle of violence will require understanding multiple cultures: racial/ethnic, gang, and interfamilial.
   
   For both sets of trainees, the Urban Peace Academy’s teaching methodology blends street-level and practitioner-based knowledge with academic literature. Participants learn about gang intervention conceptually, through hands-on practice, and in relation to their own individual experiences. Our training methods are creative, collaborative, and emphasize equality between teacher and learner, especially important when engaging non-traditional learners such as formerly incarcerated gang members. They range from group discussion, lecture, multi-media presentations, to role play, the Socratic Method, and team-building activities.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The greenest park, newest playground, or highest-quality program can’t make a
  difference in the lives of Angelenos unless they feel safe enough to use them.
  Gang interventionists work in “hot zones” - communities with particularly high
  levels of gang violence, especially as compared to surrounding neighborhoods.
  In a hot zone, even walking to school is a battle. As one youth in Watts
  described in a focus group we conducted: “It’s not even about learning
  anymore. It’s about survival. Just get there and get back home.”
   
   The Urban Peace Academy helps make L.A. the best place to play today by working immediately to reduce and prevent violence, making poor neighborhoods safer so that children can learn, families can thrive, and communities can prosper. As we plan for 2050, Advancement Project knows that when violence is reduced, more and more resources become available, families become stronger over the years due to the efforts of local service providers, and neighborhoods can be revitalized. 
   
   Many communities are isolated because of high levels of violence. After gang interventionists work to establish or restore peace in an area, community-based organizations can provide services – to individuals, as well as their families. The Urban Peace Academy will have trained these professionals how to coordinate with gang interventionists, helping to strengthen youth and their family members, breaking the intergenerational cycle of violence that is present in many gang-entrenched neighborhoods. Breaking that cycle is a step toward bringing crime down, and bringing people out from behind their locked doors to interact with each other and enjoy their community. 
   
   The Urban Peace Academy has worked extensively with the L.A. Mayor’s Office of Gang Reduction & Youth Development (GRYD) to train gang intervention workers in Summer Night Lights, GRYD’s summer violence reduction strategy. It provides evening and late-night family-friendly programming in parks in hot zones during the critical months when much crime is committed by and against youth. The results have been transformative in Summer Night Lights neighborhoods: gang-related crime reduced by over 15%; 35% fewer gang-related homicides. We have also observed that after GRYD launched the program and it became apparent that the parks were safe spaces, more and more service providers joined the effort and provided their programming as part of the strategy, and increasingly, throughout the year as their regular work.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  The Urban Peace Academy will benefit the communities most impacted by violence
  throughout Los Angeles County, as many interventionists grew up and hold a
  License to Operate in these places. In a hot zone community, even walking to
  school is a battle. In our research report, “Community Safety Scorecard: Los
  Angeles”, published in 2011, the least safe ZIP codes in the city generally
  experienced two times the gang related crime as the city as a whole, and
  almost twice the rate of violent crime and child abuse.
   
   We expect that the project would benefit multiple communities in the City of Los Angeles, unincorporated areas of LA County, and cities from San Fernando in the north to Long Beach in the south. Our partner, V2K HELPER Foundation, will leverage its relationship with a mental health services provider that works with gang-involved youth and their families in Torrance, Downtown Los Angeles, Hollywood, Compton, and Carson to recruit professionals to participate in the training to improve their effectiveness in working with these families. Lastly, the Urban Peace Academy has a direct benefit on the gang interventionists and community professionals who successfully complete the training, and learn the role that they can play in ensuring the safety of children and families.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  Advancement Project has confirmed its partnership with V2K HELPER Foundation
  to implement the Urban Peace Academy for the My LA 2050 Grants Challenge. V2K
  HELPER Foundation brings the added benefit of extensive knowledge and
  experience in engaging families of gang-involved youth in high-violence
  communities. Founded in 1999, V2K HELPER Foundation (formerly known as Venice
  2000) is a nonprofit organization originally established to provide gang
  intervention and prevention services. Since that time, the organization has
  come to view “community-intervention” services as a critical need to combat
  gang-related violence, the destruction of our communities, and the loss of our
  young people to the lure of the underground economy. The goal of V2K HELPER
  Foundation is to provide the resources and guidance to help struggling youth
  and community members of all ages make the transition from negative,
  anti-social behavior to positive, value-centered alternatives. 
   
   As instructors and consultants, their staff provide the necessary practical expertise to educate service providers, especially social workers and mental health professionals, about gang intervention to support these vulnerable families. They excel at helping these professionals become more knowledgeable about gang dynamics, and thus, more effective in their service provision. As mentioned previously, they have a relationship with a large mental health services provider in LA County that works with gang-involved youth and their families. V2K HELPER Foundation will use that relationship to recruit participants for the trainings.
   
   Our two organizations have worked together since 2008, essentially since the launch of the Urban Peace Academy, which V2K HELPER leadership helped to start. We regularly partner with them to conduct trainings on gang intervention in communities throughout California; and they support the periodic revision and improvements to the Urban Peace Academy curriculum.
   
   Three factors critical to the success of our proposal collaboration are:
   V2K HELPER Foundation’s demonstrated ability to collaborate
   Our long history of working together
   Both organizations’ shared understanding of the needs of high-violence communities
