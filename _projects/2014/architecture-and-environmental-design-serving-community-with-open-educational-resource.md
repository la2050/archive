What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  The project will provide participants the ability to create and transform the
  built environment, a human right, and connect users and space to create
  sustainable places destined for success and systemic sustainability. This type
  of learning applies Architecture as a social mechanism that stimulates the
  sensory system, affecting intellect and desire to create by means of spatial
  languages and computer technologies. The project provides innovative templates
  to create spaces, objects, and solutions for local needs and motivates the
  untapped talent of visual thinkers in our communities. It provides a nurturing
  environment where learning can happen in the context of doing. It provides
  safe, environmentally sustainable places in which to live, work and play;
  places to learn, worship, meet, govern, shop and eat. Private or public,
  indoors or outdoors, rooms, buildings or complexes this project’s built
  environment will include neighborhoods, towns, suburbs and cities. A key
  impact is, for the first time, more people will participate in the
  transformation and creation of the place they live, work, move, create. The
  Built Environment is the perfect canvas for learning. The study of
  Architecture has been very narrow and prevented people from learning and
  participating in the life cycle of our city, buildings, campuses and
  neighborhoods. Our students will apply the art and the science of creating
  such spaces and products. Basic and universal needs will inspire innovative
  designs and transform needs into evolutionary and participatory reality
  through the life cycle of the building from concept to construction,
  operation, maintenance and assessment. The project will be a parallel and
  collaborative effort to current practices in Architecture. The impact will be
  the inclusion of stronger social concerns and the ability to react to location
  and space. It will create, augment, and connect residents with a sustainable
  environment through more people participating in making and creating the built
  environment.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Higher education, socio-economic leaders and local communities will benefit
  from synergetic thinking and an integrated approach. Learning will transpire
  in the context of doing and purpose. Multiple efforts including National
  Intelligence, local neighborhood first response and Americans with
  Disabilities will benefit by having local models of how to connect higher
  education with their communities. Also benefiting will be all students and
  partners currently participating in our program and the ENCOUNTER Network.
  This new synergetic learning will catalyze our neighborhoods and our higher
  education system. With the new lenses of GIS/BIM and 3D modeling and
  visualizing, the area’s workforce will benefit by facilitation of an
  unprecedented analytical and comprehensive means of looking at human-made
  ecosystems. We will benefit by creating a sustainable workforce that will see
  patterns and relationships never before seen and they will help all sustain on
  the planet. Currently untapped members of the workforce will be helped via a
  butterfly effect to present, document, design, and ideate their contribution
  to the system. to engage, volunteer and participate in decision making. To
  empower our population, we need to help them contribute in meaningfully civic
  process with their own passion and purpose. I believe every person has a
  mission in life and my job is to help them find it and develop it. We need to
  help them present, document, design, and ideate their contribution to the
  system. The ENCOUNTER Network, a seminal founding energy, will propel these
  benefits into the greater population. The ENCOUNTER projects connect multiple
  existing organizations that will bring the project to the next level
  financially, technologically and academically.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  To be clear with time, budget and scope with all our partners will be a key
  factor for success. World Peace One Education and Communities: This
  organization provides UCLA Extension courses to our students to help them go

  articulation agreement with them to take our students and our ENCOUNTER
  project to the next level of implantation with 'World Peace One Peace
  Projects. Los Angeles Worlds Fair: Theme of the Los Angeles World's Fair is
  "The Connected City" collaborating on supporting their goal of pavilion
  design, fair planning and urban design layout, with the possibility of
  engaging the students and our partners. The USC Institute for Genetic Medicine
  Art Gallery: We will continue to work with the Gallery to organize events and
  gallery exhibitions promoting integrated thinking and holistic approaches.
  City Council District 9 is eager to use our student work to prototype a City
  of Tomorrow. The Los Angeles Open Acres organization has a map with more than
  500 open sites that we could transform or virtualize as possible urban
  interventions. Jobcreate: We are working with this local organization that has
  the management skills and training guidelines to take our models and graduated
  interns to implement their goals. Additionally, ENCOUNTER Network such as
  Efrain Miramontes, Ken Wyrick, and others bring Journalism, Design, Computer
  Networking, and other services to the project. Power Of Green: This is a
  program of Five Points in the U.S. consults for countries on Sustainable
  Technology, Green Architecture, and Renewable Energy. Their services and
  knowledge will augment our interns' opportunity for growth and collaboration.
  PV Jobs, the e7 Architecture Studio, and their networks provide an immense
  amount of knowledge that will support virtualization and simulation for this
  project. The GBI Global Business Incubator a non-profit research organization
  “think and do tank” that catalyzes the business development process of
  launching an idea, a business and a community through growing collaborative
  business incubator cluster models that grow companies that create jobs.
