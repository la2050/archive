  impact_learn: >-
    The project will provide participants the ability to create and transform
    the built environment, a human right, and connect users and space to create
    sustainable places destined for success and systemic sustainability. This
    type of learning applies Architecture as a social mechanism that stimulates
    the sensory system, affecting intellect and desire to create by means of
    spatial languages and computer technologies. The project provides innovative
    templates to create spaces, objects, and solutions for local needs and
    motivates the untapped talent of visual thinkers in our communities.  It
    provides a nurturing environment where learning can happen in the context of
    doing. It provides safe, environmentally sustainable places in which to
    live, work and play; places to learn, worship, meet, govern, shop and eat.
    Private or public, indoors or outdoors, rooms, buildings or complexes this
    project’s built environment will include neighborhoods, towns, suburbs and
    cities. A key impact is, for the first time, more people will participate in
    the transformation and creation of the place they live, work, move, create.
    The Built Environment is the perfect canvas for learning. The study of
    Architecture has been very narrow and prevented people from learning and
    participating in the life cycle of our city, buildings, campuses and
    neighborhoods.  Our students will apply the art and the science of creating
    such spaces and products. Basic and universal needs will inspire innovative
    designs and transform needs into evolutionary and participatory reality
    through the life cycle of the building from concept to construction,
    operation, maintenance and assessment. The project will be a parallel and
    collaborative effort to current practices in Architecture. The impact will
    be the inclusion of stronger social concerns and the ability to react to
    location and space. It will create, augment, and connect residents with a
    sustainable environment through more people participating in making and
    creating the built environment.
  who_benefit: >-
    Higher education, socio-economic leaders and local communities will benefit
    from synergetic thinking and an integrated approach. Learning will transpire
    in the context of doing and purpose.  Multiple efforts including National
    Intelligence, local neighborhood first response and Americans with
    Disabilities will benefit by having local models of how to connect higher
    education with their communities. Also benefiting will be all students and
    partners currently participating in our program and the ENCOUNTER Network.
    This new synergetic learning will catalyze our neighborhoods and our higher
    education system. With the new lenses of GIS/BIM and 3D modeling and
    visualizing, the area’s workforce will benefit by facilitation of an
    unprecedented analytical and comprehensive means of looking at human-made
    ecosystems. We will benefit by creating a sustainable workforce that will
    see patterns and relationships never before seen and they will help all
    sustain on the planet. Currently untapped members of the workforce will be
    helped via a butterfly effect to present, document, design, and ideate their
    contribution to the system. to engage, volunteer and participate in decision
    making. To empower our population, we need to help them contribute in
    meaningfully civic process with their own passion and purpose. I believe
    every person has a mission in life and my job is to help them find it and
    develop it. We need to help them present, document, design, and ideate their
    contribution to the system. The ENCOUNTER Network, a seminal founding
    energy, will propel these benefits into the greater population. The
    ENCOUNTER projects connect multiple existing organizations that will bring
    the project to the next level financially, technologically and
    academically. 
  collaboration: >-
    To be clear with time, budget and scope with all our partners will be a key
    factor for success. World Peace One Education and Communities:  This
    organization provides UCLA Extension courses to our students to help them go
    on to higher education with education that matters.  We are developing an
    articulation agreement with them to take our students and our ENCOUNTER
    project to the next level of implantation with 'World Peace One Peace
    Projects. Los Angeles Worlds Fair: Theme of the Los Angeles World's Fair is
    "The Connected City" collaborating on supporting their goal of pavilion
    design, fair planning and urban design layout, with the possibility of
    engaging the students and our partners. The USC Institute for Genetic
    Medicine Art Gallery: We will continue to work with the Gallery to organize
    events and gallery exhibitions promoting integrated thinking and holistic
    approaches.  City Council District 9 is eager to use our student work to
    prototype a City of Tomorrow. The Los Angeles Open Acres organization has a
    map with more than 500 open sites that we could transform or virtualize as
    possible urban interventions. Jobcreate:  We are working with this local
    organization that has the management skills and training guidelines to take
    our models and graduated interns to implement their goals. Additionally,
    ENCOUNTER Network such as Efrain Miramontes, Ken Wyrick, and others bring
    Journalism, Design, Computer Networking, and other services to the project.
    Power Of Green:  This is a program of Five Points in the U.S. consults for
    countries on Sustainable Technology, Green Architecture, and Renewable
    Energy. Their services and knowledge will augment our interns' opportunity
    for growth and collaboration. PV Jobs, the e7 Architecture Studio, and their
    networks provide an immense amount of knowledge that will support
    virtualization and simulation for this project. The GBI Global Business
    Incubator a non-profit research organization “think and do tank” that
    catalyzes the business development process of launching an idea, a business
    and a community through growing collaborative business incubator cluster
    models that grow companies that create jobs. Gregory Wright is working
    students and faculty  to visualize, design, and promote "Sun/ShadeWalls" The
    Black Caucus California Community College will continue helping us outreach
    to people of color to be active participants in the built environment as
    designers, architects, engineers, scientists and leaders.

  achievable_goal: >-
    We have the know-how of the technology and an existing network of partners
    and collaborators who are ready to take action.  We have identified the
    needs of the community and we will have a state-of-the-art laboratory that
    can be used after 2 pm on to 9 pm daily, and all day on Fridays and
    Saturdays. Through a LA2050 LEARN support grant, the Synergy Serving
    Communities will be L.A.'s 'Best Place for Learning' in a very short period
    of time.  LA 2050 LEARN support towards Synergy Serving Communities is a
    culmination that will be explosive; we have the passion, additional
    resources, the community, and a diverse group of students as drivers of
    change.
  major_challenges: >-
    This program will become self-sustaining after the grant, since it will
    generate its own money through the student store.  The biggest challenges
    are to institutionalize the paid internship program and to provide an easily
    accessible and understandable transparent allocation of funds.  The good
    news is that our College and District are moving towards open government and
    transparency in all their procedures, and our new president Larry Franks is
    very supportive of innovative thinking, the local workforce, and improving
    students' lives.
  competition: >-
    I am part of a new National Collision for Architecture Programs in the
    Nation.  Although many applauded my social concern for Architecture and the
    Built Environment, none of them are moving in that direction, instead just
    focusing on transferring to universities.  Los Angeles Trade-Technical
    College has always been about real projects with real experiences.  Our
    mission is different.
  cost: >-
    It will cost more than $100,000, but we already possess a current
    infrastructure in the college and a state-of-the-art technology laboratory. 
    We also have exiting courses and a volunteer team.  The internship program
    will pay only for the students. The student store products and services will
    produce the ability to gain income to continue and grow the program.  We
    have the necessary items, and the program should self-finance its own growth
    after this critical grant support from LA 2050 LEARN.
  budget: "1.- Intern students will be paid $10 per hour.  Although, this is below industry standards, these types of job will open many new job opportunities in a short period of time.\r\nStudent Interns: $45,000\r\n\r\n2.- We count with series of facilitators, community leaders who are experts on synergetic teaching that are ready to jump on board.  These leaders will be paid per project with an outcome. For example, a Leader will have two interns, who will produce a set of drawings and visualization for a given project.  The Leader will be paid $ 1,500 for the final product and students will be paid by the hour, for 40 hours each.  We will break the budget down according to project scope. The total for Leaders will be $25,000.\r\n\r\n3.-3-D Printer and Supplies $20,000.  This is an important component for the innovation of the  products and services that make this project unique.\r\n\r\n4.-Administration $5,000.  The foundation, chair, or administration leader has to fill out many forms and comply with local regulations to make this project successful.\r\n\r\n5.- Materials, supplies, gallery events $5,000.  We plan to have multiple events to celebrate milestones and publish our results. This budget item will facilitate this effort.\r\n"
