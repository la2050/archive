What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  The StreetArt Brokerage Firm will combine the mission and knowledge of The
  Gabba Gallery and Random Act Projects.  The LA Street Art Database, known as
  The StreetArt Brokerage Firm will educate, provide income opportunities and
  when needed serve as an “agency” or “go-between” for artists and local
  businesses. The StreetArt Brokerage firm will spearhead the creation of two
  annual citywide community art events, #EarthdayStreet and #PeaceStreet and
  seek partnerships furthering the reputation of Los Angeles as the epicenter of
  Street Art and Arts Culture worldwide, from NOW and passed 2050.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: "To implement the Street Art Brokerage Firms’ projects, we will create a website and construct the database and continually update, promote and respond to opportunities for the artists.  We will have a simple outreach program, with printed information at local events and conventions to further our cause.  We will seek press coverage for our database, artists and events. We will finalize the locations for #EarthdayStreet2015 and #PeaceStreet2015, organize the participants from artist to vendors, and create downloadable maps and a calendar of events.  The StreetArt Brokerage firm will seek corporate sponsorships and further funding to ensure Los Angeles’ place in art culture worldwide. We will also promote all projects and seek out opportunities and partnerships to further this.\r\n\r\nThe LA Street Art Database, or StreetArt Brokerage Firm will encompass all Los Angeles Street Artists with a page for each and example of their work. Interested parties will be able to contact The StreetArt Brokerage Firm for information, public relations and income opportunities for the artist.  The artist will be able to access opportunities and information to benefit their practice and livelihood, including business and legal advice.\r\n\r\n#EarthdayStreet2015 will be the first of the two annual citywide community art events on April 18th and 19th following in the footsteps of #EarthdayStreet2014. Artist will be creating earth inspired work in public spaces.  The community will be able to enjoy the making of this work via a downloadable map and calendar of events.  Three main locations will be established with all the arts represented in their celebratory earth based creations and a street fair atmosphere with all participants focused on Earth Day.\r\n\r\n#PeaceStreet2015 will be the second citywide community art event on September 19th and 20th celebrating World Peace Day.  This event will be much like #EarthdayStreet, with all the participants focused on their vision and experience of Peace.  \r\n\r\nThe StreetArt Brokerage Firm will also promote Los Angeles Street Art and Art Culture worldwide and will look to partner with projects which further promote Los Angeles as a Street Art and Art Cultural epicenter, such as The Water Tank Project in New York, the national and international participation in #EarthdayStreet2015 and #PeaceStreet2015, as well as  Los Angeles being the main hub of the planned #StreetArtTriangle, and the like.\r\n"
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to CREATE today? In 2050?: >-
  The StreetArt Brokerage firm will help make LA the best place to create today
  and in 2050 by uplifting, inspiring and beautifying Los Angeles.   The
  database will promote Art and Artists as it seeks out and provides
  opportunities and income for artists.  The StreetArt Brokerage Firm will
  provide artists with a portal of information they need for a productive and
  profitable livelihood, including pro bono legal advice and setting up
  licensing deals, making their practice stronger and working in Los Angeles a
  greater joy.  Communities and neighborhoods will be happy with their
  beautification, inspiration and the income generated through the Arts and our
  #EarthdayStreet and #PeaceStreet projects. Our weather in Los Angeles is a
  huge plus for the creation of this public art form known as Street Art, as we
  need not take a winter break.  These are some of the ways our project will
  help make LA the best place to CREATE now, in 2050 and beyond.
Whom will your project benefit?: >-
  The StreetArt Brokerage firm will benefit the Artists in Los Angeles by
  elevating them with a portal of information to make their practice
  profitable.  The SteetArt Brokerage Firm will benefit the Artists by promoting
  them, seeking out and creating opportunities and matching them with potential
  clients.  Artists will benefit by the knowledge they have a group of
  likeminded people in there corner, to seek out information and advice from.
  Manufacturers will benefit by making prints, t-shirts, skateboard decks and a
  myriad of other products for the artists to display and sell, or license their
  work.  Vendors and their manufacturers will continually benefit via licensing
  and sales, with special income opportunities during the #earthdaystreet and
  #peacestreet events.  Communities will benefit from the Street Art as it
  beautifies the neighborhood and gives the inhabitants a sense of ownership and
  place.  Children will benefit from the beautification of their neighborhoods,
  being surrounded by culture and coming face to face with the making of art. 
  Local businesses will benefit as the murals and artwork will bring in more
  customers and tourism.  Los Angeles will benefit as a whole for all the
  reasons listed as well as the income generated via national and international
  tourism which the Arts bring.
How will your project impact the LA2050 “Create” metrics?:
  - Employment in creative industries
  - Arts establishments per capita
  - Concentration of manufacturing activity in LA
  - Federal research grant funding
  - Patents per capita
  - Jobs per capita
  - Minority- and women-owned firms
  - Gini coefficient
  - Number of high-growth startups
  - Venture capital investment
  - >-
    Measures of cultural and global economic influence (“soft power”) (Dream
    Metric)
  - >-
    Recruiting and retention rates at local higher education institutions (Dream
    Metric)
  - >-
    Percentage of graduates from local higher education institutions that remain
    in LA County 5 years after graduating (Dream Metric)
Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.: "By seeking out opportunities and being a portal for those seeking to license, buy or partner with Art at its’ foundation, artist will be able to make a living via three types of income, earned, portfolio and passive.  Our planned events, #EarthdayStreet and #PeaceStreet as well as our continued promotion of Los Angeles as the Street Art and Art Culture capital of the world, will also positively address Employment in creative industries.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen throughout Los Angeles in the last 4 years, Art brings more art and creates community.  Where there is public art, coffee houses, restaurants and stores benefit and often create their own little art galleries within their walls, often beyond.\r\nSeeking opportunities for artists, manufacturers will benefit by making prints, t-shirts, skateboard decks and a myriad of other products for the artists to display and sell, or license their work. Vendors and their manufacturers will continually benefit via licensing and sales, with special income opportunities during projects like #earthdaystreet and #peacestreet events.\r\n\r\nEngaged in and support those of our artists in further funding and partnerships to hold Los Angeles as the epicenter for StreetArt and Art Culture nationwide.\r\n\r\nJobs per capita will be addressed via opportunity outreach, the scheduled #EarthdayStreet and #PeaceStreet events and the aforementioned manufacturing.\r\n\r\nIncome Equality: We create income for artists and negotiate on their behalf with corporations.  We elevate the artists and art form across the board, and have seen how low income neighborhoods will benefit from the art in their community. \r\n \r\nIndividuals will experience public art in places generally neglected, where the rents are low and be inspired to start their business in these neighborhoods, as the community revitalizes.\r\n\r\nWe continue to elevate Los Angeles as the epicenter of Street Art and Art Culture.  International tourism via Street Art is on the rise worldwide.  This will be enhanced by the #EarthdayStreet, #PeaceStreet and #StreetArtTriangle projects as well as the partnerships we will seek to maintain Los Angeles as the place to experience this public art form.\r\n\r\nAs Youth in Los Angeles experience StreetArt as Art of their generation, they look to spend their college years in the epicenter of this Art Form.\r\n\r\nThe uplifting, inspiration and beautification of low income neighborhoods will allow entrepreneurship and good will to flourish, creating opportunity.\r\n\r\n"
Please explain how you will evaluate your project.: "We will measure our success via feedback from artists and community, such as the Certificate of Recognition from City of Los Angeles District 13 Councilmember, Mitch O’Farrell for The Gabba Galleries cultural impact on the community.  \r\nWe will include the Employment in creative industries metrics via the income opportunities we help provide for our artists.  The Concentration of manufacturing activity in LA via the products created and licensed by our artists, will be measured.  Further, the measures of cultural and global economic influence (“soft power”) (Dream Metric) will be measured via the rise in income for the communities where our artists create, and Los Angeles’ rise in international Street Art tourism.  Hit’s on our websites and downloads of maps for our events will be a good indicator as well.\r\n"
What two lessons have informed your solution or project?: >-
  The two lessons that have informed our solution or project have been the
  transformative aspect of Street Art as it relates directly to the community
  where The Gabba Gallery resides and where the #EarthdayStreet2014 took place. 
  As well as the “Cross Country Random Act of Flowers” project Andrea LaHue
  completed, and how it uplifted, inspired, beautified and ultimately
  transformed areas and people across the country.
Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.: >-
  The implementation of our project is an achievable goal in the next twelve
  months, because it has already started.  Our project has been coming into
  fruition over the last 18 months.  We have a loosely constructing database and
  have been operating with these goals in mind through The Gabba Gallery and
  RandomActProjects.org blog.  We have had a successful #earthdaystreet2014
  event and will follow the same structure for #PeaceStreet.  We have garnered
  trust within the business and street art community and will continue to do so.
Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?: >-
  In listing two major barriers or challenges we anticipate, garnering more
  funds and the possibility of more neighborhoods and communities wanting our
  help, then we have the funds to accommodate, come to mind. 
What resources does your project need?:
  - Network/relationship support
  - Money (financial capital)
  - Volunteers/staff (human capital)
  - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
  - 'Infrastructure (building/space/vehicles, etc.)'
  - 'Technical infrastructure (computers, etc.)'
  - Community outreach
