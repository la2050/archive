Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  To implement the Street Art Brokerage Firms’ projects, we will create a
  website and construct the database and continually update, promote and respond
  to opportunities for the artists. We will have a simple outreach program, with
  printed information at local events and conventions to further our cause. We
  will seek press coverage for our database, artists and events. We will
  finalize the locations for #EarthdayStreet2015 and #PeaceStreet2015, organize
  the participants from artist to vendors, and create downloadable maps and a
  calendar of events. The StreetArt Brokerage firm will seek corporate
  sponsorships and further funding to ensure Los Angeles’ place in art culture
  worldwide. We will also promote all projects and seek out opportunities and
  partnerships to further this.
   
   The LA Street Art Database, or StreetArt Brokerage Firm will encompass all Los Angeles Street Artists with a page for each and example of their work. Interested parties will be able to contact The StreetArt Brokerage Firm for information, public relations and income opportunities for the artist. The artist will be able to access opportunities and information to benefit their practice and livelihood, including business and legal advice.
   
   #EarthdayStreet2015 will be the first of the two annual citywide community art events on April 18th and 19th following in the footsteps of #EarthdayStreet2014. Artist will be creating earth inspired work in public spaces. The community will be able to enjoy the making of this work via a downloadable map and calendar of events. Three main locations will be established with all the arts represented in their celebratory earth based creations and a street fair atmosphere with all participants focused on Earth Day.
   
   #PeaceStreet2015 will be the second citywide community art event on September 19th and 20th celebrating World Peace Day. This event will be much like #EarthdayStreet, with all the participants focused on their vision and experience of Peace. 
   
   The StreetArt Brokerage Firm will also promote Los Angeles Street Art and Art Culture worldwide and will look to partner with projects which further promote Los Angeles as a Street Art and Art Cultural epicenter, such as The Water Tank Project in New York, the national and international participation in #EarthdayStreet2015 and #PeaceStreet2015, as well as Los Angeles being the main hub of the planned #StreetArtTriangle, and the like.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  The StreetArt Brokerage firm will help make LA the best place to create today
  and in 2050 by uplifting, inspiring and beautifying Los Angeles. The database
  will promote Art and Artists as it seeks out and provides opportunities and
  income for artists. The StreetArt Brokerage Firm will provide artists with a
  portal of information they need for a productive and profitable livelihood,
  including pro bono legal advice and setting up licensing deals, making their
  practice stronger and working in Los Angeles a greater joy. Communities and
  neighborhoods will be happy with their beautification, inspiration and the
  income generated through the Arts and our #EarthdayStreet and #PeaceStreet
  projects. Our weather in Los Angeles is a huge plus for the creation of this
  public art form known as Street Art, as we need not take a winter break. These
  are some of the ways our project will help make LA the best place to CREATE
  now, in 2050 and beyond.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The StreetArt Brokerage firm will benefit the Artists in Los Angeles by
  elevating them with a portal of information to make their practice profitable.
  The SteetArt Brokerage Firm will benefit the Artists by promoting them,
  seeking out and creating opportunities and matching them with potential
  clients. Artists will benefit by the knowledge they have a group of likeminded
  people in there corner, to seek out information and advice from. Manufacturers
  will benefit by making prints, t-shirts, skateboard decks and a myriad of
  other products for the artists to display and sell, or license their work.
  Vendors and their manufacturers will continually benefit via licensing and
  sales, with special income opportunities during the #earthdaystreet and
  #peacestreet events. Communities will benefit from the Street Art as it
  beautifies the neighborhood and gives the inhabitants a sense of ownership and
  place. Children will benefit from the beautification of their neighborhoods,
  being surrounded by culture and coming face to face with the making of art.
  Local businesses will benefit as the murals and artwork will bring in more
  customers and tourism. Los Angeles will benefit as a whole for all the reasons
  listed as well as the income generated via national and international tourism
  which the Arts bring.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  At its’ core, The StreetArt Brokerage firm is a collaboration between The
  Gabba Gallery and Random Act Projects. This collaborative spirit has been in
  place for over 18 months and is slated to continue indefinitely. We benefit
  from this partnership via shared knowledge, impeccable reputation, a free flow
  of ideas and cooperation with our shared core values. 
   
   The three factors critical to the success of our proposed collaboration are our core values and mission, our shared knowledge and free flow of ideas and our impeccable reputations and integrity as human beings and art and community advocates.
