    The StreetArt Brokerage Firm will combine the mission and knowledge of The
    Gabba Gallery and Random Act Projects.  The LA Street Art Database, known as
    The StreetArt Brokerage Firm will educate, provide income opportunities and
    when needed serve as an “agency” or “go-between” for artists and local
    businesses. The StreetArt Brokerage firm will spearhead the creation of two
    annual citywide community art events, #EarthdayStreet and #PeaceStreet and
    seek partnerships furthering the reputation of Los Angeles as the epicenter
    of Street Art and Arts Culture worldwide, from NOW and passed 2050.
  implement: "To implement the Street Art Brokerage Firms’ projects, we will create a website and construct the database and continually update, promote and respond to opportunities for the artists.  We will have a simple outreach program, with printed information at local events and conventions to further our cause.  We will seek press coverage for our database, artists and events. We will finalize the locations for #EarthdayStreet2015 and #PeaceStreet2015, organize the participants from artist to vendors, and create downloadable maps and a calendar of events.  The StreetArt Brokerage firm will seek corporate sponsorships and further funding to ensure Los Angeles’ place in art culture worldwide. We will also promote all projects and seek out opportunities and partnerships to further this.\r\n\r\nThe LA Street Art Database, or StreetArt Brokerage Firm will encompass all Los Angeles Street Artists with a page for each and example of their work. Interested parties will be able to contact The StreetArt Brokerage Firm for information, public relations and income opportunities for the artist.  The artist will be able to access opportunities and information to benefit their practice and livelihood, including business and legal advice.\r\n\r\n#EarthdayStreet2015 will be the first of the two annual citywide community art events on April 18th and 19th following in the footsteps of #EarthdayStreet2014. Artist will be creating earth inspired work in public spaces.  The community will be able to enjoy the making of this work via a downloadable map and calendar of events.  Three main locations will be established with all the arts represented in their celebratory earth based creations and a street fair atmosphere with all participants focused on Earth Day.\r\n\r\n#PeaceStreet2015 will be the second citywide community art event on September 19th and 20th celebrating World Peace Day.  This event will be much like #EarthdayStreet, with all the participants focused on their vision and experience of Peace.  \r\n\r\nThe StreetArt Brokerage Firm will also promote Los Angeles Street Art and Art Culture worldwide and will look to partner with projects which further promote Los Angeles as a Street Art and Art Cultural epicenter, such as The Water Tank Project in New York, the national and international participation in #EarthdayStreet2015 and #PeaceStreet2015, as well as  Los Angeles being the main hub of the planned #StreetArtTriangle, and the like.\r\n"
  impact_create: >-
    The StreetArt Brokerage firm will help make LA the best place to create
    today and in 2050 by uplifting, inspiring and beautifying Los Angeles.   The
    database will promote Art and Artists as it seeks out and provides
    opportunities and income for artists.  The StreetArt Brokerage Firm will
    provide artists with a portal of information they need for a productive and
    profitable livelihood, including pro bono legal advice and setting up
    licensing deals, making their practice stronger and working in Los Angeles a
    greater joy.  Communities and neighborhoods will be happy with their
    beautification, inspiration and the income generated through the Arts and
    our #EarthdayStreet and #PeaceStreet projects. Our weather in Los Angeles is
    a huge plus for the creation of this public art form known as Street Art, as
    we need not take a winter break.  These are some of the ways our project
    will help make LA the best place to CREATE now, in 2050 and beyond.
  who_benefit: >-
    The StreetArt Brokerage firm will benefit the Artists in Los Angeles by
    elevating them with a portal of information to make their practice
    profitable.  The SteetArt Brokerage Firm will benefit the Artists by
    promoting them, seeking out and creating opportunities and matching them
    with potential clients.  Artists will benefit by the knowledge they have a
    group of likeminded people in there corner, to seek out information and
    advice from. Manufacturers will benefit by making prints, t-shirts,
    skateboard decks and a myriad of other products for the artists to display
    and sell, or license their work.  Vendors and their manufacturers will
    continually benefit via licensing and sales, with special income
    opportunities during the #earthdaystreet and #peacestreet events. 
    Communities will benefit from the Street Art as it beautifies the
    neighborhood and gives the inhabitants a sense of ownership and place. 
    Children will benefit from the beautification of their neighborhoods, being
    surrounded by culture and coming face to face with the making of art.  Local
    businesses will benefit as the murals and artwork will bring in more
    customers and tourism.  Los Angeles will benefit as a whole for all the
    reasons listed as well as the income generated via national and
    international tourism which the Arts bring.
  partners_collaboration: "At its’ core, The StreetArt Brokerage firm is a collaboration between The Gabba Gallery and Random Act Projects.

We benefit from this partnership via shared knowledge, impeccable reputation, a free flow of ideas and cooperation with our shared core values. \r\n\r\nThe three factors critical to the success of our proposed collaboration are our core values and mission, our shared knowledge and free flow of ideas and our impeccable reputations and integrity as human beings and art and community advocates.\r\n"

  evaluate: "We will measure our success via feedback from artists and community, such as the Certificate of Recognition from City of Los Angeles District 13 Councilmember, Mitch O’Farrell for The Gabba Galleries cultural impact on the community.  \r\nWe will include the Employment in creative industries metrics via the income opportunities we help provide for our artists.  The Concentration of manufacturing activity in LA via the products created and licensed by our artists, will be measured.  Further, the measures of cultural and global economic influence (“soft power”) (Dream Metric) will be measured via the rise in income for the communities where our artists create, and Los Angeles’ rise in international Street Art tourism.  Hit’s on our websites and downloads of maps for our events will be a good indicator as well.\r\n"
  two_lessons: >-
    The two lessons that have informed our solution or project have been the
    transformative aspect of Street Art as it relates directly to the community
    where The Gabba Gallery resides and where the #EarthdayStreet2014 took
    place.  As well as the “Cross Country Random Act of Flowers” project Andrea
    LaHue completed, and how it uplifted, inspired, beautified and ultimately
    transformed areas and people across the country.
  achievable_goal: >-
    The implementation of our project is an achievable goal in the next twelve
    months, because it has already started.  Our project has been coming into
    fruition over the last 18 months.  We have a loosely constructing database
    and have been operating with these goals in mind through The Gabba Gallery
    and RandomActProjects.org blog.  We have had a successful
    #earthdaystreet2014 event and will follow the same structure for
    #PeaceStreet.  We have garnered trust within the business and street art
    community and will continue to do so.
  major_challenges: >-
    In listing two major barriers or challenges we anticipate, garnering more
    funds and the possibility of more neighborhoods and communities wanting our
    help, then we have the funds to accommodate, come to mind. 
  competition: >-
    There are no other Los Angeles Street Artist databases that we know of. 
    There is no other #EarthdayStreet or #PeaceStreet event in LA that we know
    of, last year was the first.  There is a photographer database called
    50mmlosangeles.com that is completely different from our planned database,
    although we can learn from them.  There are other websites that seek to
    support the arts, although not from a Street Art or Outsider Art
    perspective.  They mainly address institutional art.  To our knowledge,
    there are no other entities doing anything like what we are doing.
  cost: >-
    The StreetArt Brokerage Firms’ expenses will be ongoing, as we are in it for
    the long haul.  This grant would serves as “startup capital” to create a
    state-of-the-art database, raise awareness, pay fees and the like. 
    Commissions, and licensing deals via the Brokerage firm will help offset the
    administrative costs.  As will as a sliding scale vendor participation fee
    for the #EarthdayStreet2015 and #PeaceStreet2015 events. Creative
    advertising on our downloadable maps and our own #EarthdayStreet2015,
    #PeaceStreet2015 and #StreetArtTriangle products will also help offset
    cost.  Corporations and private donations will come in more strongly as we
    elevate our game with marketing materials, outreach and the like.  These
    combined with more grant writing and funding are some of the ways we will
    offset cost for our project. 
  budget: "Initial 1 year budget  \r\n1 Paid full time Employees 25K a year – 25K\r\nIndependent contractors for projects- 25K\r\nOffice space and supplies:  internet and communication for 1 year 12K-15K\r\nSupplies, licensing, legal, for 2 projects for 1 year –   \r\n(Supplies – Paint / Lifts / graphic design / etc.  Licensing – Art / Images, and Graphic Design) $12-15K\r\nArtist payments and funding $10-20K\r\nIncidentals $5K\r\n"

  impact_metrics: "By seeking out opportunities and being a portal for those seeking to license, buy or partner with Art at its’ foundation, artist will be able to make a living via three types of income, earned, portfolio and passive.  Our planned events, #EarthdayStreet and #PeaceStreet as well as our continued promotion of Los Angeles as the Street Art and Art Culture capital of the world, will also positively address Employment in creative industries.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen throughout Los Angeles in the last 4 years, Art brings more art and creates community.  Where there is public art, coffee houses, restaurants and stores benefit and often create their own little art galleries within their walls, often beyond.\r\nSeeking opportunities for artists, manufacturers will benefit by making prints, t-shirts, skateboard decks and a myriad of other products for the artists to display and sell, or license their work. Vendors and their manufacturers will continually benefit via licensing and sales, with special income opportunities during projects like #earthdaystreet and #peacestreet events.\r\n\r\nEngaged in and support those of our artists in further funding and partnerships to hold Los Angeles as the epicenter for StreetArt and Art Culture nationwide.\r\n\r\nJobs per capita will be addressed via opportunity outreach, the scheduled #EarthdayStreet and #PeaceStreet events and the aforementioned manufacturing.\r\n\r\nIncome Equality: We create income for artists and negotiate on their behalf with corporations.  We elevate the artists and art form across the board, and have seen how low income neighborhoods will benefit from the art in their community. \r\n \r\nIndividuals will experience public art in places generally neglected, where the rents are low and be inspired to start their business in these neighborhoods, as the community revitalizes.\r\n\r\nWe continue to elevate Los Angeles as the epicenter of Street Art and Art Culture.  International tourism via Street Art is on the rise worldwide.  This will be enhanced by the #EarthdayStreet, #PeaceStreet and #StreetArtTriangle projects as well as the partnerships we will seek to maintain Los Angeles as the place to experience this public art form.\r\n\r\nAs Youth in Los Angeles experience StreetArt as Art of their generation, they look to spend their college years in the epicenter of this Art Form.\r\n\r\nThe uplifting, inspiration and beautification of low income neighborhoods will allow entrepreneurship and good will to flourish, creating opportunity.\r\n\r\n"
