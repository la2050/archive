  The Wellbeing Project is a game-changing update to the way a community
  understands its strengths and challenges. The Local Wellbeing Index will
  harness the power of data to drive action. By reflecting a community back to
  itself in a genuine, dynamic, data-driven way, city government will have
  information needed to make better decisions, allow social impact service
  providers to directly address community needs, and empower residents to take
  charge of their own wellbeing. This common platform will make it easier to
  work together to create a city of wellbeing by strengthening community health,
  cohesion, trust, accountability, and connections. Ultimately, we hope this
  collective impact strategy will be open and scalable to other cities.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  1: Define community wellbeing and the Local Wellbeing Index. Under the
  advisement of an international, interdisciplinary panel of experts, the City
  is working with RAND and the New Economics Foundation (nef) to create the
  analytic framework for the Local Wellbeing Index, a new science-based
  measurement tool with real-world use. This framework is directly informed by
  needs expressed by primary end users (City staff). The framework outlines
  specific things we want to know about our community. Grouped into 5 dimensions
  (Community, Place, Learning, Health, and Opportunity), these things will tell
  us who Santa Monica is and how Santa Monica is doing. Through deep listening,
  we will work with Daylight Design to determine how users might engage with the
  data, resulting in wireframes for the platform that will bring the index to
  life online.
   2: Measure community wellbeing. The index will be fed by a blend of administrative and subjective data. Using the framework, indicators will be mapped to data collected by the City and other sources, and from people via a new survey instrument. We will also explore the potential of social media as a viable source of data. RAND researchers will analyze the data and refine as needed, and develop the backend data management system. We will also build out the wireframes for the MVP version of the platform that will visualize the data, give it meaning, and engage users. 
   3: Actively improve community wellbeing. The City project team will work with RAND, nef, and Daylight Design to engage primary end users (City staff) and other user groups (community partners and residents) to identify uses for the index. The goal is to use the index to strengthen community connections, trust, accountability, and cohesion. We anticipate that the index will aid City decision-makers; assist change agents identify and provide services that meet community needs; and empower residents to take charge of improving their own wellbeing and connections with each other. The successful uptake of The Wellbeing Project and sustained use of the index will require building momentum within the community through innovative engagement strategies, including the regularly refreshed and enhanced platform that will bring the index to life online. Ultimately, we envision The Wellbeing Project as being open and scalable to other cities interested in gaining a deeper understanding of their community in order to drive collective impact strategies to improve wellbeing.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Santa Monica is a community facing change. Without a common understanding of
  who the community is and how we connect with one another, fear of change has
  created artificial barriers between people. Local government is uniquely
  positioned to make decisions and provide information that could directly
  facilitate partnerships and improve connections, yet we currently lack the
  information needed to do so. By creating a way to reflect a community back to
  itself in a genuine, data-driven way we believe we can begin to move beyond
  perception and anecdotal information; and that having a better understanding
  of ourselves in relation to our community will surface similarities and common
  concerns that will encourage people to work together to improve connections
  with each other and the world around them. In the short term, The Wellbeing
  Project is a way to recalibrate the conversation from reactive to proactive,
  to focus on collective impact and positive change. By 2050, we hope that The
  Wellbeing Project and the Local Wellbeing Index will have spread to
  communities beyond Santa Monica, creating a network of like-minded cities
  bonded by a similar approach to identifying and addressing community needs.
  Having information needed to promote positive communication, and a platform
  that engages and connects city staff, service providers, and residents, will
  strengthen our community, our collective resilience, and our ability to manage
  change together.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  The Local Wellbeing Index will not be a static report that sits in a drawer.
  It will be a dynamically-refreshed tool with real-world use. While Local
  Wellbeing Index will no doubt have broad application, there are three primary
  end user groups for The Wellbeing Project:
   > City staff (to guide decision-making and resource allocation)
   > Local nonprofit organizations (to help identify needs and guide development of social impact programs) 
   > Community members (to empower people to take charge of improving their own wellbeing)
   The way in which people access, understand, and plug into the Index will be critical to the success of The Wellbeing Project. Central to this will be an engagement platform that brings the Index to life online. The north star vision for this platform includes features that will make data-driven decision making possible; give data meaning; and engage the community. Ensuring the successful uptake of the platform will require outreach strategies that will build awareness and momentum among the primary end user groups. These strategies should go beyond local government’s traditional one-way approach to outreach. By tapping into the local creative and tech sectors for ideas and implementation, outreach for The Wellbeing Project will become a community-driven effort with a broad base of support. While the ways in which end user groups are engaged may vary, they will be based on the same principles of deep listening and do-it-together collective impact.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  City Project Team: This interdepartmental group brings diverse interests and
  expertise to guide the successful implementation and uptake of the project.
  Participants come from the City Managers Office, Community & Cultural
  Services, Information Systems, Santa Monica Public Library, Office of
  Sustainability & the Environment, and Planning & Community Development. In
  addition, staff from all Departments have been actively engaged in the
  project, ensuring that the end result will be representative of the broad
  range of work done by our full service city. This collaborative approach is
  helping us connect the dots between our work through the lends of wellbeing,
  setting us up for effective use of the index once it's ready.
   RAND Corporation & New Economics Foundation: These partners are leading development of the index, including the analytic framework, survey instrument, and backend data management system. As one of the world's leading think tanks, RAND brings a depth of expertise in research, data collection & analysis. Based in the UK, the New Economics Foundation has been working at the epicenter of wellbeing research, measurement & application for decades. Working together, this team has helped the City assemble and convene an international panel of experts to advise on the project. 
   Panel of Experts: This advisory group allows us to tap into the international wellbeing knowledge bank. Panel participants represent a broad range of disciplines, including economics, behavioral science, public health, public policy, sustainability, and technology/data science.
   Daylight Design: This team has been engaged to apply human centered design principles to tease out critical questions, challenges, and opportunities inherent to this project. Through deep listening, research, and synthesis, Daylight helped us create the guiding principles and vision for how and why users would engage with the index. During the user experience visioning process, Daylight's work had a catalytic impact, helping all aspects of the project move from 'what' toward 'how.'
   Bloomberg Philanthropies: The project was conceived of thanks to Bloomberg Philanthropies Mayors Challenge, a contest to ignite innovation in local government. As 1 of 5 winning cities, Santa Monica continues to benefit from guidance and advice of this expert team.

    Local government is uniquely poised to facilitate partnerships and directly
    impact LA2050’s Connect metrics, but we need a starting point. The first
    step in moving the needle on specific metrics is to create a baseline
    understanding of current conditions. From there, we can set goals and work
    together on strategies to achieve those goals. This is what The Wellbeing
    Project is seeking to accomplish. The mission of LA2050 is closely aligned
    with the values built in to The Wellbeing Project, and the Connect metrics
    are already embedded in the analytic framework for the Local Wellbeing
    Index. We will collect data and provide information specific to these
    Connect metrics. With a baseline understanding of community needs, we can
    identify and prioritize collective impact strategies to advance metrics
    related to civic collaboration, volunteerism, government responsiveness and
    accountability, and participation in lifelong learning opportunities and
    meaningful cultural experiences.

    For The Wellbeing Project, success is defined as creating a deep, meaningful
    understanding of community wellbeing that will guide City staff in making
    decisions, help local agents of change create social impact programs and
    partnerships to address community needs, and empower residents to take
    charge of their own wellbeing and strengthen connections between each other.
    While we don’t yet know what the Local Wellbeing Index will reveal about the
    level of wellbeing in our community, we have embarked on an endeavor to move
    the concept of wellbeing into the mainstream. Increased understanding of the
    conditions that contribute to wellbeing of people and desire to take action
    are two aspirational measures of success. The spread of this project to
    other cities interested in using meaningful data about the wellbeing of
    people to inform decisions and collective impact is a longer-term goal. 
    Translation of these aspirational goals into measurable outcomes could
    include the level of engagement with the index, the volume of data received
    from community members, the number of initiatives or decisions based upon
    information provided by the index, and the number of cities that have
    expressed interest in or implemented wellbeing measurement in their
    communities.  It could also include an increase in the number of
    partnerships formed between service providers and program supporters/donors
    to deliver services that address specific needs as identified by the Local
    Wellbeing Index. The ultimate, long-range sign of success would be an uptick
    in specific areas of wellbeing in need of improvement, as indicated by the
    Local Wellbeing Index.
  two_lessons: "The Wellbeing Project was inspired by Santa Monica’s Cradle to Career initiative (SMC2C), which brought the City, community leaders and concerned residents together to better understand how our children are doing and how we work together to support youth and families. SMC2Cs first major output was the Youth Wellbeing Report Card, a multidimensional measure of how Santa Monica youth were doing. This highly informative case study has taught us about wrangling data to fuel community-based social impact initiatives. During ideation for this project, we paid particular attention to the lessons learned through SMC2C, and the Youth Wellbeing Report Card served as a rough prototype for the Local Wellbeing Index. SMC2C also laid important groundwork for this project by establishing lines of information sharing between major institutions like the City, school district, and Santa Monica College. In addition, the 2014 report card update involved piloting an interactive data visualization platform, helping us learn more about working with data to yield meaningful information upon which action can be based. \r\n\r\nWe’ve also learned from our City’s experience advancing sustainability. It wasn’t that long ago when sustainability was a largely unknown, fringe concept. Today, it’s part of our operations and collective consciousness. Moving an aspirational concept like sustainability into the mainstream exactly mirrors a challenge/goal faced by this project. Like SMC2C and this project, the City’s sustainability movement started with creating a data-driven understanding of the community’s performance related to the environment. From data flows action. The sustainability initiative has leveraged grassroots partnerships to advance and promote specific messages and goals. The strong support network formed through this effort exemplifies collective impact. No one person or entity can make sustainability stick. Pushing this work forward has required hard work from many organizations and facilitation by the City.\r\n\r\nThrough these examples, we’ve learned that change doesn’t happen overnight or in a vacuum. It requires meaningful information, regular engagement, the ability to demonstrate progress at regular intervals, and broad community support in order to stick. The Wellbeing Project has also identified ways to assist both initiatives by creating structures that will support centralized data management, automated analysis, and an online engagement platform to connect data with action."
  achievable_goal: "Implementation of The Wellbeing Project is underway. Although this is a big project, we are well-poised to achieve success within 12 months. Specifically, we have: \r\n> Created internal infrastructure needed to support project implementation.\r\n> Engaged key partners to assist us in developing the Local Wellbeing Index. \r\n> Assembled an international panel of advisors.\r\n> Conducted extensive research and synthesized a horizon scan into a whitepaper.\r\n> Completed the index framework and started to map indicators to data sources.\r\n> Developed a build-ready vision for what the index will look like and how users will engage with it. \r\n> Started conversations with primary end users to inform them about the project and identify potential uses for information provided by the index. \r\n> Identified communication and implementation strategies.\r\n> Established social media presence.\r\n> Cultivated relationships with a network of project supporters, both within the community and beyond.\r\n> Created a manageable, phased plan to roll out the index that will allow us to test and refine it, while building momentum within the community.\r\nAdditional documentation illustrating work done to-date, including a video about the project, the whitepaper, and the panel of experts is available on our website. \r\nDuring the next 12 months, we will continue to collect data, analyze it, build the engagement platform, and roll out the index."
  major_challenges: "The Wellbeing Project is seeking to do something that’s never been done before: create a tool using administrative and subjective data to measure community wellbeing; and then use the information to inform city decision-making processes, facilitate partnerships, and empower residents to create change. To-date unforeseen challenges have arisen and we’ve worked around them - that’s the nature of innovating. Advancing innovation within local government has been and will continue to be a challenge. Resources are strained, our current work never stops, and people are used to doing things in a particular way. By engaging with city staff about the project early and often, and establishing an interdepartmental team of project supporters, we have laid significant groundwork to aid us in continuing to move forward. Bringing Daylight Design on board for the user experience visioning process was particularly helpful in this respect. Their human centered design approach and deep listening skills not only cultivated additional project support within the city organization, it also resulted in making the aspirational vision more concrete and tangible. As we move towards building out the wireframes for the online platform, we will have continual opportunities to re-engage with staff to present this clear vision and show progress over time. Public perception, participation, and engagement will be another challenge. Simply communicating about what wellbeing is, what the project is, and its utility has been a challenge. People confuse ‘wellbeing’ with ‘wellness.’ We’ve also uncovered a key tension between individual wellbeing, community wellbeing, and the City’s role or investment in the wellbeing of people. To address these communications challenges, we’ve established guiding principles, which include clearly stating that improving community wellbeing is a do-it-together effort. The City is not the purveyor of wellbeing, but we can present data, facilitate partnerships, convene forums, and engage community members to advance this initiative. Again, the user experience visioning work completed by Daylight Design will help us address this challenge going forward as we build out a highly engaging and intuitive platform that will bring the index to life online. To accompany this, over the next year we will need to identify and implement communications and engagement strategies as we roll out the index. \r\n"
  competition: "A key criteria of the Mayors Challenge was to present a big idea to address a challenge common to cities that had never been done before. While developing and refining our project, we conducted a thorough horizon scan to identify similar projects, and highlight what made our idea unique. As we moved from idea to implementation, we engaged a research team from U.Penn to conduct an additional horizon scan and synthesize it into a whitepaper, entitled, “A City of Wellbeing: The what, why, and how of measuring community wellbeing.” This whitepaper outlines various approaches to wellbeing measurement and application, and is available on our website.\r\nTo summarize findings from both these efforts, wellbeing-esque measurement and public sector application is an emerging field. This work is more advanced in other countries like the UK, and tends to focus on national or regional wellbeing. In the US, there are some initiatives at the community level that are similar to our project, but they tend to focus on happiness or quality of life. Another key difference between our project and similar initiatives is that The Wellbeing Project is being led from within city government. Other initiatives attempting to make this type of change in local government tend to be led by nongovernmental organizations, the challenge of which is getting government to take wellbeing measurement seriously enough to adopt it as a priority for their organization. By coming at it from the other way, we’ve checked off one of the biggest barriers to successful uptake of this type of project. Our Mayor and City leaders have clearly supported The Wellbeing Project as a priority, and support its successful implementation has been added to the official workplan for every City department. "
  cost: "Implementation of The Wellbeing Project is underway, thanks to an award from Bloomberg Philanthropies Mayors Challenge. The core deliverable for the Bloomberg-funded portion of the project is development of the Local Wellbeing Index. This scope also covers some end user engagement activities, development of the backend data management system, and development of the MVP version of the platform that will bring the index to life online. Additional funds and in-kind support for the project are provided by the City of Santa Monica. The City's contribution is primarily supporting project management, administrative support, and small project-related research efforts like the whitepaper and a feasibility study of social media/sentiment analysis.\r\n\r\nTo fully implement the vision for the project and successfully sustain it within the City organization, we need a strategy to build momentum and demand for the project among community members. This could be achieved through direct engagement and communication activities, development of additional engagement tools - either features to be added to the platform or a new data collection tool tied to the index like an app, or a combination. These components are not fully covered within the Bloomberg-funded scope of work. We would work within LA2050's $100,000 budget to identify and implement strategies that would achieve these goals, and continue to provide in-kind City support in terms of staff resources needed to manage LA2050-funded projects. \r\n"
  budget: "Engagement Enhancements: Through the user experience visioning process, Daylight Design developed a full compliment of feature sets for the platform that will bring the index to life online. Prototypes and wireframes for the feature sets have been created, as well as a thorough analysis of the technical feasibility and complexity involved in building out each feature. A software development firm is currently costing out what it would take to build each feature set. It is clear that the current budget will not make it possible to implement all components included in the wireframe. Feature sets will likely need to be prioritized based on cost, complexity, and payoff. The MVP platform release will need to include those features that convey who Santa Monica is and visualize how Santa Monica is doing. Building features that encourage interactivity with the platform, including user-generated content, real-time visualization user input, and the ability for users to create user-generated custom reports will likely not be possible within the current project budget. Additional tools to engage users and harvest new sources of data to feed the index have been proposed (but not fully spec’d), including an app or mobile site that would take the ‘positivity pulse’ of community members and suggest activities or behaviors to address needs of individual users based on their input. Further exploration of more experimental data sources like mining social media or google searches for sentiment analysis to enhance the information presented on the platform is another potential enhancement. These additional engagement tools are not possible within the current project budget. \r\nMomentum Building: Ongoing community demand for the type of information provided through and action generated by The Wellbeing Project will be essential to continued support for the project within the City organization. This could include microgrants to artists for creative engagement campaigns, a speaker series, replication forums with other communities, or more. \r\nIf The Wellbeing Project is awarded an LA2050 prize, we would like to work together with you to identify specific uses for the $100,000 that would best align with the project's engagement needs and goals of the LA2050 initiative."

      The Wellbeing Project is a game-changing update to the way a community
      understands its strengths and challenges. The Local Wellbeing Index will
      harness the power of data to drive action. By reflecting a community back
      to itself in a genuine, dynamic, data-driven way, city government will
      have information needed to make better decisions, allow social impact
      service providers to directly address community needs, and empower
      residents to take charge of their own wellbeing. This common platform will
      make it easier to work together to create a city of wellbeing by
      strengthening community health, cohesion, trust, accountability, and
      connections. Ultimately, we hope this collective impact strategy will be
      open and scalable to other cities.

    answer: "1: Define community wellbeing and the Local Wellbeing Index. Under the advisement of an international, interdisciplinary panel of experts, the City is working with RAND and the New Economics Foundation (nef) to create the analytic framework for the Local Wellbeing Index, a new science-based measurement tool with real-world use. This framework is directly informed by needs expressed by primary end users (City staff). The framework outlines specific things we want to know about our community. Grouped into 5 dimensions (Community, Place, Learning, Health, and Opportunity), these things will tell us who Santa Monica is and how Santa Monica is doing. Through deep listening, we will work with Daylight Design to determine how users might engage with the data, resulting in wireframes for the platform that will bring the index to life online.\r\n2: Measure community wellbeing. The index will be fed by a blend of administrative and subjective data. Using the framework, indicators will be mapped to data collected by the City and other sources, and from people via a new survey instrument. We will also explore the potential of social media as a viable source of data. RAND researchers will analyze the data and refine as needed, and develop the backend data management system. We will also build out the wireframes for the MVP version of the platform that will visualize the data, give it meaning, and engage users. \r\n3: Actively improve community wellbeing. The City project team will work with RAND, nef, and Daylight Design to engage primary end users (City staff) and other user groups (community partners and residents) to identify uses for the index. The goal is to use the index to strengthen community connections, trust, accountability, and cohesion. We anticipate that the index will aid City decision-makers; assist change agents identify and provide services that meet community needs; and empower residents to take charge of improving their own wellbeing and connections with each other. The successful uptake of The Wellbeing Project and sustained use of the index will require building momentum within the community through innovative engagement strategies, including the regularly refreshed and enhanced platform that will bring the index to life online. Ultimately, we envision The Wellbeing Project as being open and scalable to other cities interested in gaining a deeper understanding of their community in order to drive collective impact strategies to improve wellbeing."

      Santa Monica is a community facing change. Without a common understanding
      of who the community is and how we connect with one another, fear of
      change has created artificial barriers between people. Local government is
      uniquely positioned to make decisions and provide information that could
      directly facilitate partnerships and improve connections, yet we currently
      lack the information needed to do so. By creating a way to reflect a
      community back to itself in a genuine, data-driven way we believe we can
      begin to move beyond perception and anecdotal information; and that having
      a better understanding of ourselves in relation to our community will
      surface similarities and common concerns that will encourage people to
      work together to improve connections with each other and the world around
      them. In the short term, The Wellbeing Project is a way to recalibrate the
      conversation from reactive to proactive, to focus on collective impact and
      positive change. By 2050, we hope that The Wellbeing Project and the Local
      Wellbeing Index will have spread to communities beyond Santa Monica,
      creating a network of like-minded cities bonded by a similar approach to
      identifying and addressing community needs. Having information needed to
      promote positive communication, and a platform that engages and connects
      city staff, service providers, and residents, will strengthen our
      community, our collective resilience, and our ability to manage change
      together.

    answer: "The Local Wellbeing Index will not be a static report that sits in a drawer. It will be a dynamically-refreshed tool with real-world use. While Local Wellbeing Index will no doubt have broad application, there are three primary end user groups for The Wellbeing Project:\r\n> City staff (to guide decision-making and resource allocation)\r\n> Local nonprofit organizations (to help identify needs and guide development of social impact programs) \r\n> Community members (to empower people to take charge of improving their own wellbeing)\r\nThe way in which people access, understand, and plug into the Index will be critical to the success of The Wellbeing Project. Central to this will be an engagement platform that brings the Index to life online. The north star vision for this platform includes features that will make data-driven decision making possible; give data meaning; and engage the community. Ensuring the successful uptake of the platform will require outreach strategies that will build awareness and momentum among the primary end user groups. These strategies should go beyond local government’s traditional one-way approach to outreach. By tapping into the local creative and tech sectors for ideas and implementation, outreach for The Wellbeing Project will become a community-driven effort with a broad base of support. While the ways in which end user groups are engaged may vary, they will be based on the same principles of deep listening and do-it-together collective impact."

      Local government is uniquely poised to facilitate partnerships and
      directly impact LA2050’s Connect metrics, but we need a starting point.
      The first step in moving the needle on specific metrics is to create a
      baseline understanding of current conditions. From there, we can set goals
      and work together on strategies to achieve those goals. This is what The
      Wellbeing Project is seeking to accomplish. The mission of LA2050 is
      closely aligned with the values built in to The Wellbeing Project, and the
      Connect metrics are already embedded in the analytic framework for the
      Local Wellbeing Index. We will collect data and provide information
      specific to these Connect metrics. With a baseline understanding of
      community needs, we can identify and prioritize collective impact
      strategies to advance metrics related to civic collaboration,
      volunteerism, government responsiveness and accountability, and
      participation in lifelong learning opportunities and meaningful cultural
      experiences.

      For The Wellbeing Project, success is defined as creating a deep,
      meaningful understanding of community wellbeing that will guide City staff
      in making decisions, help local agents of change create social impact
      programs and partnerships to address community needs, and empower
      residents to take charge of their own wellbeing and strengthen connections
      between each other. While we don’t yet know what the Local Wellbeing Index
      will reveal about the level of wellbeing in our community, we have
      embarked on an endeavor to move the concept of wellbeing into the
      mainstream. Increased understanding of the conditions that contribute to
      wellbeing of people and desire to take action are two aspirational
      measures of success. The spread of this project to other cities interested
      in using meaningful data about the wellbeing of people to inform decisions
      and collective impact is a longer-term goal.  Translation of these
      aspirational goals into measurable outcomes could include the level of
      engagement with the index, the volume of data received from community
      members, the number of initiatives or decisions based upon information
      provided by the index, and the number of cities that have expressed
      interest in or implemented wellbeing measurement in their communities.  It
      could also include an increase in the number of partnerships formed
      between service providers and program supporters/donors to deliver
      services that address specific needs as identified by the Local Wellbeing
      Index. The ultimate, long-range sign of success would be an uptick in
      specific areas of wellbeing in need of improvement, as indicated by the
      Local Wellbeing Index.

    answer: "The Wellbeing Project was inspired by Santa Monica’s Cradle to Career initiative (SMC2C), which brought the City, community leaders and concerned residents together to better understand how our children are doing and how we work together to support youth and families. SMC2Cs first major output was the Youth Wellbeing Report Card, a multidimensional measure of how Santa Monica youth were doing. This highly informative case study has taught us about wrangling data to fuel community-based social impact initiatives. During ideation for this project, we paid particular attention to the lessons learned through SMC2C, and the Youth Wellbeing Report Card served as a rough prototype for the Local Wellbeing Index. SMC2C also laid important groundwork for this project by establishing lines of information sharing between major institutions like the City, school district, and Santa Monica College. In addition, the 2014 report card update involved piloting an interactive data visualization platform, helping us learn more about working with data to yield meaningful information upon which action can be based. \r\n\r\nWe’ve also learned from our City’s experience advancing sustainability. It wasn’t that long ago when sustainability was a largely unknown, fringe concept. Today, it’s part of our operations and collective consciousness. Moving an aspirational concept like sustainability into the mainstream exactly mirrors a challenge/goal faced by this project. Like SMC2C and this project, the City’s sustainability movement started with creating a data-driven understanding of the community’s performance related to the environment. From data flows action. The sustainability initiative has leveraged grassroots partnerships to advance and promote specific messages and goals. The strong support network formed through this effort exemplifies collective impact. No one person or entity can make sustainability stick. Pushing this work forward has required hard work from many organizations and facilitation by the City.\r\n\r\nThrough these examples, we’ve learned that change doesn’t happen overnight or in a vacuum. It requires meaningful information, regular engagement, the ability to demonstrate progress at regular intervals, and broad community support in order to stick. The Wellbeing Project has also identified ways to assist both initiatives by creating structures that will support centralized data management, automated analysis, and an online engagement platform to connect data with action."

    answer: "The Wellbeing Project is seeking to do something that’s never been done before: create a tool using administrative and subjective data to measure community wellbeing; and then use the information to inform city decision-making processes, facilitate partnerships, and empower residents to create change. To-date unforeseen challenges have arisen and we’ve worked around them - that’s the nature of innovating. Advancing innovation within local government has been and will continue to be a challenge. Resources are strained, our current work never stops, and people are used to doing things in a particular way. By engaging with city staff about the project early and often, and establishing an interdepartmental team of project supporters, we have laid significant groundwork to aid us in continuing to move forward. Bringing Daylight Design on board for the user experience visioning process was particularly helpful in this respect. Their human centered design approach and deep listening skills not only cultivated additional project support within the city organization, it also resulted in making the aspirational vision more concrete and tangible. As we move towards building out the wireframes for the online platform, we will have continual opportunities to re-engage with staff to present this clear vision and show progress over time. Public perception, participation, and engagement will be another challenge. Simply communicating about what wellbeing is, what the project is, and its utility has been a challenge. People confuse ‘wellbeing’ with ‘wellness.’ We’ve also uncovered a key tension between individual wellbeing, community wellbeing, and the City’s role or investment in the wellbeing of people. To address these communications challenges, we’ve established guiding principles, which include clearly stating that improving community wellbeing is a do-it-together effort. The City is not the purveyor of wellbeing, but we can present data, facilitate partnerships, convene forums, and engage community members to advance this initiative. Again, the user experience visioning work completed by Daylight Design will help us address this challenge going forward as we build out a highly engaging and intuitive platform that will bring the index to life online. To accompany this, over the next year we will need to identify and implement communications and engagement strategies as we roll out the index. \r\n"

    answer: "A key criteria of the Mayors Challenge was to present a big idea to address a challenge common to cities that had never been done before. While developing and refining our project, we conducted a thorough horizon scan to identify similar projects, and highlight what made our idea unique. As we moved from idea to implementation, we engaged a research team from U.Penn to conduct an additional horizon scan and synthesize it into a whitepaper, entitled, “A City of Wellbeing: The what, why, and how of measuring community wellbeing.” This whitepaper outlines various approaches to wellbeing measurement and application, and is available on our website.\r\nTo summarize findings from both these efforts, wellbeing-esque measurement and public sector application is an emerging field. This work is more advanced in other countries like the UK, and tends to focus on national or regional wellbeing. In the US, there are some initiatives at the community level that are similar to our project, but they tend to focus on happiness or quality of life. Another key difference between our project and similar initiatives is that The Wellbeing Project is being led from within city government. Other initiatives attempting to make this type of change in local government tend to be led by nongovernmental organizations, the challenge of which is getting government to take wellbeing measurement seriously enough to adopt it as a priority for their organization. By coming at it from the other way, we’ve checked off one of the biggest barriers to successful uptake of this type of project. Our Mayor and City leaders have clearly supported The Wellbeing Project as a priority, and support its successful implementation has been added to the official workplan for every City department. "

    answer: "Implementation of The Wellbeing Project is underway, thanks to an award from Bloomberg Philanthropies Mayors Challenge. The core deliverable for the Bloomberg-funded portion of the project is development of the Local Wellbeing Index. This scope also covers some end user engagement activities, development of the backend data management system, and development of the MVP version of the platform that will bring the index to life online. Additional funds and in-kind support for the project are provided by the City of Santa Monica. The City's contribution is primarily supporting project management, administrative support, and small project-related research efforts like the whitepaper and a feasibility study of social media/sentiment analysis.\r\n\r\nTo fully implement the vision for the project and successfully sustain it within the City organization, we need a strategy to build momentum and demand for the project among community members. This could be achieved through direct engagement and communication activities, development of additional engagement tools - either features to be added to the platform or a new data collection tool tied to the index like an app, or a combination. These components are not fully covered within the Bloomberg-funded scope of work. We would work within LA2050's $100,000 budget to identify and implement strategies that would achieve these goals, and continue to provide in-kind City support in terms of staff resources needed to manage LA2050-funded projects. \r\n"

    answer: "Engagement Enhancements: Through the user experience visioning process, Daylight Design developed a full compliment of feature sets for the platform that will bring the index to life online. Prototypes and wireframes for the feature sets have been created, as well as a thorough analysis of the technical feasibility and complexity involved in building out each feature. A software development firm is currently costing out what it would take to build each feature set. It is clear that the current budget will not make it possible to implement all components included in the wireframe. Feature sets will likely need to be prioritized based on cost, complexity, and payoff. The MVP platform release will need to include those features that convey who Santa Monica is and visualize how Santa Monica is doing. Building features that encourage interactivity with the platform, including user-generated content, real-time visualization user input, and the ability for users to create user-generated custom reports will likely not be possible within the current project budget. Additional tools to engage users and harvest new sources of data to feed the index have been proposed (but not fully spec’d), including an app or mobile site that would take the ‘positivity pulse’ of community members and suggest activities or behaviors to address needs of individual users based on their input. Further exploration of more experimental data sources like mining social media or google searches for sentiment analysis to enhance the information presented on the platform is another potential enhancement. These additional engagement tools are not possible within the current project budget. \r\nMomentum Building: Ongoing community demand for the type of information provided through and action generated by The Wellbeing Project will be essential to continued support for the project within the City organization. This could include microgrants to artists for creative engagement campaigns, a speaker series, replication forums with other communities, or more. \r\nIf The Wellbeing Project is awarded an LA2050 prize, we would like to work together with you to identify specific uses for the $100,000 that would best align with the project's engagement needs and goals of the LA2050 initiative."
