  The Wellbeing Project is a game-changing update to the way a community
  understands its strengths and challenges. The Local Wellbeing Index will
  harness the power of data to drive action. By reflecting a community back to
  itself in a genuine, dynamic, data-driven way, city government will have
  information needed to make better decisions, allow social impact service
  providers to directly address community needs, and empower residents to take
  charge of their own wellbeing. This common platform will make it easier to
  work together to create a city of wellbeing by strengthening community health,
  cohesion, trust, accountability, and connections. Ultimately, we hope this
  collective impact strategy will be open and scalable to other cities.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  1: Define community wellbeing and the Local Wellbeing Index. Under the
  advisement of an international, interdisciplinary panel of experts, the City
  is working with RAND and the New Economics Foundation (nef) to create the
  analytic framework for the Local Wellbeing Index, a new science-based
  measurement tool with real-world use. This framework is directly informed by
  needs expressed by primary end users (City staff). The framework outlines
  specific things we want to know about our community. Grouped into 5 dimensions
  (Community, Place, Learning, Health, and Opportunity), these things will tell
  us who Santa Monica is and how Santa Monica is doing. Through deep listening,
  we will work with Daylight Design to determine how users might engage with the
  data, resulting in wireframes for the platform that will bring the index to
  life online.
   2: Measure community wellbeing. The index will be fed by a blend of administrative and subjective data. Using the framework, indicators will be mapped to data collected by the City and other sources, and from people via a new survey instrument. We will also explore the potential of social media as a viable source of data. RAND researchers will analyze the data and refine as needed, and develop the backend data management system. We will also build out the wireframes for the MVP version of the platform that will visualize the data, give it meaning, and engage users. 
   3: Actively improve community wellbeing. The City project team will work with RAND, nef, and Daylight Design to engage primary end users (City staff) and other user groups (community partners and residents) to identify uses for the index. The goal is to use the index to strengthen community connections, trust, accountability, and cohesion. We anticipate that the index will aid City decision-makers; assist change agents identify and provide services that meet community needs; and empower residents to take charge of improving their own wellbeing and connections with each other. The successful uptake of The Wellbeing Project and sustained use of the index will require building momentum within the community through innovative engagement strategies, including the regularly refreshed and enhanced platform that will bring the index to life online. Ultimately, we envision The Wellbeing Project as being open and scalable to other cities interested in gaining a deeper understanding of their community in order to drive collective impact strategies to improve wellbeing.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Santa Monica is a community facing change. Without a common understanding of
  who the community is and how we connect with one another, fear of change has
  created artificial barriers between people. Local government is uniquely
  positioned to make decisions and provide information that could directly
  facilitate partnerships and improve connections, yet we currently lack the
  information needed to do so. By creating a way to reflect a community back to
  itself in a genuine, data-driven way we believe we can begin to move beyond
  perception and anecdotal information; and that having a better understanding
  of ourselves in relation to our community will surface similarities and common
  concerns that will encourage people to work together to improve connections
  with each other and the world around them. In the short term, The Wellbeing
  Project is a way to recalibrate the conversation from reactive to proactive,
  to focus on collective impact and positive change. By 2050, we hope that The
  Wellbeing Project and the Local Wellbeing Index will have spread to
  communities beyond Santa Monica, creating a network of like-minded cities
  bonded by a similar approach to identifying and addressing community needs.
  Having information needed to promote positive communication, and a platform
  that engages and connects city staff, service providers, and residents, will
  strengthen our community, our collective resilience, and our ability to manage
  change together.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  The Local Wellbeing Index will not be a static report that sits in a drawer.
  It will be a dynamically-refreshed tool with real-world use. While Local
  Wellbeing Index will no doubt have broad application, there are three primary
  end user groups for The Wellbeing Project:
   > City staff (to guide decision-making and resource allocation)
   > Local nonprofit organizations (to help identify needs and guide development of social impact programs) 
   > Community members (to empower people to take charge of improving their own wellbeing)
   The way in which people access, understand, and plug into the Index will be critical to the success of The Wellbeing Project. Central to this will be an engagement platform that brings the Index to life online. The north star vision for this platform includes features that will make data-driven decision making possible; give data meaning; and engage the community. Ensuring the successful uptake of the platform will require outreach strategies that will build awareness and momentum among the primary end user groups. These strategies should go beyond local governmentâ€™s traditional one-way approach to outreach. By tapping into the local creative and tech sectors for ideas and implementation, outreach for The Wellbeing Project will become a community-driven effort with a broad base of support. While the ways in which end user groups are engaged may vary, they will be based on the same principles of deep listening and do-it-together collective impact.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  City Project Team: This interdepartmental group brings diverse interests and
  expertise to guide the successful implementation and uptake of the project.
  Participants come from the City Managers Office, Community & Cultural
  Services, Information Systems, Santa Monica Public Library, Office of
  Sustainability & the Environment, and Planning & Community Development. In
  addition, staff from all Departments have been actively engaged in the
  project, ensuring that the end result will be representative of the broad
  range of work done by our full service city. This collaborative approach is
  helping us connect the dots between our work through the lends of wellbeing,
  setting us up for effective use of the index once it's ready.
   RAND Corporation & New Economics Foundation: These partners are leading development of the index, including the analytic framework, survey instrument, and backend data management system. As one of the world's leading think tanks, RAND brings a depth of expertise in research, data collection & analysis. Based in the UK, the New Economics Foundation has been working at the epicenter of wellbeing research, measurement & application for decades. Working together, this team has helped the City assemble and convene an international panel of experts to advise on the project. 
   Panel of Experts: This advisory group allows us to tap into the international wellbeing knowledge bank. Panel participants represent a broad range of disciplines, including economics, behavioral science, public health, public policy, sustainability, and technology/data science.
   Daylight Design: This team has been engaged to apply human centered design principles to tease out critical questions, challenges, and opportunities inherent to this project. Through deep listening, research, and synthesis, Daylight helped us create the guiding principles and vision for how and why users would engage with the index. During the user experience visioning process, Daylight's work had a catalytic impact, helping all aspects of the project move from 'what' toward 'how.'
   Bloomberg Philanthropies: The project was conceived of thanks to Bloomberg Philanthropies Mayors Challenge, a contest to ignite innovation in local government. As 1 of 5 winning cities, Santa Monica continues to benefit from guidance and advice of this expert team.
