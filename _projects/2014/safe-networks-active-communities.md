Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  The Safe Networks/Active Communities (SNAC) project is designed both to
  protect teen dating violence and domestic violence survivors in the community
  from threats in cyberspace and to promote awareness and prevention of domestic
  violence through social media, marketing and community mobilization.
   The goals of this project are to enhance services to those who have experienced domestic violence; and to conduct outreach (in the community and in cyberspace) that results in more informed dialogue regarding the issue of domestic violence among adults and teens; and to inspire a commitment among Long Beach and LA County residents to participate in the prevention of domestic violence through informed activism and leadership opportunities.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Start-up activities call for the design/piloting of the project's cybersafety
  curriculum and the continued enhancement of WSLB's online presence. After the
  curriculum has been evaluated to ensure all issues are addressed and that our
  methodology is responsive to both the unique learning styles of older teens
  and adults, the agency will offer “train the trainer “classes to other area
  shelters and agencies that serve youth and young adults. 
   
   Following these activities, the project will extend to the community offline, seeking to engage as many residents as possible in a special year-long project campaign. 
   
   Partner agencies will offer three large community events designed to strengthen and connect the community in uniting to end DV. Each hosted event will educate and empower participants, many of whom are DV survivors and the families of victims. Each event will include a survivor’s art exhibit and art workshops with a focus on the I Can/We Can hands- a unique socially engaged art project gaining popularity and momentum in LA County. 
   
   Youth Leadership Teams, ages 16-25, and Adult Leadership Teams will be recruited and trained to lead discussions on TDV prevention strategies and healthy relationship practices, as well as receive training on community mobilization techniques. 
   
   This effort will increase community awareness about teen dating violence and domestic violence and increase the commitment among Long Beach (and surrounding cities) residents to participate in the prevention of violence through informed activism. Accordingly, the project takes advocacy to a new level, facilitating systemic change while engaging a diverse (and limitless) number of stakeholders. 
   
   Our work with youth has become progressively comprehensive in recent years. In addition to the programs we offer at our shelter, at our Domestic Violence Resource Center, and in middle and high school classrooms through the Long Beach Unified School District, we continue to cultivate strong collaborative relationship with local youth-serving agencies. Through all corresponding programs and activities, youth leaders have emerged, and we continue to welcome their involvement as we enhance our prevention work both within the organization and out in the community.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Funded, SNAC will inform future dialogue on teen dating violence and domestic
  violence. Collaborators, already aware of the need to address intimate partner
  violence, will appreciate the knowledge we are guaranteed to gain as we
  develop and implement this special project. Youth and domestic violence
  agencies will benefit from the increasingly substantive leadership in the area
  of community education. 
   
   WSLB engages in consistent strategic planning to maximize opportunities for collaboration and innovation. WSLB’s Executive Director serves on the Steering Committee of the City of Long Beach Violence Prevention Plan (LBVPP), which comprises representatives from law enforcement, local colleges and universities, the faith community, the judicial branch, the Long Beach Unified School District, public departments, hospitals and clinics, a diversity of local social services providers, and the community at large. 
   
   Given the investment that already has taken place toward promoting violence prevention in Long Beach, the community is well-positioned to continue to unite its assets, tap its strengths, and thereby ensure the stability of and support for long-term DV/TDV primary prevention efforts. Tracy M. Colunga, Violence Prevention Coordinator for the City of Long Beach, supports WSLB’s efforts and specifically the actions it would take in addressing Domestic Violence and Teen Dating Violence. The coalition that Ms. Colunga coordinates has demonstrated and documented its commitment to community engagement on this front.
   
   In implementing SNAC, WSLB will be able to draw on the coalition’s resources while taking advantage of the momentum that already has been established. WSLB will relay new knowledge to the coalition’s Steering Committee, thereby maximizing the likelihood of well-coordinated community-wide efforts that reflect best-practice based prevention strategies and practices. 
   
   By building connections through community outreach and presentations and the active recruitment of community leaders, WSLB will have a cadre of enthusiastic and committed SNAC volunteers. Through a series of 3 major events, we have a unique opportunity to respond to the community's "readiness" for community engagement around the issue of partner violence. By including art, drama, social media, and community leadership, we seek to empower and transform individuals and the larger community—as we are all impacted, to some degree, by trauma brought on by DV.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  The project will be implemented in and for the residents of Long Beach and the
  surrounding cities, but given WSLB’s efforts – already underway – to utilize
  social media as part of the agency’s DV/TDV prevention strategy, the project’s
  reach will potentially be much broader geographically. Because the project’s
  focus is on TDV/DV and the development of leadership skills vis-à-vis
  community mobilization, the primary audience will be youth, ages 11-18 and
  adults of all ages. The very nature of community mobilization is to reach and
  inspire all, so while the primary audience appears to be related to domestic
  violence, the project should be viewed as having no audience limitations.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  WSLB’s current DV/TDV primary prevention efforts maximize local resources and
  assets in service to youth. Guiding past and current prevention work has been
  WSLB’s substantive collaboration with the school district, whose
  representatives have helped to coordinate the delivery of TDV presentations by
  WSLB’s Youth Services staff. Since 2006, these presentations at middle and
  high schools have delivered knowledge on TDV while simultaneously introducing
  local youth to WSLB’s position as an advocate. Post-presentation activities,
  in turn, have provided WSLB staff with an opportunity to assess the needs of
  local youth and then bring those assessments to planning sessions with other
  service providers within the community’s continuum of care.
   
   The Safe Long Beach Steering Committee, as well as the City’s Inter-Department Team – which is charged with strengthening collaboration and coordination among City departments that prevent, intervene, or suppress violence – will continue to oversee and assess prevention developments in Long Beach, and those activities will reinforce the linkages made between WSLB’s work, and the broader work conducted through Safe Long Beach. Accordingly, there will be a variety of opportunities for WSLB to share project information with fellow Long Beach stakeholders.
   
   WSLB also has cultivated strong partnerships with many other youth-serving agencies in the community, and presentations through those agencies have helped reach a greater number of youth while facilitating a collaborative approach to addressing violence prevention – and particularly teen dating violence prevention – in Long Beach. 
   
   Through collaborations with program designers, such as A Window Between Worlds, which uses art as a healing tool to empower and transform individuals and communities impacted by violence and trauma, WSLB engages those youth in activities that benefit the community at-large. 
   
   Confirmed partners for this funding opportunity include: A Window Between Worlds and Su Casa. Furthermore, Tracy M. Colunga, Violence Prevention Coordinator for the City of Long Beach, endorses this application and strongly recommends it for funding. 
   
   Required for the success of this endeavor are: funding for the project, continued collaboration between the existing partners and the acquisition of new partners, and a strong coalition of volunteer leaders.
