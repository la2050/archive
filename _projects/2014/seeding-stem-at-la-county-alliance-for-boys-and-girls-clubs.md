Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  The curriculum was created by East Los Angeles College instructors in
  alignment with common core standards for a pilot program which ran from
  February 25 – May 22, 2014 with six LA County Boys and Girls Clubs serving 120
  youth. The curriculum and staff training have been recorded and are ready to
  roll out to all clubs over the course of the 2014-15 school year. Funding will
  supply staff training, equipment and materials for the project-based learning
  projects (participants build a motorized toy car with electric gears, gliders
  that demonstrate the relationship between force and motion, gravity cruisers,
  and fuel cell vehicles). The West San Gabriel Valley Boys and Girls Club, a
  LACABGC member organization, will facilitate the training and tracking of
  program deliverables and participating clubs will be responsible for providing
  staff, space and 11-14 year old members interested in participating in this
  transformative engineering design experience. A STEMFest at the end of the
  twelve week program provides an opportunity for participants to show off their
  projects with peers and community stakeholders throughout the county.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Careers in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) are rapidly on the
  rise. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce by 2018 STEM jobs will have
  increased by 17% over ten years as compared to 9.8% growth for non-STEM jobs.
  In addition, STEM workers tend to earn 26% more than their non-STEM
  counterparts. Despite all of this growth, as a country, we are failing our
  youth in terms of preparation for STEM jobs of the future. The United States
  is ranked 49th in the quality of science and math education and only 16% of
  American high school seniors are proficient in math and interested in a STEM
  career. In order for the United States and specifically Los Angeles to remain
  a global leader there must be a shift to bridge this gap.
   
   Middle School is a vital time for young people. Kids are deciding where they fit in and what excites them. Capturing their interest in STEM at this age (11-14) encourages continued studies STEM courses in high school and college and post graduation career paths.
   
   Additionally, minority young people are at a statistical disadvantage for quality STEM education and are disproportionately represented in the Boys and Girls Clubs of LA County (2012 US Congress Joint Economic Committee report on STEM Education). The opportunity to serve and inspire Boys and Girls Club members through STEM opportunities supports the county’s workforce development needs for the future as well as fulfills the Boys and Girls Club mission to enable all young people, especially those who need us most, to reach their full potential as productive, caring, responsible citizens.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Over 500 youth members of Boys and Girls Clubs in Los Angeles County (see list
  below, 20 members and two facilitating staff per club) will directly benefit
  from participating in Seeding STEM as will the professional staff and
  volunteers trained to facilitate the program. Indirectly, the surrounding
  schools and communities will benefit from engaged kids in the classroom and
  neighborhood inspiring their peers towards STEM fields of study.

How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Confirmed collaborators are East Los Angeles College and the Jaime Escalante
  Math Program which developed the curriculum and the West San Gabriel Valley
  Boys and Girls Club who successfully facilitated the pilot with six
  organizations this spring. Additionally, the Los Angeles County Alliance for
  Boys and Girls Clubs is committed to implementing Seeding STEM for its 26
  member organizations throughout the county as part of its STEM initiative
  (facilitated by lead agency, West San Gabriel Valley Boys and Girls Club). The
  LACABGC has existed for over ten years and has a track record of county wide
  events and initiatives designed to bring together the collective strengths of
  the individual organizations which are independent non-profits with their own
  governing boards (examples include Youth of the Year, Teen Summit and myriad
  program and training opportunities). Three factors critical to the success of
  this collaboration are the commitment of organization leadership in providing
  the space and staffing for the twelve week program, staff commitment to
  training (13 hours), and the facilitation of pre and post perception and
  interest surveys to measure impact.
