    Seeding STEM is a collaborative education program for middle school aged
    Boys and Girls Club members developed by East Los Angeles College and the
    Jamie Escalante Math Program. Over the course of twelve weeks, 36
    instructional hours plus lab time, over 500 11-14 year olds will participate
    in hands-on, project-based common core complementary STEM curriculum
    facilitated by trained Boys and Girls Club staff and STEM coaches from ELAC.
    Participants engage in the Engineering Design Experience, a problem-solving
    process favored by engineers and design teams across the country. LACABGC
    will take this successful pilot program which ran this spring with six clubs
    to all 26 Boys and Girls Club organizations in the county.
  achievable_goal: >-
    Throughout the course of the next academic year, Boys and Girls Clubs
    throughout Los Angeles County will be implementing after-school STEM
    initiatives including Seeding STEM. Because the program is 12 weeks long, it
    can complement and fit into STEM activities in either the fall, winter or
    spring.
  implement: >-
    The curriculum was created by East Los Angeles College instructors in
    alignment with common core standards for a pilot program which ran from
    February 25 – May 22, 2014 with six LA County Boys and Girls Clubs serving
    120 youth. The curriculum and staff training have been recorded and are
    ready to roll out to all clubs over the course of the 2014-15 school year.
    Funding will supply staff training, equipment and materials for the
    project-based learning projects (participants build a  motorized toy car
    with electric gears, gliders that demonstrate the relationship between force
    and motion, gravity cruisers, and fuel cell vehicles). The West San Gabriel
    Valley Boys and Girls Club, a LACABGC member organization, will facilitate
    the training and tracking of program deliverables and participating clubs
    will be responsible for providing staff, space and 11-14 year old members
    interested in participating in this transformative engineering design
    experience. A STEMFest at the end of the twelve week program provides an
    opportunity for participants to show off their projects with peers and
    community stakeholders throughout the county. 
  impact_learn: "Careers in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) are rapidly on the rise.  According to the U.S. Department of Commerce by 2018 STEM jobs will have increased by 17% over ten years as compared to 9.8% growth for non-STEM jobs. In addition, STEM workers tend to earn 26% more than their non-STEM counterparts. Despite all of this growth, as a country, we are failing our youth in terms of preparation for STEM jobs of the future.  The United States is ranked 49th in the quality of science and math education  and only 16% of American high school seniors are proficient in math and interested in a STEM career. In order for the United States and specifically Los Angeles to remain a global leader there must be a shift to bridge this gap.\r\n\r\nMiddle School is a vital time for young people. Kids are deciding where they fit in and what excites them. Capturing their interest in STEM at this age (11-14) encourages continued studies STEM courses in high school and college and post graduation career paths.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, minority young people are at a statistical disadvantage for quality STEM education and are disproportionately represented in the Boys and Girls Clubs of LA County  (2012 US Congress Joint Economic Committee report on STEM Education). The opportunity to serve and inspire Boys and Girls Club members through STEM opportunities supports the county’s workforce development needs for the future as well as fulfills the Boys and Girls Club mission to enable all young people, especially those who need us most, to reach their full potential as productive, caring, responsible citizens."
  who_benefit: "Over 500 youth members of Boys and Girls Clubs in Los Angeles County (see list below, 20 members and two facilitating staff per club) will directly benefit from participating in Seeding STEM as will the professional staff and volunteers trained to facilitate the program. Indirectly, the surrounding schools and communities will benefit from engaged kids in the classroom and neighborhood inspiring their peers towards STEM fields of study.\r\n\r\nAntelope Valley Boys & Girls Club\r\nBoys & Girls Club of Carson\r\nBoys & Girls Club of Hollywood\r\nBoys & Girls Club of Malibu\r\nBoys & Girls Club of Pasadena\r\nBoys & Girls Club of Pomona Valley\r\nBoys & Girls Club of San Fernando Valley\r\nBoys & Girls Club of Venice\r\nBoys & Girls Club of West San Gabriel Valley \r\nBoys & Girls Club of Whittier\r\nBoys & Girls Clubs of Long Beach\r\nBoys & Girls Clubs of Santa Monica\r\nBoys & Girls Clubs of the Foothills\r\nBoys & Girls Clubs of the Los Angeles Harbor\r\nBoys & Girls Clubs of the South Bay\r\nChallengers Boys & Girls Club\r\nEast Los Angeles Boys & Girls Club\r\nEast Valley Boys & Girls Club\r\nFort MacArthur Youth Center\r\nLos Angeles Boys & Girls Club\r\nSalesian Boys & Girls Club of Los Angeles\r\nSanta Clarita Valley Boys & Girls Club\r\nThe Boys & Girls Club of Burbank and Greater East Valley, Inc.\r\nVariety Boys & Girls Club\r\nWatts / Willowbrook Boys & Girls Club\r\nWest Valley Boys & Girls Club\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
  collaboration: "Confirmed collaborators are East Los Angeles College and the Jaime Escalante Math Program which developed the curriculum and the West San Gabriel Valley Boys and Girls Club who successfully facilitated the pilot with six organizations this spring. Additionally, the Los Angeles County Alliance for Boys and Girls Clubs is committed to implementing Seeding STEM for its 26 member organizations throughout the county as part of its STEM initiative (facilitated by lead agency, West San Gabriel Valley Boys and Girls Club). The LACABGC has existed for over ten years and has a track record of county wide events and initiatives   designed to bring together the collective strengths of the individual organizations which are independent non-profits with their own governing boards (examples include Youth of the Year, Teen Summit and myriad program and training opportunities). Three factors critical to the success of this collaboration are the commitment of organization leadership in providing the space and staffing for the twelve week program, staff commitment to training (13 hours), and the facilitation of pre and post perception and interest surveys to measure impact.\r\n\r\nLos Angeles County Alliance for Boys and Girls Clubs:\r\nAntelope Valley Boys & Girls Club\r\nBoys & Girls Club of Carson\r\nBoys & Girls Club of Hollywood\r\nBoys & Girls Club of Malibu\r\nBoys & Girls Club of Pasadena\r\nBoys & Girls Club of Pomona Valley\r\nBoys & Girls Club of San Fernando Valley\r\nBoys & Girls Club of Venice\r\nBoys & Girls Club of West San Gabriel Valley \r\nBoys & Girls Club of Whittier\r\nBoys & Girls Clubs of Long Beach\r\nBoys & Girls Clubs of Santa Monica\r\nBoys & Girls Clubs of the Foothills\r\nBoys & Girls Clubs of the Los Angeles Harbor\r\nBoys & Girls Clubs of the South Bay\r\nChallengers Boys & Girls Club\r\nEast Los Angeles Boys & Girls Club\r\nEast Valley Boys & Girls Club\r\nFort MacArthur Youth Center\r\nLos Angeles Boys & Girls Club\r\nSalesian Boys & Girls Club of Los Angeles\r\nSanta Clarita Valley Boys & Girls Club\r\nThe Boys & Girls Club of Burbank and Greater East Valley, Inc.\r\nVariety Boys & Girls Club\r\nWatts / Willowbrook Boys & Girls Club\r\nWest Valley Boys & Girls Club"
  evaluate: >-
    We will measure our success by pre and post survey outcomes for all 
    participants, participation rates of individuals and member organizations
    and facilitator (staff and volunteer) reports on the success of the program.
  two_lessons: "Collaboration is key for greater program impact. Engaging the educational talents and resources of local institutions such as East Los Angeles College and the Jaime Escalante Math Program ensured high quality curriculum serving common core standards.\r\n\r\nWe also learned that staff training and resources are necessary for engaged facilitators and program success. Ample training and coaching inspires confidence in youth development staff and is directly correlated with positive participant experience and outcomes."

    Seeding STEM is a collaborative education program for middle school aged
    youth developed by ELAC and the Jaime Escalante Math Program
  major_challenges: "We anticipate there being a potential challenge in identifying space for a STEM lab required for the project (many pilot participants converted computer  labs into \"STEM\" labs). Additionally staff training could be a challenge for organizations with tight personnel structures and budgets. To overcome these challenges, funding for Seeing STEM includes support for lab supplies and staff training expenses such as overtime and transportation).\r\n\r\nBecause this is a collaborative, we can also overcome space challenges by sharing resources (i.e. community partner locations, neighboring participating organizations, etc.)."

  impact_metrics: "The pre and post program survey measures changes in participant confidence in STEM subjects after successful completion of the 12 week program. Seeding STEM is designed as an intervention for 11-14 year olds to curb STEM apathy in high school and increase kids'  interest in STEM career paths. During the pilot program which ran in Spring 2014, participants showed a 35-50% improvement in their perceptions and performance self-evaluations of STEM subjects as well as a collective improvement in their plans to use STEM in their future careers from 49-67%.\r\n\r\nIndirectly, we hypothesize that increased academic confidence will lead to greater academic performance in API measures as program curriculum is designed in alignment with common core standards."
