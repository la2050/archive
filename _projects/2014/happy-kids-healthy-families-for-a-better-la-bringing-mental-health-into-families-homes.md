    WIN is an ongoing project, and since launching in 2006, WIN has annually met
    and/or exceeded its goals. WIN’s highly trained, bilingual therapy staff, as
    well as partner agency case managers trained by WIN, work in-home with
    families identified by our partner agencies using a combination of: 1)
    child-parent dyadic therapy, 2) adult individual therapy for parents, and/or
    3) intensive, in-home, cross-agency case management for basic needs, to meet
    clinical and life goals established by families to ensure that their
    children are able to thrive in safe, nurturing homes.  WIN will use its
    deep, collaborative infrastructure to ensure that all partners are working
    together with families to deliver seamless health, mental health, social
    services and early education such that families can make real, substantive
    gains.

    We bring high-quality psychotherapy and integrated basic services into
    families' homes to help parents and children heal from trauma.
  implement: >-
    Through it's therapy and consultation work WIN affects the lives of 1000s of
    individuals yearly, and the core of our program is our intensive clinical
    work: WIN will provide in-home, dyadic child-parent psychotherapy and
    individual therapy for parents along with integrated health, early
    care/education and social services through our referring partner agencies to
    350-400 children, parents and family members annually.  Our bilingual,
    master’s-level therapists will work with young children (prenatal through
    3+) and parents whose relationships have been disrupted by trauma, neglect
    and mental illness to affect substantive, measurable improvement in 1)
    secure attachment, 2) children’s social, emotional and cognitive
    development, and 3) parental stress. While WIN therapists provide these
    direct services, our partner agency case managers ensure that families get
    intensive, cross-agency early care, social services and health clinic
    support before and throughout the therapeutic process, such that unmet basic
    needs don’t interrupt treatment.  We will manage the entire network of
    services in “real time” via WIN’s innovative communications infrastructure
    and web-based data system to make sure families facing substantial
    challenges get what they need, when they need it, without the service
    barriers of an agency working in isolation, and without the “red tape”
    typical of cross-agency collaborations.  Along with these services, WIN will
    help families build relationships and social networks though our monthly
    Family Night gatherings.  And, in order to positively affect the lives of
    children and families beyond the geographic reach of our direct services, we
    will also provide professional-level early childhood mental health training
    to clinicians and providers throughout LA County, and mental health
    consultation to Early Head Start programs and other agencies, including
    Venice Family Clinic, Westside Children’s Center, El Nido Family Center,
    Pediatric Therapy Center and St. Joseph Center.
  impact_live: "Just like adults, infants and toddlers suffer from mental health issues.  But untreated, impacts can be far more pernicious and entrenched, developing into lifetimes of mental and physical illness, behavior and educational problems, with root causes deeply embedded in brain structures and chemistry. Children’s brains are particularly vulnerable to stress and trauma during this critical period from prenatal through three years old, when brain architectures are being formed, but therapy during this window is also more impactful than at other times in the human lifespan.   WIN’s early therapeutic and case management interventions work to prevent long-term, ill effects for children and families, as well as ongoing social costs to educational, medical and legal systems.  \r\n\r\nEarly childhood mental health issues are often caused or exacerbated by parental/caregiver lack of attunement, or abuse or neglect resulting from caregivers’ own depression, unresolved traumas or other mental health issues.  By providing both in-home, child-parent dyadic therapy and individual therapy for parents, as well as critical, integrated basic services including health care, food pantry, employment training, and early intervention for special needs, WIN comprehensively addresses intergenerational mental health issues and unmet basic needs, while re-attuning child-parent relationships, building resilience, and helping families move on from past traumas.\r\n\r\nSince the strongest indicator of the type of relationship a child will have with a parent, is the relationship that parent had with their parents, abuse and neglect have a tendency to move from generation to generation, bringing along with it the cognitive, mental health and physical health issues and societal costs associated with toxic stress (see Harvard University Center on the Developing Child's research : http://developingchild.harvard.edu/key_concepts/toxic_stress_response/).  However, if children are securely attached to parents, their brains are in the best possible position to develop to their full potential--and their children are highly likely to benefit from the same strong, resilient parenting.  The research is clear: if every kid in LA has a happy childhood, LA becomes more creative, more innovative, less violent and a better place for all of us to live, in 2050--and beyond.\r\n\r\n"
  who_benefit: >-
    WIN targets low-income families with children prenatal through three who are
    facing attachment issues across 26 Los Angeles Country zip codes from
    Inglewood to Hollywood, Venice to West LA.  Annually, our intensive clinical
    program serves 350-400 individual children, parents and family members who
    are facing critical challenges (approximately 75-90 families).  All (100%)
    of our clients are from low income families across 26 local zip codes
    including Inglewood and Mar Vista.  Of current WIN clients, 83% are Latino
    (most are recent immigrants from Mexico and Central America who speak
    Spanish or indigenous languages); 2% are multiracial (Asian/African
    American/Latino); 5% are Caucasian; 8% are African American; and 2% have
    other ethnic backgrounds).  We typically work with families for 12-18
    months—and the process is an intensive one.  Our consultation program
    provides 700 hours of direct service to 125-150 staff of 5 agencies in LA to
    affect the lives of 1000s of additional children and families annually. 
  partners_collaboration: "Since 2006, WIN’s network partners have included Venice Family Clinic, Westside Children’s Center and St. Joseph Center.  Respectively, they bring a host of high-quality medical care; early care and early intervention services; and food pantry, housing support and homelessness support to our shared clients.  All of the families who come to WIN are referred from our three partners, and that allows us to ‘nest’ our intensive mental health care within the context of their home-agencies services.   WIN’s partnership relationships are some of the most deeply rooted we’ve encountered, and are critical to our success with families. \r\n\r\nAll WIN families receiving therapy get a home visiting case manager from their home agency, as well as a Master’s level WIN therapist.  Because WIN pays the salaries of partner-agency case managers, our web based  data system rates services on a monthly basis, which helps ensure high quality care.  Because WIN releases its clinical outcomes biannually, our partners know how their families are doing in our care.\r\n\r\nLead clinical staff from each agency and WIN meet to coordinate work at our monthly Program Committee Meetings, and partner agency case managers and supervisors, plus WIN therapists and our clinical director meet weekly for shared case reviews.  WIN trains its partner agency staff with 20-40 hours of multi-disciplinary training each year, plus provides dedicated, weekly mental health consultation to the Early Head Start and/or programmatic staff of each of our partner agencies.\r\n\r\nThanks to WIN’s HIPAA-compliant data system (a system that has become the model for one the state of Connecticut has adopted for its early childhood mental health services), WIN and its partners coordinate care for each family though a jointly prepared on-line service plan that is updated by each agency regularly.  The system reports monthly on how well we’re helping families achieve their goals, and allows staff to communicate in ‘real-time’ regarding family progress—as well as to coordinate care during emergencies.  The system tabulates our biannual outcomes, gathering data input by staff at various levels from all partners, and reminds case managers and therapists when screenings, assessments and releases are due.\r\n"
  evaluate: "Our goals for children and families are based on substantial data demonstrating that children who are securely attached to their parents and caregivers are happier, healthier and do better in school, work and life over the long-term. WIN’s program goals are as follows: 1) children will be securely attached to their parents/caregivers; 2) if children enter with developmental delays, we will see substantial improvement; 3) parents will feel less stress and more competence in their roles as parents; 4) our network will proactively link families to the basic services they need to stabilize and improve their lives such that our therapy can be more effective; 5) and staff throughout the WIN network will be better able to identify, refer and provide services for families who are in need.  We evaluate our work using the following indicators: \r\n1.\tChildren will improve in developmental outcomes: 70% will show improvement in identified areas of concern after one year of WIN therapy, as screened by the Ages and Stages Questionnaire, administered every six months throughout program involvement.   \r\n2.\tChildren will increase in secure attachment behaviors: 70% will show an increase after one year of WIN therapy, as observed and reported by licensed clinicians and/or master’s-level therapists using the PIR-GAS (Parent-Infant Relationship Global Assessment Scale).\r\n3.\tParents will feel less stress and anxiety: 70% of adults demonstrating need will improve after one year of WIN therapy, as screened by the Parenting Stress Index Short Form.\r\n4.\tFamilies will be successfully linked to services in the community: 60% of identified needs will be linked to services, as tracked through the case management needs assessment and case notes from each agency.  \r\n5.\tDirect service staff will be better able to identify, refer and provide services for families: 75% will show increased knowledge and competency, as indicated by pre- and post- questionnaires collected at WIN-sponsored trainings.  \r\nWIN outcomes are calculated biannually by our Clinical Information Systems Manager and our Clinical Director, using data gathered from the WIN Network. Data are collected on an ongoing basis, using our data tracking system, standardized screenings, assessments and interviews. We also ask families to rate our services through anonymous Parent Satisfaction Surveys, given to all client families biannually and upon graduation.\r\n"
  two_lessons: "1.\tJust like adults, infants and toddlers suffer from mental health issues.  But untreated, impacts can be far more pernicious and entrenched, developing into lifetimes of mental and physical illness, behavior and educational problems, with root causes deeply embedded in brain structures and chemistry.   And children who have experienced early childhood trauma and adversity, the primary cause of early mental health issues, are three to fifty times more likely, depending on the severity and types of trauma, to develop severe mental health issues like psychosis, borderline personality disorder and paranoid schizophrenia than the general population—diagnoses that have been linked to recent tragedies around the country.  Children’s brains are particularly vulnerable to stress and trauma during the critical period from prenatal through three years old, when brain architectures are being formed, but therapy during this window is also more impactful than at other times in the human lifespan.   WIN’s early therapeutic and case management interventions work to prevent long-term, ill effects for children and families, as well as ongoing social costs to educational, medical and legal systems.

A Study from the 2007; The Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey. Schizophrenia Bulletin, 2012; National Scientific Council on the Developing Child, 2008)\r\n2.\tIn Los Angeles, there are few mental health services for the uninsured, and for the low-income insured, agencies have long waiting lists, limited services in languages other than English and restricted treatment duration.   Within this landscape, WIN fills an important niche.  We provide critically needed early childhood and infant mental health therapy in areas where so many families with young children are facing multiple challenges.  However, unlike many programs, WIN’s therapy is based on treatment goals, not time-limits.  Our services are provided by bilingual therapists, are free to all low-income families, regardless of insurance or immigration status, and are provided in-home to alleviate transportation barriers and improve outcomes.  \r\n"

    At WIN, we make psychotherapy house calls to kids and parents who are
    dealing with multiple traumas and poverty during the most critical point of
    brain development in the human lifespan.  We coordinate our mental health
    therapy with the food, health care, early intervention and other services of
    our 3 partner agencies so families recover in a “nest” of integrated care. 
    And it works: our kids overcome developmental delays, families have
    measurably stronger relationships, and our parents and less stressed and
    depressed.  Plus, WIN provides over 700 hours of professional consultation
    to agencies throughout LA so they can better help families thrive--and we
    have an ongoing project with Harvard to create better outcomes for kids
    nationwide.   
  major_challenges: "Risks & Limitations: As demonstrated above, WIN is effective at increasing childhood developmental-educational and child-parent attachment outcomes for families that receive a year or more of child-parent psychotherapy.  However, the long-term effectiveness of our work may be limited by the following factors:\r\na.  Parental physical, mental and social issues: Our client parents often face chronic health, mental health, economic and social issues resulting in the insecure attachment with their children that brought them to WIN initially.  Moreover, some parents with severe mental health issues, such as untreated schizophrenia, are beyond WIN’s ability to treat, and may no longer have children in their custody because the State feels that they are incapable of caring for them. \r\nb. Family Transience: Los Angeles is an expensive city in which to live, and many of our client families are marginally employed and inadequately housed, living with friends, relatives or unauthorized communal rental situations with strangers.  Although the collaboration partners are able to help some families find permanent housing, oftentimes families must leave WIN treatment for work, housing or shelter in areas outside our treatment area (e.g. when a family moves to a domestic violence shelter on the Eastside).  In these cases, where WIN and the family have not reached treatment goals, the family remains at risk for each of the childhood mental health issues.\r\nc. Capacity: To be sure, WIN is achieving its initial purpose: we were created to meet the needs of children and families amongst our agency partners who were struggling with the effects of trauma, mental health issues and insecure attachment during their children’s most important window of neurological development.  Our outcomes are good.  We’ve won several national awards and are one of a small group that have been invited to advise Harvard University and others on creating better systems of care for young children.  However, we can serve only a limited number through our clinical work, and touch perhaps a thousand more though our mental health consultation for other agencies.   In no way is this meeting the needs of thousands of LA children whose brain architectures and futures are being adversely affected for the long-term right now.  Hence, our ongoing work with Harvard: it is our goal to work with the researchers and model programs involved with the Frontiers of Innovation initiative to assess & address needs earlier."

    Because WIN integrates its mental heath services with the health, social
    services, food and housing support, and early care and early intervention
    services of its three agency partners, WIN families are connected with a
    medical home and get integrated mental health care (in-home!).  We work to
    ensure families are securely housed, receive food support, and that families
    have the skills and resources they need to shield their kids from abuse and
    neglect.  Because families are deeply connected to WIN and our partners,
    even after goals are met, families can reconnect with WIN at any time if
    they face a crisis, need supplementary resources--or would just like
    reassurance and support as they raise their children.

  This authentic learning experience for license-exempt caregivers will address
  health and wellness topics such as Breastfeeding, Food and Drink, Physical
  Activity, Screen time and Valuable Community Resources. 
   
   The learning experience will:
   • not use a powerpoint to teach the curriculum • utilize a format similar to a “mommy and me” class enabling the caregiver to bring the children to the class • perceived as a fun activity instead of a professional development course or training • have hands on elements making it easier for the caregiver to implement with the children at home • designed for the median education obtained by the caregiver • designed to address multi-cultural barriers to a healthy culture • be in a time-frame that is feasible for this demographic • address the varying ages of children that will attend the class with caregiver, and • be in a setting that is easy to access. 
   
   According to the First 5 LA report “Families, Friends and Neighbors” there are approximately “590,000 children under age 12 [that] receive care in license exempt settings throughout L.A. County.” After speaking with representatives from the Choose Health LA Child Care project, we learned this is a key demographic the project is trying to engage and has found that license-exempt participation is a challenge. 
   
   The challenge is not because these providers “can’t be found.” The challenge is messaging and offering an opportunity to learn about nutrition and physical activity in a format that appeals to the license-exempt child care provider. 
   
   Project Phases:
   
   Phases: 1) establishing working partnerships with LA County Child Care Resource and Referral agencies and local businesses to assist with outreach, 2) Recruiting - RFP for curriculum, seek coaching volunteers and RFP for Train theTrainer, and secure meeting spaces 3) begin creation and distribution of materials via email/sms, snail mail and local businesses, 4) establish class schedule and open registration, 5) securing supplemental materials for classes, 6) creating pre/post evaluations, 7) give 2 "test" classes to invited community members and license-exempt caregivers and assess the feedback - change things if necessary, 8) start classes, 9) ongoing evaluation process.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Addressing the childhood obesity epidemic, a disease which fuels other chronic
  conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease, is an
  essential element to a healthy LA. By addressing the health culture of
  children, we effectively address the health culture of our future, in 2050, as
  the children positively impacted by the education of the caregivers in 2014,
  take with them the healthy habits established for their lifetime.
   
   Our project addresses the LA2050 obesity metric by educating license-exempt caregivers who, if they take home, one element of the training and use it, will be creating a healthier present and future for themselves, their families and the children of LA’s future.
   Another metric addressed is lack of access to parkland for Los Angles County children which then compounds the problem of access to physical activity. Our project will provide physical activity ideas and alternatives to parkland so as another LA2050 grantee works on furnishing LA County with more parks for outside recreation and physical activity, children can get moving now. Children understanding how to get physical in all types of spaces will be better off in their future as LA2050 residents as well.
   
   Our project will effectively reduce childhood obesity through education of child caregivers who don’t typically get information and training materials or adhere to regulations, even the minimal ones that licensing requires.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: |-
  This project will benefit:
   
   License-exempt caregivers by providing them with an educational environment that works for them. They will not only learn about providing a healthy culture for the children in their care but will understand why and how to do it, motivating them to carry out at least one new thing learned in one category at home.
   
   Children by educating their caregivers about breastfeeding, food and drinks, physical activity and screen time who are not typically exposed to informational material or in educational experiences tailored to their needs. Children who are cared for by the providers who attend this authentic training will have a better chance of establishing healthy habits to reduce childhood obesity than those who are in the care of license exempt caregivers who have not had the opportunity to participate in the educational experience.
   
   Also, as caregivers bring their children to the “mommy and me” formatted class, the older children will have an opportunity to learn and ask questions which then gives them an opportunity to be an active participant in the health culture of their caregivers environment as well as take it home with them to share with parents.
   
   Parents, as caregivers extend the education opportunity to them. Providers will be encouraged to engage parents in what they learned as they distribute ready-made information from the class as well as simple discussion with the parents about good nutrition, physical activity and the importance of limited screen time.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  We do not have confirmation but these are the organizations with which we hope
  to engage as collaborators.
   
   Child Care Resource and Referral Agencies
   
   We hope to collaborate with the partners of Choose Health LA Child Care. Choose Health LA Child Care is a program funded by First 5 LA and administered through the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. The Child Care Alliance is coordinating the Choose Health LA Child Care Project due to their long standing relationship with child care providers across the County and expertise in the child care field. We have had conversations about collaboration but could not determine a scope of work that could be committed to prior to submission of the proposal.
   
   In addition to Child Care Alliance of Los Angeles, we would hope to collaborate all LA County Child Care Resource and Referral Agencies as they, too, have relationships with the child care field. The agencies are: Child Care Resource and Referral, Children’s Home Society of California, Connections for Children, Crystal Stairs, Mexican American Opportunity Foundation, Options, Pathways and Pomona Unified School District.
   
   Potentially partnering with these R&R organizations would bring with them:
   • The connections to the license-exempt providers receiving child care subsidies.
   • Expertise regarding the license-exempt child care provider culture
   • Network of potential volunteers to execute elements of the project
   • Access to bilingual materials 
   • Knowledge of what does or does not work with the license-exempt child care providers after implementation of current curriculum
   
   3 factors critical to success of potential collaboration
   • Outreach to license-exempt child care providers
   • Assistance in establishing a network of volunteers
   • Consulting regarding the creation of new curriculum
   
   We also intend to reach out to Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) Sponsors for reaching out to license-exempt providers on their programs or seeking out volunteer coaches.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: ''
