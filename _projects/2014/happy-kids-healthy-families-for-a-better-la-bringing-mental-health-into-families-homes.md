  This authentic learning experience for license-exempt caregivers will address
  health and wellness topics such as Breastfeeding, Food and Drink, Physical
  Activity, Screen time and Valuable Community Resources. 
   
   The learning experience will:
   • not use a powerpoint to teach the curriculum • utilize a format similar to a “mommy and me” class enabling the caregiver to bring the children to the class • perceived as a fun activity instead of a professional development course or training • have hands on elements making it easier for the caregiver to implement with the children at home • designed for the median education obtained by the caregiver • designed to address multi-cultural barriers to a healthy culture • be in a time-frame that is feasible for this demographic • address the varying ages of children that will attend the class with caregiver, and • be in a setting that is easy to access. 
   
   According to the First 5 LA report “Families, Friends and Neighbors” there are approximately “590,000 children under age 12 [that] receive care in license exempt settings throughout L.A. County.” After speaking with representatives from the Choose Health LA Child Care project, we learned this is a key demographic the project is trying to engage and has found that license-exempt participation is a challenge. 
   
   The challenge is not because these providers “can’t be found.” The challenge is messaging and offering an opportunity to learn about nutrition and physical activity in a format that appeals to the license-exempt child care provider. 
   
   Project Phases:
   
   Phases: 1) establishing working partnerships with LA County Child Care Resource and Referral agencies and local businesses to assist with outreach, 2) Recruiting - RFP for curriculum, seek coaching volunteers and RFP for Train theTrainer, and secure meeting spaces 3) begin creation and distribution of materials via email/sms, snail mail and local businesses, 4) establish class schedule and open registration, 5) securing supplemental materials for classes, 6) creating pre/post evaluations, 7) give 2 "test" classes to invited community members and license-exempt caregivers and assess the feedback - change things if necessary, 8) start classes, 9) ongoing evaluation process.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Addressing the childhood obesity epidemic, a disease which fuels other chronic
  conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease, is an
  essential element to a healthy LA. By addressing the health culture of
  children, we effectively address the health culture of our future, in 2050, as
  the children positively impacted by the education of the caregivers in 2014,
  take with them the healthy habits established for their lifetime.
   
   Our project addresses the LA2050 obesity metric by educating license-exempt caregivers who, if they take home, one element of the training and use it, will be creating a healthier present and future for themselves, their families and the children of LA’s future.
   Another metric addressed is lack of access to parkland for Los Angles County children which then compounds the problem of access to physical activity. Our project will provide physical activity ideas and alternatives to parkland so as another LA2050 grantee works on furnishing LA County with more parks for outside recreation and physical activity, children can get moving now. Children understanding how to get physical in all types of spaces will be better off in their future as LA2050 residents as well.
   
   Our project will effectively reduce childhood obesity through education of child caregivers who don’t typically get information and training materials or adhere to regulations, even the minimal ones that licensing requires.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: |-
  This project will benefit:
   
   License-exempt caregivers by providing them with an educational environment that works for them. They will not only learn about providing a healthy culture for the children in their care but will understand why and how to do it, motivating them to carry out at least one new thing learned in one category at home.
   
   Children by educating their caregivers about breastfeeding, food and drinks, physical activity and screen time who are not typically exposed to informational material or in educational experiences tailored to their needs. Children who are cared for by the providers who attend this authentic training will have a better chance of establishing healthy habits to reduce childhood obesity than those who are in the care of license exempt caregivers who have not had the opportunity to participate in the educational experience.
   
   Also, as caregivers bring their children to the “mommy and me” formatted class, the older children will have an opportunity to learn and ask questions which then gives them an opportunity to be an active participant in the health culture of their caregivers environment as well as take it home with them to share with parents.
   
   Parents, as caregivers extend the education opportunity to them. Providers will be encouraged to engage parents in what they learned as they distribute ready-made information from the class as well as simple discussion with the parents about good nutrition, physical activity and the importance of limited screen time.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  We do not have confirmation but these are the organizations with which we hope
  to engage as collaborators.
   
   Child Care Resource and Referral Agencies
   
   We hope to collaborate with the partners of Choose Health LA Child Care. Choose Health LA Child Care is a program funded by First 5 LA and administered through the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. The Child Care Alliance is coordinating the Choose Health LA Child Care Project due to their long standing relationship with child care providers across the County and expertise in the child care field. We have had conversations about collaboration but could not determine a scope of work that could be committed to prior to submission of the proposal.
   
   In addition to Child Care Alliance of Los Angeles, we would hope to collaborate all LA County Child Care Resource and Referral Agencies as they, too, have relationships with the child care field. The agencies are: Child Care Resource and Referral, Children’s Home Society of California, Connections for Children, Crystal Stairs, Mexican American Opportunity Foundation, Options, Pathways and Pomona Unified School District.
   
   Potentially partnering with these R&R organizations would bring with them:
   • The connections to the license-exempt providers receiving child care subsidies.
   • Expertise regarding the license-exempt child care provider culture
   • Network of potential volunteers to execute elements of the project
   • Access to bilingual materials 
   • Knowledge of what does or does not work with the license-exempt child care providers after implementation of current curriculum
   
   3 factors critical to success of potential collaboration
   • Outreach to license-exempt child care providers
   • Assistance in establishing a network of volunteers
   • Consulting regarding the creation of new curriculum
   
   We also intend to reach out to Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) Sponsors for reaching out to license-exempt providers on their programs or seeking out volunteer coaches.
