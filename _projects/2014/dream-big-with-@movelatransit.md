  Game-changing transportation investment is transforming Los Angeles County and
  it’s just the beginning! Transportation is the spine around which cities get
  built and investments in transit, walking and biking can reinvent
  neighborhoods, making our county a more sustainable, healthy and prosperous
  place. Move LA is like the Johnny Appleseed of transit — we are seeding a
  countywide public conversation about what to build next and to find out which
  ideas take root. This conversation couldn’t be more fundamental to LA’s
  future. We ask you to help us fund a digital media campaign that allows us to
  engage more Angelenos and prompt them to contribute meaningfully to this civic
  process. LA is a big place. We need to work together to make it great.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  As the coalition of business, labor and environmental groups instrumental in
  getting the Measure R half-cent sales tax on the ballot in 2008 — the
  game-changing investment in transit referred to above — Move LA has street
  cred in building coalitions and consensus. Every year since Measure R won
  (with 67% of the vote!) our coalition has gathered at an annual
  “transportation conversation” that draws elected officials, agency leaders and
  other influencers as well as ordinary citizens. The 500-plus people who come
  together are champions of more sustainable and affordable transportation and
  housing choices in walkable, bikeable neighborhoods.
   
   We’re implementing an ambitious campaign to keep this conversation going and take it deep into the grassroots with a canvass that’s helping us meet people in neighborhoods. At the grasstops, we’re co-convening cities in partnership with LA County’s five most active councils of government. We’re also taking this conversation on the road to meet with coalition partners and to cultivate new ones. We’ve got a good game at the grasstops, but we need resources for the technology, tools and talent that will allow us to implement a digital platform for even broader grassroots engagement. Social media and the analytics that make these communications tools effective will help us to connect with people who can carry on the conversation with their neighbors. We need these tools to identify people who really care about these issues, and to cultivate local champions who will like us and share our messages on Twitter and Facebook, and spread the word in other ways. 
   
   We are working with NationBuilder — a company we met at an LA 2050 discussion about social connectedness — to integrate our database with our donor base, and with our website, email, social media and supporters recruited by our canvass. We want to hire a digital media strategist who can help us design an integrated social communications plan that works in sync with our grasstops game and helps us orchestrate a campaign that inspires action and motivates engagement. We want to hire a half-time social media manager to help the whole staff implement the plan.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  With transformational transit investments: Southern California has long been
  infamous as a place without a center, growing ever outward into a
  disorganized, disaggregated, diverse region that sprawls over 191 cities and
  38,000 square miles of heavily trafficked roads and single-family
  neighborhoods. The distance between jobs and housing — especially affordable
  housing — has exacerbated not only traffic and air pollution but also a lack
  of social cohesion. We spend so much time driving we barely have time for
  family and friends, and until fairly recently it was unlikely very many
  Angelenos would connect on public transit, in public spaces, or while walking
  or biking down the street. Investment in transit, bike lanes and wider
  sidewalks, however, is changing the tenor of life in our neighborhoods,
  providing a landscape where we can watch the parade of life go by and
  literally bump into each other, providing a sense of shared space and civic
  culture. 
   
   By getting our "mojo" back: The success of Measure R in creating game-changing resources to help solve seemingly intractable problems has inspired elected officials to work together to make Los Angeles a better place. This belief that we can work together and make a real difference is what we call "mojo," and LA’s got its mojo back! We want many more Angelenos to hear and be inspired by this story. Elected officials have begun talking about the possibility of another sales tax on the 2016 ballot and we want many more Angelenos to be involved in these discussions: What should be funded? More light rail? BRT? Grand Boulevards? Shared-use mobility hubs? Places to walk and bike? Complete streets? Green streets? All of the above? 
   
   Making the dream a reality is a decades-long process that involves a multitude of decisions, many of which are very, very local. We are constructing 100 rail stations and a dozen new transit lines through many neighborhoods. We need to talk about how to do this. How should we connect neighborhoods with stations? What about the gentrification that can occur in neighborhoods once transit provides fast and easy access to jobs, shops, culture and entertainment? Will people who use transit the most still be able to live near it? How big and dense should new development be? How can we preserve single-family neighborhoods? 
   
   By working together on these issues we can ensure that LA becomes a much better place to connect.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Connecting the people of Los Angeles County around a sustainable
  transportation and neighborhood agenda will benefit everyone — because we all
  sit in the same traffic, breathe the same air, and feel the impact of global
  warming. Sustainable transportation and development can reduce all this
  negative fallout even as the population grows — meantime increasing access to
  opportunity in terms of jobs, education, fresh food, health care,
  entertainment, culture, parks and recreation, our friends and neighbors.
  Moreover, the zero- and near-zero emission technologies we are promoting will
  allow us to move freight to and from the ports without having to sentence
  those who live along our heavily trafficked goods movement corridors to
  intolerably high rates of asthma and other chronic illness.
   
   Not everyone needs to live in a walkable transit-oriented neighborhood — cars (privately owned or shared) will likely be a part of the LA landscape for decades to come. But providing more transportation and housing choices is essential for an increasingly diverse population that includes aging baby boomers, a millennial generation saddled with student debt and that can’t afford to own cars, and the rapidly increasing cohort of single-person households. Moreover, making it possible for more people of all ages and incomes to live in places where they don’t need to drive as much or own as many cars can will also help increase disposable income. People who can get by with one less car save about $10,000/year, according to the American Automobile Association, enabling them to save up for college or a down payment on a home. And for people who can’t afford a car, a robust transit system and the ability to get to stops and stations on foot or on bike offers both more affordable mobility and better access to opportunity. 
   
   The construction and operation of an expanded transportation system also creates good union jobs with good wages. LA Metro’s project labor agreements and construction careers program ensures that a share of all construction jobs will go to people who are struggling to make a living in LA’s low-income communities. Moreover, in addition to careers in construction and operation, additional jobs are created in the professional, scientific and technical services sector, and in retail — providing a boost to the regional and local economies and to local businesses countywide.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  NationBuilder and a digital media strategist are the partners we believe are
  essential to making this larger outreach and engagement effort as robust as
  possible -- we have signed a contract with NationBuilder and are interviewing
  strategists now. Our goal is to use a digital media platform to leverage all
  our partnerships in order to collaborate with as many people as possible. Move
  LA began as a coalition of business, labor and environmental interests working
  in collaboration with government agencies and elected officials, and the
  coalition has continued to expand to include: faith-based organizations,
  public health advocates, bike and pedestrian activists, tenants rights
  activists, academics, affordable housers, design professionals, architects,
  developers, student organizations, community-based groups, neighborhood
  organizations, and funders.
   
   Our outreach plan (discussed above) includes organizing and staging convenings in partnership with the five biggest councils of government (which represent most of the cities in the county), and we are organizing events with Latino leaders, the Urban League, Community Health Councils, environmental health and environmental justice groups, and all of the business organizations and community groups interested in clean goods movement. We’re scheduling presentations to the LA Business Council, the building trades and LA County Federation of Labor, to seniors and the disabled, engineering groups, and to the LA chapters of the Urban Land Institute, American Institute of Architects, the American Planning Association, and the American Society of Landscape Architects. We will meet with the movie studios, the LA County Museum of Arts, the Dodgers, area hospitals, and other large employers who have sponsored our work in the past. We are planning a student transportation summit. We are a founding member of a regional equity collaborative -- of national nonprofits, community-based organizations and funders -- that will be involved. And all the while our on-the-ground canvass operation will continue to knock on doors throughout the county. 
   
   Most of these partners have been with us in the trenches since Measure R. We add new partners often but not all in this list are confirmed and we hope to keep discovering more. The three factors critical to the success of this collaboration are: 1) sufficient resources; 2) a smart strategy that effectively engages our partners; 3) our ability to sustain the organizing effort over time.
