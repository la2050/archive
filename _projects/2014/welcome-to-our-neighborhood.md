Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): |-
  1. Meet with collaborators. 
   
   ...1.1 Decide upon details of recycled material. 
   
   ......1.1.1 Optimize resistance to weathering.
   
   ......1.1.2 If on walkway, ensure that the surface of the design not be slippery.
   
   ......1.1.3 Where in LA County to source. 
   
   ......1.1.4 How many jobs can be created in LA County.
   
   ......1.1.5 Beyond walls, walkways, and windows: bus shelters? Interior corridors? Other appropriate locations?
   
   ...1.2 Use resources in the College of Engineering at Cal Poly Pomona to set up manufacturing process.
    
   ...1.3 Choose the ten categories and the design for each.
   
   ......1.3.1 Begin process of design and utility patents.
   
   2. Make a public announcement inviting others to collaborate, e.g., local businesses, local organizations, educational institutions, local governments.
   
   ...2.1 News conferences, municipal newsletters, local news media, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, college and school clubs, etc.
   
   3. Set up a system to create and assign QR codes. Each QR code would be unique, enabling the management team to convey and update a unique message. Yet, a cluster of QR codes, that is, those in the same neighborhood, would have a neighborhood identification marker.
    
   4. Manufacture using recycled material.
   
   5. Install where permitted on walls, walkways, and windows. Parolees graduating from the Reintegration Academy at Cal Poly Pomona will be given jobs, as will others.
   
   6. Publicize to residents of Los Angeles County, local businesses, local organizations, local governments, others.
   
   7. Maintain the decals and QR codes, and update the information provided through the QR codes.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: |-
  TODAY
   
   1. We will be creating jobs.
   
   ...1.1 Los Angeles City has 6,500 miles of streets, not including freeways, http://bss.lacity.org/resurfacing/ . If (a) all of LA County is double that number and (b) QR codes could be put on each side of a street, a hundred feet apart, we would have 1,372,000 QR codes. Assuming that half of the commercial districts and residential neighborhoods would not want the QR codes, we would have 686,000 QR codes.
   
   ......1.1.1 If installation of one QR code took ten minutes, we are looking at 114,000 hours, approximately 57 full-time jobs over the course of a year.
   
   ......1.1.2 After installation, there would be maintenance and updating of information. Ten minutes per QR codes per week would necessitate about 6,000,000 hours over a year, creating approximately 3,000 long-term jobs. 
   
   2. We will be contributing significantly to the sustainability of neighborhoods by making learning, exercise, and social interaction fun.
   
   ...2.1 Learning will vary from local happenings, like the time and address of a farmer's market to classroom priorities, "STEM on the Street".
   
   ...2.2 Exercise will be by(a) walking, with motivation coming from clues behind succeeding QR codes leading to an answer, (b) contests where foot or bicycle speed would be essential.
   
   ...2.3 Social interaction will be creative, high-profile, drawing further publicity to WON. For example, scan a QR code to read "If you find a person named John in the next ten minutes, you and he get a free ice cream at the Foster's Freeze around the corner". The creativity will be tempered by input from safety personnel.
   
   3. WON is a cross-over project, beginning with "Create" and touching upon the other four categories of the LA 2050 competition: Play, Connect, Live, Learn.
   
   IN 2050
   
   4. Residents of Los Angeles County will be healthier, as WON contributes to awareness about local agriculture and health programs.
   
   5. As they know their neighbors and neighborhoods better, they will collaborate to find solutions to neighborhood issues on a scale much larger than at present.
   
   ...5.1 Neighborhoods will be more sustainable, as WON contributes to local economic sustainability.
   
   ...5.2 Through the news service INSPIRE BEYOND, people will be exposed to solutions to local issues and motivated to act.
   
   6. The mix of education and fun will lead to a more learned population.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  1. Every resident, whatever his or her age, every tourist, whatever his or her
  age, who uses a hand-held device can benefit from the learning, exercise, and
  social interaction. 
   
   2. Local businesses, organizations, government units, and educational institutions benefit as their offerings and events become better known. 
   
   3. As for jobs, parolees coming through the Reintegration Academy, founded by Dr. Renford Reese of California Polytechnic University, Pomona, http://www.reintegrationacademy.org/ReintegrationAcademy.html, prepare for jobs in (a) design, (b) manufacture, (c) presentation, (d) installation, and (e) ongoing maintenance and updating of information.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
