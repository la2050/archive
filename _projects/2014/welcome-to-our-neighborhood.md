    "Welcome to Our Neighborhood", 'WON", is ten designs, each representing a
    category:  local events, local restaurants, local neighborhood councils,
    local competitions, local parks, local history, etc.  Each design is matched
    with a unique QR code telling about local happenings, opportunities, and
    resources, with the information updated weekly.  These are broken down even
    further, e.g., "resources" for education would include (a) knowledge games
    for individuals and groups, and (b) information about colleges, universities
    and trade schools in LA County.  Notably, three things can happen
    simultaneously:  learning, exercise, social interaction, as nobody anywhere
    is doing.  As we learn about our neighborhoods, we make friends and create
    jobs.
  implement: "1. Meet with collaborators. \r\n\r\n...1.1  Decide upon details of recycled material. \r\n\r\n......1.1.1  Optimize resistance to weathering.\r\n\r\n......1.1.2  If on walkway, ensure that the surface of the design not be slippery.\r\n\r\n......1.1.3  Where in LA County to source. \r\n\r\n......1.1.4 How many jobs can be created in LA County.\r\n\r\n......1.1.5  Beyond walls, walkways, and windows:  bus shelters?  Interior corridors?  Other appropriate locations?\r\n\r\n...1.2  Use resources in the College of Engineering at Cal Poly Pomona to set up manufacturing process.\r\n \r\n...1.3  Choose the ten categories and the design for each.\r\n\r\n......1.3.1 Begin process of design and utility patents.\r\n\r\n2. Make a public announcement inviting others to collaborate, e.g., local businesses, local organizations, educational institutions, local governments.\r\n\r\n...2.1  News conferences, municipal newsletters, local news media, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, college and school clubs, etc.\r\n\r\n3. Set up a system to create and assign QR codes.  Each QR code would be unique, enabling the management team to convey and update a unique message.  Yet, a cluster of QR codes, that is, those in the same neighborhood, would have a neighborhood identification marker.\r\n \r\n4. Manufacture using recycled material.\r\n\r\n5. Install where permitted on walls, walkways, and windows.  Parolees graduating from the Reintegration Academy at Cal Poly Pomona will be given jobs, as will others.\r\n\r\n6. Publicize to residents of Los Angeles County, local businesses, local organizations, local governments, others.\r\n\r\n7. Maintain the decals and QR codes, and update the information provided through the QR codes."
  impact_create: "TODAY\r\n\r\n1. We will be creating jobs.\r\n\r\n...1.1  Los Angeles City has 6,500 miles of streets, not including freeways, http://bss.lacity.org/resurfacing/ .  If (a) all of LA County is double that number and (b) QR codes could be put on each side of a street, a hundred feet apart, we would have 1,372,000 QR codes.  Assuming that half of the commercial districts and residential neighborhoods would not want the QR codes, we would have 686,000 QR codes.\r\n\r\n......1.1.1  If installation of one QR code took ten minutes, we are looking at 114,000 hours, approximately 57 full-time jobs over the course of a year.\r\n\r\n......1.1.2  After installation, there would be maintenance and updating of information.  Ten minutes per QR codes per week would necessitate about 6,000,000 hours over a year, creating approximately 3,000 long-term jobs.   \r\n\r\n2. We will be contributing significantly to the sustainability of neighborhoods by making learning, exercise, and social interaction fun.\r\n\r\n...2.1  Learning will vary from local happenings, like the time and address of a farmer's market to classroom priorities, \"STEM on the Street\".\r\n\r\n...2.2  Exercise will be by(a) walking, with motivation coming from clues behind succeeding QR codes leading to an answer, (b) contests where foot or bicycle speed would be essential.\r\n\r\n...2.3  Social interaction will be creative, high-profile, drawing further publicity to WON.  For example, scan a QR code to read \"If you find a person named John in the next ten minutes, you and he get a free ice cream at the Foster's Freeze around the corner\".  The creativity will be tempered by input from safety personnel.\r\n\r\n3. WON is a cross-over project, beginning with \"Create\" and touching upon the other four categories of the LA 2050 competition:  Play, Connect, Live, Learn.\r\n\r\nIN 2050\r\n\r\n4. Residents of Los Angeles County will be healthier, as WON contributes to awareness about local agriculture and health programs.\r\n\r\n5. As they know their neighbors and neighborhoods better, they will collaborate to find solutions to neighborhood issues on a scale much larger than at present.\r\n\r\n...5.1  Neighborhoods will be more sustainable, as WON contributes to local economic sustainability.\r\n\r\n...5.2  Through the news service INSPIRE BEYOND, people will be exposed to solutions to local issues and motivated to act.\r\n\r\n6. The mix of education and fun will lead to a more learned population.\r\n\r\n"
  who_benefit: "1. Every resident, whatever his or her age, every tourist, whatever his or her age, who uses a hand-held device can benefit from the learning, exercise, and social interaction.  \r\n\r\n2. Local businesses, organizations, government units, and educational institutions benefit as their offerings and events become better known.  \r\n\r\n3. As for jobs, parolees coming through the Reintegration Academy, founded by Dr. Renford Reese of California Polytechnic University, Pomona, http://www.reintegrationacademy.org/ReintegrationAcademy.html, prepare for jobs in (a) design, (b) manufacture, (c) presentation, (d) installation, and (e) ongoing maintenance and updating of information."
  partners_collaboration: "1. Dr. Renford Reese, Reintegration Academy, http://www.reintegrationacademy.org/ReintegrationAcademy.html , based at California Polytechnic University, Pomona, confirmed.\r\n\r\n...1.1  The Cal Poly Pomona College of Engineering.

  evaluate: "1. We will have a mobile app which will record each \"swipe\" of a QR code.\r\n\r\n...1.1  There will be a feature of the app which will tell us whether a resident or tourist has followed up on information, e.g., virtually watching a highlight from a lecture at USC and hten commenting.\r\n\r\n2. Measuring the number of jobs directly tied to WON will come from reports from collaborators.\r\n\r\n3. The number of announcements from local businesses, organizations, government units, educational institutions, and others wishing to use the QR codes.\r\n\r\n...3.1  The amount of revenue generated from such announcements."
  two_lessons: "1. A survey of education innovators has shown that there is far more which we could do with technology for public benefit than is now being done.  For example, WON is unique by combining learning, exercise, and social interaction, making the best use of available time, scarce time.  This potentially has a large implication.\r\n\r\n2. High schoolers on \"closed\" campuses are isolated from the residents around the campus.  Friendship, respect, and trust cannot be built, yet should be built so that youth contribute to the sustainability of their neighborhoods."
  achievable_goal: "1. Our goal is to set up and operate a demonstration with 10,000 QR codes in areas of Los Angeles County which could benefit from one or more of \r\n\r\n(a) more exercise,\r\n\r\n(b) more collaboration among neighbors,\r\n\r\n(c) more transactions for local businesses,\r\n\r\n(d) more civic involvement,\r\n\r\n(e) more volunteering with local organizations.\r\n\r\n1.1  the installation of 10,000 QR codes will require one full-time job or, preferably, so that the installation skill be developed, 10 part-time jobs.\r\n\r\n2. Revenue generated during the demonstration will be used to expand toward the goal of approximately 686,000 QR codes installed and updated throughout Los Angeles County.\r\n\r\n...2.1  Reaching the goal will take from three to five years."
  major_challenges: "1. We will not have permission from every public and private property owner, whether residential or business, to install QR codes.  While we have estimated that LA County could take 1,372,000 QR codes, we have based this application on the installation of half that number, 686,000.\r\n\r\n...1.1 WON would succeed as an innovative program if only one percent of the potential were realized.  Understandably, the expectations for the present and for 2050 would be tempered.\r\n\r\n...1.2 On our side is the modest precedent set by McKinney, Texas, http://www.mckinneyonline.com/July-2013/The-QR-Code-Historic-Walking-Tour-of-McKinney/ .  We will be doing bigger and better what McKinney has done.\r\n\r\n2. While there are plastics which endure under a hot sun emitting ultraviolet radiation, we do not know at this point which recyclable material would be used in the manufacture of the QR codes.\r\n\r\n...2.1  The solution will come from engineering faculty and students from one or more campus of the California State University in Los Angeles County:  Northridge, Los Angeles, Pomona, Long Beach, Dominguez Hills."
  competition: "The closest of which we are aware is QR codes used for historical sites, http://www.mckinneyonline.com/July-2013/The-QR-Code-Historic-Walking-Tour-of-McKinney/ .  WON is distinct because of the many categories and the three goals of learning, exercising, and social interaction.\r\n\r\nWhile the scope of a WON utility patent cannot be predicted, there is a chance that a WON patent would have an effect outside of Los Angeles County, meaning more income and jobs into our county."
  cost: "The goal is to manufacture, install, maintain, and update approximately 686,000 designs with QR codes.  The $100,000 will be used to set up, operate, and evaluate a demonstration for one year, specifically the manufacture, installation and operation of 10,000 QR codes.  Revenue, generated for immediate expansion thereafter, will come from\r\n\r\n(a) weekly advertising;  if half of 686,000 QR codes lead to advertising for local businesses and $20 is charged a week for that advertising, there would be an operating budget of up to $6,860,000 per week, sufficient to pay for 3,000 jobs at $2,000 a month per job;\r\n\r\n(b) sponsorships;  designs would include logos where appropriate;  this would cover the manufacture and installation of QR codes, as well as an \"exclusive license\" whereby a sponsor alone would be recognized in a design;  at $50 per year, there would be approximately $1,420,000 more income per month;\r\n\r\n(c) grants remain an option because of WON as an innovation supporting business sustainability, education, exercise, civic participation."
  budget: "The below covers the demonstration year and is subject to adjustment as new priorities arise.\r\n\r\n1. Accounting for the funds will be done by the 501(c)(3) public charity Transcendence, https://www.facebook.com/Transcendence.org .  To file forms and reports, $5,000.  125 hours at $40 per hour.   (This charity is contacted through Dr. Renford Reese, rrreese@csupomona.edu .)\r\n\r\n2. $2,500 for design work by Big Red Shoe.  50 hours at $50 per hour.\r\n\r\n3. $20,000 to create the molds for the first 10,000 QR codes.\r\n\r\n4. $22,500 to manufacture the first 10,000 QR codes.\r\n\r\n5. $34,000 to install the QR codes.  This includes pay of $12 per hour pay and $8 for materials, like epoxy.\r\n\r\n6. $2,500 for INSPIRE BEYOND to prepare inspiring news, e.g., teenage girl invents a medical tool, for transmission to Los Angeles County residents through QR codes.  50 news stories.\r\n\r\n7. $7,500 for project management.  One hour per working day, 250 days, $30 an hour.\r\n\r\n8. $6,000 for announcements directed to demonstration-area residents, businesses, organizations, government units, others.  $20 an hour to hire students and parolees to put the word out.\r\n\r\n"
