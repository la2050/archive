   Programming will include:
   
   SUMMER 2014
   • Student leadership training: Select rising seniors (Class of 2015) will attend our signature 4-day college-immersion Summer Workshops where they will be immersed in the college application process and trained as “Peer Leaders” to ignite a college-going culture in their schools.
   • Professional development and support for educators: Teachers and counselors responsible for implementing our curricula will attend our Educator Academy and become equipped to coach students from a college-savvy perspective and use our tools to collect data and track the application path of every senior. 
   
   SCHOOL YEAR
   • Innovative school-year curricula: 9th-11th grade students will receive our Launch program and be guided step-by-step through postsecondary preparation; seniors will benefit from our Navigator program by gaining the knowledge, confidence, tools, and support to identify their goals and plan for success beyond high school.
   • Support: Our School Partnership Managers will serve as a resource, helping educators create dynamic College Summit classroom experiences and supporting Peer Leader activities.
   • Actionable data: Our Milestone Reports will track student, classroom, and school progress toward achieving specific college enrollment goals are shared and discussed regularly to enable educators to proactively identify and respond to challenges and ensure optimal student success.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  In today’s global economy, postsecondary education is increasingly vital to
  individual success, as well as to our country’s future. The knowledge,
  experience and skills attained through postsecondary education help sustain
  our workforce, which keeps the United States competitive in the global
  marketplace. There was a time when a high school diploma was all that was
  necessary to work at an auto plant or factory and earn enough to support a
  family. That time has passed.
   
   The Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce report on educational concentrations of employment in the United States shows that by 2018, 67% of job openings in California will require applicants to have a post-high school education. Yet, in Los Angeles, Census data finds that only 59% of public school graduates go directly to college, and only half the adult population has earned a Bachelor’s degree or higher.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Target population for 2014-15 is 4,800 low-income youth between the ages of
  14-19 in the Greater Los Angeles metropolitan area. 70% of students served
  qualify for free/reduced meal plans (80% at most schools). 
   
   Students attend the following partner schools in the Los Angeles area: Academy of Science & Engineering Charter School; Academy of Scientific Exploration at Cesar E. Chavez Learning Academies; East Valley High School; Green Design Community School at Diego Rivera Learning Complex; Math, Science and Technology Magnet Academy at Roosevelt High School; Public Service Community School at Diego Rivera Learning Complex; Roosevelt High School; Thomas Jefferson High School; Arleta High School; APEX Academy; Arts, Theatre, and Entertainment School at Cesar E. Chavez Learning Academies; Communications and Technology School at Diego Rivera Learning Complex; Social Justice Humanitas Academy at Cesar E. Chavez Learning Academies; Sylmar High School; and Washington Preparatory High School.
   
   College Summit helps students like Alexis Cardenas (Class of 2014, ArTES Academy in Los Angeles). “Before College Summit,” she says, “the question wasn't whether or not I would go to college; it was always whether or not I'd care enough to finish…After high school, I actually just saw myself as working in some job I hated, studying something I disliked by night.” Then Alexia attended a College Summit workshop which helped her learn more about using college as a stepping stone to her future. Now, she says, “after realizing that everything I enjoy is indeed marketable in the work force, I became interested in going after my dreams.” Since returning to school in the fall, Alexia has recently been accepted into one of the eight schools to which she’s applied and is awaiting word from the others. However, what makes her most proud as a Peer Leader is having helped two of her friends who were on the fence about college to see its importance and apply; both, she is happy to report, have since been accepted into their first choice colleges.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  School Partners (listed above): Because of the embedded nature of our systemic
  model, strong partnerships with schools are necessary; we deliberately nurture
  relationships at multiple levels of leadership. Even when changes in personnel
  have occurred, we have been able to maintain our services because College
  Summit has become entrenched in the culture of schools. 
   
   Higher Education Partners: Deep relationships with the college/university partners that host our summer workshops create a vital bridge to postsecondary entry for students. Students greatly benefit from campus exposure, access to admissions counselors, and timely and relevant information and support. Our college partners, California Lutheran University and the University of Redlands, represent a network of higher education institutions across the country that have a shared mission to increase college access. By hosting our summer workshops, partners minimize our workshop costs and low-income students are introduced to their campuses and their students.
   
   Significant corporate partnerships include: Deloitte brings expertise in managing and identifying areas of growth, fund development, and sponsorship of awards to honor the work of our partner schools; Darden Restaurants Inc., Foundation supports Peer Leader meetings at schools and Peer Leader awards. Collaborations provide access and information on grants and financial aid: Citi Foundation, Cash for College, Hispanic Scholarship Fund, Magic Johnson Foundation, and Junior Achievement. Community engagement: participating in the Valley Education Collaborative working on college access issues and policies in the San Fernando area; and assisting the Los Angeles Urban League in their efforts to increase the college enrollment of students in the Crenshaw corridor. The region has also formed more than 50 volunteering partnerships with local businesses, professional associations, and community groups to increase knowledge about college access issues and recruit volunteers from diverse backgrounds. College Summit has a pending application with the SoCal College Access Network (CAN), a regional network of 30+ college access organizations, to increase our visibility, identify us as a leader in the field, and provide access to resources, learnings, and best practices.
