  LA Schools to Parks will increase community parks in the LA Promise Zone by
  working with schools to open their outdoor recreation space to the community
  on weekends and in summer. Currently only 30% of Zone residents live within
  1/4 mile walk to a park. The goal of LA Schools to Parks is to double this
  within one year, so that 60% of residents live within 1/4 mile walk to a park
  and can enjoy recreation, exercise and play. 
   
   Our project will open schools on weekends and in the summer for residents, while offering recreation programs in the parks through partnerships with community groups, the City of LA Recreation and Parks, and LAUSD. Our analysis of existing parks in the Promise Zone shows that transforming just 12 schools into parks would double the percentage of residents within 1/4 mile of a park to 60% of residents. To accomplish this, we partner with residents and school leaders in neighborhood visioning sessions in the first six months of the grant to finalize school locations and identify recreation and play activities that should be offered at each park. Then we will solidify agreements with the District and schools, recruit partners to offer activities and open the parks for public use.
   
   LA Schools to Parks is part of both the Promise Zone and the Promise Neighborhood, which is exciting because these programs will bring existing fitness/recreation activities and coordination with broader neighborhood revitalization efforts in this community. 
   
   In January 2014 President Obama announced that Los Angeles had received one of only five Promise Zone designations, with the goal of revitalizing high-poverty communities through potential tax incentives and receiving extra points on federal grant applications for funding. The LA Promise Zone has over 80 public and private partners, with YPI as the Lead Implementation Partner. YPI is also Lead Agency for the LA Promise Neighborhood (LAPN) in the Hollywood area of the Zone. LAPN in Hollywood is working with seven schools to provide a continuum of cradle to college and career services to help students graduate high school college and career ready. Four of these campuses are strong candidates for transforming into weekend/summer parks, as YPI's existing funding will provide recreation activities at these times. All of these resources will help us achieve our goal of opening up 12 more parks and helping LA residents to be healthy and play in safe spaces.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Our project will increase open space and parks. The LA Promise Zone in Central
  Los Angeles is one of the densest communities in the City, but has little
  green space and few options for play. Over 70% of Zone residents do not live
  within 1/4 mile of a park. Los Angeles is the most “park poor” of major cities
  in the United States. While Los Angeles has 9.1 acres of park per 1,000
  residents (compared to 4.6 acres per 1,000 for New York), parks are less
  equitably distributed in LA. The vast majority of children in New York (91%)
  and Boston (97%) live within walking distance of a park, compared to only 33%
  in LA (The Trust for Public Land, No Place to Play, 2004). The LA Promise Zone
  has even fewer park spaces, with only 30% of residents living within walking
  distance of a park, demonstrating a great need for additional parks and
  recreation spaces that will help make LA the best place to play today.
   
   LA Schools to Parks will address this by opening up more recreational spaces within walking distance of residents for play, recreation, and community involvement. LA Mayor Eric Garcetti has a goal that every resident should be able to walk to a park. Given the lack of affordable properties in central LA, YPI offers a feasible way to accomplish this goal - opening school playgrounds on the weekends and during the summer, rather than trying to develop and open expensive new parks. LA Schools to Parks will work to double the number of residents within walking distance of a recreational space and park by 2015. In addition, LA Schools to Parks will fundraise and work with schools long term to convert any concrete recreational spaces into increased green space.
   
   By 2050, the City of Los Angeles will be able to leverage the success of LA Schools to Parks to meet Mayor Garcetti’s goal. The Promise Zone, with its partnerships, defined collaborative structure, and ongoing initiatives, offers the ideal laboratory to implement LA Schools to Parks. The success here will provide the springboard needed to extend this model of cooperation and grassroots change to the entire City, so that by 2050, over 90% of residents will be within walking distance to a park, and Los Angeles will be known among large cities for its extensive -- and equitable -- reach of open space and parks.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The project will most directly benefit over 32,000 families currently living
  in the Promise Zone, the majority of whom lack access to parks and open space
  within walking distance. 70% of Promise Zone residents (113,082) do not live
  within 1/4 mile of a park, which reflects the inequitable distribution of
  parks and open space in the City of Los Angeles. These residents are expected
  to use the new parks and will most directly benefit from the project.
   
   The Promise Zone in Central Los Angeles is home to 161,516 residents. These residents are the direct beneficiaries of the LA Schools to Parks project. Promise Zone residents experience high levels of need and are very diverse, as demonstrated by the following characteristics. 
   
   19.5% are youth under the age of 18, and 6.2% are under the age of 5. 
   
   71% are between 18-64 years of age, and 9.6% are senior citizens age 65 and older. 
   
   57.7% are Hispanic, with the remainder classified as White, Asian, and African American. 
   
   A significant percentage of residents who will benefit from the new parks are low income. 34.9% are below the poverty line, a much higher percentage than for Los Angeles as a whole (20.2%). 72.8% of households in the Promise Zone make less than $50,000 per year (compared to 42% of households in California). (American Community Survey (ACS) 2007-11 and 2008-12).
   
   Critically, only 7.6% of housing in the Promise Zone are single family homes, while 90.3% are apartment complexes that typically lack a backyard for play or recreation (compared to 28.3% of all California housing being apartments) (ACS 2008-12). The need for parks and open space is particularly critical for families in the Promise Zone, which, as discussed earlier, live in one of the densest communities in Los Angeles. Moreover, this part of LA is located at a significant distance from most of the larger park systems that Los Angeles has to offer, such as the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area or Angeles National Forest.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  YPI (the Promise Zone Lead Implementation Partner and Lead Agency for the LA
  Promise Neighborhood) works with the City of Los Angeles, the Lead Agency for
  the Promise Zone and a confirmed partner. The City of LA and the Mayor’s
  Office will leverage services for newly created parks, including arts and
  sports offered at Recreation Centers, Summer Night Lights (a program that
  provides after-dark recreational and jobs for youth in City parks during
  summer), and intergenerational programs.
   
   The LA Unified School District is a partner and working with the City and YPI to transform Promise Zone schools into full-fledged community schools to support academic achievement and family stability. They have worked with People for Parks to establish a Memorandum of Understanding to streamline creation of new parks at schools, while the LAUSD School Police will partner to support safety in the parks.
   
   People for Parks LA is a partner and works to create Community-School Parks that offer open space and grass with recreational activities in LAUSD schools. They offer a grassroots incubator training program and a Fast Track Permit Process with the school district.
   
   The Trust for Public Land is committed to support YPI and the City while building on similar programs like the NYC Schoolyards to Playgrounds Initiative, which has designed and built over 180 green playgrounds since 1996. The Trust for Public Land is a founding partner in the Promise Zone and works to lead park and open space development in the Zone. 
   
   Three major factors critical to success include involvement and buy-in of residents. Without this, this project cannot and will not happen. They will participate through neighborhood visioning, incubator training, and volunteering to ensure that parks are great locations for fun and play. Secondly, involvement of partners is vital. Without effective buy-in of the City of LA and the Recreation and Parks Department, and the support of LAUSD and schools, the project will not succeed. Finally, best practices offered by YPI and partners in opening schools as public parks and in providing collaborative services for residents are critical- this includes experience YPI has in building community involvement, experience People for Parks has in opening schools and parks, and components already in place to make this happen- Fast Track permitting, approval procedures, and services provided by the City in the Recreation and Parks Department.
