Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Building upon our 10-year track record as a presenting theatre and home to a
  resident theatre laboratory, Schkapf will expand its pilot programming
  capacity to increase our functionality as an incubation house for artists as
  entrepreneurs. In order to achieve this goal, Schkapf will:
   
   (1) Cultivate its current intern team into sustainable staff positions, including Development, Programming and Education Directors, as well as a Cultural Liaison to engage with neighborhood, academic, and business partners.
   
   (2) Select five ensembles or individuals to incubate projects. Recipients will be guided through their creation process with resource-sharing, space-sharing, professional development classes, and expert feedback. They will hold consistent public showings of work-in-progress, and will serve as case studies in the further development of the incubation model.
   
   (3) Expand the School of Embodied Acting to hold regular fee-based classes with established local, national and international teachers in order to improve the caliber of work created in Los Angeles and make it competitive in a wider market.
   
   (4) Secure partnerships with at least three new partners, including a local vendor, school, and other nonprofit, to cross-promote and support, creating a positive feedback loop within cultural and economic ecosystems. The areas we are focused on are: 
   (a) the creation of our research library and commissary as a neighborhood hangout that serves the Theatre Row Association and Central Hollywood, and acts as a hub for artists within the wider LA County area to exchange ideas, do research, and be inspired by installations, video and audio recordings situated throughout the space; 
   
   (b) the building of stable foundations for a wider alternative touring network on the West Coast specifically for, but not limited to, physical, collectively created, visually ambitious, and cross-disciplinary live performance that will serve as a viable way for LA artists to bring their work to other communities and generate more income; 
   
   (c) the development of a more vibrant educational interface bridging students and faculty of LA’s rich universities with local practitioners, thus generating more research networks and potential funding revenue for the universities, a clearer understanding of the current artistic field for students, and a more robust pool of patrons and artists at Schkapf.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Today, independent artists interested in live performance in Los Angeles
  contend with the mega-industry that is film and television while receiving
  minimal support from government and local nonprofits. While many theatres have
  ‘new works’ series, few incubate projects from inception to completion.
  University settings are fertile breeding grounds for experimentation, but too
  often do not communicate with local practitioner groups. The result is a
  broken pipeline in which much of the city’s best talent does not have a venue
  to hone their craft, connect with fellow artists, and key into the communities
  that they exist to serve.
   Schkapf’s project challenges the production status quo, creating new environments for industry professionals to develop and expand their artistry, raise the culture of live performance in LA to a competitive standard on the national and international scenes and generate more economic viability for artists seeking community engagement and experimenting with new work.
   By 2050 we envision Schkapf to be a vibrant artist live/work village providing onsite livelihood for hundreds of artists. This means easily accessible work and rehearsal space, a state-of-the-art flexible performing arts centre capable of meeting a wide variety of performance demands, and a robust and unique School of Embodied Acting with its own pedagogical paradigm that serves as a node in an international training scheme. It also means a performance research library and bookstore, artisan retail shops, a cafe/restaurant, and rotating interfaces (galleries, installations, screenings, hands-on learning opportunities) for the wider education and recruitment of audiences. This village will not only directly change the ways in which performance is created in Los Angeles, dramatically increasing access to the means of production, but will also add to a more educated and interactive audience support base for live performance in LA County. Schkapf will not only be incubating world class homegrown LA performance, but, unlike the majority of presenting houses currently in LA, Schkapf will directly collaborate with international artists to incubate work that impacts and serves the residents of LA County.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Our project benefits the performing arts communities of Los Angeles and their
  audiences, specifically but not limited to, those interested in physical,
  visual, ensemble and cross-disciplinary work. It will also benefit the
  surrounding neighborhood of Schkapf by creating a Cultural Liaison with the
  intent of bridging the artist-driven work at Schkapf with local residents,
  creating more dialogue around the use and value of live performance as well as
  developing mutual bonds that will cultivate respect, care, and pride in the
  neighborhood itself. Our project also aims to benefit our partner
  organizations: the local vendor, school, and nonprofit that we engage with in
  order to mutually grow, or further sustain, our respective organizations.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Schkapf has a robust network of sustained partners that it has been
  collaborating and consulting with to create the first stage of its
  development. In the performing arts context these include The Clown School
  (local), the Network of Ensemble Theaters and Celebration Barn (national),
  Slava Polunin, Au Brana, Awake Projects, the Grotowski Institute and the
  London School of Performing Arts Practices (international). In a local
  government context, Schkapf is an active participant in the Central Hollywood
  Neighborhood Council, Media Business Improvement District, and the Theatre Row
  Association as well as seeks regular consultation from Arts for LA and the
  Department of Cultural Affairs. In an academic context, Schkapf has partners
  at USC, CalArts, CSU/LA (local), Naropa, Emerson and Brown University
  (national), the Laboratory Theatre Network, the University of Leeds, the
  University of Huddersfield, and the University of Kent (international), as
  well as notable independent scholars, such as Kathryn Mederos Syssoyeva and
  John Britton. We will continue to work extensively with these partners in the
  visioning and implementation of Stage 2 of this project. Schkapf will also
  reach out to local theatres that have successfully created multi-faceted
  neighborhood hubs, such as the Bootleg Theatre (which is also a bar and music
  venue) and Greenway Arts Alliance (which partners with its local school and
  vendors) and international organizations such as the National Theatre Studio
  (a research and development organization that ensures innovative new
  performance for England’s regional theatres) and the Battersea Arts Centre (a
  collective of producers who have renovated an historic London Town Hall in
  order to incubate a variety of performance capable of “inventing the future of
  theatre”) to further develop our programming and ensure that stage 2 is
  sustainable and influential. Furthermore, we will identify and begin
  collaborating with new partners capable of assisting in the creation of an
  operational and revenue-producing commissary, the foundations for a
  sustainable touring network, and a university-to-industry pipeline.
