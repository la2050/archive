  Through it's therapy and consultation work WIN affects the lives of 1000s of
  individuals yearly, and the core of our program is our intensive clinical
  work: WIN will provide in-home, dyadic child-parent psychotherapy and
  individual therapy for parents along with integrated health, early
  care/education and social services through our referring partner agencies to
  350-400 children, parents and family members annually. Our bilingual,
  master’s-level therapists will work with young children (prenatal through 3+)
  and parents whose relationships have been disrupted by trauma, neglect and
  mental illness to affect substantive, measurable improvement in 1) secure
  attachment, 2) children’s social, emotional and cognitive development, and 3)
  parental stress. While WIN therapists provide these direct services, our
  partner agency case managers ensure that families get intensive, cross-agency
  early care, social services and health clinic support before and throughout
  the therapeutic process, such that unmet basic needs don’t interrupt
  treatment. We will manage the entire network of services in “real time” via
  WIN’s innovative communications infrastructure and web-based data system to
  make sure families facing substantial challenges get what they need, when they
  need it, without the service barriers of an agency working in isolation, and
  without the “red tape” typical of cross-agency collaborations. Along with
  these services, WIN will help families build relationships and social networks
  though our monthly Family Night gatherings. And, in order to positively affect
  the lives of children and families beyond the geographic reach of our direct
  services, we will also provide professional-level early childhood mental
  health training to clinicians and providers throughout LA County, and mental
  health consultation to Early Head Start programs and other agencies, including
  Venice Family Clinic, Westside Children’s Center, El Nido Family Center,
  Pediatric Therapy Center and St. Joseph Center.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Just like adults, infants and toddlers suffer from mental health issues. But
  untreated, impacts can be far more pernicious and entrenched, developing into
  lifetimes of mental and physical illness, behavior and educational problems,
  with root causes deeply embedded in brain structures and chemistry. Children’s
  brains are particularly vulnerable to stress and trauma during this critical
  period from prenatal through three years old, when brain architectures are
  being formed, but therapy during this window is also more impactful than at
  other times in the human lifespan. WIN’s early therapeutic and case management
  interventions work to prevent long-term, ill effects for children and
  families, as well as ongoing social costs to educational, medical and legal
  systems. 
   
   Early childhood mental health issues are often caused or exacerbated by parental/caregiver lack of attunement, or abuse or neglect resulting from caregivers’ own depression, unresolved traumas or other mental health issues. By providing both in-home, child-parent dyadic therapy and individual therapy for parents, as well as critical, integrated basic services including health care, food pantry, employment training, and early intervention for special needs, WIN comprehensively addresses intergenerational mental health issues and unmet basic needs, while re-attuning child-parent relationships, building resilience, and helping families move on from past traumas.
   
   Since the strongest indicator of the type of relationship a child will have with a parent, is the relationship that parent had with their parents, abuse and neglect have a tendency to move from generation to generation, bringing along with it the cognitive, mental health and physical health issues and societal costs associated with toxic stress (see Harvard University Center on the Developing Child's research : http://developingchild.harvard.edu/key_concepts/toxic_stress_response/). However, if children are securely attached to parents, their brains are in the best possible position to develop to their full potential--and their children are highly likely to benefit from the same strong, resilient parenting. The research is clear: if every kid in LA has a happy childhood, LA becomes more creative, more innovative, less violent and a better place for all of us to live, in 2050--and beyond.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  WIN targets low-income families with children prenatal through three who are
  facing attachment issues across 26 Los Angeles Country zip codes from
  Inglewood to Hollywood, Venice to West LA. Annually, our intensive clinical
  program serves 350-400 individual children, parents and family members who are
  facing critical challenges (approximately 75-90 families). All (100%) of our
  clients are from low income families across 26 local zip codes including
  Inglewood and Mar Vista. Of current WIN clients, 83% are Latino (most are
  recent immigrants from Mexico and Central America who speak Spanish or
  indigenous languages); 2% are multiracial (Asian/African American/Latino); 5%
  are Caucasian; 8% are African American; and 2% have other ethnic backgrounds).
  We typically work with families for 12-18 months—and the process is an
  intensive one. Our consultation program provides 700 hours of direct service
  to 125-150 staff of 5 agencies in LA to affect the lives of 1000s of
  additional children and families annually.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Since 2006, WIN’s network partners have included Venice Family Clinic,
  Westside Children’s Center and St. Joseph Center. Respectively, they bring a
  host of high-quality medical care; early care and early intervention services;
  and food pantry, housing support and homelessness support to our shared
  clients. All of the families who come to WIN are referred from our three
  partners, and that allows us to ‘nest’ our intensive mental health care within
  the context of their home-agencies services. WIN’s partnership relationships
  are some of the most deeply rooted we’ve encountered, and are critical to our
  success with families. 
   
   All WIN families receiving therapy get a home visiting case manager from their home agency, as well as a Master’s level WIN therapist. Because WIN pays the salaries of partner-agency case managers, our web based data system rates services on a monthly basis, which helps ensure high quality care. Because WIN releases its clinical outcomes biannually, our partners know how their families are doing in our care.
   
   Lead clinical staff from each agency and WIN meet to coordinate work at our monthly Program Committee Meetings, and partner agency case managers and supervisors, plus WIN therapists and our clinical director meet weekly for shared case reviews. WIN trains its partner agency staff with 20-40 hours of multi-disciplinary training each year, plus provides dedicated, weekly mental health consultation to the Early Head Start and/or programmatic staff of each of our partner agencies.
   
   Thanks to WIN’s HIPAA-compliant data system (a system that has become the model for one the state of Connecticut has adopted for its early childhood mental health services), WIN and its partners coordinate care for each family though a jointly prepared on-line service plan that is updated by each agency regularly. The system reports monthly on how well we’re helping families achieve their goals, and allows staff to communicate in ‘real-time’ regarding family progress—as well as to coordinate care during emergencies. The system tabulates our biannual outcomes, gathering data input by staff at various levels from all partners, and reminds case managers and therapists when screenings, assessments and releases are due.
