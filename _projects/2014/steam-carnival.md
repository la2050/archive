Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Support from the Goldhirsh Foundation’s LA2050 will help ensure that the first
  STEAM Carnival will be a huge success in 2014. Additionally, funds will
  increase the organizational capacity to immediately begin to plan annual
  Carnivals in Los Angeles, serving different neighborhoods each year. This
  creates an incredible opportunity to serve the needs of each neighborhood,
  highlight the unique cultural, commercial and community-based offerings in
  each area of Los Angeles and give a boost to these local economies.
   
   Support will also help underwrite STEAM Carnival Student Preview Day. During Student Preview Day, visiting students and educators will participate in the STEAM Lab, a 15,000 square foot space dedicated to hands-on workshops exploring wearable electronics, musical robots, and additional engaging activities, and the STEAM Arcade, a high-tech midway encouraging purposeful play. In the STEAM Arcade, trained instructors will provide crucial links between Carnival games and STEAM disciplines.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  It was in early 2013 that Two Bit Circus became impassioned to design an event
  that fused STEM principles with our own dynamic inventions, gadgets and
  amusements. In researching the state of education in regards to STEM and STEAM
  education, we were made aware of several distressing statistics: The National
  Math and Science Initiative has called it a ‘STEM crisis.’
   
   The need is so great that through his Educate to Innovate initiative President Obama has committed $43.1 billion dollars to STEM Education. In January 2013, the White House issued a call to tech innovators to work together to ensure that all youth—particularly those from underserved and historically underrepresented communities—have the opportunity to study STEM subjects and participate in the technology sector (http://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/education/K-12/educate-innovate).
   
   While this is a tremendous resource it is a national one and the regional need is what STEAM Carnival will address first in Los Angeles. While California used to be a national leader in K–12 and higher education, it now ranks 43rd or lower among all states in math and science proficiency in grades 4 through 8 (http://www.stemadvantage.org/stem-stats/). 
   
   Fewer than 50% of students who enter college intending to major in a STEM field complete a STEM degree (Ibid). 
   
   Two Bit Circus has accepted that call with the belief that if we want our students to be successful in the 21st century, they must be armed with creative problem-solving skills that allow them to thrive in complex and changing environments. 
   
   The 'A' (Arts) added to STEM instruction is crucial to our vision. Creative exploration in STEM disciplines activates students’ curiosity, in turn often leading to deeper understanding across seemingly disparate areas of learning. As STEM initiatives are slowly but surely integrating the arts into scientifically driven subjects, opportunities for STEAM expansion abound. Two Bit Circus seeks to bring unique and dynamic learning to STEAM Carnival attendees to utilize and harness the potentials of scientific inquiry through creativity and innovation.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  STEAM Carnival will bring together diverse facets of the community and offer a
  unique platform to address inequalities found in education and workforce
  development. To this end, Two Bit Circus will continue to partner with LAUSD
  schools to provide access to interactive learning tools during the Carnival as
  well as through its on-going related programs with Two Bit Circus and several
  nonprofit partners. 
   
   The primary population STEAM Carnival Student Preview seeks to serve is students ages 12 to 18 from underserved students in Los Angeles. 
   
   In the case of San Pedro specifically, STEAM Carnival is working with Dana STEAM Middle School.
   
   After Student Preview Day, STEAM Carnival is open to the public on October 25th-26th. Then we will welcome families, teachers, mentors and learners of all ages to join the fun!
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Community engagement and collaboration is a founding principal of STEAM
  Carnival. 
   
   Education Technical Assistance - The Los Angeles Education partnership (LAEP) - serves as our primary education outreach partner which we are already working with. Two Bit Circus is working in collaboration with LAEP as it is a fit to their mission to provide all students access to interactive learning tools at our STEAM Carnival. Their expertise in working in high poverty communities to foster schools that support the academic success of children and youth brings that expertise to our efforts. We also have other working relationships through our on-site studio and in the community with LAUSD, Beyond the Bell, A Place Called Home, and the Girl Scouts. We are also exploring a relationship with After School All-Stars, a nationwide after school program operator. 
   
   A Host partner - The Port of LA - host of the inaugural STEAM Carnival and a key partner in bringing together diverse facets of the Los Angeles and Harbor communities. 
   
   Corporate and Government Engagement - The STEAM Committee - is a highly engaged group of community influencers who are passionate about STEAM education and are working on its behalf on several fronts. Chairing the Committee is Nolan Bushnell, Founder of Atari and Chuck E. Cheese along with John Ward, Sr VP Content Operations at Direct TV; other committee members include Eric Garcetti, Los Angeles Mayor; Don Knabe, Los Angeles County Supervisor and Chairman; Elizabeth Espinosa, CNN Host; Gilbert Cedillo, Los Angeles Council member; Joe Buscaino, Los Angeles Council member; Mark Francis, New Venture Lead at Intel; and Caine Monray, Caine’s Arcade. Committee members are currently all LA based and members are tasked with engaging new partners and supporters to make the first Carnival an unforgettable experience. 
   National and regional support has been secured for the STEAM Carnival and include sponsorships and grants from several sources including: Time Warner Cable, Hitachi, City of Los Angeles, and Popular Mechanics. We also have a two-year recurring commitment from American Honda Foundation for the development of our STEAM curriculum and professional learning costs. 
   
   Two Bit Circus in currently working with the Extension Program at the University of California, San Diego to create the first-ever STEAM certificate program for K-12 teachers. This was announced as a CGI commitment (http://www.prweb.com/releases/2014/07/prweb12011117.htm).
