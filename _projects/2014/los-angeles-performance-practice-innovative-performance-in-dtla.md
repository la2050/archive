Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  We plan to work with city developers, property managers, and downtown
  businesses to activate contemporary performance in specific areas. We have
  initiated conversations with the Mayor's Office (city planning division), and
  have worked in the past with the City of Los Angeles Department of Cultural
  Affairs. We also plan to call upon our friends and contacts in property
  management, and form new relationships with those involved in Bringing Back
  Broadway initiatives. 
   
   We have seen a huge influx of demand for "immersive" and "site-specific" performance in the past 2-5 years. In New York, for example, some of the most successful performances have been in non-traditional sites- with 'Sleep No More' being the most dominant example. Audiences are hungry for immersive experiences, and at the same time contemporary art with aesthetic integrity. 
   
   Our network of artists have ample experience working in these emerging forms- but producing at this scale can be expensive. These performance experiences are often intended for intimate audiences, making it impossible to recoup costs through ticket sales alone. Other companies have attempted this kind of work, but have been unable to pay artists a fair wage. 
   
   We will implement this project in partnership with our network of artists, providing opportunities to emerging artists in Los Angeles, and relying on the strengths of artists who are already developing projects within this framework- but still seeking a venue and producing infrastructure. We will hire performers, directors, designers, visual artists, composers, and stage managers to execute the highest quality experience possible.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  LA is known internationally as being a leader in film/television, music, even
  contemporary visual art. Our city is under-recognized for the incredible
  talent we house in the areas of contemporary performance. 
   
   Prior to Los Angeles Performance Practice, it was common for interdisciplinary artists working in performance to develop and present work outside of their home city. LA artists were (and still are) presenting work at world-class venues in New York, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Dallas, plus in Europe and Latin America. But, sufficient opportunities were hard to come by in LA. 
   
   We are working actively to form relationships with top venues in the city to promote the work of our local artists. We have two premieres scheduled at REDCAT in the coming year, and are in our second year with the Bootleg Theater producing the Live Arts Exchange (LAX) Festival for contemporary work. 
   
   By bringing contemporary performance to DTLA, we will elevate the overall perception of performance emerging out of Los Angeles, and will activate our local audiences and communities in celebration of our work. 
   
   In Los Angeles, anything is possible! We feel it's still the "wild west" of theater/dance/performance forms. Because of this, it's the best place to innovate art itself- to tell stories about THIS MOMENT, using tools and technologies of the present day. 
   
   Our project will bring this work out of the theaters- out of outdated infrastructure- and into the streets. We'll activate hotels, office buildings, parks, street corners, abandoned warehouses. By relocated performance to a public space beyond the walls of the theater, we will encourage expanded creativity that will funnel into other industries in Los Angeles: film/tv, design, restaurants, hotels, etc.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Our project will provide well-paying opportunities to local artists. These
  opportunities are few and far between in Los Angeles. One of our overall goals
  with LAPP is to create infrastructure that makes it easier to live as a
  generative artist in our city. 
   
   Beyond the artists themselves, our project will greatly benefit the City of Los Angeles. It is well known that bringing arts and culture to underdeveloped sectors of cities worldwide sparks city development. We have seen this pattern re-occur several times in the country- and several times in Los Angeles.
   
   Additionally, our project will benefit local business. A study from Americans for the Arts found that "Attendees at arts events spend $24.60 per person, per event, beyond the cost of admission on items such as meals, parking, and babysitters. Attendees who live outside the 
   county in which the arts event takes place spend twice as much as their local counterparts ($39.96 vs. $17.42)—valuable revenue for local businesses and the community.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: |-
  City of Los Angeles 
   We are in conversation with members of the City Planning team, who have expressed interest in working with us to identify projects that could be used as activating arts and cultural activities in under-utilized parts of the city. Should we receive this funding, we will be able to offer the City our services in programming these unused areas. 
   
   ACE Hotel
   We are in conversation with the ACE around one particular project that would occur on Broadway as an immersive, overnight experience. The success of this collaboration also hinges on funding. The ACE has a built-in audience of local art-seekers, and we would be thrilled to work with them. 
   
   Annie Saunders (confirmed artist)
   Annie has a wealth of experience in working with site-specific immersive performances. Her project 'The Day Shall Declare It' explores the concept of work, both what it means to us and what it does to us. The piece interrogates beliefs about working, work ethics, work/life balance and how these concepts infiltrate our relationships with others and ourselves.
   
   Zoe Aja Moore (confirmed artist)
   Zoe will direct a new adaptation of Hedda Gabler as an immersive, overnight experience. Hedda is a cry for a new radicalism – a woman in the midst of bourgeois culture struggles to break free from the repetition of history. By extending the classic play, Hedda Gabler, into an overnight event the play is adapted into a ritualistic experience that invites the audience to encounter the action of the performance through an intimate proscenium – the performers and audiences body rhythms of sleep and wakefulness align with each other, shifting the play from it’s traditional psychological profile into a united experience of the play’s universal themes. The extended duration of the play aerates the text, creating space for operatic expressions and intimate moments.
