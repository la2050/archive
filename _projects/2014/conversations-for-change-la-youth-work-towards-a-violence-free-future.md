  Jenesse’s focus on youth is a critical aspect of our prevention strategy to
  reduce the prevalence of domestic violence in our communities in the near
  future. The goal of "Youth Conversations” is to educate youth about the
  warning signs of domestic violence and give youth an opportunity to discuss
  how domestic violence can be prevented. “Youth Conversations” events will
  provide an opportunity to discuss domestic violence without the stigma that is
  usually associated with this issue. Young people will learn about the cycle of
  violence, where to get help, and what to do if they or their friends are ever
  involved in unhealthy relationships.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Given our experience with youth intervention through our shelter programs and
  community-orientated youth prevention programs, Jenesse’s youth-targeted
  violence prevention model has the potential to change the life trajectory of
  at-risk youth in Los Angeles County.
   Funding from MY LA2050 would be used to expand Jenesse’s “Youth Conversations” and Teen Angels programs. “Youth Conversations” provides youth with the opportunity to have frank discussions about relationship violence. 
   
   Jenesse plans to implement our project by:
   
   1. Hold “Youth Conversations” to provide youth the opportunity to have frank discussions about relationship violence.
   2. Increase the awareness and support of Jenesse’s Teen Angeles, who create change within our community by being active role models for the next generation.
   3. Engage men and boys as allies in our prevention strategy and intervention model.
   4. Utilize men and boys to influence other men and boys and encourage them to work as change agents to prevent domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking.
   5. Develop violence prevention workshops and activities designed to address the intersection of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and other youth issues.
   6. Create and implement culturally responsive pathway programs, from crisis to stability for youth who are impacted by violence.
   7. Enhance services and support for youth who are exposed to domestic violence.
   8. Increase the community response for youth exposed to domestic violence, dating violence, stalking etc. and community agencies who work with this population.

  The Secret to Why We Connect. We KNOW that We Know…..
   (1) Domestic violence is a family issue 
   (2) Children and teens are equal victims of domestic violence
   (3) Young men have to be part of the conversation
   (4) Domestic violence is sometimes a family cycle that goes generation to generation; this cycle can be broken with proper education, awareness, counseling and preparation.
   Los Angeles is a violent city, but the most insidious violence, the one that does the most damage, is the violence that takes place in the home. What leaves the home enters the world, and statistics show time and time again that men and women raised in a home where family violence is the norm often become abusers and violent offenders who not only hurt those they love, but target those in their community for harm as well. Decreasing the amount of people who are victims and perpetrators of domestic violence will lead to a safer Los Angeles. But to get there, we must challenge people to redefine their "normal" when it comes to violence. This includes mental, physical, we must engage them to unlearn what they have learned. 
   Karen Earl, CEO of Jenesse Center says, "Jenesse and our collaborators believe we will change Los Angeles by talking. We will come together and share all of the painful questions around relationship violence, develop agreed upon language and process, decide who else belongs in the tent, engage in friendly, fabulous discussions and share our findings and implementation strategies in a lovely inclusive manner. It is now 2050 and Los Angeles is changed.”
   Jenesse strongly believes that youth intervention strategy is the key to ending domestic violence. We believe that we can live in LA2050 without domestic violence. If we continue to educate and hold conversations about healthy relationships, dating violence and sexual assault until it is nonexistent. Jenesse's efforts to connect, educate, address and serve the needs of Los Angeles youth by:
   1. Develop and increase existing community programs focused on youth.
   2. Increase availability information and resources for youth exposed to domestic violence and other youth issues.
   3. Develop culturally and linguistically appropriate mental health, anger management and other support services for various age groups.
   4. Provide age, culturally, and linguistically appropriate residential and nonresidential services to youth exposed to domestic violence.
   5. Increase awareness and funding to support programs.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Funds obtained through MY LA 2050 will benefit over 1000 unserved and
  underserved youth ages (11-18) in Los Angeles County. Thirty-four percent of
  all domestic violence calls in Los Angeles county are from Jenesse’s Service
  Area. Jenesse’s qualitative and quantitative in- house data supports the
  devastating effect of domestic violence among children and youth.
   Jenesse Center knows that to end domestic violence, we must educate our youth early on to recognize the signs of unhealthy relationships, so they never end up in a shelter. We also know that we must challenge young people who have already fallen into unhealthy relationship patterns, to redefine their idea of normal, and to give and demand respect.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  Jenesse thrives on partnerships. One of our strengths is bringing the power,
  influence and resources of partners within our appropriate framework to move
  our mission forward.
   
   1. ICON MANN- Recently, Jenesse was embraced by ICON MANN, a group of Hollywood actors, high level executives and dignitaries...all men, who shadow, mentor, counsel and recognize the achievement of our boys and youth. The men recently celebrated the youth's achievements at 2014 Youth Conversations event. They provoked thought and reflection on panel discussions about "what is it to be a man", "what does a healthy relationship look like?"
   
   When we asked some of the ICON MANN participants the questions (1) Why was it important for you to be there? (2) Why are these youths vital?, Graylind R. Wheery/Director of Finance for Sony stated, “I think it was important for me to be part of the conversation because of one of the key topics…“Manhood”. For youth “Manhood”, in some cases, is defined by images seen through various media outlets or through personal interactions. Unfortunately, as in the case of many of the victims who seek Jenesse services for support, some of the personal interactions are not positive ones and the youth will get a skewed view of Manhood thus increasing the chances of a cycle of violence and abuse. Being there and a part of the discussion provided a platform to help change that view. Simply put, we provided the youth with another perspective…a positive perspective. Not to suggest that some of the youth did not already have positive male role models, but more re-enforcement can’t hurt. These youth are vital because they have a voice and can be advocates in getting the Jenesse message out. They will also be leaders and influencers of tomorrow. By providing them with a broad set of exposures today, we are equipping them to not only survive, but also to thrive in an ever changing and complex world. I only hope my words resonated with them.”
   2. Coordinated Community Response Network- A network of organizations who together will ensure access to community resources and provide a victim-centered response to domestic
   violence, teen dating violence, sexual assault, stalking and other youth issues. Our Memorandum of Understanding Partners include: Watts Healthcare Corporation, Green Dot Public Schools Animo (Alain) Leroy Locke High School, South Central Training Consortium, and Los Angeles Police Department/Wilshire Area Leadership Academy.
