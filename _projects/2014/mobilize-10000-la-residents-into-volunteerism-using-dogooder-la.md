Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Nothing connects Los Angelenos more than our mobile phones. They are
  everywhere. You're almost lost without one. So, how do we increase
  volunteerism using the power of cellphone? 
   
   Well, its not by just creating a regular mobile app that lists volunteer opportunities. That’s been done. 
   
   Its by creating an volunteering app that gives Los Angelenos tangible rewards for completing what we call "tracks" which are full immersion volunteering experiences and allowing you do it with your friends.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: |-
  Introducing our mobile app called DoGooder.LA
   
   The apps shows you curated volunteer opportunities from all over the Los Angeles basin, even those you didn't even know existed, and lumps them into fun and exciting "tracks" that you can start immediately and invite your friends to join through social media.
   
   A "Track" consist of 3-6 volunteer opportunities, each called "steps", lumped together. For example, if Homeless was your "track", one day your "step" may include serving in the kitchen at Skid Row's Union Rescue Mission. The next day, your "step" may include helping build temporary homeless shelters with Habitat for Humanity in Santa Monica. The following day, your “step” may included could be passing blankets with Urban Possibilities under cold freeway bridges along the 110 at midnight.
   
   By following each “step” within a “track”, you fully immerse yourself in your chosen area instead of just the limited experience you get by attending a one time volunteering event.
   
   As you complete your "steps", your accumulate reward points. Once you complete the entire track, you’ll receive online badges to proudly showcase your accomplishments and be able to redeem your points towards rewards like free Starbucks Coffee, Six Flags tickets, free lunches at Chipotle, gas cards and other items through our local business partners. Or, if you want, you can donate your points to the charity of your choice for charities to redeem. 
   
   There will be multiple categories of curated volunteering experiences from Environmental Tracks, Homeless Tracks, Children's Track, Mentorship tracks, Animal Track, Social Tracks, Health Tracks, and additional categories giving you you full immersion into what it means to serve in LA. 
   
   In future developments, the app will allow users to curate their own “tracks” as well as a randomize “steps” within “tracks” to bring an element of surprise to volunteerism.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  According the The Urban Institute's Center for Nonprofits and Philanthropy in
  2012, there are over 40,000 nonprofits and charitable causes in LA. By 2050,
  that number could easily double, if not triple, and so will volunteer
  opportunities. 
   
   LA needs a better way of making volunteer opportunities known and attractive by integrating technology such as social media and mobile apps like DoGooder.LA to stay current and connected through 2050. 
   
   If not, as technology gets more integrated with our lives and we become more of a distracted society, less and less people will likely not initiate volunteerism on their own as evident by falling volunteerism rates nationwide over the past 10 years. 
   
   That’s why our app strives to not only lay a clear path to find LA-based, full immersion volunteering experiences with rewards, but through volunteerism, connect LA residents to other people who share the same passion and values and build a more connected Los Angeles well into and beyond 2050.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: |-
  We believe this app can affect Los Angeles in three specific sectors:
   
   Nonprofits - Access volunteers that otherwise would have been unreachable due to limited reach or limited marketing resources. 
   
   Community - Los Angelenos experience volunteerism without barriers to entry and providing a clear path to volunteerism. And, helping people make connections with people who share the same passion.
   
   Business & LA Commerce - Users will want to frequent businesses that rewards and support community causes by using their reward points.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  We currently have confirmed partnerships with World Harvest Food Banks, Union
  Rescue Mission (Skid Row), Women's Center for Alcoholism, Just For Detention,
  and Urban Possibilities and numerous other causes to provide volunteerism
  opportunities and resources. We have worked with these organization in past
  volunteerism programs.
   
   We will work hard to curate additional organizations to create “tracks” with meaningful volunteer opportunities, which you normally would not find on your own and to help increase awareness to less-exposed causes in LA. 
   
   For user reward system, we will curate companies and business to provide giveaways, coupons, and more for Los Angelenos who complete “tracks” at retailers such as Starbucks, Target, Best Buy, clothing stores, and more.
