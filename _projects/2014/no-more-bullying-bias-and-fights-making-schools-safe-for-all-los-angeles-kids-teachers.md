  WJC will provide a mix of programs for students and educators to teach them
  about bias, bullying and conflict resolution, and to give them the support
  needed to create and sustain safe and inclusive school environments. The ABCs
  of Conflict will train 40 to 60 LA County K-12 educators (at no cost to them)
  to resolve conflict positively, to teach their students to do the same, and to
  create and run peer mediation programs in their schools. Potential
  participants in the five-day, 30-hour The ABCs of Conflict training will
  complete an online application. Since ongoing support is key to sustaining a
  safe and inclusive school, each educator will show personal and organizational
  commitment to creating new or nurturing conflict resolution or anti-bias
  programs at her or his school. 
   
   WJC Program Director Emily Linnemeier and mediator Jason Harper will conduct Days 1-3: the basics of conflict; understanding and dealing with conflict positively; and the role of culture, identity and power in conflict. Educators will learn to use mediation and arbitration to solve conflicts; they’ll learn to set up a peer mediation program. WJC Associate Executive Director Lori Nelson and student actors from our Encompass Service Learning Class at Los Angeles County High School for the Arts will focus on bias and the educator’s role in bullying prevention and intervention on Day 4. Restorative Justice specialist Schoene Mahmood will conclude the training. 
   
   All participants will have access to Haven School Tools, an online source of information and lessons about conflict resolution, bias and bullying. The site also has talking points and videos that show the need, efficacy, and value of these programs. These materials help teachers gain support from administrators to work on creating a safe and welcoming climate.
   
   We’ll celebrate peer mediators at our annual Peer Mediation Invitational where elementary, middle and high school students can sharpen their skills in mock mediations, receive coaching and talk with peer mediators from other schools in LA County.
   
   High school mediators and their advisors will be invited to join Haven, our social network for students who are members of organizations (peer mediation groups, anti-bullying clubs, gay-straight alliances) working to make their schools safer and more inclusive. Haven gives these teens 24/7 access to videos, interactive training modules about conflict resolution and prejudice reduction,and forums.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  What will an investment in WJC make happen? This year, students and educators
  in 50 LA County schools will learn to create more just schools and
  communities. They’ll make places where kids feel safe and welcomed, schools
  where students want to be. There will be less anger, less fear, more
  understanding and acceptance. Schools will be places where kids can achieve,
  where they learn to their full potential.
   
   The National Education Association estimates that every day, tens of thousands of kids choose to stay home and not go to school. They are frightened, desperately unhappy. To these students, school is a place where they are not safe, where they are not wanted. It’s not a place to learn. They don’t do well, they act out, get suspended and fall behind academically and emotionally. Then they drop out...or they stay, miserable and distracted, never achieving their full potential. Instead, let’s make school a place to learn!
   
   The ABCs of Conflict, Peer Mediation Invitational, Haven and Haven School Tools teach kids, teens and adults to change the ways they think about differences and how they respond to conflict. Those lessons – about solving conflicts collaboratively, that you don’t have to be afraid or hateful of difference – go home. They go into the community.
    
   Much of a child’s life is spent in the classroom. His or her performance there has ramifications far into the future – in terms of socioeconomics, health, happiness. But too often educators and students are unschooled about how to resolve disputes, even small ones that disrupt the learning environment, or how to understand and accept difference and to work against bullying and bias. 
   
   That’s where WJC programs make a lasting difference. Educators and students learn about conflict, bullying and bias…how it plays out in class and on campus, how she or he can stop it. Some teachers even start student-run mediation programs. Teens working to make their schools safe and welcoming are supported by peers as part of our social network exclusively for high school students and their advisers. Teachers, students, families – anyone with a stake in resolving conflicts peacefully and making schools safe – have online access to lessons and helpful tips.
   
   This is the future you’re creating for Los Angeles with an investment in WJC as part of LA2050: schools where kids are safe and happy and achieve to their full potential, communities that welcome rather than intimidate.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Forty to 60 K-12 educators from schools across Los Angeles County will
  participate at WJC headquarters in a five-day, 30-hour session of The ABCs of
  Conflict. WJC will select a group of participants that reflects a variety of
  experiences and perspectives. Educators will represent diverse school types –
  public, charter, and secular and non-secular private – and a range of
  socioeconomics, ethnicity and race. The majority will teach underserved
  students. This selection enriches the training, creating the potential for
  both positive and difficult interactions based on difference – an element that
  underlies conflict and that educators and students often do not know how to
  address in a positive way.
   
   On average, each educator will teach 150 students a year. That means that the 40-60 educators trained in The ABCs of Conflict – in solving disputes positively and working against bias and bullying – will directly and positively affect 9000 students. In turn, these students will have better interactions with countless others at school and beyond.
   
   Another 30-hour session of The ABCs of Conflict will comprise on-site training for the full 15-member staff of LAUSD K-5 Village Charter Academy in Canoga Park. The Academy is opening in August 2014. The school’s co-directors have invited WJC to help create, from day one, a culture of inclusion and safety. The Academy will enroll up to 250 students, the majority being English learners from underserved populations. 30-40 4th and 5th graders will be trained as peer mediators. Again, they will positively affect family, friends and community.
   
   The approximately100 peer mediators at our Peer Mediation Invitational attend elementary, middle and high schools throughout Los Angeles County. WJC will invite current and former participants of The ABCs of Conflict to send their student mediators to the event, and will also invite students from any LA County peer mediation program. In addition, dozens of adult mediators, educators and judges and lawyers from the WJC Board volunteer to coach, mediate and present.
   
   Approximately 50 high school groups (500 students and advisors) that are addressing bullying, prejudice or violence issues will join Haven social network next year. Additionally, more than 1000 teachers, parents, students, grandparents –anyone interested in understanding conflict resolution, bias and bullying and what an individual can do – will use Haven School Tools.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  WJC depends on collaborators – funders, participants and program specialists –
  to help create and implement our programs. We seek funding from individuals,
  foundations and corporations that share our commitment to creating schools
  that are safe and welcoming and that in turn create a Los Angeles that is more
  civil, just and peaceful. For example, WJC is committed to delivering The ABCs
  of Conflict at no cost to educators. In addition to individual, foundation and
  corporate support, WJC will encourage districts and individual schools to help
  defray costs through providing professional development funds that replace the
  modest stipend WJC gives teachers as part of this program since they typically
  attend on their own time. Village Charter Academy, with the full backing of
  its co-directors, has already agreed to include this program in their teacher
  training and to assist with raising funds; they are collaborating with us to
  create a healthy, safe and inclusive school environment.
   
   Our Encompass Service Learning Class is a collaboration with Los Angeles County High School for the Arts (LACHSA). Student actors and artists from LACHSA demonstrate the impact of homophobia, racial bias and bullying on the classroom; they work in our Peer Mediation Invitational; Creating Bias-Free Classrooms; Haven and Haven School Tools programs.
   
   Haven is currently being tested by a volunteer team of 50 students and educators from LACHSA, Social Justice Schools: Global Issues Academy and University High School. They test the site and report needed fixes to the program consultant who is creating the site structure. The testers also evaluate content and technology to ensure that WJC is creating a user-friendly and youth-empowering product that addresses the needs of high school students committed to creating better schools.
   
   WJC values collaborations with the leadership and staff of individual schools. A single educator cannot create and/or sustain a safe and inclusive school; administrators and other school staff members must also support conflict resolution as a way to create a school climate that promotes learning. We look for this collaboration as we implement each program: educators who have the support of their administration to start an anti-bully or anti-bias or peer mediation program; a principal’s validation that students and advisers from his or her school should participate in Haven; a school’s suggestion that parents check out Haven School Tools.
