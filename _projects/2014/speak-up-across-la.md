Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  We want to present the voices of our future leaders. By 2050, the youth of
  today will be the generation that inherits Los Angeles. One of them may even
  be the mayor in 2050. So why are we not listening to them?
   
   We plan to film 50 young people across LA and develop 50 solution stories. These short films will be shown in nontraditional and traditional settings in communities throughout Los Angeles. These stories will inspire others to follow their passion and be the difference they want to see in their community. Viewers of these short films can learn from these stories and in turn new partnerships will form because of this candid and powerful form of sharing solutions.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  We plan to work with our team of students and mentors to film these stories
  across Los Angeles. We have broken up the yearlong project into four stages,
  outlined below. 
   
   Story Outreach (2 months) 
   • Brainstorm with team, mentors and partners. 
   • Create outreach strategy and implement outreach campaign and story website to collect stories across Los Angeles. 
   • Create criteria for story selection and clear format for filming, editing and the interview process. 
   • Visit elected offices, neighborhood councils, nonprofits and community centers to present on our mission and vision to document inspiring stories from our young people. 
   • Select 50 individuals evenly spread out across the five main regions of Los Angeles (South LA, East LA, Central LA, West Side and Valley) 
   
   Filming (6 months) 
   • Arrange film times with the young people to be interviewed.
   • Partner with local nonprofits to schedule interview locations. 
   • Film stories 
   
   Editing (2 months) 
   • Edit all footage
   • Meet with interviewees again if necessary
   • Complete all 50 two minute films
   
   Community Outreach (2 months) 
   • Arrange film screenings as conversations in local community locations. 
   • Arrange larger film screening in an open location (like Grand Park) in Central Los Angeles. 
   • Film screenings would allow youth and participants the opportunity to speak up after each film screening. We plan for break out conversations around the topics the stories evoke.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  It is our belief that young people have a need to give input and speak up. In
  the last years we have seen this in the students we work with and the staff on
  our team. When given the opportunity, they have the drive and ability to
  surprise us with amazing ideas. Through genuine listening and authentic
  conversation we can tap into the fresh outlook and wisdom of youth in our
  currently estranged communities. The guidance and mentorship of invested,
  caring adults can help transform Los Angeles into a socially connected,
  civically active community.
   
   The program enables students to share a powerful story, an example of how they plan to be the change they see in their community. Young people will be able share how they give back and inspire others to step up in volunteer roles in their community, schools and city. Sharing stories among the community, residents create the type of human connections that play an important role in civic engagement, emotional intelligence and self-confidence we need to succeed and create a more connected LA.
   
   Our project will create a more engaged generation across Los Angeles and develop a line of stories that bind our experiences and commitment to give back. Once we present the stories in the communities they were born, the stories will be connected to others and potential partnerships will form. 
   
   By the simple act of documenting stories and listening to each other we also see our project impacting our society at 2050. These films will remind one another of our shared humanity, strengthen and build the connections between people and creating a culture of understanding in our higher risk communities in Los Angeles.
   
   Every movement of change needs a spark. These videos will create the spark. The film screenings will fan this energy and create conversations between people that will spread and continue for years. In the long run impacting the individual telling the story and the people who heard their story. 
   
   Each story will answer the questions: What legacy do they want to leave in their community? How do they see LA in 2050 if we all volunteered our time? How do they currently make an impact in their community? These videos could be the first step towards creating the impact that we need to transform our community.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Our project will benefit a variety of groups. First, the individual. The
  person who tells the story will be valued and listened to. Their story and
  ideas will be viewed by thousands. Through this message their own experiences
  will be honored and they will be empowered to continue their efforts in the
  community. These short videos will give young students a platform not only to
  find their voice, but to let that voice be heard across LA. By sharing their
  story, these students will become more confident in themselves, more
  empathetic towards their peers, and more committed to their community. These
  students will inspire others by the simple act of telling their story and
  sharing their solution ideas for an issue in their community. 
   
   Second, the individuals who hear the story will be engaged with the message and will be encouraged to find a way to partner with the storyteller. Through our film screening sessions we hope to inspire new partnerships and collaborative efforts through these stories and films. 
   
   Our Youth Speak Media Solutions team of students and mentors will also benefit from this project as they will experience the stories first hand during the time of production. Our team of students also become inspired to give back to their communities after capturing such powerful stories and witnessing the positive work organizations are doing across Los Angeles.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  We would love to partner with you! As a nonprofit we have worked with groups
  across Los Angeles, and we would love to hear from new young people and groups
  making an impact in LA.
   
   Currently we plan to work with and actively collaborate with the following nonprofit and business partners: Youth Justice Coalition, The Hub LA, New Leaders Council, Proyecto Pastoral, Boys and Girls Club of Venice, and Unusual Suspects Theatre Company. We plan to reach out to other established and grassroots organizations throughout Los Angeles in our target communities once the campaign is funded. 
   
   We hope to partner also with various marketing firms, public relation organizations and media outlets to communicate these stories to as broad of an audience as possible. Some of which include, MTA that could showcase these short films in bus routes across Los Angeles. We currently have media partnerships with LATV, CNN, NBC, Junker Wagner Marketing, Media Image Public Relations and AK Design Strategies. 
   
   Once funded we will also partner with civic leaders in our target communities along with local neighborhood councils and the elected council members in that district. We know that by partnering with elected leaders in local, city and state levels we can create conversations both at the community and policy levels to really affect change and give an avenue for the students solutions and voice.
