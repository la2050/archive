Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Start up education is a new frontier, and the Incubator School is one of its
  pioneers. As a free, diverse, open enrollment LAUSD public school that
  launched in 2013, we are bringing innovation to the second largest school
  district in the country. In fact, we're one of the only schools in the world
  working to combine entrepreneurship and schooling for middle and high school
  students. 
   
   We're designing a thoughtful and comprehensive program where we add one grade per year and each grade builds upon the previous one. Our goal is for students take ownership: of their passions, interests, and behavior, their relationship to their peers, communities, and world, the impact they want to have on that world. Our program grows studentsâ€™ collaborative capabilities and their ability to communicate to diverse audiences for diverse purposes. It also nurtures a solutions-orientation; we are training our students to empathize with others, assess needs, and deploy a variety of tools, techniques, and pathways to design responses to problems they see around them. In our program students explore non-profit projects and for-profit ones, and learn about social entrepreneurship as well as the fast paced world of Silicon Beach. We engage our learners in exploring the ethics of different choices and the impact of different decisions. In short, we start up students to become 21st century citizens.
   
   To accomplish this, we are continually testing, experimenting, and iterating. We observe and measure what works and what doesn't. We seek feedback from all our stakeholders. To start up students, we need to stay small and agile like a start up company. 
   
   Building such a responsive comprehensive program, as well as an online playbook that enables us to extend our reach to anyone who wants to borrow or adapt our program, requires time. Time, of course, means people. As a small LAUSD public school in a system that determines budgets based on the number of pupils, we were allocated 2.6 teachers last year; this year we have 6. Yet, these early years require the greatest amount of research and development, partnership-building, and training. 
   
   We will use the grant to hire additional staff to enable us to build out our program as well as our playbook to share our program. We will also use the funds to help grow the expertise of our teachers and bring in expert partners to help us design 21st century learning experiences.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Los Angeles is the third most vibrant startup economy in the world, yet that
  energy has not made its way into our city's schools. We want to change that.
  Schools and the ideas of young people should be the drivers of the future and
  feed their visions into the startup world. Los Angeles has to tap youthful,
  out-of-the-box thinking to grow the economy towards LA2050. For this to
  happen, learning in LA needs to flow in every direction through the vast,
  diverse interconnected ecosystem that is our city. The Incubator School is a
  connector that facilitates this flow.
   
   In an ecosystem every part is dependent on every other part, and needs to learn to value the other parts. We work with everyone to connect the complex and exciting parts of Los Angeles' learning energy.
   
   We bring social and for-profit entrepreneurs into our school to share their expertise so that our students absorb starting up as a mindset. We retrain teachers to collaborate with funders, engineers, artists, chief technology officers, game developers, conservationists, designers, and other experts to design curricula that reflect the 21st century. As they work with our teachers and students, these experts and entrepreneurs also learn from our students and teachers, thereby impacting how they think about the world. 
   
   We work with large and small companies as well as non-profits and service organizations. Our students have conference calls with CTOs of companies whose learning products and games they beta test. They were some of the first middle schoolers to work with LA Audubon Society; they proposed redesigns of Dockweiler Beach so that its facilities could meet the needs of both humans and the federally threatened snowy plover. Our students created apps that anyone in the city can use (free augmented reality apps for the Ballona Wetlands). Through these interactions, not only do our students change but so do the organizations with whom they work. They come to see middle schools as possible thought partners.
   
   We collaborate with foundations and other schools to launch conferences where students, adults, teachers, administrators, game designers, technology companies, nonprofits, and arts organizations connect and share expertise (innovatED.LA). Our students and staff participate in Startup Weekends, hackathons, makerspaces. 
   
   We connect as many parts of the ecosystem together as we can so learning can flow freely, and our playbook will extend this connecting even further.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  We are a diverse, integrated LAUSD public school that anyone can attend: last
  year 39% of our students were low income, 47% were Latino, 32% White, 16%
  African American, 5% Asian; 19% Special Education, 15% Gifted and Talented.
  Our project will most immediately benefit them. This year we are expanding
  from 62 6th-7th graders to about 140 6th-8th graders. Each year we will add
  one additional grade. 
   
   However, our reach extends beyond our school. We host visiting teachers, administrators, foundations, non-profits, etc, every week. The US Department of Education and the State Department have visited us, as have delegations and journalists from Thailand, Korea, Japan, and China. Since we were featured on BBC News on July 4th, we've received requests for information and curriculum from England, Ireland, Hungary, Chile, India, Italy, Romania, and throughout the United States. Our free online playbook would allow what we're doing to spread all through the world. 
   
   Our goal, however, is to change education in Los Angeles. We want our students to become change agents even more than they are already. We want them to change what Los Angeles expects from its students, and we want the Incubator School to change what Los Angeles expects from its schools.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  We partner with many organizations to grow our programs (New Learning
  Institute of the Pearson Foundation, LA Audubon, CoderDojo, GameDesk,
  Playmaker, Joan Ganz Cooney Center @ Sesame Workshop, Institute of Play,
  Everyone On, Pearson PLC), but for this grant we will be partnering with the
  Los Angeles chapter of the Network For Teaching Entrepreneurship to build our
  capacity to teach entrepreneurship and create a playbook for launching
  startups during middle and high school. 
   
   NFTE's mission is to provide programs that inspire young people from low-income communities to stay in school, to recognize business opportunities, and to plan for successful futures. To do so NFTE runs during- and after-school programs, as well as NFTE University, a mini-MBA program for teachers to train them in entrepreneurial thinking and practices. NFTE's programs have reached over 7,800 students in Los Angeles since 2007, and over 500,000 nationally. 
   
   The Incubator School believes that schools of LA2050 must be entrepreneurial. They need to understand the expertise they bring to the table, and work with others to grow that expertise as well as share it. Exchanges and partnerships need to be mutual. 
   
   We deeply value the expertise NFTE's mini-MBA program will bring to our instructional staff and plan to have NFTE train them. 
   
   However, we also plan to help grow NFTE's programs. Their middle school curriculum leads students to creating a business concept while their high school curriculum has students creating a business plan. 
   
   Our goal is for students actually to launch startups: in 8th grade in the school, and in 12th grade in the real world in Silicon Beach. 
   
   Our collaboration will thus enable both organizations to expand our capacities. 
   
   Three critical factors are:
   
   1) mutual growth
   2) the ability of both organizations to dedicate staff time to the collaboration
   3) the ability of both organizations to extend the reach of the curricula the collaboration develops
   
   We have not worked together in the past, but we greatly look forward to working together in the future.
