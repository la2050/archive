  FFFRW is an established program and has been running successfully since 2010.
  Currently, Crossroads residents work with Claremont College students enrolled
  in the Political Economy of Food course at Scripps College to build the FFFRW
  enterprise. The enterprise funds the women and students who participate in a
  weekly Meatless Mondays program, in which they prepare and share a home-cooked
  meal at the Crossroads house. The enterprise has also funded two flourishing
  vegetable gardens at the Crossroads residences that provide fresh healthy
  produce and help the women and students learn gardening skills in a supportive
  therapeutic environment.
   
   In the next year, our project will invest in programming and equipment to build capacity for the social enterprise. 
   
   We will begin by establishing a co-op that Crossroads graduates can elect to join. We will expand production to two days per week and pay the graduates an hourly wage in addition to sweat equity. As part of their membership and participation in the co-op, the women will be enrolled in the Social Entrepreneurs Academy with 4 hours of instruction per week. To enable participation in the academy, we will pay the women a stipend for completion of the course. 
   
   In addition, we will work with students and faculty at the Claremont Colleges in the fall semester to develop a curriculum for the Social Entrepreneurs Academy. The curriculum will include instruction in accounting, marketing, alternative business models, and other business skills as well as guest lectures and case studies.
   
   Finally, we plan to invest in needed infrastructure to help make our enterprise more efficient. Crossroads women and students learn a lot from their work together in the kitchen, including how to produce and handle food, provide excellent customer service, and support coworkers. By investing in equipment and streamlining our process, we will be able to spend more time teaching the “big picture,” like what it takes to manage a business and what it means to be a social entrepreneur.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Bell Hooks says: To be truly visionary we have to root our imagination in our
  concrete reality while simultaneously imagining possibilities beyond that
  reality.
   
   One third of the California prison population comes from Los Angeles County and about 85% of convictions are for non-violent crimes. These statistics clearly indicate that a significant number of formerly incarcerated persons will be returning to Los Angeles County at some point in time. To overcome the stigma and stereotypes of incarceration, an evening of the playing field is necessary for a person to become a productive member of the community. A better LA means a community building relationships socially, economically, politically, environmentally, and academically. These relationships embrace each person, regardless of his/her background, with the encouragement, support, and opportunity to reach their full potential. Support provides hope for change. Opportunity makes change possible. LA becomes a thriving environment where individuals are empowered and the community becomes more cohesive.
   
   Providing services for formerly incarcerated women for over 40 years has taught Crossroads to see the bigger picture that addresses systemic change and compels us to further action. It has been said that working with one woman affects seven generations. Teaching soft skills like how to keep a job while managing sobriety, family, work and self, empowers women as they move from surviving in their environment to thriving in the community.
   
   Universities have an anchoring power unlike practically any other for-profit or nonprofit institution. By building strong ties between the Claremont Colleges and the surrounding region, we are creating a culture of collaboration that is designed to last well past 2050. The coupling of education and community involvement is what makes our program so special. 
   
   In 2050, there will be problems we haven’t anticipated. Our project will equip people from all walks of life to be able to think creatively and adapt to the needs of a changing world.

  Our project directly benefits three groups: the Crossroads residents and
  graduates, the Claremont College community, and the larger community of Los
  Angeles County.
   
   
   1. Crossroads Residents and Graduates: 
   Since 1974, Crossroads has been providing services to women in Los Angeles County recently released from prison. Our primary goal is to empower formerly incarcerated women by teaching new skills and helping them achieve economic self-sufficiency. Formerly incarcerated women are a group of homeless women with significant and multi-layered needs. In terms of socioeconomic status, the women who come to Crossroads are generally destitute. In the past five years, almost all of our residents have served a life sentence. The average length of stay for our residents who served a life sentence was 23.4 years and their average age is 52 years. Our six-month Residential Program serves about 34 formerly incarcerated women per year. Our graduates enthusiastically keep in contact with Crossroads, and continue to work and live in Los Angeles County. Many have reunited with family and many now have significant work experience (even those women who served over 20 years in prison.) Graduates reach success in their chosen field of employment. Most graduates have worked multiple years in their jobs and many have been promoted to management positions. One graduate shared that she has worked as office manager in a doctor’s office for three years and completed her bachelor’s degree. With the help from this grant, we will expand our services to include more support for the women who have graduated from the residential program.
   
   
   2. Claremont College Community:
   College students are future change-makers. They will go on to lead non-profit organizations and businesses, advocate for policy and reform, and become engaged members of our community. Some students who have participated in FFFRW have changed their major as a result of their experience with Crossroads. One 2013 graduate remarked that “when we first began, we did not realize that the heart and soul of our internship, and perhaps of all food and social justice issues, was the community that we were able to create.”
   
   
   3. LA County Community:
   The backdrop of everything we do is educating the larger community about the incarcerated. We connect the public to the faces of the criminal justice system and demonstrate that people who have been incarcerated can become productive, engaged members of society.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Established in 2010, FFFRW is an existing collaboration between Crossroads and
  Scripps College. Crossroads has been collaborating with Scripps College in
  various capacities for over a decade. The FFFRW collaboration has
  institutional support from Scripps College, which includes administrative and
  managerial support from the Sustainable Entrepreneurship Fellow, as well as
  internship credit granted for the course practicum component of the Political
  Economy of Food course.
   
   In the past, Crossroads has collaborated with marketing students from the Drucker School of Management. We plan to deepen our collaboration with Drucker through the development of the Social Entrepreneurs Academy; however, a formal collaboration with Drucker has not yet been established. We have also collaborated with faculty from the Claremont Colleges. Dr. Nancy Neiman Auerbach teaches the Political Economy of Food course and serves as the creative director of FFFRW. In addition, Kim Drake, a Scripps English professor, taught writing workshops for the Crossroads residents and compiled their stories into a book published in 2013 titled Stinging for their Suppers. The possibility of connecting with additional resources and accessing expertise from the Claremont College community is significant. 
   In addition, we have active partnerships with the local Claremont community. Fred and Julianne Baumann generously donate fresh fruit from their 2.5 acre backyard on a weekly basis to create our jams. We have also established relationships with the Prison Library Project, Uncommon Good, and Randy Beckendam, the owner of Amy’s Farm, a social justice oriented farm. 
    
   There are several factors critical to the continued success of these collaborations. First, continued support from Scripps College is key. The collaboration with Scripps College has been institutionalized and made a core part of the curriculum and educational mission of the college, receiving significant funding from the office of the President. In addition, we rely on community involvement and fruit donations for our jams. Finally, Crossroads has made FFFRW part of their comprehensive reentry program and the core of their food justice initiative.
