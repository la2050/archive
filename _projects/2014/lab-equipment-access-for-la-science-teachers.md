title: Lab Equipment Access for LA Science Teachers
project_summary: >-
  We want to empower teachers to increase student engagement by lending teachers
  our equipment and helping them to use their own equipment.

Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  We want to visit science teachers at fifteen or more different Title I schools
  in Los Angeles. We want to do three things for or with them during these
  visits:
   
   1. We will find out which science lessons they currently run without hands-on experiences due only to a lack of equipment and technical support.
   
   2. We will schedule the loan (delivery or pickup and return) of the necessary equipment items and technical support directly from our organization, if we have the equipment; if not, we will find feasible ways to obtain said equipment either by us for loan, or by the teacher to own.
   
   3. If the teacher has a storage space on campus that houses old science equipment that may be unknown or in states of disrepair, then we will identify and repair those items and show the teacher how to use them.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  All over the country, disadvantaged kids sit through (or choose not to sit
  through) science classes where the major activities are pencil-pushing and
  page-turning. Our project will change this for over 1,500 students this year
  in Los Angeles. Next year, those same science teachers will continue to borrow
  our equipment; they will no longer need as much technical support, so even
  without funding we could manage to maintain the difference. 
   
   This means that one year of funding can bring hands-on lab experiences on a regular basis to over 1,500 new students every year. Kids will grow up learning science by doing, instead of only via the more passive, bookish routes. 
   
   Some of these kids will choose to pursue careers in science due to interests sparked by those teachers (our collaborators). LA will see a new generation of adults who have more awareness of science and the scientific method. Future generations will grow up with parents who foster an interest in science. Some of those who decided on careers in science will bring jobs in science back to LA, finding that LA has become a hotbed of science knowledge and technical skills. The market for informal learning opportunities will grow here, for the following generations. Innovation and invention will grow, solving problems using new technologies here. The low-income workforce will be replaced gradually by a high-income, high-tech one, mostly because of the hands-on science experiences that kids have had at school. The tech sector will keep on giving back to those schools, and those teachers will be accoladed and honored. LA will end up being the best place to learn.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Our project will benefit students at fifteen or more Title I LA public
  schools; thus, the specific LA population that will benefit from our work is
  the LA population of lowest economic means.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Without a budget, we have managed to work with five teachers at five different
  schools on a very limited basis over the past three years. Four of these five
  are confirmed collaborators (one of the five will move to a more well-equipped
  school where she may no longer require our services). This grant would empower
  us to increase our impact with our confirmed collaborators into greater
  significance for their students. The grant would also allow us increase the
  number of our collaborators by triple or more.
   
   Each collaborator brings two things to our project: first, each brings their own influence and responsibility over the science education of over one hundred students annually; second, each brings their own expertise and energy in hands-on science education, which we can share with other collaborators.
   
   This is an annotated list of three critical factors to our collaboration.
   1. The collaborator's personal professional interest and commitment to working with us: hands-on science activities are not necessarily part of a teacher's job obligations, and there is often extra time and effort involved up front; we can therefore only work with teachers who have a strong interest in engaging their students in this way.
   2. The collaborator's particular needs: we're looking for teachers whose classroom needs fit our skills, experience, and equipment inventory in order to maximize our contribution to each collaborator's work.
   3. The collaborator's accessibility: we've found that the teachers whom we can serve best are those at schools located near our staff, near bus lines that our staff uses, or near university campuses from which we can recruit volunteers.
