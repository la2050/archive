  collaboration: "LAWF FPC is reaching out to volunteers to support it’s efforts.  This includes a number of voluntary flex teams.  Flex teams are committees of volunteers assigned to assist it in grass roots community outreach, development of preliminary maps and plans, market strategies, and obtaining funding, among other duties and responsibilities.  The term “Flex” is used to identify them with this new type of hybrid corporation to take advantage of provisions of both profit and non-profit organizations.  This project will network the members of these teams, as necessary and appropriate, to achieve the objectives.  This application is presented under the authority of Dotty Kaminsky, Executive Director of LAWF FPC, with the approval of the Board.  The staff, advisors and volunteers listed below are assigned by her to participate in the project, as necessary. Allocation of Grant funds will be distributed by the LAWF, FPC as outlined in budget summary. The extended team will include accomplished businessmen, architects, developers, educators, government leaders, event producers, artists and entertainers, journalists, and others willing to dedicate time and effort to this cause.\r\n\r\nActive members of this team who have expressed the desire to collaborate include, but are not limited to the following by name, title, and added benefit to the project:  \r\n      Name                           \tTitle/Benefit Area\r\n•\tDotty Kaminsky, \t\tExecutive Director/ Marketing\r\n•\tRobert Vanech, \t\tBoard Chairman/Finance\r\n•\tJefferson Schierbeek, \tBoard Member, DMPC Co-Lead/ Design\r\n•\tRandy Vane, \t\t        Board Member, SVP/Marketing \r\n•\tThomas DeVoss,\t\tDMPC Co-Lead/Design\r\n•\tSharla Russell,\t\tDMPC Co-Lead/Planning \r\n•\tMarcela Oliva, \t\tDMPC Member/Design \r\n•\tJuanita Price,\t\t        ITCC Secretary/Outreach \r\n•\tLynda Wilson, \t\tITCC Co-Lead/Outreach \r\n•\tGaston Mantero,  \t\tITCC Co-Lead/Outreach \r\n•\tJohn Bollinger, \t\tAdvisor, ITCC Co-Lead/Outreach \r\n•\tEric Vollmer, Advisor,   ITTC Member; Outreach\r\n•\tBarry Howard, \t\tAdvisor/Design \r\n•\tArmen Martin, \t\tAdvisor/Legal\r\n\r\nThree factors critical to the success of this collaboration are: \r\n1.\tAvailability of sufficient funding to cover the proposed outreach effort,  \r\n2.\tDevelopment of the strategic plan to be used by participants in their outreach efforts, and \r\n3.\tEffective administration collaborative outreach efforts toward achieving the overall objectives of the project.  \r\n"

  evaluate: "During the first year success of the project will be measured using the following three specific metrics:\r\n1.\tCompletion of schematic design and identification of a location for Pavilion Zero, a draft or final strategic plan for implementing the LAWF, and enlisting the participation of LA Metro in coordinating the development of new transit facilities with the development of fairgrounds.\r\n2.\tNumber of individuals and organizations volunteering to participate and support the promotion, development and operation of the LAWF beginning during the grant period.  1000 or more entities enlisted will be considered a “success.”  \r\n3.\tNumber of public meetings and events in which our collaborators participate, and the number of people attending and informed at those activities.  Staging of 10 or more events involving attendance of 1000 people or more will be considered a “success.”\r\n"
  two_lessons: "1.\tA world’s fairs is a large public fair of international scope and reach, typically staged over a period of time ranging up to six months.  A world’s fair is often staged as a means of stimulating the growth and development of international trade, commerce, science, education, art, culture and tourism in a region which offers distinctive themes of general or special benefit to the world.  The vision of the LAWF will act as a catalyst for meaningful and lasting change throughout this region and beyond by generating extraordinary economic growth and opportunity and integrating public transit into the fabric of the City.  Thus the proposed theme for the LAWF is “The Connected City.” \r\n2.\tThe economy of the region signal why the time is right for the LAWF. Greater Los Angeles has $575 billion a year economy, expected to grow by 50% in the next ten years; a consumer market of 18.1 million people; a labor force of more than 4.9 million; 14 leading trade industry clusters creating 2.3 million jobs; the 19th largest economy in the world;  100 consulates and an international community which speaks over 140 languages, making it one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse populations in the world;  121 universities, colleges and educational institutions, including world-class research universities.  It is the creative capital of the World hosting such industries as Performing Arts, Architectural and Interior Design, Entertainment, Motion Pictures, Music, Toys, Automotive Design, Information and Communications Design and Programming, Fashion, Multi and Digital Media, Furniture Design, Biotechnology, Sustainable Technologies and Advanced Medicine, to name just a few.  It is the premier gateway for trade from the Pacific Rim, Canada, Mexico and Latin America to the lucrative consumer market in the United States of America.  It’s two ports handle $380 billion in exports and imports.  Five airports in the region carry over 84 million passengers, and have an economic impact of over $20 billion on the local economy.  Public investment in the County includes $30 billion in rail and bus transportation; $4 billion in airport modernization and $2 billion in Port modernization.  These infrastructure improvements will better connect international visitors enabling regional rail, bus and highway transportation to better serve local communities.  The LAWF will weave these resources into a paradigm for a bright future for the region, the Nation and the world.\r\n\r\n"
  achievable_goal: "The LAWF is expected to be implemented over the next TEN YEARS.  The effort was begun with a “Start-up” phase in 2013 during which initial planning and strategy were formulated, monthly outreach meetings were scheduled, and flex teams began to be formed.  In 2014-2015, the grant year LAWF is engaged in the “Exploratory” phase, aimed at completing the the development of the strategic plan, the blueprint for Pavilion Zero, raising initial funds, developing criteria, standards and procedures for subsequent phases, and community outreach for membership, participation and sponsorship.  Achieving the latter goals will enable the subsequent “Launch” phase between 2016 and 2022, when the LAWF will be engaged in aggressive sales, obtaining sponsorship, negotiating and entering into purchase, joint ventures and development agreements  for acquisition, design and development of fairgrounds around the region, and overseeing the completion of venues and ancillary facilities of the LAWF.  Between 2022 and 2024 the project will enter the “Operation” phase, during which LAWF FPC will oversee the operation of the LAWF for two years and possibly beyond.\r\n \r\nDuring the current Exploratory phase, the project team has already begun the process of drafting the strategic plan, identifying and establishing resource contacts in the community to achieve the enterprise objectives.  Some members of the team have been working for a year or more on this enterprise.  Research on other world’s fairs has been done, a theme has been selected, flex teams have been formed, preliminary plans, schedules and budgets have been drawn.  Team members have the experience, strength and confidence that these objectives can be reached and exceeded within the next year.  This grant will insure that the job is done effectively and with the proper level of commitment of time and effort to successfully achieve this phase of the project. \r\n"
  major_challenges: "1.\tPublic skepticism.  This frequently occurs during the early pre-development stages of a large project, when the vision and plan are still being formulated, funding for the project appears out of reach, and the credibility of the project has not yet been tested.   This challenge will be overcome by:  Assembling a team of highly qualified and experienced professionals capable of organizing and managing all stages of project implementation; attracting leaders in business, finance, government, development, trade and culture both within and outside the community and convincing them to participate; formulating a theme, concept and vision which is expansive and inclusive of all segments of the community; informing and promoting support both in and outside the community, particularly internationally.\r\n\r\n2.\tAttracting sufficient funding to jumpstart implementation.  Funding obtained from the grant $100,000 will be to leverage to reach or come close to reaching the goals of the Launch phase, including real estate feasibility studies, preliminary designs, and executing necessary joint power and development agreements, acquiring property, sponsors, developers and operators, and development of fairgrounds and ancillary facilities. \r\n"
  competition: "It is not unusual for several cities in a state or region to propose world’s fairs.  In the early 19th Century the cities of San Diego and San Francisco competed to get Federal and State support for their proposed World’s Fairs.  Planning for both fairs was started in 1909 to celebrated the anticipated opening of the Panama Canal 1914 and attract increased trade to the respective cities in order to stimulate the economy. Ultimately, both cities held fairs in 1915 years, and San Diego extended it’s fair through 1917.  The City of Los Angeles was asked to participate in both of the fairs.   Other organizations worldwide have proposed world’s fairs and expositions include cities of Milan, Astana, Dubai, Copenhagen, Canary Islands, Newcastle, Houston, London, Paris, and San Francisco.   Some of these have already been schedule for 2020 and 2022.\r\n\r\nThe original concept for the LAWF was to celebrate the completion of the high speed rail link between Los Angeles and San Francisco by staging the world’s fair simultaneously in both cities and linking the venues with high speed rail.  Since the completion of high speed rail has been delayed, LAWF proceeded on its own with the concept of using regional rail to create “The Connected City.”  The LAWF, FPC is the only entity which has presently declared the intent to do a world’s fair in Los Angeles.  The LAWF will be unique from all other world’s fairs presently planned in a number of ways. First, others are staged in one campus or fairground, whereas LA’s will be distributed at numerous venues around Greater Los Angeles.  Second, most other fairs are held for up to six months and then demolished,  whereas THE LAWF’s will be staged for two years or more and many of the structures will be maintained or reused or repurposed for continuing uses in the communities where they are built.  The LAWF is presently projected to be held for two years beginning in 2022.  This schedule is subject to the success of the project in attracting support and financing during the Exploratory phase between 2014 and 2015."
  cost: "This grant project proposal will be managed utilizing the $100,000.  The goals achieved with the grant $100,000 funding will be used at this preliminary stage to leverage additional participation and investment to conduct real estate feasibility studies and prepare preliminary designs, and execute necessary joint power and development agreements.  These funds will be raised variously through sponsorships, subscriptions, bonds, and financing raised by public and private entities who enlist to participate in development and operation of the LAWF, not unlike the methods used on other world’s fairs.  \r\n"
