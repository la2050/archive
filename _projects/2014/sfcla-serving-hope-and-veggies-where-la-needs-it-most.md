Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  We train and supply the professional theater artists, and continue our 20 year
  relationship with services at the Veterans Administration such as New
  Directions, the Salvation Army, and the California State Home for Veterans, as
  well as other veteran homes and services all over Los Angeles in serving their
  clients (the veterans), but on a larger scale than before by supplying more
  artists in order to serve 100 vets. We arrange for the meeting space, and then
  rent the theater spaces for performance
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Scientific testing at the UCLA Semel Institute has shown that among those who
  suffer mental illness, participation in Imagination Workshop's theater
  workshops for the mentally ill leads to a higher functioning, better life,
  which includes improved social skills, higher functioning in job interviews,
  the establishing of ego boundaries through the experience of creating and
  embodying fictional characters, better participation in groups and programs,
  and the ability to stay out of the hospital. Our work with homeless veterans
  and those suffering PTSD in the past has been very successful and helped
  hundreds of vets live fuller lives. By helping 100 Los Angeles veterans live
  healthier lives, we help La become the healthiest place to live today. By
  creating a continuing program that reaches out and serves this many vets every
  year, we help make a heathy LA in 2050.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Our project will directly benefit 100 homeless veterans and veterans suffering
  PTSD, their families, and their community. Through professional theater
  presentations, we will reach audiences of several hundred theater-goers and
  share with them the nature of our work and the needs of our veterans.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  In 2012, IW, with a a grant from Metabolic Studio, led 20 weekly sessions at
  the Calvet Center with 40 senior vets and homeless vets from the California
  State Home for Veterans and the Salvation Army Veteran Home that resulted in
  an original theater production at the Odyssey theater, seen by 150 people.
  From 2000 to 2010, IW ran a weekly group of homeless veterans at New
  Directions that resulted in three original theater productions at Theater
  Theater and The Greenway Theater. All of these organizations have issued IW a
  standing invitation to work with their vets, but have not, of late, been able
  to fund our work. With funding, IW is definitely invited to work with these
  organizations.
