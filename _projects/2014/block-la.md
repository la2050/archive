Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  In the next year, LA Community Garden Council will help an additional 150
  low-income families grow healthy food in their neighborhood.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  We envision a community garden network for Los Angeles where people of all
  ages live healthy, active lives in a clean environment by growing fresh food
  in their neighborhood. This network enables healthy lifestyles by providing
  access to healthy food and getting people outdoors exercising through
  gardening. It fosters the meeting of people from diverse cultures to share the
  best growing techniques in order to practice sustainable urban agriculture
  while growing sustainable communities. 
   
   In the next year, LA Community Garden Council will build three new community gardens in low-income neighborhoods to ensure that at least 150 families can grow their own healthy food in their neighborhood.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Within the first year, the three new community gardens will provide access to
  healthy food and exercise for at least 150 low-income families in LA County.
  Healthcare professionals are starting to recognize the need for a holistic
  approach to preventative care and a healthy diet and exercise are key
  components of this. From the existing LA Community Garden Council gardens, we
  have evidence that gardeners lose weight in their first year of gardening,
  which helps to prevent Type 2 Diabetes, cholesterol, hypertension, and heart
  disease. Gardening is relaxing and therapeutic and helps patients with mental
  illness. By getting children outdoors to garden instead of indoors in front of
  computer screens, we will help to create positive childhood experiences. We
  will encourage gardeners to walk, bike or take public transport to their
  community garden for their health as well as the community’s health.
   
   Building new community gardens creates a healthier environment for local residents. We will seek to have land leases that extend beyond 2050 and, preferably, ensure that the land is used as green space in perpetuity. Teaching organic gardening techniques, including composting and seed collection, will ensure that the garden is sustainable and it will lower residents’ exposure to unhealthy toxins. We will have rainwater collection systems in the garden to ensure the best water conservation methods are followed and to reduce dependence on imported water. We will plant trees around the perimeter of the garden to increase the tree canopy cover.
   
   By focusing on low-income neighborhoods, we will help families to reduce their grocery bill by growing their own food. Ultimately, this reduces the number of households living below the self-sufficiency standard, builds more resilient communities, and helps to reduce rates of homelessness. 
   
   We are confident that this three-fold focus on (1) access to healthy food and active lifestyles, (2) creating a sustainable environment, and (3) addressing economic concerns in lower-income neighborhoods will help to make LA the healthiest place to live in 2050!
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Within six weeks of the completion of the new community gardens, at least 150
  low-income families in LA County will directly benefit from eating the fresh
  produce that they are growing, based on each garden having 50 gardeners. As
  most avid gardeners know, a single harvest is often too much for your
  immediate family to consume and so you soon find yourself spreading the wealth
  and giving away tomatoes, zucchini, mint, and other edibles to your extended
  family, neighbors, school friends, and co-workers! 
   
   We are focusing on the Watts area of South LA for the new garden sites because of the immense need in this area where, according to the LA Times profile, the median household income is low at $25,161, the median age is young at 21 years (partly due to gang violence), household size is high at 4.0 people, only 2.9% of residents have a four-year college degree, and 38.9% of the households are headed by a single parent. 61.6% of the residents are Latino and 37.1% are black.
   
   There are currently 125 community gardens open to anyone in the community in LA County (this does not include gardens with restricted access, for example at schools, hospitals, or detention centers). Our goal is to build three new community gardens in 2015, four new gardens in 2016, five new gardens in 2017, and continue to build one additional new garden every year for the next 36 years. By 2050, there will be 863 community gardens in LA County. If each of these serves 50 families and the average family size continues to be 4.0, more than 172,000 people will benefit from growing their own healthy food in their neighborhood!
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  To acquire the land, we will partner with organizations including the LA
  Neighborhood Land Trust and the Trust for Public Land. We have worked with
  these organizations in the past and they bring expertise to the process of
  land acquisition.
   
   For the past 16 years, LA Community Garden Council has partnered with the LA Conservation Corps to employ youth from low-income neighborhoods to help with community organizing and construction of the community gardens. They bring skilled labor and efficiency in numbers. 
   
   We will continue to partner with the UCCE Master Gardener program to find knowledgeable and experienced teachers to lead our gardening classes. We plan to form new partnerships with healthcare professionals, especially nutritionists, to offer health programs in the community gardens.
   
   When there is surplus produce in the community gardens, we will continue to partner with Community Services Unlimited, a local organization that distributes fresh food through markets in South LA, selling produce at low prices in neighborhoods that are considered food deserts because of the lack of availability of fresh produce.
   
   Three factors that are critical to the success of these partnerships are (1) setting clear agreements and expectations in writing at the beginning of the partnership, (2) keeping channels of communication open and transparent throughout the project so that everyone is on the same page, and (3) debriefing at the end of the project so that we can determine ways to work together even better in future.

  more_detail: >-
    BLOCK is a video game for city planning and speculation. The game is founded
    on ideas of ecology, establishing the interdependencies of city entities
    such as housing, shops, parks and infrastructure. By allowing the player to
    understand how to use resources (money, waste, social capital), we can
    encourage entrepreneurship through the design of an ecological urbanism,
    allowing for new opportunities to be conceived in the city. The objective of
    the game is to both educate people and to generate user data for design
    patterns for the LA of 2050, producing the first database of a future city.
    The project will be open-source and free to access. The first prototype of
    the game has already been developed within USC School of Architecture. 
  implement: "We have already developed an initial prototype, as can be seen in the accompanying video. The prototype allows us to already start working with players and communities as we develop and add real data and features to the game. Local communities within LA have already approached us to use the game in the teaching of architecture and urban development.  \r\n\r\nTo implement this project, we need to build a team that will support the current development team, primarily by going into the community, and connecting with people in education, design, and urban planning, and also to source real data to create accurate simulations. \r\n\r\nThe game prototype that we have already developed works as a proof of concept; Players can easily simulate urban environments and come to understand the interdependencies of different elements. The game encourages the player to improve the quality of urban space and learn the needs of other actors in the city.\r\n\r\nGames such as Simcity and Minecraft allow players to engage with city simulations or digital design, but we currently do not have an accessible game that can connect players with the real implications of products, of architecture and the city. BLOCK will breach the digital with the physical and allow anyone to become an active participant in the LA of 2050. The current Gamescapes research led by Jose Sanchez at USC School of Architecture, has been developed over the past 2 years, to create the tools and the framework to make this game possible. \r\n"
  impact_live: "LA is a city that has been built by its inhabitants. Is in in their power to make a significant new change. The LA of 2050 will be shaped by a generation that is currently very young. It requires a ‘massive design medium’ to expand the imagination of the current generation. Video games have the reach to affect a larger community. They also offer the possibility to simulate systems; Systems thinking is one of the fundamental challenges of the 21st century. If we have engaging video games that can simulate the quality of the air, the health of the city and the interdependences of businesses, we can allow individuals and organizations to see how their own ideas are intertwined.\r\n\r\nBLOCK aims to be a medium for 21st century city participation where we could crowd-source the models for the LA of 2050. \r\n\r\nHowever, BLOCK can also have a direct impact very quickly. One of the stages of the project is to model a series of case studies of cities and neighbourhoods that work with ideas of ecology, generating patterns of sustainability. These patterns will be included in the game as examples, and would enable anyone to learn how to implement already working solutions. Think of it as an interactive recipe book for a healthy Los Angeles.\r\n"
  who_benefit: "Change takes time, and the beneficiaries of this project will truly be near future generations. In it’s initial phase, the game’s primary educational purpose, will be to support educational institutions to find and model urban problems, and build simulations that could provide alternative patterns for the urban conditions of today.\r\n\r\nIn it’s second phase, the game will build a catalogue of case studies of established urban problems and possible solutions. The game will show that it can model existing and envisioned city configurations, and also demonstrate how they could operate. This will connect a gamer community with architects and city planners.\r\n\r\nWhilst the internet can provide a forum to enable hundreds of people to play and suggest great ideas to a particular problem, is can be difficult to know if the ideas are feasible or if they are missing other information that render them irrelevant. By developing BLOCK, citizens will be armed with the tools to create city simulations themselves, and ideas will be in a format that any authority could implement. The challenge of the project is to go ‘from Gaming to Making’.\r\n\r\nIn a similar way in which the game FOLD-IT (http://fold.it/) works with a community of players to advance the science of protein folding and cure diseases, BLOCK will bring the problem of urban health and ecological urbanism to a massive community of players that can collectively be smarter than a state of the art algorithm.\r\n"
  partners_collaboration: "USC School of Architecture has already secured two partners:\r\nUSC Game Innovation Lab\r\nhttp://www.gameinnovationlab.com/\r\n5D Institute\r\nhttp://5dinstitute.org/\r\n\r\nThe project is also trying to collaborate with:\r\nUnity3D (TBC)\r\nhttp://unity3d.com/\r\nThe Plant Chicago (TBC)\r\nhttp://www.plantchicago.com/\r\n\r\nThe experience in developing video games at the USC Game Innovation Lab led by Tracy Fullerton, will be a critical assessment to the work developed. They posses a fundamental expertise in all areas of game development and will certainly push the game to be meaningful and accomplish its goals.\r\n\r\nThe 5D Institute, led by Alex McDowell, is recognised for innovation in narrative structures. They will be a key collaborator to define the rhetoric of the project to generate player engagement. The ecological narrative of the game needs to be strong and accessible and the 5D Institute will support us to achieve this goal.\r\n\r\nThe two other collaborations currently being pursued will add a deeper expertise to the game: \r\n\r\nUnity3D is the company that develops Unity, the game engine used so far for the development of BLOCK. We are in conversation with them for technical support for this project.\r\n\r\nThe Plant Chicago is an Urban Farming initiative that has pioneered an ecological urban farm concept that eliminates the idea of waste by establishing the interdependence of productive units. They posses a unique expertise and have been a great inspiration to the project. In collaborating with The Plant Chicago, we hope to use them as a case study and implement several other concepts similar to theirs within the game. \r\n"

  impact_metrics: "Some of the additional metrics to consider are the following:\r\n-Reduction of waste [OWN]\r\n-Ecological Awareness [OWN]\r\n-Local energy Collection [OWN]\r\n-Local Food production [OWN]\r\n-Interdependence coefficients. [OWN]\r\n-Walk/transit/bike score [CONNECT]\r\n-Median travel time to work [CONNECT]\r\n-Residential segregation [CONNECT]\r\n-Number of public transit riders [CONNECT]\r\n-Access to open space and park facilities [PLAY]\r\n-Percentage of residents that feel safe in their neighborhood [PLAY]\r\n-Employment in the creative industries [CREATE]\r\n-Concentration of manufacturing activity in LA [CREATE]\r\n-Number of high growth startups [CREATE]\r\n\r\nBy modelling the scenario in which these conditions emerge, we can design alternative patterns or implement local solutions. Often, many of the metrics can be improved by broadening the scope of the problem. BLOCK is based on an idea of ‘Systems Thinking’ that would encourage different actors to take action and get involved. An informed community is the best way to promote local innovation."

  evaluate: "The data of player’s creations will be saved to a server in an anonymous format. This will allow us to generate several indicators and statistics.\r\n\r\nThe main indicators for the GAME are:\r\nReach – The amount of engagement that the game has in a particular community.\r\nPatterns – How advanced and efficient are the patterns created by the community.\r\nInnovation – How new patterns emerge from the community and how they perform with different evaluation criteria.\r\nPersistence – How does the implementation of the game continue to involve new members.\r\n"
  two_lessons: "The project is primarily influenced by the rich gaming community, which is incredibly passionate and engaged with new games. The example, as described earlier, of the video game ‘FOLD-IT’ constitutes a vital precedent to the use of videogames for research and development.\r\n\r\nSecondly, there are two videogames that have greatly influenced the development of BLOCK: SimCity(http://www.simcity.com/) and Minecraft (https://minecraft.net/). Both video games allow players to design at different scales. Both video games have been used for educational purposes. What both games lack is the ability to connect the game to the real world. Most videogames do not need to do that as they are framed as entertainment. In our case, BLOCK is intended as a research project that could enable us to connect virtual simulations with the physical word.\r\n\r\nFinally, an important lesson has been learnt by one of our potential collaborators. ‘The Plant’ in Chicago has shown the way to generate urban farming by eliminating the idea of waste. The key implementation in ‘The Plant’ is how one system feeds into another. The waste of one productive agent becomes the resource for another. This is what we identify as ecological urbanism and those relationships can be found in many situations. By crowdsourcing the design of meaningful combinations of services and urban entities, we can redefine the way we think about the city. \r\n"
  achievable_goal: "We understood that the key way to communicate this project was to first develop a prototype. We have done this over the past several months and we had the opportunity to publicly test it at the ‘Smart Geometry’ Conference in Hong Kong. The first prototype has allowed us to engage in great conversations and speculation on the possibilities of the project. The feedback has been extremely positive, inspiring others to suggest ideas and wanting to get more involved in the development of the project. \r\nThe hard work of designing the framework for the game is over. The next stage is to develop the content and collect real world data to bring accuracy and meaning to the game. Based on the four months of past development, we are confident that 12 months will be enough time to finish the second stage, and open the project up to the community of LA. \r\n"
  major_challenges: "Firstly, one of the major challenges is to be able to describe real world problems within the game. Often games follow a certain logic for entertainment value and they do not need to have real world accuracy. Will Wright, the creator of SimCity, explains this very well. He argues that a game needs to be engaging, as without that engagement people will not play it. This forces game designers to compromise on the accuracy of the models in order to make them more fun. Whilst we want to create engagement, we also want to connect the game to the real world by incorporating the actual energy consumption of a certain service, for example. We believe this will be a crucial challenge that the project will need to address.\r\n\r\nSecondly, is the challenge of the development of a community. Without the community, we will have no data, no metrics, no innovation. It would be easy to underestimate the importance of marketing and taking the game out to different locations in the community of LA where people can engage with it. The aspect of community engagement will be included from day one, as it is player feedback which will allow the game to grow and become successful. \r\n"
  competition: >-
    As it has been mentioned in this presentation, there are video games which
    have been developed to conduct research and development, such as the
    previously mentioned FOLD-IT game (http://fold.it/). This uses a similar
    approach through its use of crowd sourcing, however it operates in the field
    of research science, and there is no equivalent in the field of urban design
    or city planning. To this extent, the work done by FOLD-IT is complementary
    but not overlapping to the research of ‘BLOCK’, and continues to be an
    influential reference in our development. 
  cost: "The development of the game needs to be strategized in a modular fashion. A video game can require a much larger budget than 100,000 USD, however we are approaching this project to work to that budget.\r\n \r\nThe development can be divided into four main categories:\r\n-Game development (Covered by Host and Collaborating institution)\r\n-Data collection and statistics. (1 new hire for the team)\r\n-Artwork (Covered by Host and Collaborating institution)\r\n-Community engagement and management (2 volunteers or hire members)\r\n-Advertising (campaign in coordination with community events)\r\n"
  budget: "As presented in the breakdown above, many of the costs will be absorbed by the on-going research within USC Architecture and USC Game Innovation Lab, involving students and sessions as part of a research curriculum.\r\n\r\nHires:\r\n-Computer Science hire: 30,000 USD – 4 months. This hire is one of the fundamental elements to be able to evaluate the project and assess the indicators. The hire needs to be proficient in programming databases, collection of data and statistics, and supporting the game development with a strong computer science background.\r\n-Community Champions hire: 5,000 USD – 2 people that will work throughout the year taking the game to community events. The payment will be dedicated to individual events throughout the year.\r\n-University Fringe cost for all hires: 11,725 USD. 33.5% of hire cost.\r\n\r\nSubtotal: 46,725 USD\r\n\r\nConsulting:\r\n-Game Development Support consultancy: 6,000 USD. This item will be employed to optimize and refine the game output to be fully accessible by a larger audience. This will enable us to export the game to multiple devices and increase the amount of simulations to be performed by the game.\r\n\r\nInfrastructure:\r\n-Community Infrastructure: 8,000 USD. A website design that would collect the gameplay data of players. It would function as a hub where the community can engage in forums and suggest ways of improving the game. This item also considers the payment for hosting of the collected data. \r\n\r\nSubtotal: 60,725\r\n\r\nUniversity Facilities and Administration costs: 39,167 USD 64.5% of costs.\r\n\r\nTotal: 99,892 USD.\r\n\r\n"

The prototype allows us to already start working with players and communities as we develop and add real data and features to the game. Local communities within LA have already approached us to use the game in the teaching of architecture and urban development.  \r\n\r\nTo implement this project, we need to build a team that will support the current development team, primarily by going into the community, and connecting with people in education, design, and urban planning, and also to source real data to create accurate simulations. \r\n\r\nThe game prototype that we have already developed works as a proof of concept; Players can easily simulate urban environments and come to understand the interdependencies of different elements. The game encourages the player to improve the quality of urban space and learn the needs of other actors in the city.\r\n\r\nGames such as Simcity and Minecraft allow players to engage with city simulations or digital design, but we currently do not have an accessible game that can connect players with the real implications of products, of architecture and the city. BLOCK will breach the digital with the physical and allow anyone to become an active participant in the LA of 2050. The current Gamescapes research led by Jose Sanchez at USC School of Architecture, has been developed over the past 2 years, to create the tools and the framework to make this game possible. \r\n"

    answer: "LA is a city that has been built by its inhabitants. Is in in their power to make a significant new change. The LA of 2050 will be shaped by a generation that is currently very young. It requires a ‘massive design medium’ to expand the imagination of the current generation. Video games have the reach to affect a larger community. They also offer the possibility to simulate systems; Systems thinking is one of the fundamental challenges of the 21st century. If we have engaging video games that can simulate the quality of the air, the health of the city and the interdependences of businesses, we can allow individuals and organizations to see how their own ideas are intertwined.\r\n\r\nBLOCK aims to be a medium for 21st century city participation where we could crowd-source the models for the LA of 2050. \r\n\r\nHowever, BLOCK can also have a direct impact very quickly. One of the stages of the project is to model a series of case studies of cities and neighbourhoods that work with ideas of ecology, generating patterns of sustainability. These patterns will be included in the game as examples, and would enable anyone to learn how to implement already working solutions. Think of it as an interactive recipe book for a healthy Los Angeles.\r\n"

    answer: "Change takes time, and the beneficiaries of this project will truly be near future generations. In it’s initial phase, the game’s primary educational purpose, will be to support educational institutions to find and model urban problems, and build simulations that could provide alternative patterns for the urban conditions of today.\r\n\r\nIn it’s second phase, the game will build a catalogue of case studies of established urban problems and possible solutions. The game will show that it can model existing and envisioned city configurations, and also demonstrate how they could operate. This will connect a gamer community with architects and city planners.\r\n\r\nWhilst the internet can provide a forum to enable hundreds of people to play and suggest great ideas to a particular problem, is can be difficult to know if the ideas are feasible or if they are missing other information that render them irrelevant. By developing BLOCK, citizens will be armed with the tools to create city simulations themselves, and ideas will be in a format that any authority could implement. The challenge of the project is to go ‘from Gaming to Making’.\r\n\r\nIn a similar way in which the game FOLD-IT (http://fold.it/) works with a community of players to advance the science of protein folding and cure diseases, BLOCK will bring the problem of urban health and ecological urbanism to a massive community of players that can collectively be smarter than a state of the art algorithm.\r\n"

    answer: "USC School of Architecture has already secured two partners:\r\nUSC Game Innovation Lab\r\nhttp://www.gameinnovationlab.com/\r\n5D Institute\r\nhttp://5dinstitute.org/\r\n\r\nThe project is also trying to collaborate with:\r\nUnity3D (TBC)\r\nhttp://unity3d.com/\r\nThe Plant Chicago (TBC)\r\nhttp://www.plantchicago.com/\r\n\r\nThe experience in developing video games at the USC Game Innovation Lab led by Tracy Fullerton, will be a critical assessment to the work developed. They posses a fundamental expertise in all areas of game development and will certainly push the game to be meaningful and accomplish its goals.\r\n\r\nThe 5D Institute, led by Alex McDowell, is recognised for innovation in narrative structures. They will be a key collaborator to define the rhetoric of the project to generate player engagement. The ecological narrative of the game needs to be strong and accessible and the 5D Institute will support us to achieve this goal.\r\n\r\nThe two other collaborations currently being pursued will add a deeper expertise to the game: \r\n\r\nUnity3D is the company that develops Unity, the game engine used so far for the development of BLOCK. We are in conversation with them for technical support for this project.\r\n\r\nThe Plant Chicago is an Urban Farming initiative that has pioneered an ecological urban farm concept that eliminates the idea of waste by establishing the interdependence of productive units. They posses a unique expertise and have been a great inspiration to the project. In collaborating with The Plant Chicago, we hope to use them as a case study and implement several other concepts similar to theirs within the game. \r\n"

    explanation: Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.
    answer: "Some of the additional metrics to consider are the following:\r\n-Reduction of waste [OWN]\r\n-Ecological Awareness [OWN]\r\n-Local energy Collection [OWN]\r\n-Local Food production [OWN]\r\n-Interdependence coefficients. [OWN]\r\n-Walk/transit/bike score [CONNECT]\r\n-Median travel time to work [CONNECT]\r\n-Residential segregation [CONNECT]\r\n-Number of public transit riders [CONNECT]\r\n-Access to open space and park facilities [PLAY]\r\n-Percentage of residents that feel safe in their neighborhood [PLAY]\r\n-Employment in the creative industries [CREATE]\r\n-Concentration of manufacturing activity in LA [CREATE]\r\n-Number of high growth startups [CREATE]\r\n\r\nBy modelling the scenario in which these conditions emerge, we can design alternative patterns or implement local solutions. Often, many of the metrics can be improved by broadening the scope of the problem. BLOCK is based on an idea of ‘Systems Thinking’ that would encourage different actors to take action and get involved. An informed community is the best way to promote local innovation."

    answer: "The project is primarily influenced by the rich gaming community, which is incredibly passionate and engaged with new games. The example, as described earlier, of the video game ‘FOLD-IT’ constitutes a vital precedent to the use of videogames for research and development.\r\n\r\nSecondly, there are two videogames that have greatly influenced the development of BLOCK: SimCity(http://www.simcity.com/) and Minecraft (https://minecraft.net/). Both video games allow players to design at different scales. Both video games have been used for educational purposes. What both games lack is the ability to connect the game to the real world. Most videogames do not need to do that as they are framed as entertainment. In our case, BLOCK is intended as a research project that could enable us to connect virtual simulations with the physical word.\r\n\r\nFinally, an important lesson has been learnt by one of our potential collaborators. ‘The Plant’ in Chicago has shown the way to generate urban farming by eliminating the idea of waste. The key implementation in ‘The Plant’ is how one system feeds into another. The waste of one productive agent becomes the resource for another. This is what we identify as ecological urbanism and those relationships can be found in many situations. By crowdsourcing the design of meaningful combinations of services and urban entities, we can redefine the way we think about the city. \r\n"
  - name: achievable_goal
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "We understood that the key way to communicate this project was to first develop a prototype. We have done this over the past several months and we had the opportunity to publicly test it at the ‘Smart Geometry’ Conference in Hong Kong. The first prototype has allowed us to engage in great conversations and speculation on the possibilities of the project. The feedback has been extremely positive, inspiring others to suggest ideas and wanting to get more involved in the development of the project. \r\nThe hard work of designing the framework for the game is over. The next stage is to develop the content and collect real world data to bring accuracy and meaning to the game. Based on the four months of past development, we are confident that 12 months will be enough time to finish the second stage, and open the project up to the community of LA. \r\n"
  - name: major_challenges
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Firstly, one of the major challenges is to be able to describe real world problems within the game. Often games follow a certain logic for entertainment value and they do not need to have real world accuracy. Will Wright, the creator of SimCity, explains this very well. He argues that a game needs to be engaging, as without that engagement people will not play it. This forces game designers to compromise on the accuracy of the models in order to make them more fun. Whilst we want to create engagement, we also want to connect the game to the real world by incorporating the actual energy consumption of a certain service, for example. We believe this will be a crucial challenge that the project will need to address.\r\n\r\nSecondly, is the challenge of the development of a community. Without the community, we will have no data, no metrics, no innovation. It would be easy to underestimate the importance of marketing and taking the game out to different locations in the community of LA where people can engage with it. The aspect of community engagement will be included from day one, as it is player feedback which will allow the game to grow and become successful. \r\n"

      As it has been mentioned in this presentation, there are video games which
      have been developed to conduct research and development, such as the
      previously mentioned FOLD-IT game (http://fold.it/). This uses a similar
      approach through its use of crowd sourcing, however it operates in the
      field of research science, and there is no equivalent in the field of
      urban design or city planning. To this extent, the work done by FOLD-IT is
      complementary but not overlapping to the research of ‘BLOCK’, and
      continues to be an influential reference in our development.

    explanation: ''
    answer: "The development of the game needs to be strategized in a modular fashion. A video game can require a much larger budget than 100,000 USD, however we are approaching this project to work to that budget.\r\n \r\nThe development can be divided into four main categories:\r\n-Game development (Covered by Host and Collaborating institution)\r\n-Data collection and statistics. (1 new hire for the team)\r\n-Artwork (Covered by Host and Collaborating institution)\r\n-Community engagement and management (2 volunteers or hire members)\r\n-Advertising (campaign in coordination with community events)\r\n"
  - name: budget
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "As presented in the breakdown above, many of the costs will be absorbed by the on-going research within USC Architecture and USC Game Innovation Lab, involving students and sessions as part of a research curriculum.\r\n\r\nHires:\r\n-Computer Science hire: 30,000 USD – 4 months. This hire is one of the fundamental elements to be able to evaluate the project and assess the indicators. The hire needs to be proficient in programming databases, collection of data and statistics, and supporting the game development with a strong computer science background.\r\n-Community Champions hire: 5,000 USD – 2 people that will work throughout the year taking the game to community events. The payment will be dedicated to individual events throughout the year.\r\n-University Fringe cost for all hires: 11,725 USD. 33.5% of hire cost.\r\n\r\nSubtotal: 46,725 USD\r\n\r\nConsulting:\r\n-Game Development Support consultancy: 6,000 USD. This item will be employed to optimize and refine the game output to be fully accessible by a larger audience. This will enable us to export the game to multiple devices and increase the amount of simulations to be performed by the game.\r\n\r\nInfrastructure:\r\n-Community Infrastructure: 8,000 USD. A website design that would collect the gameplay data of players. It would function as a hub where the community can engage in forums and suggest ways of improving the game. This item also considers the payment for hosting of the collected data. \r\n\r\nSubtotal: 60,725\r\n\r\nUniversity Facilities and Administration costs: 39,167 USD 64.5% of costs.\r\n\r\nTotal: 99,892 USD.\r\n\r\n"
