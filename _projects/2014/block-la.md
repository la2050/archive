Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  In the next year, LA Community Garden Council will help an additional 150
  low-income families grow healthy food in their neighborhood.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  We envision a community garden network for Los Angeles where people of all
  ages live healthy, active lives in a clean environment by growing fresh food
  in their neighborhood. This network enables healthy lifestyles by providing
  access to healthy food and getting people outdoors exercising through
  gardening. It fosters the meeting of people from diverse cultures to share the
  best growing techniques in order to practice sustainable urban agriculture
  while growing sustainable communities. 
   
   In the next year, LA Community Garden Council will build three new community gardens in low-income neighborhoods to ensure that at least 150 families can grow their own healthy food in their neighborhood.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Within the first year, the three new community gardens will provide access to
  healthy food and exercise for at least 150 low-income families in LA County.
  Healthcare professionals are starting to recognize the need for a holistic
  approach to preventative care and a healthy diet and exercise are key
  components of this. From the existing LA Community Garden Council gardens, we
  have evidence that gardeners lose weight in their first year of gardening,
  which helps to prevent Type 2 Diabetes, cholesterol, hypertension, and heart
  disease. Gardening is relaxing and therapeutic and helps patients with mental
  illness. By getting children outdoors to garden instead of indoors in front of
  computer screens, we will help to create positive childhood experiences. We
  will encourage gardeners to walk, bike or take public transport to their
  community garden for their health as well as the community’s health.
   
   Building new community gardens creates a healthier environment for local residents. We will seek to have land leases that extend beyond 2050 and, preferably, ensure that the land is used as green space in perpetuity. Teaching organic gardening techniques, including composting and seed collection, will ensure that the garden is sustainable and it will lower residents’ exposure to unhealthy toxins. We will have rainwater collection systems in the garden to ensure the best water conservation methods are followed and to reduce dependence on imported water. We will plant trees around the perimeter of the garden to increase the tree canopy cover.
   
   By focusing on low-income neighborhoods, we will help families to reduce their grocery bill by growing their own food. Ultimately, this reduces the number of households living below the self-sufficiency standard, builds more resilient communities, and helps to reduce rates of homelessness. 
   
   We are confident that this three-fold focus on (1) access to healthy food and active lifestyles, (2) creating a sustainable environment, and (3) addressing economic concerns in lower-income neighborhoods will help to make LA the healthiest place to live in 2050!
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Within six weeks of the completion of the new community gardens, at least 150
  low-income families in LA County will directly benefit from eating the fresh
  produce that they are growing, based on each garden having 50 gardeners. As
  most avid gardeners know, a single harvest is often too much for your
  immediate family to consume and so you soon find yourself spreading the wealth
  and giving away tomatoes, zucchini, mint, and other edibles to your extended
  family, neighbors, school friends, and co-workers! 
   
   We are focusing on the Watts area of South LA for the new garden sites because of the immense need in this area where, according to the LA Times profile, the median household income is low at $25,161, the median age is young at 21 years (partly due to gang violence), household size is high at 4.0 people, only 2.9% of residents have a four-year college degree, and 38.9% of the households are headed by a single parent. 61.6% of the residents are Latino and 37.1% are black.
   
   There are currently 125 community gardens open to anyone in the community in LA County (this does not include gardens with restricted access, for example at schools, hospitals, or detention centers). Our goal is to build three new community gardens in 2015, four new gardens in 2016, five new gardens in 2017, and continue to build one additional new garden every year for the next 36 years. By 2050, there will be 863 community gardens in LA County. If each of these serves 50 families and the average family size continues to be 4.0, more than 172,000 people will benefit from growing their own healthy food in their neighborhood!
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  To acquire the land, we will partner with organizations including the LA
  Neighborhood Land Trust and the Trust for Public Land. We have worked with
  these organizations in the past and they bring expertise to the process of
  land acquisition.
   
   For the past 16 years, LA Community Garden Council has partnered with the LA Conservation Corps to employ youth from low-income neighborhoods to help with community organizing and construction of the community gardens. They bring skilled labor and efficiency in numbers. 
   
   We will continue to partner with the UCCE Master Gardener program to find knowledgeable and experienced teachers to lead our gardening classes. We plan to form new partnerships with healthcare professionals, especially nutritionists, to offer health programs in the community gardens.
   
   When there is surplus produce in the community gardens, we will continue to partner with Community Services Unlimited, a local organization that distributes fresh food through markets in South LA, selling produce at low prices in neighborhoods that are considered food deserts because of the lack of availability of fresh produce.
   
   Three factors that are critical to the success of these partnerships are (1) setting clear agreements and expectations in writing at the beginning of the partnership, (2) keeping channels of communication open and transparent throughout the project so that everyone is on the same page, and (3) debriefing at the end of the project so that we can determine ways to work together even better in future.
