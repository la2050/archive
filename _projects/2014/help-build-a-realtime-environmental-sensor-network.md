title: Help build a Realtime Environmental Sensor Network
project_summary: >-
  We have a prototype network up and running in Fukushima Japan now, want to
  launch full network in Los Angeles.

maker_answers:
  implement: >-
    Finalize the production version of our sensors, secure locations then
    purchase, build and deploy sensors around Los Angeles.
  achievable_goal: >-
    Our prototype network is up and running currently, if we had confirmed
    funding for development of the production sensors we could put that into
    action. Our track record shows how fast we can move and what we can pull
    off, so it's really just a matter of getting the sensors in hand and putting
    them out in the world.
  impact_live: >-
    With our radiation data we changed the established method of reporting data
    as huge averages to giving pinpoint data down to a specific GPS location,
    giving people the very granular data they needed and were unable to get
    anywhere else. We're hoping to do the same thing for air quality and other
    environmental data so right now Angelenos can get very vague data - air in
    LA is OK today, air in LA is bad today - etc. Our sensors and network will
    change that and tell people exactly what is different street to street,
    moment to moment. Imagine being able to plan a run or bike ride specifically
    down streets with better air quality at the least polluted times of the day.
    Imagine being able to pinpoint pollution sources and make changes to correct
    these problems at the source.
  who_benefit: >-
    Individuals who are interested in their environment, researchers who need
    concrete data for their work, and policy/government who currently have
    limited data with which to make decisions.
  partners_collaboration: For Los Angeles we won't need any partners to deploy this.
  evaluate: >-
    If we can deploy enough sensors to collect relevant data, if the data we
    collect is useful to others, if people make decisions based on our data.
  two_lessons: >-
    With Radiation monitoring in Japan we learned first hand that any data is
    better than no data and giving people the power to collect data empowers
    them in ways they never imagined. We also learned the value of lean and
    agile development -rather than making plans for 5 years from now we decide
    what we can do that will be most impactful today.
  more_detail: >-
    Started in response to the Fukushima meltdown in 2011 - In 3 years Safecast
    has built the most trusted citizen monitoring network for radiation data in
    the world, with the largest open data set ever. Our network of mobile
    sensors is tried and tested, and we're now building out a static realtime
    network and adding other environmental data to that - air quality, weather,
    etc. We have a prototype network up and running now, but would love to
    deploy a full network in Los Angeles as the first US initiative.
  major_challenges: >-
    We thought volunteers would be our biggest problem, but we have more
    volunteers and offers to help and house sensors than we know what do to do
    with. Our problems have consistently been getting enough hardware out to
    people fast enough.

    - San Gabriel Valley
    - San Fernando Valley
    - South Bay
    - Westside
  Does your project impact Los Angeles County?: Yes (benefits a region of LA County)
  How will your project impact the LA2050 “Live” metrics?:
    - Exposure to air toxins
    - Acres and miles of polluted waterways
  Please describe yourself: Solo actor (just us on this project!)
  What resources does your project need?:
    - Money (financial capital)
