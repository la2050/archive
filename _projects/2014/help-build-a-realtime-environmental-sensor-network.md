  To implement the “Toward a Carbon Neutral House” project we propose to
  demonstrate the relative benefit of using salvaged materials based on a case
  study of the deconstruction of an existing house and the construction of a new
  house using salvaged materials from the former. The case study will include a
  cataloging of inputs and outputs of materials for salvage and disposal at each
  of the two house sites in Los Angeles for the purposes of a Life-Cycle
  Assessment (“LCA”). This LCA will establish an “energy budget” for the new
  house based on: 1) a calculation of the embodied energy of these materials;
  and, 2) a calculation of the projected operational energy use for the new
  house over its life-cycle.
   
   This total energy budget of the new house will allow us to further analyze and compare the case study with other cases such as a Baseline Case which meets minimum code requirements. Additionally, we will be able to find the associated CO2 emissions of each element of the new house, and add other external emissions to the Baseline Case such as from the landfill disposal of a typical demolition. This will allow a more complete picture of the performance of the new house not just in terms of its energy use, but its carbon footprint.
   
   If, through this case study, we are able to demonstrate there is a significant amount of reduced CO2 emissions from using salvaged materials to build a new home, then we would propose to use this assessment to advocate for the reform of the applicable codes and standards (e.g. Los Angeles Green Building Code and LEED for Homes). To accomplish this goal, we propose to organize and disseminate the results of our work for use by the relevant stakeholders and policy makers. We will use a variety of media and formats for communicating our results including a short video to be used online and at screenings for educational and advocacy purposes.
   
   The LA2050 grant will allow us to carry out a complete and thorough cataloging of the inputs and outputs of the deconstructed house and new house, and to conduct a Life-Cycle Assessment which will help quantify the CO2 emissions of salvaged materials in new home construction. With the proper funding of the “Toward a Carbon Neutral House” project, we hope to carry out this case study in a manner that will serve a range of stakeholders and policy makers, but in the end serve the greater community of Los Angeles through reduced carbon emissions and helping to create a more resilient city.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  The “Toward a Carbon Neutral House” project will help make Los Angeles the
  healthiest place to live by serving as a launch pad for reforming the codes
  and regulations which shape the homes we live in, and therefore drive how we
  as a city produce CO2 emissions and contribute to climate change. In the Los
  Angeles region, we have both the blessing of beautiful landscapes and a
  history of environmental damage in the smog and pollutants we have produced,
  and the wildfires and droughts we have precipitated due to climate change. To
  mitigate this damage and make Los Angeles a more resilient city and region
  will not happen overnight, nor in a year, but if we take incremental steps
  like reforming the codes, we can achieve a steady progress toward a healthy
  environment in which to live over the long term.
   
   In the next year, we believe the “Toward a Carbon Neutral House” project will demonstrate the relative benefits of using salvaged materials in new homes, and we will begin to reform the necessary codes and regulations for all of Los Angeles and the region to be able to take advantage of this smart CO2 emissions reduction measure. In the long term (and definitely in 2050) the construction industry will, we believe, have embraced the use of salvaged materials as a standard practice, and the benefits of reduced CO2 emissions and minimized climate change will be enjoyed by all Angelenos.
   
   What this will mean for Angelenos is a more resilient city and region where the extreme outcomes of increasing climate change such as wildfires, droughts and rising sea level will be minimized. Like a firefighter taking the fuel away from the fire, these natural events will hopefully be minimized in their severity and frequency if we are able to minimize climate change. Similarly, the severity of smog and levels of air toxins in the Los Angeles region will hopefully be reduced if we minimize climate change due to the reduced CO2 levels and temperatures which contribute to particulates collecting in the atmosphere even.
   
   In 2050, Los Angeles will be a healthy place to live for all Angelenos due in part, we hope, to the early efforts of the “Toward a Carbon Neutral House” project to serve as a launch pad for the necessary documentation, advocacy and reforms to the codes and standards which shape the way we live.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The “Toward a Carbon Neutral House” project is intended to benefit all of Los
  Angeles's communities from the improved environmental quality associated with
  reduced CO2 emissions. To accomplish this goal the project proposes to first
  lay the groundwork for reforms to the codes and standards which shape the
  homes we live in, and how they treat the use of salvaged materials. Therefore,
  the project will at first be a documentation and advocacy tool for
  stakeholders and policy makers who work in the residential construction market
  in the Los Angeles region. 
   The specific stakeholders we are targeting include general contractors, sub-contractors, building materials suppliers, architecture and engineering professionals, sustainability consultants, and environmental and community groups. The specific policy makers include researchers, building officials at the municipal and state level, officials at the Los Angeles Bureau of Sanitation, and USGBC technical committee members. The benefits of this research will hopefully be to provide a foundation for future research, help to build a consensus on the issue of salvaged materials within both the private and public sector, and hopefully lead to real reforms of the applicable codes and standards such as the Los Angeles Green Building Code and LEED for Homes.
   The goal of the “Toward a Carbon Neutral House” project is to demonstrate how locally-sourced salvaged materials can be used to reduce our carbon footprint, and thereby improve the environmental quality of the world we all live in. The benefits of a reduced carbon footprint extend well beyond the city limits of Los Angeles, and will require the participation of many more communities to be effective, but that is the nature of environmental issues. Pollution, climate change, and other environmental challenges do not tend to respect borders, and consequently require a global response, but acting locally is always the first step.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  The “Toward a Carbon Neutral House” project will be lead internally at Home
  Front Build by Derek Ryder, a licensed architect and LEED AP, who will serve
  as the sustainability professional and project coordinator leading the data
  collection, dissemination and project management activities with the project
  team. Derek comes to Home Front Build with 13+ years of experience in
  residential and religious architecture, and received his Master of
  Architecture degree from the Yale School of Architecture in 1999.
   
   The USC School of Architecture is a confirmed partner. Faculty members Douglas Noble, Chair of the Ph.D Program and Discipline Head of the Building Science Department, and Karen M. Kensek, Associate Professor, will provide supervision and direction to a graduate level thesis project analyzing the data collected by the project. 
   
   BurroHappold International engineering firm is a confirmed partner. They will provide strategic over-sight of the process including the data collection and life-cycle assessment. They will assist directing the graduate student work and provide peer support and review of the results of this research. Further, they have interested international parties and contacts, specifically in the UK, that are conducing industrial research in this area and who would be able to share their expertise and be able to build on it.
   
   Veracity Productions will operate as a subcontractor to Home Front Build in the making of a documentary for educational and advocacy purposes: www.veracityproductions.com.
