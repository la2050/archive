title: Help build a Realtime Environmental Sensor Network
project_summary: >-
  We have a prototype network up and running in Fukushima Japan now, want to
  launch full network in Los Angeles.

project_areas: []
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: For Los Angeles we won't need any partners to deploy this.
Please describe yourself: Solo actor (just us on this project!)
Does your project impact Los Angeles County?: Yes (benefits a region of LA County)
Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - South LA
  - San Gabriel Valley
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South Bay
  - Westside
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Started in response to the Fukushima meltdown in 2011 - In 3 years Safecast
  has built the most trusted citizen monitoring network for radiation data in
  the world, with the largest open data set ever. Our network of mobile sensors
  is tried and tested, and we're now building out a static realtime network and
  adding other environmental data to that - air quality, weather, etc. We have a
  prototype network up and running now, but would love to deploy a full network
  in Los Angeles as the first US initiative.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Finalize the production version of our sensors, secure locations then
  purchase, build and deploy sensors around Los Angeles.
How will your idea/project help make LA the healthiest place to LIVE today? In 2050?: >-
  With our radiation data we changed the established method of reporting data as
  huge averages to giving pinpoint data down to a specific GPS location, giving
  people the very granular data they needed and were unable to get anywhere
  else. We're hoping to do the same thing for air quality and other
  environmental data so right now Angelenos can get very vague data - air in LA
  is OK today, air in LA is bad today - etc. Our sensors and network will change
  that and tell people exactly what is different street to street, moment to
  moment. Imagine being able to plan a run or bike ride specifically down
  streets with better air quality at the least polluted times of the day.
  Imagine being able to pinpoint pollution sources and make changes to correct
  these problems at the source.
Whom will your project benefit?: >-
  Individuals who are interested in their environment, researchers who need
  concrete data for their work, and policy/government who currently have limited
  data with which to make decisions.
How will your project impact the LA2050 “Live” metrics?:
  - Exposure to air toxins
  - Acres and miles of polluted waterways
Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.: >-
  By giving people the best data about their environment making changes for the
  better of the entire region becomes easy.
Please explain how you will evaluate your project.: >-
  If we can deploy enough sensors to collect relevant data, if the data we
  collect is useful to others, if people make decisions based on our data.
What two lessons have informed your solution or project?: >-
  With Radiation monitoring in Japan we learned first hand that any data is
  better than no data and giving people the power to collect data empowers them
  in ways they never imagined. We also learned the value of lean and agile
  development -rather than making plans for 5 years from now we decide what we
  can do that will be most impactful today.
Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.: >-
  Our prototype network is up and running currently, if we had confirmed funding
  for development of the production sensors we could put that into action. Our
  track record shows how fast we can move and what we can pull off, so it's
  really just a matter of getting the sensors in hand and putting them out in
  the world.
Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?: >-
  We thought volunteers would be our biggest problem, but we have more
  volunteers and offers to help and house sensors than we know what do to do
  with. Our problems have consistently been getting enough hardware out to
  people fast enough.
What resources does your project need?:
  - Money (financial capital)
  - Volunteers/staff (human capital)
  - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
