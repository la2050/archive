Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  We build relationships with established organizations in low-income
  communities, who connect us with a first class of 10 families. After six
  months working with us to improve their health, those 10 families recruit 10
  more families, and serve as mentors. The cycle continues each season, as
  stakeholders spread practices of healthy living throughout their networks. So,
  over time, we organically grow a robust oasis of wellness in food deserts,
  empowering communities to nurture future generations’ bodies, minds and
  hearts.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  A lot of wonderful projects are trying to change the food system from the top
  down. We are doing the opposite--from the bottom up, one family at a time. 
   
   Right here in LA, we have kickstarted a growing movement teaching people how to take care of their bodies in the present food system. Groceryships is offering not a technical solution, but an adaptive one, helping people achieve vibrant health despite their current circumstances. We focus on the here and now, spreading a solution that equips people with the knowledge, tools, and support to make permanent lifestyle changes. 
   
   The wealth gap creates the health gap. At Groceryships, we know every person's health is equally important, but the world seems to disagree. So we've structured our program and organization to help close both gaps. We focus on bringing all the resources available to higher income neighborhoods to lower income families. We fund this partially by donations, but also by bringing our innovative curriculum and program structure to corporations, through our for-profit Corporate Wellness program. 
   
   In 2050, Groceryships groups will have spread across Los Angeles. The tech companies in Silicon Beach will be getting healthy through our corporate wellness program, while at the same time financing groups in Compton and Inglewood. The finance companies in Pasadena and the South Bay will be getting healthy while financing Groceryships groups in Boyle Heights. 
   
   By 2050, the seeds we planted in 2014 will have taken root and changed the landscape from a desert to a rainforest, where generations of families have adopted healthy ways of eating, moving, and communicating. The Framingham study made clear the power of social networks. Changing a single families health can have profound influence not just on future generations of that family, but on everyone they come in contact with, and who those people come in contact with. 
   Over the long run, a change in one family can change a community, which can change a city.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Our first two groups are in South Los Angeles and Boyle Heights, where
  childhood obesity is 30% and the rate of overweight/obesity is above 70%. We
  will focus primarily on low-income families across Los Angeles who are
  struggling with food related health issues like obesity, diabetes, heart
  disease, malnourishment, etc.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Homeboy Industries has mentored us from the early stages of our program,
  providing advice and support in developing our concept. In October, we are
  launching our first class together, connecting their twenty-six years of
  experience, highly motivated members, and proven success with our innovative
  strategy. This is a mutually beneficial partnership, allowing us to transform
  the relationship with food for Homeboy employees, explore a different facet of
  the wellness emphasized by Homeboy, and introduce our curriculum to a new
  neighborhood.
   
   Vitamix has also worked with us throughout our pilot program. The blenders they donate make it easier for families to increase fruit and vegetable consumption, so much so that kids of our families are holding “smoothie parties.”
