Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  (1) Nutritional Information Pamphlets: The first step of the Four Seasons of
  Food would be to research and compile nutritional information pamphlets which
  provide simple to understand nutritional information to the clients. The
  pamphlets will include simple charts and diagrams outlining food pyramids,
  recommended daily levels, and recommended BMI levels. (2)Seasonal Food Plans:
  The next phase of Four Seasons of Food would be designing a diet plan with the
  food provided by Interfaith in mind. Interfaith provides clients with four
  bags of food: a “wet” bag (containing refrigerated/frozen items such as dairy
  and meat), a “dry” bag (containing canned goods, cereals, and other packaged,
  non-refrigerated items), fresh produce when available, and a bag of
  bread/tortillas. The food plans will take into consideration the items being
  distributed and offer recipes, preparation tips, and other information which
  would allow clients to use the food to the most of its nutritious and economic
  potential. Each quarter (season) would have its own detailed plan, and this
  would reflect the what is offered by Interfaith and also what is available at
  that time of the year. Information in both the informative pamphlet and
  seasonal plan pamphlet would be compiled by health/nutrition students in the
  area and PIH Health, under the direction of the program administrator. Clients
  would pick up these materials as they signed in before they received their
  food. (3) Food Preparation Demonstrations: The third part of the Four Seasons
  of Food program will be the offering of food demonstrations/cooking classes
  for clients. Every quarter clients will be invited to sign up for a
  demonstration in the on-site kitchen/preparation room or the facilities at
  Whittier Area First Day, which will inform clients of healthy/economical ways
  to prepare the food provided weekly. (4) Kitchen Items:The final phase of Four
  Seasons of Food will be the purchase and distribution of kitchen items at
  demonstration classes to complement each season and provide clients with a
  tangible tool to prepare/keep food. The items for each season will be as
  follows: spring will be a juicer, summer will be a smoothie maker, fall will
  be items to pack a healthy lunch (portion controlled, cooled lunchboxes), and
  winter will be a slow cooker/crock pot.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  One in six American families are currently experiencing food insecurity, which
  is defined as not the total absence of food, but rather the constant fear that
  the next meal can not be counted on (National Geographic 2014). The majority
  of food insecure households have at least one working parent employed in a
  full time job, but due to low wages and high living expenses, the “new face of
  poverty” seen nationwide is one that is not only struggling to get by, but
  also lacking the time and energy necessary to prepare labor intensive meals
  with nutritiousness in mind. Melissa Boteach, vice president of the Poverty
  and Prosperity Program of the Center for American Progress notes in the August
  2014 issue of National Geographic, that “the paradox that hunger and obesity
  are two sides of the same coin.” Many “make trade-offs between food that is
  filling but not nutritious and may actually contribute to obesity.”
  Continuing, the undeniable link between being overweight and having food
  insecurity is explained because “junk food [is] plentiful and often cheap,
  hunger and obesity are now parallel problems.” 
   A clear indication of the severity of food insecurity in the service area is found in the PIH Health Needs Assessment (PIH Survey, 2013), which indicates that in the Los Nietos School District (with three schools, all located in the designated service area), 100% of the student population participate in the Free and Reduced Meal Program, and in the South Whittier School District, 64% of the students participate in that same program. The clients served by Interfaith Food Center live in an area with an above national average poverty rate, with 15.7% earning less than than $10,830/person/year (PIH Survey, 2013). Additionally, 9% of the population served identify as a senior in poverty (PIH Survey, 2013). 
   The unfortunate link between obesity and food insecurity is something that has been proven by studies throughout the United States and is something that Four Seasons of Hunger attempts to tackle. Through this four pronged approach, beginning with broad information and concluding with specific action, the hope is that clients will be able to avoid becoming part of this trend and use Interfaith Food Center’s supplemental groceries to achieve healthy diets. A good diet is something that is passed down from generation to generation, and if healthy habits are instilled in the current population, not only will they benefit, but it will ensure a healthier LA in 2050.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The Four Seasons of Food project would benefit Interfaith Food Center's
  clients. Interfaith Food Center currently serves over 1,200 families,
  consisting of roughly 4,000 individuals living with food insecurity in the
  city and unincorporated areas of Whittier, and the cities of La Mirada and
  Santa Fe Springs in Los Angeles County. All clients will be given not only
  supplemental food, but also correct and current information about how to
  prepare it.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Interfaith Food Center currently partners with PIH Health, Whittier Area First
  Day, Whittier College, and Biola University, as well as having the support and
  resources of many talented volunteers. Specifically, PIH Health has
  nutritionists and chefs to assist in compiling informational pamphlets and
  menus. Whittier Area First Day is a local homeless shelter. The shelter just
  received a new commercial grade kitchen, which they will make available to
  Interfaith Food Center to conduct classes, if necessary. Both Whittier and
  Biola Colleges partner with Interfaith Food Center for internships and
  research classes, making them the perfect partners for program evaluation and
  implementation. The three factors that are critical to the success of the
  proposed collaboration are (1) access to nutritional information and menu
  planning; (2) ability to conduct classes and; (3) expertise and knowledge to
  evaluate and measure success. The proposed partners meet these critical
  factors.
