  Beauty Bus Foundation brings beauty home to chronically or terminally ill
  individuals and their caregivers. For the past five years, Beauty Bus
  volunteers have provided so many moments of hope and respite to clients and
  caregivers. It is now time to create the optimal volunteer experience. Every
  aspect of our three core programs (In-Home Visits, Pop-Up Salons and Bag of
  Beauty) depend on the time and commitment of our trained volunteers. We do not
  exist without them. By streamlining our system and minimizing any barrier to
  entry – this will ensure that we can capture potential volunteer excitement
  and convert them to volunteers quickly. Resulting in an increase in the number
  of clients, services and bags we deliver.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  After five years we recognize that our volunteers come to Beauty Bus because
  they are drawn to our mission. It is time to create a volunteer program that
  is easy to use and in line with how so many are already scheduling their time.
  Currently, the In-Home Program centers on the date requested by the
  patient/caregiver and can be long for both staff and volunteers.
   We have started looking into purchasing salon systems. There are a few that allow us a quick fix. However, a salon system would be a stand-alone system. We currently house our client and volunteer in excel sheets and in our database. In a perfect world, adapting our current database and/or finding a way to make the salon systems work with our database would provide a solution for scheduling and evolve our unique volunteer program from a hand-holding endeavor to one ready for growth and the 21st century.
   With current tools and automation, we believe we can switch this entire process and serve more people. We are also looking to this system to support future growth. We believe that the system should actually revolve around the availability of the beauty professional and beauty buddy – our volunteers!
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  In addition to our clients, Beauty Bus develops a deep and mutually beneficial
  relationship with our volunteers. The interaction that takes place on a Beauty
  Bus Foundation visit is unique. Clients and volunteers develop new
  perspectives about what living with a chronic or terminal illness looks like.
  The subtle change that happens is raising social awareness about the
  populations we serve. Our volunteers are changing their community as they work
  toward a more inclusive society focused on opportunity for those caring for
  and living with a chronic or terminal condition. Since our founding we have
  seen 5,000 clients, provided 4,000 services and delivered 16,000 bags. And we
  have only begun to scratch the surface of the nearly 50,000 Angelenos living
  with chronic or terminal conditions, who qualify for our services. Success in
  2050 would mean that Beauty Bus is an integrated part of the pallative care
  services that hospital and social service agencies recommend to clients and
  caregivers across Los Angeles County. Perhaps our most profound accomplishment
  is in generating connection and the show of support in the forms of referrals
  we receive from those in the healthcare fields. Nurses, doctors and social
  workers are telling their patients and families about Beauty Bus because they
  have seen first hand the powerful transformation that comes from the human
  interaction during a hair cut or a manicure.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  When we started Beauty Bus, it was clear to us that, disease does not
  discriminate. We see a gap between "quality of care" and "quality of life." It
  is in this gap that we work.
   
   Beauty Bus serves chronically or terminally ill men, women and children with the following diseases or conditions: ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease), Cancer, Muscular Dystrophy, Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's Disease, Spinal Cord Injuries, Stroke, Other Select Neuromuscular or Motor Neuron Diseases…AND their caregivers.
   
   Beauty Bus programs benefit a multitude of individuals. Our programs will benefit the clients and caregivers we serve, their family members, as well as our social service and hospital partners.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  Beauty Bus Foundation benefits from strong collaboration and volunteer support
  in many areas of operation. Beauty Bus currently works with over twenty social
  service partners including: 
   ALS Association Golden West Chapter, National MS Society, Ronald McDonald House Charities, UCLA Mattel Children’s Hospital, UCLA Radiation Oncology, USC Keck Hospital, City of Hope, Glendale Adventist Medical Center, Rose Room Hospice, Pomona Valley Medical Center, Leeza’s Care Connection, Los Angeles Caregiver Resource Center, No Worries Now, VITAS Hospice, Parkinson’s Resource Organization, The Stroke Association, Concern Foundation and We Spark.
   
   Every year we are deepening our relationships with current partners and adding new partners. Collaboration with these partners is critical because we are able to:
   1) Reach more individuals who would otherwise not know about Beauty Bus
   2) Add value to our partners programs by making interactions with clients and caregivers more meaningful
   3) Build community among all the individuals involved in the process of caring for and advocating for those living with chronic or terminal conditions. In addition, to the tremendous partnerships in our program area, Beauty Bus has successful collaborations with a number of beauty companies and the Professional Beauty Association. These relationships are responsible for the million dollars in product donations which are used at all of our events, visits and our Bag of Beauty Program.
