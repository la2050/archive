Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Beautify Earth’s vision is to create 50 murals in one year throughout South
  Los Angeles, initially targeting 3 neighborhoods: Crenshaw, Central
  Avenue/84th Street and La Brea/Slauson. One potential project includes a space
  large enough to accommodate several murals along with art structures and can
  be used to host community events, workshops, classes and even an outdoor café
  or farmer’s market. 
   
   We have already created four murals in South Los Angeles. These murals were painted on walls in the Crenshaw district that were being tagged nightly. Since the murals have been installed, these walls have gone untouched—some for a full year. The community is proud, and building owners are ecstatic, calling them life changing for their businesses.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  All Beautify projects begin with location scouting, followed by outreach to
  building or wall owners. Once the owner is identified and approves the
  project, Beautify’s volunteer artists develop an artistic concept and
  rendering. 
   
   Community building is an integral component of our process. Project leaders identify neighborhood councils, schools and local nonprofits in order to build awareness and engage local volunteers. Next, a crew of volunteers is assembled to execute the project. They create a work plan and approach vendors for donations/discounts on supplies. 
   Murals form the focal point to connect communities. Beautify also offers free dance and arts education programs to local communities in tandem with mural creation. Other activities will be determined in partnership with the local community and may include:
   
   • Greening, gardening and landscaping 
   • Cultural events
   • Civic engagement activities
   • Street gatherings
   • Street clean-up 
   
   In recognition that creating great streets transforms neighborhoods and businesses, Mayor Garcetti established a Great Streets initiative to attract pedestrians and new businesses to revitalize streets that need help. Two of the 15 initial thoroughfares slated for improvements are in South Los Angeles (one on Crenshaw and one on Central Avenue). As part of our efforts in the next 12 months, we will be meeting with the Great Streets team to discuss incorporating Beautify’s mural painting and community development work into the Great Streets program. We will also meet with the new General Manager for Cultural Affairs about bringing our program to more neighborhoods. 
   
   Because Beautify’s program has been developed to identify and mentor neighborhood champions and inexpensively help them implement their vision for their community, Beautify can have a significant impact throughout the region within a very short timeframe. Adding two part-time staff members will allow us to accomplish the goals set out for this project and lay a firm foundation for Beautify’s future growth.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Beautify’s murals serve as vehicles of business improvement and community
  pride and inspire a connection to one’s neighborhood, one’s history and
  oneself. Murals give residents, business owners and passersby ways to identify
  neighborhoods, and serve as community gathering places. The creation and
  placement of murals has an immediate effect on the daily lives of Los Angeles
  residents and businesses. The process of the community coming together to
  create and support each mural starts building connections between neighbors
  even before the mural is created.
   
   The broken windows theory states that “maintaining and monitoring urban environments in a well-ordered condition may stop further vandalism and escalation into more serious crime.” Neglect creates a sense of hopelessness and despair. Conversely, “perceived beauty or aesthetic character of a location has a positive and significant effect on perceived community satisfaction. It is one of the most significant factors alongside economic security, good schools, and the perceived capacity for social interaction.” (Florida, Mellander and Stolarick, 2009). Aesthetic negligence is also correlated with high crime and poverty. Whether a symptom of depressed economic times, insufficient economic development or natural disaster, lack of public attention and investment leaves its stain on local residents and businesses.
   
   As neglect is viral, so is beautification. Murals empower residents and communities, and connect them with one another. Businesses that have participated in other Beautify Earth projects have reported up to a 50% increase in revenue in less than a year’s time as a result of our contribution to their otherwise blank and blighted walls. Countless residents and patrons have commented about their delight in seeing otherwise unsightly areas virtually transformed as a result of our work.
   
   Our project will infuse South Los Angeles with the same benefits. By 2050, we believe that our impact will be citywide. We will have brought art and beauty to every neglected wall and neighborhood, inspiring others to showcase their creativity and making LA one of the most inspiring cities in the world – a city that values the voice of each individual, and connects them to one another through meaningful artistic and civic engagement activities. Often forgotten, South Los Angeles will have moved past its blighted history and begin a transformation worthy of its tremendous potential.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  This project will directly benefit and impact local residents, business owners
  and artists in South Los Angeles. While the immediate effects are improved
  community pride and a sense of inspiration and transformation, Beautify’s
  efforts develop the local economy by improving local business revenue,
  attracting new investment and generating interest for tourists and visitors.
  This in turn leads to job creation across multiple industries and sectors. We
  will be helped in these efforts by our collaborators, which include two
  non-profits that focus on economic development and a local marketing firm that
  hosts an internet talk show with 300,000 monthly viewers. 
   
   According to Americans for the Arts, “communities that invest in the arts reap the additional benefits of jobs, economic growth, and a quality of life that positions those communities to compete in our 21st-century creative economy.” In other words, “Investments in public art are not just for cultural or aesthetic purposes; they also can have a positive bottom-line economic impact, with material financial benefits to their owners. Good art is good business.” (Rosenfeld, 2012).
   
   Beautification also impacts the individual. Public art projects inspire; they open minds and hearts. The mural process is both a demonstration of support and a call to action. Murals can empower youth to use their creativity to join in a sense of ownership and pride instead of following an impulse for destruction or isolation. Murals connect individuals to their neighborhoods and serve as an example that anyone can become engaged, take responsible action and lend to the richness of their own community. 
   
   Individuals who have the privilege of living and working in beautiful settings feel valued. And when people feel valued, they recognize the importance of their own voice and ability to create change in their communities. Enhancing and beautifying neighborhoods therefore paves the way for greater civic participation, including neighborhood council representation, elected official outreach and voter turnout.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  Our work is collaborative in nature. We bring together artists, community
  members, businesses, employees, property owners, government officials, their
  staff and other government workers, and philanthropic sources to volunteer
  time and/or donate goods, services or funds for mural painting, street fairs,
  arts education, outreach and other community-building activities that increase
  connections between people of varied races, backgrounds, interests, and
  socioeconomic groups.
   
   Home Depot and Sherwin William are currently collaborators providing supplies and volunteers. Project leaders live and/or work in the area and are deeply connected to their community. The project leader begins by connecting with local organizations and businesses to find walls and volunteers.
   
   In just a short time, we have interest in collaborating from: West Angeles Community Development Corporation (connected with West Angeles Church, which is a cornerstone of the Crenshaw community and involved in economic development activities in the area); George Crenshaw Development Corp. (facilitating transit-oriented development); Dan Rosenfeld, who has worked extensively in South LA, is former deputy to Supervisor Mark Ridley Thomas and President of George Crenshaw Development Corp.; and Starlett Quarles of urban X marketing (branding, urban marketing, and community PR services), who hosts an Internet talk show with 300,000 viewers and was honored as one of Los Angeles’ Most Influential African American Movers and Shakers by the LA Wave Newspaper. 
   
   We have also had conversations with area neighborhood council presidents who are excited to work with us and will include us on agendas to obtain official support in the near future. We have also reached out to the Greater LA African-American Chamber and the LA Latino Chamber. 
   
   Other potential collaborators that we have reached out to but not confirmed:
   
   Knox Presbyterian Church (volunteers); 
   St. James Armenian Apostolic Church (volunteers); 
   Park Mesa Heights Community Council (volunteers, engaging the community, outreach); Crenshaw High School (volunteers); 
   Southeast Neighborhood Council (volunteers, engaging the community, outreach); 
   CANNDU (Neighborhood Council) (volunteers, engaging the community, outreach); 
   Fremont High School (volunteers); and
   Charles Drew Middle School (volunteers).
   
   When funding is secured all collaborators will be confirmed.
