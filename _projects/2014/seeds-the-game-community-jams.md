  We are creating a game jam series of hack events and building a creative team
  based in Los Angeles and Vista, CA to make SEEDS the Game, a social action
  ecosystem of games for mobile devices. SEEDS the Game encourages players to
  tackle real life food security challenges by going outside and creating
  gardens at home and with their community. 
   
   Our work starts with a series of game jams - experimental hacklabs in California to design and develop the best game mechanics for mapping seed exchanges, pest challenges, food deserts and potential centers for community actions. We begin in September with this series of events and will be working throughout the school year with development teams from schools and community centers in the Los Angeles area. Events are a mix of game hackathon for data integration with real seed, soil and plant tests in the field at gardens, markets, and permaculture centers.
   
   Developers, alpha testers and players track and share their progress while bonding with neighbors and making friends across garden guilds. The game jam series includes integrated profiles for community organizing and organic gameplay experiments across the network of game hack teams.
   
   We dedicate our human resources to build the Grow Games community to include artists, musicians, software developers, engineers, permaculture educators and programmers in Southern California. Our implementation with the support and funds would allow us to begin the community-building and testing process starting with the alpha stage.
   
   We are scheduling the Los Angeles area to be the first in line to Alpha and Beta test SEEDS the Game. Local participants that sign up as a beta tester in Los Angeles will be first in line to provide feedback and suggestions through our feedback system while enjoying actions in community and school gardens, farmers markets and at home growing food and sharing seeds. When SEEDS the Game first round is completed, users will also have the ability to redeem vouchers for garden-related prizes at local participating markets. 
   
   Los Angeles, Pasadena and Riverside locations have been secured for first events in September and we are expanding to work with community and school gardens throughout the fall of 2014. We are looking for great school gardens to work with on playtesting, especially with youth over age 13 who can give us feedback on gameplay from new perspectives.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Los Angeles already has some of the most beautiful parks, gardens, and
  farmers’ markets in the world. Our project will get more citizens outside and
  interacting with the beauty we know is already there, as well as teaming up to
  create more green spaces and transform problem areas.
   
   In the coming year we can improve co-learning and connectedness between people and their environment while beautifying public spaces together through growing food and beneficial plants. We will map food resiliency needs while making it fun for people to grow food together and level up their skills.
   
   SEEDS the Game is a location-based game for mobile devices that can be played with GPS and data connection. We offer in-game incentives for SEEDS the Game players that are in Los Angeles including advancement in the local Leadership Board and In-Game Achievements that connect people to local actions and gameplay centers such as community and school gardens. Citizens can earn points while volunteering at participating locations or picking up gardening tools through partners that have signed up to be in our SEEDS the Game Partnership Network. 
   
   Our goal is to work with community based organizations, businesses, government and local garden leaders to identify great actions and opportunities to incentivize through gameplay. Over the coming year we expect thousands of players to engage in community volunteerism through Seeds the Game apps.
   
   Not only is SEEDS the Game beneficial to people but our games also stimulate the economy. We aim to maken Los Angeles a global innovation leader for technology addressing food/water/climate issues. By 2050, we will have created a dynamic network connecting local organizations and businesses with player/members who are also consumers. Our community will use the most cutting edge technology available to maximize our land and water use, while participants compete to create the most beautiful and inspiring gardens and public spaces. The market and gameplay are fully integrated and it is easy to see on a map where resources are needed for resiliency, disaster mitigation and food security. 
   
   We are establishing a safe connection to share real seeds around the world to promote healthy heirloom plants, biodiversity and organic solutions to pest control for our soil and water health. We anticipate a total of 3 Billion downloads by 2050, with participants cooperatively playing with players in every other country on earth.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Our goal is to encourage grandmas and kids to play together to grow food,
  share seeds, improve water conservation and energy/climate resiliency for
  people of all ages and backgrounds. At the farm we playtest with all ages and
  our team comes from 4 ethnic backgrounds with diverse experience in
  food/climate intervention for disaster relief.
   
   The SEEDS Game Jam series of events will bring together Los Angeles designers and developers with economists, game strategists, media market leaders, nonprofit organizations, youth and master gardeners aligned to connect people to food and seeds through mobile play starting in September of 2014. 
   
   SEEDS the Game as a series of apps will benefit just about everyone of all ages from diverse backgrounds, from grandmas to any kid with a phone or iPad at school. Our focus for this project is to encourage everyone who has action and adventure interest to tackle real challenges and quests to benefit the community. 
   
   SEEDS the Game not only encourages players to participate but communities as well. Nonprofit organizations can sponsor actions in the game and communities are incentivized to grow their own community garden and host farmers market. Players can earn points and skill points along the way.
   
   Communities that are heavily impacted by gang violence and youth that are raised in poverty would benefit gradually from SEEDS the Game. We cater our game to be actively engaging and will offer a special bundle for education and non-profit organizations. Other communities that are in middle income and upper middle class can also benefit by participating the quest and challenges that promote a safe and better community. 
   
   SEEDS The Game is also disguised as a gardening tool and game that allows parents to teach their kids how to grow their own food. When it is night time, players can also earn points by playing mini-games to earn more points.
   
   We have prototyped this project at an ecovillage with a food forest now growing in Vista, CA, at home gardens in Glendale, CA and at a handful of aligned hackathons and conferences with industry leaders. Our partners include NGO allies in 6 countries eager to test with us in 2015 and become global connection zones for Los Angeles players to share their insights and what’s working to grow great food in LA.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Collaborators that are confirmed include Growcology (a nonprofit organization
  for permaculture education based in Southern California), Southern California
  Permaculture Guild, the global Seed Libraries network, Project Nuevo Mundo
  (community food growth nonprofit) along with project partnerships at school
  gardens, Burners without Borders and development allies at major universities:
  USC Games for talent in game design, UC Riverside for talent in animation and
  storytelling for games, JMU for data/climate integration and allies from the
  CalTech innovation community currently assisting with engineering and backend
  design.
   
   In 2015 we are lining up to trade seeds and growing experience with communities rebuilding in Haiti and Philippines through Communitare, an international NGO connecting local talent with opportunities to volunteer in rebuilding and relief efforts. We will also be connecting the LA #seedsthegame community to our allies in Central and South America for seedsharing challenges and knowledge sharing and we will be sharing some of our indigenous community work at social impact and social entrepreneurship conferences in California as an example of social benefit corporations incubated within the networked community.
   
   Additional allies include Ron Finley and his work to grow food with youth in Los Angeles, UrbanTXT working with youth and mobile development, Vortex Immersion hosting events with us in Los Angeles near LAUSD and La Loma, a local permaculture development company providing playtesting space for people to grow food for the first time during our game jam series. Some of these are now confirming for the next round and we have worked with Vortex in the past on the State of the Arts immersion experience.
   
   We are currently considering collaborating within the LA Technology community (business and government-focused) along with talent from local game companies, schools and hacker/maker community groups. We have shared #SeedstheGame at the Verge conference for green solutions for business and government and with the Federal Games Guild which is informally helping us position for federal and international NGO funding in 2015.
