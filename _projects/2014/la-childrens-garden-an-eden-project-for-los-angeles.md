Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  We've partnered with Environmental Charter High School in Lawndale and Mia
  Lehrer + Associates to site one of the most innovative school campuses and
  botanic gardens imaginable. Muir Ranch currently occupies 3.5 acres in
  Pasadena and features a student-run CSA vegetable subscription program,
  catering and long table dinners and full event floral jobs training programs
  for low-income high school students. A LA children's garden will be an
  expansion of our existing work. Designing and building this "farm" will be a
  hands-on project for our students and our adult professional mentors from all
  sectors: design, entertainment, hospitality (food), #green construction and
  education.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  LA does not have a children's garden like New York or Chicago (or even Dayton,
  Ohio). It's a double shame since we live in a year-round outdoor growing
  climate unlike our eastern sisters. 
   
   Kids that interact with nature and each other learn more and faster. And nothing inspires wonder like sunflowers in a Van Gogh field or a spiral maze of zinnias and kale. And once kids engage with nature they might be more inclined to empathize with it and want to do more to travel lightly on the planet. 
   
   The farm will be a school for the students who build it. It will be a wonderful place for younger students to visit and play. The farm will be teaching tool for educators. And like a church, it is the people who gather and invest their time there.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Elementary and Pre-k students: they need places to explore and interact. Think
  Kidspace as a garden! 
   
   High School Students: look what's possible a career, as a farmer and a learner in service.
   
   Teachers: see what's possible as an educator and know you are supported at your school to teach kids what they are capable of. 
   
   Angelenos: not all soil needs to be covered up! Let's grow a flower farm.
   
   Butterflies: we need more milkweed for Monarchs.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Muir Ranch is a teen jobs program that looks like a farm. We are working with
  Environmental Charter High School to build the LA Children's Garden as a
  project-based learning campus.
   
   "Environmental Charter High School (ECHS) is an award winning, free, public high school in South Los Angeles that prepares students for 4-year colleges using the environment as a lens for real-life learning. Our schools place an emphasis on experiential, project-based learning that engages students as it prepares them to become leaders in their communities."
   
   Mia Lehrer + Associates' projects include the LA River, Vista Hermosa Park, TreePeople campus and the Natural History Museum. Amazing sites!
   
   Muir Ranch is supported by dozens of corporate and individual donors and customers via are CSA program. We sell vegetables to retail customers and horticulture companies (Baker Creek, Seeds of Change and Organiks) provide endless plant and seed material. Both major program partners, ECHS and MLA, with Muir Ranch bring education and design expertise to create a space where all can learn and #play!
