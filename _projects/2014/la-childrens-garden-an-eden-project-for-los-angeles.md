    We've partnered with Environmental Charter High School in Lawndale and Mia
    Lehrer + Associates to site one of the most innovative school campuses and
    botanic gardens imaginable. Muir Ranch currently occupies 3.5 acres in
    Pasadena and features a student-run CSA vegetable subscription program,
    catering and long table dinners and full event floral jobs training programs
    for low-income high school students. A LA children's garden will be an
    expansion of our existing work. Designing and building this "farm" will be a
    hands-on project for our students and our adult professional mentors from
    all sectors: design, entertainment, hospitality (food), #green construction
    and education.

    There's a growing movement of school gardens across all parts of LA County.
    They all have common needs: compost, tools, skilled gardeners and water-wise
    irrigation. A LA Children's garden could support them all with material,
    technical and training resources. If you put a charter high school in the
    middle of it you have one of the best learning labs around. If you add a
    concert venue and meeting space to this flower farm you have a truly dynamic
    learning and play space.

  achievable_goal: >-
    Muir Ranch was started 3 years ago on 2 acres with $5,000 and a supportive
    school. Once we've chosen our specific site (any acre with dirt, sun and
    access to water) making fields bloom is not hard. Not at all. We create the
    learning and work environment where our student interns and the farm can
    literally bloom. 
  major_challenges: "We have several candidate sites. Dozens. We need a 5 year+ lease with govt. agencies to secure the space.\r\n\r\nHaving dozens of sites to choose from makes for tough choices. Which one? Which one? That's a good problem. \r\n\r\nWe have faith in dahlias and kids. "
  competition: >-
    There is no publicly owned children's garden in LA County. It's an omission.
    EnrichLA, Rootdown LA, Garden School Foundation and the American Heart
    Association all work with gardens at schools but none specifically as
    public-service high school-based service models. The Huntington Botanic
    Garden does have a small children's garden but it is very private and very
    expensive. The Los Angeles Zoo is a botanic garden (officially speaking) but
    the plants are props to the seals and elephants, c'mon now. 
  cost: >-
    $100,000 IS MORE than enough to build a small farm. THAT IS THE START. ECHS
    has raised $750,000 in FY 2013. Muir Ranch receives $250,000/year in in-kind
    garden resources. 
  budget: "50/50 budget: staff/stuff\r\n\r\nObviously $100,000 will not build a house... or a traditional school... or a botanic garden. But it will build a farm aka a children's garden and outdoor learning lab.\r\n\r\nWe'll be relying largely on volunteers but we do have a budget for shipping container structures and irrigation, the two major site improvements. \r\n\r\n$25,000 coordinator\r\n$25,000 intern salaries\r\n\r\n$10,000 shipping containers (2)\r\n$20,000 bobcat tractor\r\n$10,000 irrigation\r\n$10,000 miscellaneous supplies (tools, fencing, shade cloth, weed control) \r\n"

    answer: "We have several candidate sites. Dozens. We need a 5 year+ lease with govt. agencies to secure the space.\r\n\r\nHaving dozens of sites to choose from makes for tough choices. Which one? Which one? That's a good problem. \r\n\r\nWe have faith in dahlias and kids. "

      There is no publicly owned children's garden in LA County. It's an
      omission. EnrichLA, Rootdown LA, Garden School Foundation and the American
      Heart Association all work with gardens at schools but none specifically
      as public-service high school-based service models. The Huntington Botanic
      Garden does have a small children's garden but it is very private and very
      expensive. The Los Angeles Zoo is a botanic garden (officially speaking)
      but the plants are props to the seals and elephants, c'mon now.

      $100,000 IS MORE than enough to build a small farm. THAT IS THE START.
      ECHS has raised $750,000 in FY 2013. Muir Ranch receives $250,000/year in
      in-kind garden resources.

    answer: "50/50 budget: staff/stuff\r\n\r\nObviously $100,000 will not build a house... or a traditional school... or a botanic garden. But it will build a farm aka a children's garden and outdoor learning lab.\r\n\r\nWe'll be relying largely on volunteers but we do have a budget for shipping container structures and irrigation, the two major site improvements. \r\n\r\n$25,000 coordinator\r\n$25,000 intern salaries\r\n\r\n$10,000 shipping containers (2)\r\n$20,000 bobcat tractor\r\n$10,000 irrigation\r\n$10,000 miscellaneous supplies (tools, fencing, shade cloth, weed control) \r\n"
