Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  The collaboration of Netiya and Seeds of Hope through Open Grove involves
  engaging the untapped power of our faith-based institutions around food
  justice. As a combined network of close to 250 institutions, we start with
  accessing willing partners that can offer acreage, resources, and volunteers
  from our institutions. We build out a collaborative network wherein Open Grove
  offers institutions with deeply rooted and, in many cases, shared ethics, an
  opportunity to become powerfully aligned with one another around food justice
  in LA. 
   
   The viability of our 2050 vision will be demonstrated within the next year by taking on the following measurables:
   
   1) Develop three pilot orchard projects at three faith-based institutions representing geographic, religious, socioeconomic, and land-use diversity. Complete experiential and educational orchard installs and have the three institutions coordinating their own sustainable garden maintenance plans.
   
   2) Initiate large-scale interfaith food justice collaboration through institutional engagement by convening a one-day, interfaith food awareness summit targeted toward religious and lay leaders across institutions, building upon the Seeds of Hope conference that was held in May 2014. This conference will focus on shmita - the religious commandment of leaving the land fallow every seven years (from September 2014-2015). We’ll hold interfaith discussions about how to improve upon our food growing operations so the recipients of the food relief become more empowered - and focus on food sovereignty rather than furthering hand outs.
   
   3) Convene an “Interfaith Council” that meets twice a year to collaborate and support ongoing food production efforts, building upon Netiya’s successful model Council. Hold meetings sharing best practices on food procurement and food security with interfaith clergy and lay leadership.
   
   4) Develop and distribute a “Your Congregation's Sustainable, Water-Wise Orchard Resource Guide.” Perhaps it will have a shorter title! The guide will give tools to our network institutions to plant and maintain orchards on their properties and contribute the produce to grow community food security.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Converting faith-based institutions’ unused land into productive green space
  will expand urban green areas and bring about related environmental benefits.
  These include temperature reduction, energy conservation, fewer smog and red
  alert days, improved water quality, and sequestering of greenhouse gases. In
  particular, there is an acute awareness of the need for more green space in
  low-income urban environments. In this way, Open Grove’s approach can have a
  particularly powerful impact on the health of these communities, as religious
  institutions are very strong players and can become a starting point for
  cultivating new and improved access to green spaces. 
   
   Open Grove’s other benefits result from shifting towards local sustainable food systems, as a response to food safety and food access issues, as well as national epidemics of hunger and obesity. The focus on planting urban orchards is intentional, as we assert that urban orchards can have a much more significant effect on the long-term food system than annual vegetable gardens. Once established and producing, orchards can produce food for decades, and, in the case of nut trees, can produce healthy food with high caloric value. Orchards are also significantly easier to maintain once established, need far less material (compost, mulch, plastic irrigation supplies), water, and labor than annual gardens, and many orchards will produce food even if they are left alone for years. And Open Grove will work with gleaning networks in LA that already work on private and public orchards to provide food to local pantries.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Open Grove recognizes its place in a much larger urban sustainability movement
  in Los Angeles that provides environmental, economic, and societal benefits to
  Angelenos. By funding two networks to collaborate on installing Urban Orchards
  on institutional land, this project will effectively free up more unused land
  to increase food production. It will also do two vital things: 1) it will
  enhance the food justice collaboration between secular and religious sectors
  and 2) it will give voice to the religious and spiritual people / institutions
  in LA that have not yet been harnessed and serve to literally and figuratively
  “feed” this growing food movement. Specifically, Open Grove is part of the
  much larger urban greening, local food production, and food justice movements.
  By engaging powerful faith-based allies across the city in planting urban
  orchards, Open Grove will amplify the social and environmental benefits of
  tree planting for food, creating positive effects that will last for decades.

How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Specific partners that have been identified are the Metropolitan Water
  District, Greywater Corps, The River Project, LA Community Garden Council, New
  Horizon Muslim School in Pasadena, the New Community Jewish High School,
  Temple Beth Hillel, the North Hollywood Interfaith Food Pantry, the Unitarian
  Universalist Church, Temple Beth Ohr, All Saints Episcopal Church, Temple Beth
  Israel of Highland Park and Eagle Rock, the Prince of Peace Episcopal Church
  and the West Valley Food Pantry as a demonstration orchard and a model of the
  direct orchard-to-pantry model. 
   
   Some partners do advocacy, some provide funding, others provide land, and still others find the materials needed to install the orchards.
   
   We have very specific membership and partnership terms for all collaborations. We work towards a model of empowerment and reciprocity. We are happy to forward a PDF with our terms for your perusal. 
   
   Potential partners may come from the public or private sector, including corporations, academia, water agencies, other food and environmental nonprofits, and workforce development agencies. We would specifically expect to continue to engage our network partner institutions, UC Master Gardener, Master Composter, and Master Food Preserver volunteers, Brown Mountain CSA, Social Justice Learning Institute, Food Forward, Tree People, the Million Trees Initiative, the Yale University Urban Resources Initiative, SOVA and the NoHo interfaith food pantry. We will also bring in community organizations and youth groups to help start up and manage the orchards in their local neighborhoods, potentially establishing new community hubs in areas with limited access to fresh food.
   
   The collaboration with Seeds of Hope is confirmed - this is Netiya main partner. The food justice ministry of the Episcopal Diocese of LA established to repurpose church property and facilities for the production and distribution of food in underserved communities across the six-county diocese. The program currently grows food at nearly 100 locations and operates 60 food pantries and 50 feeding programs as well as providing nutrition and fitness education. Executive Director, Tim Alderson, came to Seeds of Hope from a lifetime in agriculture. He was the founder and former CEO of AgriGator, Inc., a multinational soil amendment company and the founding chairman of the California School Garden Network, a statewide network of public and private sector organizations united in support of school gardens.
