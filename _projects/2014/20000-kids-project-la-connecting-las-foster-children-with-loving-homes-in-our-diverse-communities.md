    Today, 20,000 children languish in LA’s foster care system.  RAC will apply
    its successful model of recruiting prospective parents and helping match
    them with children awaiting loving homes by broadening its outreach to a
    more inclusive constituency.  In addition to its LGBT audience, RAC will
    broaden its focus to include LA’s Latino and welcoming faith-based
    communities. RAC will further develop/expand its existing outreach model to
    a year-round initiative which will include an emphasis on a strong social
    media campaign supported by radio, television, outdoor advertising, and
    events to recruit and educate prospective parents.  RAC also provides direct
    services to assist LA County DCFS to facilitate and expedite parent-child
    matches.
  implement: "Founded in 2011, RAC enjoyed immediate recruitment success as we launched a creative multi-media campaign to encourage the LGBT community of LA to build families through fostering and adoption. By 2012, our extended national reach and improved campaign strategies resulted in recruiting more than 600 prospective foster/adoptive parents.  In 2013, RAC and Huffington Post Gay Voices launched a weekly series entitled “Let Love Define Family™.” Several of our stories have gone viral including http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/28/wendy-gay-family_n_5042297.html.  \r\n\r\nToday, more than 2,200 individuals have signed up at the www.RaiseAChild.US website to take the “Next Step to Parenthood.” Through our 3 year history of events and ad campaigns, RAC has engaged with tens of thousands more. \r\n\r\nRAC,is unique as we coordinate with our fost/adopt agency partners to provide our prospective parents with formalized assistance through our Parent Advocate Program, which combines personalized attention with the technological support of a cloud-based case management system.  Locally, our outcomes are extremely impressive:  partnering with Los Angeles County agencies, our Parent Advocate has been able to move prospective parents through the training and certification process at a success rate of 26%, significantly greater than the national average of only 5%.  \r\nRAC is now well positioned to open its programs/services to a broader, more inclusive constituency and plans to begin this journey by branching out to the Spanish speaking (which represents approximately 48% of the LA population) and heterosexual communities of LA County.  Currently, more than 11% of our database is comprised of single heterosexuals.  Funding from the My LA 2050 grant will allow us to add: 1)  a bilingual FTE Parent Advocate to make inroads into the Hispanic community and expand our ability to place more children in loving homes throughout LA; 2)  increase by 25% our single heterosexual cohort by modifying and targeting our marketing efforts.\r\nAs part of this initiative, all of RAC’s online and printed outreach materials will be translated to Spanish and its key recruitment message, “Let Love Define Family™” will be developed for special events. The Parent Advocate will follow up, providing personalized one-to-one guidance to each prospective parent. We also plan to begin a dialogue with several inclusive and welcoming faith-based organizations to further promote our enhanced mission."
  impact_connect: "Every parent sees endless possibilities and great hope in the eyes of a child. As Angelenos, when we look at today’s children. But for our children to thrive and Los Angeles to stay a city in which people stay connected, we must support their development, their parents, their families and the public policies that work for all. Studies show that the earliest of experiences in supportive environments are essential to how children succeed in their lifetimes. In order for communities to come together cohesively to create a prosperous Los Angeles by 2050, we must invest in children now.\r\nRAC is proud of our own success stories. Long Beach, California residents Bianca and her wife, Tonie, initially found the road to building a family through foster/adoption to be lonely and complicated.  It was the couple’s social worker at LA County Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) who suggested RaiseAChild.US for support and direction.\r\n“We attended a RaiseAChild.US event in West Hollywood, last December,” said Bianca.  “Soon after, 18month-old Jacob was placed in our home.  Throughout the process, we continued to access RaiseAChild.US support for referrals and advice on adoption finalization.”\r\n“Jacob has not only changed our lives but the lives of our family and friends,” says Tonie. “His grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, and friends have all embraced Jacob as part of the family. Jacob has adopted all of us.”\r\n\r\nThis project meets two critically important metrics in the Connect application. First, RAC’s Parent Advocate Program directly addresses ‘Adults getting sufficient social & emotional support’ with its personalized service to all prospective parents navigating the foster/adoption process. Next, our close work with the LA County Department of Children and Family Services has been a key factor in the agency’s improved communication with waiting parents and increasing its child placement rate. This addresses the second (dream) metric of ‘Government responsiveness to residents’ needs.’\r\n \r\nOur goal is to improve the foster care system in LA County by 2050 and hold it high as a shining example of how diverse communities can come together to the benefit of children in the foster care system. Our vision is to create a community of good fost/adopt families in LA County that will multiple and proudly support one another well in to the future. In addition, RAC will be primed to export our business model to foster agencies for replication in other US cities.\r\n"
  who_benefit: "This project will reduce the number of children who continue to languish in LA’s foster care system by many as 2,000 within a two-year time frame. By connecting these children to loving adoptive homes, they are more likely to receive the support and medical and emotional attention that they need to thrive.  \r\nFostering and adoption are slow processes, but our goal is to recruit and begin to process 1,000 new prospective homes during the grant period; this would represent an increase of 192% beyond RAC’s current annual matching rate.\r\nAlready lauded for its capacity to move prospective parents through the adoption system at a rate that is five times the national average, RAC’s Parent Advocate Program will dramatically expand its reach through the addition of a full-time bilingual social worker.  Backed by newly-developed Spanish language materials, the new advocate will help meet the culturally specific needs of Latinos who seek to foster or adopt as well as the need to find culturally sensitive placements for Latino youth in foster care.  This addition to our staff will ensure our continued responsiveness.  \r\nExpanding our unique programs and services will also help to reduce the ‘drop out’ rate of prospective foster/adopt parents who so often give up since the process has been so cumbersome, significantly ease caseloads of DCFS social workers and of particular importance, RAC’s innovative methods of working with the system, will continue to cut and curb government spending.  For every child adopted in LA County, there is an estimate national savings to the taxpayer of over $15,000.\r\n"
  collaboration: "To accomplish this expansion to a more inclusive audience, RAC plans to work in tandem with its seven vetted foster/adopt partners in LA, with whom we have formal sponsorship agreements: LA County Department of Children & Family Services; Penny Lane Centers; Southern California Foster Family & Adoption Agency; The Village Family Services; Five Acres; Vista Del Mar; and Westside Children's Center. Each of these organizations will continue to work closely with RAC to help match available children with prospective parents and provide a seamless transition as the new initiative gets off the ground.  RAC will seek out key leaders in the Hispanic community, an audience that has been researched for its feasibility and pilot tested with Penny Lane Centers, one of our partner agencies. Together, we placed several targeted spots on KLVE and KTNQ, popular Southern California Spanish language radio stations and the immediate response was that nearly 70 prospective foster/adopt parents signed up at our website or called the RAC office.  We will also identify and reach out to welcoming clergy who might be willing to test pilot a small scale collaboration within their respective congregations.  While RAC will benefit in the identification of children and parents to be matched as part of its core services by partnering with these entities, the value to them in finding homes for children, many of whom come from the populations they serve, will provide them a substantive role in addressing a critical community need in keeping with their respective missions.\r\n\r\nFactors critical to the success of this effort are 1) recruiting appropriate staff who understands the cultural sensitivities to carry out the myriad of details/programs/services; 2) identifying clergy who are committed to helping RAC find loving homes for children in foster care and who endorse our message to its parishioners; and 3) funding necessary to conduct a year-long outreach campaign, thereby laying the foundation for sustaining these recruitment efforts for years to come.\r\n"

  evaluate: "RaiseAChild.US (RAC) has an existing model which will drive and measure the success of the 20,000 LA Kids Project.  Our Parent Advocate Program design is distinctive as it combines the personalized attention of a mentor with the technological support of a cloud-based case management system. The result is that RAC has a program that has been tested and proven, unlike any in the country, which provides measured and ongoing support and guidance to all of its prospective parents as they navigate the foster/adoption process. Through this custom designed, proprietary system, the Parent Advocate is able to easily and closely monitor the progress of each prospective parent. \r\n\r\nAt any given time, RAC can identify and track:\r\n•\tThe number of prospects who come to RAC through its campaigns, events, websites, word of mouth, etc.\r\n•\tThe number of prospective parents who have begun the necessary orientation, training and certification steps -- or where they are in the process; and\r\n•\tThe number of recruits to contact personally and provide support and guidance because they have not followed through on the specific stages of the foster/adoption process.\r\n\r\nThe RaiseAChild.US Parent Advocate Program is able to track and facilitate the progress of all of our identified prospective parents. In the program's first 16 months, RAC helped our Los Angeles County agency partners retain and move prospective parents through the training and certification program at a success rate of 26%, a retention rate five times higher than the national average of 5%. We anticipate this rate will climb to 30% within the next six months as we continue to assess and refine our program model.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the success of LA2050 / 20,000 Kids Project LA will measured by the numbers of new fost/adopt prospective parents that are recruited, trained and certified, placed with children from LA County's foster system, and eventually adopted.. Our goals are to:\r\n\r\n\t• Recruit 1,000 prospective parents in the targeted cohorts \r\n\t• Screen, orient and train 35% of the total number of prospective parents recruited\r\n\t• Counsel and support 350+ prospective parents through the foster/adoption process (includes 15 hours of supportive activities per parent)\r\n\t• Assist in finalizing the adoption of 600+ children over an 24 month period.\r\n"
  two_lessons: "Youth in foster care are in the system through no fault of their own -- and each of them deserves to experience a loving home where they can feel secure and thrive. According to recent statistics, nearly 110,000 children in foster care are waiting to be adopted, 20,000 in LA County alone. There are an additional 300,000 children in need of immediate foster placement. More than 1,000 enter foster care each day and remain there for an average of two years. The majority of foster agencies, including LA County DCFS, are unable to make the headway necessary to significantly decrease these numbers. Due to imbedded bureaucracy, budget and staffing constraints and outdated protocols, these agencies cannot provide the depth of services that the Parent Advocate Program delivers. \r\n\r\nRAC’s founder and CEO Rich Valenza’s love for children, social justice and personal experience in building a family through fostering and adoption, served as the catalyst to establish RaiseAChild.  He understands first-hand the struggles and challenges one faces when navigating family building through the foster care system.  Given our retention rate success of moving prospective foster/adopt parents from recruitment to licensing and certification continues to soar overwhelmingly above the national average, RAC is well poised to make a substantial impact by continuing to expand its reach, particularly to targeted communities often ignored by traditional adoption services, to improve the outcomes for children and prospective parents facing the adoption system.\r\n"
  achievable_goal: "Since 2011, RaiseAChild.US has achieved success serving children in the foster care system throughout Los Angeles County through three strategic initiatives: \r\n\r\nOutreach Campaigns -- RaiseAChild.US works with its foster/adoption agency partners to create and manage multi-media campaigns that promote family building to a broad spectrum of prospective foster and adoptive parents. \r\n\r\nEducational Programs -- RaiseAChild.US produces thorough, effective foster/adoption informational programs for its foster/adoption agency partners to educate and motivate prospective foster and adoptive parents. \r\n\r\nParent Advocate Program -- In February 2013, through the generous support of The Annenberg Foundation, CICA, Los Angeles County Department of Children & Family Services, and ACMS Inc., RaiseAChild.US established the Parent Advocate Program, which provides personalized support to each recruit as they undergo the detailed process of initial interest, qualification, orientation, training, and ultimately matching them with a child. This service is provided free of charge. \r\n\r\nThe LA2050 grant will enable RAC to launch the 20,000 LA Kids Project as an expansion of its existing year-round outreach, education and support programs for the LBGT community. \r\n"
  major_challenges: "In all likelihood, we anticipate that working with small grassroots partners/faith-based organizations will take more time/hand-holding than in the past although necessary given their value add access to our targeted communities.  It may also be a challenge to identify and foster relationships with the faith-based community as their receptiveness to the LGBT community – our core constituency – has not always been the case.\r\n\r\nAlso, replicating efforts, although targeting different communities, is always dependent on finding the staff that matches the culture of the start up.  RAC’s current Parent Advocate has an undergraduate degree in Psychology and Education and graduate degree in Education for Special Populations and brings more than 20 years’ experience to this role. In addition, he has first-hand experience with the foster/adoption process, as over the past 15 years, he has adopted seven children through foster care.  Finding his equal will be a challenge that RAC is very conscious of and prepared to meet going forward.\r\n"
  competition: "RAC provides a service unlike any other. While it works closely with partner agencies that are charged with recruiting potential foster parents, the majority of these organizations do not have the marketing expertise or other resources to design and carry out media campaigns, advertise, implement recruitment events, or fast track waiting parents and children. In addition, none have a designated Parent Advocate Program, which combines the personalized attention of a mentor with the technological support of a cloud-based case management system. The result is that RaiseAChild has a program that has been tested and proven, unlike any in the country, which provides measured and ongoing support and guidance to all of its prospective parents as they navigate the foster/adoption process. Through this custom designed, proprietary system, the Parent Advocate is able to easily and closely monitor the progress of each prospective parent. \r\n\r\nNone of our partner agencies have achieved individually, the type of recruitment success that RaiseAChild has in such a short period of time. And with the forecasting ability of our case management system, those numbers will continue to climb. 87% of the agencies served by RaiseAChild manage and track their recruits manually on hand-written files. For them, RaiseAChild.US provides the benefits of our own case management and computerized reporting systems. Without RAC's intervention, however, wait times would continue to increase and the number of children leaving foster care would not be as great.\r\n"
  cost: "Currently, RAC has planned a $158,453 budget encompassing our outreach, recruitment, and support programs to the LGBT community for the following campaigns and events:\r\n\tAug/Sept 2014:\r\n\t\tRAC/DCFS Child Presentation Events (4X)\t\r\n\tSept/Oct 2014:\r\n\t\t“Let Love Define Family” Campaign Video & PSA Production\r\n\t\tLGBT National Print Ads\r\n\tNov 2014 – National Adoption Month / “Let Love Define Family” Campaign:\r\n\t\tRadio Advertising\r\n\t\tStreet-Light Banners\r\n\t\tLos Angeles Times Partnership\r\n\tDec 2014 – “Let Love Define Family” Educational Event\r\n\tFeb 2015 – “Let Love Define Family” Social Media Campaign\r\n\tMay 2015 – National Foster Care Month:\r\n\t\t“Call Me Mom” Educational Event\r\n\t\t\tRadio Advertising\r\n\t\t\tEvent Production & Venue\r\n\t\tLong Beach Pride Vendor Booth & Promotion\r\n\t\tLGBT National Print Ads\r\n\tJun 2015 – Pride Month\r\n\t\t5th Annual Gay Father’s Day Brunch\r\n\r\nFunding for this budget is provided by our seven local partner agencies, private donors, and through foundation grants including CICA, The Ralph M. Parsons Foundation, and The Eisner Foundation.  \r\n \r\nWith the Goldhirsh Foundation LA2050 award, RAC will make necessary message and visual alterations, targeted translations, and staff enhancements to the planned outreach and event campaigns to accommodate a secondary budget for a board appeal.  The $100,000 award will allow RAC to enhance the planned budget and schedule by adding Spanish-language radio and street-light banner buys, while creating and producing promotional materials, campaigns and events to target LA’s Latino and welcoming faith-based communities.  \r\n"

  This project will reduce the number of children who continue to languish in
  LA’s foster care system by many as 2,000 within a two-year time frame. By
  connecting these children to loving adoptive homes, they are more likely to
  receive the support and medical and emotional attention that they need to
  thrive. 
   Fostering and adoption are slow processes, but our goal is to recruit and begin to process 1,000 new prospective homes during the grant period; this would represent an increase of 192% beyond RAC’s current annual matching rate.
   Already lauded for its capacity to move prospective parents through the adoption system at a rate that is five times the national average, RAC’s Parent Advocate Program will dramatically expand its reach through the addition of a full-time bilingual social worker.

For every child adopted in LA County, there is an estimate national savings to the taxpayer of over $15,000.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  To accomplish this expansion to a more inclusive audience, RAC plans to work
  in tandem with its seven vetted foster/adopt partners in LA, with whom we have
  formal sponsorship agreements: LA County Department of Children & Family
  Services; Penny Lane Centers; Southern California Foster Family & Adoption
  Agency; The Village Family Services; Five Acres; Vista Del Mar; and Westside
  Children's Center. Each of these organizations will continue to work closely
  with RAC to help match available children with prospective parents and provide
  a seamless transition as the new initiative gets off the ground. RAC will seek
  out key leaders in the Hispanic community, an audience that has been
  researched for its feasibility and pilot tested with Penny Lane Centers, one
  of our partner agencies. Together, we placed several targeted spots on KLVE
  and KTNQ, popular Southern California Spanish language radio stations and the
  immediate response was that nearly 70 prospective foster/adopt parents signed
  up at our website or called the RAC office. We will also identify and reach
  out to welcoming clergy who might be willing to test pilot a small scale
  collaboration within their respective congregations. While RAC will benefit in
  the identification of children and parents to be matched as part of its core
  services by partnering with these entities, the value to them in finding homes
  for children, many of whom come from the populations they serve, will provide
  them a substantive role in addressing a critical community need in keeping
  with their respective missions.
   
   Factors critical to the success of this effort are 1) recruiting appropriate staff who understands the cultural sensitivities to carry out the myriad of details/programs/services; 2) identifying clergy who are committed to helping RAC find loving homes for children in foster care and who endorse our message to its parishioners; and 3) funding necessary to conduct a year-long outreach campaign, thereby laying the foundation for sustaining these recruitment efforts for years to come.

      Today, 20,000 children languish in LA’s foster care system.  RAC will
      apply its successful model of recruiting prospective parents and helping
      match them with children awaiting loving homes by broadening its outreach
      to a more inclusive constituency.  In addition to its LGBT audience, RAC
      will broaden its focus to include LA’s Latino and welcoming faith-based
      communities. RAC will further develop/expand its existing outreach model
      to a year-round initiative which will include an emphasis on a strong
      social media campaign supported by radio, television, outdoor advertising,
      and events to recruit and educate prospective parents.  RAC also provides
      direct services to assist LA County DCFS to facilitate and expedite
      parent-child matches.

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Founded in 2011, RAC enjoyed immediate recruitment success as we launched a creative multi-media campaign to encourage the LGBT community of LA to build families through fostering and adoption. By 2012, our extended national reach and improved campaign strategies resulted in recruiting more than 600 prospective foster/adoptive parents.  In 2013, RAC and Huffington Post Gay Voices launched a weekly series entitled “Let Love Define Family™.” Several of our stories have gone viral including http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/28/wendy-gay-family_n_5042297.html.  \r\n\r\nToday, more than 2,200 individuals have signed up at the www.RaiseAChild.US website to take the “Next Step to Parenthood.” Through our 3 year history of events and ad campaigns, RAC has engaged with tens of thousands more. \r\n\r\nRAC,is unique as we coordinate with our fost/adopt agency partners to provide our prospective parents with formalized assistance through our Parent Advocate Program, which combines personalized attention with the technological support of a cloud-based case management system.  Locally, our outcomes are extremely impressive:  partnering with Los Angeles County agencies, our Parent Advocate has been able to move prospective parents through the training and certification process at a success rate of 26%, significantly greater than the national average of only 5%.  \r\nRAC is now well positioned to open its programs/services to a broader, more inclusive constituency and plans to begin this journey by branching out to the Spanish speaking (which represents approximately 48% of the LA population) and heterosexual communities of LA County.  Currently, more than 11% of our database is comprised of single heterosexuals.  Funding from the My LA 2050 grant will allow us to add: 1)  a bilingual FTE Parent Advocate to make inroads into the Hispanic community and expand our ability to place more children in loving homes throughout LA; 2)  increase by 25% our single heterosexual cohort by modifying and targeting our marketing efforts.\r\nAs part of this initiative, all of RAC’s online and printed outreach materials will be translated to Spanish and its key recruitment message, “Let Love Define Family™” will be developed for special events. The Parent Advocate will follow up, providing personalized one-to-one guidance to each prospective parent. We also plan to begin a dialogue with several inclusive and welcoming faith-based organizations to further promote our enhanced mission."

    answer: "Every parent sees endless possibilities and great hope in the eyes of a child. As Angelenos, when we look at today’s children. But for our children to thrive and Los Angeles to stay a city in which people stay connected, we must support their development, their parents, their families and the public policies that work for all. Studies show that the earliest of experiences in supportive environments are essential to how children succeed in their lifetimes. In order for communities to come together cohesively to create a prosperous Los Angeles by 2050, we must invest in children now.\r\nRAC is proud of our own success stories. Long Beach, California residents Bianca and her wife, Tonie, initially found the road to building a family through foster/adoption to be lonely and complicated.  It was the couple’s social worker at LA County Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) who suggested RaiseAChild.US for support and direction.\r\n“We attended a RaiseAChild.US event in West Hollywood, last December,” said Bianca.  “Soon after, 18month-old Jacob was placed in our home.  Throughout the process, we continued to access RaiseAChild.US support for referrals and advice on adoption finalization.”\r\n“Jacob has not only changed our lives but the lives of our family and friends,” says Tonie. “His grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, and friends have all embraced Jacob as part of the family. Jacob has adopted all of us.”\r\n\r\nThis project meets two critically important metrics in the Connect application. First, RAC’s Parent Advocate Program directly addresses ‘Adults getting sufficient social & emotional support’ with its personalized service to all prospective parents navigating the foster/adoption process. Next, our close work with the LA County Department of Children and Family Services has been a key factor in the agency’s improved communication with waiting parents and increasing its child placement rate. This addresses the second (dream) metric of ‘Government responsiveness to residents’ needs.’\r\n \r\nOur goal is to improve the foster care system in LA County by 2050 and hold it high as a shining example of how diverse communities can come together to the benefit of children in the foster care system. Our vision is to create a community of good fost/adopt families in LA County that will multiple and proudly support one another well in to the future. In addition, RAC will be primed to export our business model to foster agencies for replication in other US cities.\r\n"

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "This project will reduce the number of children who continue to languish in LA’s foster care system by many as 2,000 within a two-year time frame. By connecting these children to loving adoptive homes, they are more likely to receive the support and medical and emotional attention that they need to thrive.  \r\nFostering and adoption are slow processes, but our goal is to recruit and begin to process 1,000 new prospective homes during the grant period; this would represent an increase of 192% beyond RAC’s current annual matching rate.\r\nAlready lauded for its capacity to move prospective parents through the adoption system at a rate that is five times the national average, RAC’s Parent Advocate Program will dramatically expand its reach through the addition of a full-time bilingual social worker.  Backed by newly-developed Spanish language materials, the new advocate will help meet the culturally specific needs of Latinos who seek to foster or adopt as well as the need to find culturally sensitive placements for Latino youth in foster care.  This addition to our staff will ensure our continued responsiveness.  \r\nExpanding our unique programs and services will also help to reduce the ‘drop out’ rate of prospective foster/adopt parents who so often give up since the process has been so cumbersome, significantly ease caseloads of DCFS social workers and of particular importance, RAC’s innovative methods of working with the system, will continue to cut and curb government spending.  For every child adopted in LA County, there is an estimate national savings to the taxpayer of over $15,000.\r\n"

      We strongly support collaboration, please tell us a little more about your
      partnership.
    answer: "To accomplish this expansion to a more inclusive audience, RAC plans to work in tandem with its seven vetted foster/adopt partners in LA, with whom we have formal sponsorship agreements: LA County Department of Children & Family Services; Penny Lane Centers; Southern California Foster Family & Adoption Agency; The Village Family Services; Five Acres; Vista Del Mar; and Westside Children's Center. Each of these organizations will continue to work closely with RAC to help match available children with prospective parents and provide a seamless transition as the new initiative gets off the ground.  RAC will seek out key leaders in the Hispanic community, an audience that has been researched for its feasibility and pilot tested with Penny Lane Centers, one of our partner agencies. Together, we placed several targeted spots on KLVE and KTNQ, popular Southern California Spanish language radio stations and the immediate response was that nearly 70 prospective foster/adopt parents signed up at our website or called the RAC office.  We will also identify and reach out to welcoming clergy who might be willing to test pilot a small scale collaboration within their respective congregations.  While RAC will benefit in the identification of children and parents to be matched as part of its core services by partnering with these entities, the value to them in finding homes for children, many of whom come from the populations they serve, will provide them a substantive role in addressing a critical community need in keeping with their respective missions.\r\n\r\nFactors critical to the success of this effort are 1) recruiting appropriate staff who understands the cultural sensitivities to carry out the myriad of details/programs/services; 2) identifying clergy who are committed to helping RAC find loving homes for children in foster care and who endorse our message to its parishioners; and 3) funding necessary to conduct a year-long outreach campaign, thereby laying the foundation for sustaining these recruitment efforts for years to come.\r\n"

    answer: "RaiseAChild.US (RAC) has an existing model which will drive and measure the success of the 20,000 LA Kids Project.  Our Parent Advocate Program design is distinctive as it combines the personalized attention of a mentor with the technological support of a cloud-based case management system. The result is that RAC has a program that has been tested and proven, unlike any in the country, which provides measured and ongoing support and guidance to all of its prospective parents as they navigate the foster/adoption process. Through this custom designed, proprietary system, the Parent Advocate is able to easily and closely monitor the progress of each prospective parent. \r\n\r\nAt any given time, RAC can identify and track:\r\n•\tThe number of prospects who come to RAC through its campaigns, events, websites, word of mouth, etc.\r\n•\tThe number of prospective parents who have begun the necessary orientation, training and certification steps -- or where they are in the process; and\r\n•\tThe number of recruits to contact personally and provide support and guidance because they have not followed through on the specific stages of the foster/adoption process.\r\n\r\nThe RaiseAChild.US Parent Advocate Program is able to track and facilitate the progress of all of our identified prospective parents. In the program's first 16 months, RAC helped our Los Angeles County agency partners retain and move prospective parents through the training and certification program at a success rate of 26%, a retention rate five times higher than the national average of 5%. We anticipate this rate will climb to 30% within the next six months as we continue to assess and refine our program model.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the success of LA2050 / 20,000 Kids Project LA will measured by the numbers of new fost/adopt prospective parents that are recruited, trained and certified, placed with children from LA County's foster system, and eventually adopted.. Our goals are to:\r\n\r\n\t• Recruit 1,000 prospective parents in the targeted cohorts \r\n\t• Screen, orient and train 35% of the total number of prospective parents recruited\r\n\t• Counsel and support 350+ prospective parents through the foster/adoption process (includes 15 hours of supportive activities per parent)\r\n\t• Assist in finalizing the adoption of 600+ children over an 24 month period.\r\n"

    answer: "Youth in foster care are in the system through no fault of their own -- and each of them deserves to experience a loving home where they can feel secure and thrive. According to recent statistics, nearly 110,000 children in foster care are waiting to be adopted, 20,000 in LA County alone. There are an additional 300,000 children in need of immediate foster placement. More than 1,000 enter foster care each day and remain there for an average of two years. The majority of foster agencies, including LA County DCFS, are unable to make the headway necessary to significantly decrease these numbers. Due to imbedded bureaucracy, budget and staffing constraints and outdated protocols, these agencies cannot provide the depth of services that the Parent Advocate Program delivers. \r\n\r\nRAC’s founder and CEO Rich Valenza’s love for children, social justice and personal experience in building a family through fostering and adoption, served as the catalyst to establish RaiseAChild.  He understands first-hand the struggles and challenges one faces when navigating family building through the foster care system.  Given our retention rate success of moving prospective foster/adopt parents from recruitment to licensing and certification continues to soar overwhelmingly above the national average, RAC is well poised to make a substantial impact by continuing to expand its reach, particularly to targeted communities often ignored by traditional adoption services, to improve the outcomes for children and prospective parents facing the adoption system.\r\n"
  - name: achievable_goal

    explanation: ''
    answer: "Since 2011, RaiseAChild.US has achieved success serving children in the foster care system throughout Los Angeles County through three strategic initiatives: \r\n\r\nOutreach Campaigns -- RaiseAChild.US works with its foster/adoption agency partners to create and manage multi-media campaigns that promote family building to a broad spectrum of prospective foster and adoptive parents. \r\n\r\nEducational Programs -- RaiseAChild.US produces thorough, effective foster/adoption informational programs for its foster/adoption agency partners to educate and motivate prospective foster and adoptive parents. \r\n\r\nParent Advocate Program -- In February 2013, through the generous support of The Annenberg Foundation, CICA, Los Angeles County Department of Children & Family Services, and ACMS Inc., RaiseAChild.US established the Parent Advocate Program, which provides personalized support to each recruit as they undergo the detailed process of initial interest, qualification, orientation, training, and ultimately matching them with a child. This service is provided free of charge. \r\n\r\nThe LA2050 grant will enable RAC to launch the 20,000 LA Kids Project as an expansion of its existing year-round outreach, education and support programs for the LBGT community. \r\n"
  - name: major_challenges

    explanation: ''
    answer: "In all likelihood, we anticipate that working with small grassroots partners/faith-based organizations will take more time/hand-holding than in the past although necessary given their value add access to our targeted communities.  It may also be a challenge to identify and foster relationships with the faith-based community as their receptiveness to the LGBT community – our core constituency – has not always been the case.\r\n\r\nAlso, replicating efforts, although targeting different communities, is always dependent on finding the staff that matches the culture of the start up.  RAC’s current Parent Advocate has an undergraduate degree in Psychology and Education and graduate degree in Education for Special Populations and brings more than 20 years’ experience to this role. In addition, he has first-hand experience with the foster/adoption process, as over the past 15 years, he has adopted seven children through foster care.  Finding his equal will be a challenge that RAC is very conscious of and prepared to meet going forward.\r\n"
  - name: competition
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "RAC provides a service unlike any other. While it works closely with partner agencies that are charged with recruiting potential foster parents, the majority of these organizations do not have the marketing expertise or other resources to design and carry out media campaigns, advertise, implement recruitment events, or fast track waiting parents and children. In addition, none have a designated Parent Advocate Program, which combines the personalized attention of a mentor with the technological support of a cloud-based case management system. The result is that RaiseAChild has a program that has been tested and proven, unlike any in the country, which provides measured and ongoing support and guidance to all of its prospective parents as they navigate the foster/adoption process. Through this custom designed, proprietary system, the Parent Advocate is able to easily and closely monitor the progress of each prospective parent. \r\n\r\nNone of our partner agencies have achieved individually, the type of recruitment success that RaiseAChild has in such a short period of time. And with the forecasting ability of our case management system, those numbers will continue to climb. 87% of the agencies served by RaiseAChild manage and track their recruits manually on hand-written files. For them, RaiseAChild.US provides the benefits of our own case management and computerized reporting systems. Without RAC's intervention, however, wait times would continue to increase and the number of children leaving foster care would not be as great.\r\n"
