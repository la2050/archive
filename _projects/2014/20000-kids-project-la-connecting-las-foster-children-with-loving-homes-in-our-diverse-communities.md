Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Today, 20,000 children languish in LA’s foster care system. RAC will apply its
  successful model of recruiting prospective parents and helping match them with
  children awaiting loving homes by broadening its outreach to a more inclusive
  constituency. In addition to its LGBT audience, RAC will broaden its focus to
  include LA’s Latino and welcoming faith-based communities. RAC will further
  develop/expand its existing outreach model to a year-round initiative which
  will include an emphasis on a strong social media campaign supported by radio,
  television, outdoor advertising, and events to recruit and educate prospective
  parents. RAC also provides direct services to assist LA County DCFS to
  facilitate and expedite parent-child matches.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Founded in 2011, RAC enjoyed immediate recruitment success as we launched a
  creative multi-media campaign to encourage the LGBT community of LA to build
  families through fostering and adoption. By 2012, our extended national reach
  and improved campaign strategies resulted in recruiting more than 600
  prospective foster/adoptive parents. In 2013, RAC and Huffington Post Gay
  Voices launched a weekly series entitled “Let Love Define Family™.” Several of
  our stories have gone viral including
  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/28/wendy-gay-family_n_5042297.html. 
   
   Today, more than 2,200 individuals have signed up at the www.RaiseAChild.US website to take the “Next Step to Parenthood.” Through our 3 year history of events and ad campaigns, RAC has engaged with tens of thousands more. 
   
   RAC,is unique as we coordinate with our fost/adopt agency partners to provide our prospective parents with formalized assistance through our Parent Advocate Program, which combines personalized attention with the technological support of a cloud-based case management system. Locally, our outcomes are extremely impressive: partnering with Los Angeles County agencies, our Parent Advocate has been able to move prospective parents through the training and certification process at a success rate of 26%, significantly greater than the national average of only 5%. 
   RAC is now well positioned to open its programs/services to a broader, more inclusive constituency and plans to begin this journey by branching out to the Spanish speaking (which represents approximately 48% of the LA population) and heterosexual communities of LA County. Currently, more than 11% of our database is comprised of single heterosexuals. Funding from the My LA 2050 grant will allow us to add: 1) a bilingual FTE Parent Advocate to make inroads into the Hispanic community and expand our ability to place more children in loving homes throughout LA; 2) increase by 25% our single heterosexual cohort by modifying and targeting our marketing efforts.
   As part of this initiative, all of RAC’s online and printed outreach materials will be translated to Spanish and its key recruitment message, “Let Love Define Family™” will be developed for special events. The Parent Advocate will follow up, providing personalized one-to-one guidance to each prospective parent. We also plan to begin a dialogue with several inclusive and welcoming faith-based organizations to further promote our enhanced mission.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Every parent sees endless possibilities and great hope in the eyes of a child.
  As Angelenos, when we look at today’s children. But for our children to thrive
  and Los Angeles to stay a city in which people stay connected, we must support
  their development, their parents, their families and the public policies that
  work for all. Studies show that the earliest of experiences in supportive
  environments are essential to how children succeed in their lifetimes. In
  order for communities to come together cohesively to create a prosperous Los
  Angeles by 2050, we must invest in children now.
   RAC is proud of our own success stories. Long Beach, California residents Bianca and her wife, Tonie, initially found the road to building a family through foster/adoption to be lonely and complicated. It was the couple’s social worker at LA County Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) who suggested RaiseAChild.US for support and direction.
   “We attended a RaiseAChild.US event in West Hollywood, last December,” said Bianca. “Soon after, 18month-old Jacob was placed in our home. Throughout the process, we continued to access RaiseAChild.US support for referrals and advice on adoption finalization.”
   “Jacob has not only changed our lives but the lives of our family and friends,” says Tonie. “His grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, and friends have all embraced Jacob as part of the family. Jacob has adopted all of us.”
   
   This project meets two critically important metrics in the Connect application. First, RAC’s Parent Advocate Program directly addresses ‘Adults getting sufficient social & emotional support’ with its personalized service to all prospective parents navigating the foster/adoption process. Next, our close work with the LA County Department of Children and Family Services has been a key factor in the agency’s improved communication with waiting parents and increasing its child placement rate. This addresses the second (dream) metric of ‘Government responsiveness to residents’ needs.’
    
   Our goal is to improve the foster care system in LA County by 2050 and hold it high as a shining example of how diverse communities can come together to the benefit of children in the foster care system. Our vision is to create a community of good fost/adopt families in LA County that will multiple and proudly support one another well in to the future. In addition, RAC will be primed to export our business model to foster agencies for replication in other US cities.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  This project will reduce the number of children who continue to languish in
  LA’s foster care system by many as 2,000 within a two-year time frame. By
  connecting these children to loving adoptive homes, they are more likely to
  receive the support and medical and emotional attention that they need to
  thrive. 
   Fostering and adoption are slow processes, but our goal is to recruit and begin to process 1,000 new prospective homes during the grant period; this would represent an increase of 192% beyond RAC’s current annual matching rate.
   Already lauded for its capacity to move prospective parents through the adoption system at a rate that is five times the national average, RAC’s Parent Advocate Program will dramatically expand its reach through the addition of a full-time bilingual social worker. Backed by newly-developed Spanish language materials, the new advocate will help meet the culturally specific needs of Latinos who seek to foster or adopt as well as the need to find culturally sensitive placements for Latino youth in foster care. This addition to our staff will ensure our continued responsiveness. 
   Expanding our unique programs and services will also help to reduce the ‘drop out’ rate of prospective foster/adopt parents who so often give up since the process has been so cumbersome, significantly ease caseloads of DCFS social workers and of particular importance, RAC’s innovative methods of working with the system, will continue to cut and curb government spending. For every child adopted in LA County, there is an estimate national savings to the taxpayer of over $15,000.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  To accomplish this expansion to a more inclusive audience, RAC plans to work
  in tandem with its seven vetted foster/adopt partners in LA, with whom we have
  formal sponsorship agreements: LA County Department of Children & Family
  Services; Penny Lane Centers; Southern California Foster Family & Adoption
  Agency; The Village Family Services; Five Acres; Vista Del Mar; and Westside
  Children's Center. Each of these organizations will continue to work closely
  with RAC to help match available children with prospective parents and provide
  a seamless transition as the new initiative gets off the ground. RAC will seek
  out key leaders in the Hispanic community, an audience that has been
  researched for its feasibility and pilot tested with Penny Lane Centers, one
  of our partner agencies. Together, we placed several targeted spots on KLVE
  and KTNQ, popular Southern California Spanish language radio stations and the
  immediate response was that nearly 70 prospective foster/adopt parents signed
  up at our website or called the RAC office. We will also identify and reach
  out to welcoming clergy who might be willing to test pilot a small scale
  collaboration within their respective congregations. While RAC will benefit in
  the identification of children and parents to be matched as part of its core
  services by partnering with these entities, the value to them in finding homes
  for children, many of whom come from the populations they serve, will provide
  them a substantive role in addressing a critical community need in keeping
  with their respective missions.
   
   Factors critical to the success of this effort are 1) recruiting appropriate staff who understands the cultural sensitivities to carry out the myriad of details/programs/services; 2) identifying clergy who are committed to helping RAC find loving homes for children in foster care and who endorse our message to its parishioners; and 3) funding necessary to conduct a year-long outreach campaign, thereby laying the foundation for sustaining these recruitment efforts for years to come.
