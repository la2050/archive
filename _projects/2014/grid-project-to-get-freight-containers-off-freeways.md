  more_detail: >-
    Our project comprises the Superdock, an integrated transloading and storage
    facility for shipping containers that would transfer cargo directly between
    ships and trains faster than current systems can, and would also service our
    Freight Pipeline, a dedicated electric underground freight shuttle to move
    cargo between the ports and local distribution centers.
  achievable_goal: >-
    We can't implement the entire project within twelve months, but the LA2050
    grant, if we win it, would allow us to work full-time on funding the CSUN
    study which will make the GRID project itself a viable target for investors.
    That is achievable within twelve months.
  implement: >-
    We currently have a feasibility study pending at CSUN, which, once
    completed, would enable us to win private financing that would fund
    engineering, acquisition of rights-of-way, and actual construction. Our team
    comprises designers, engineers, outreach specialists, logistics experts, and
    former terminal managers. We have also engaged in extensive outreach to
    local and national labor unions, environmental organizations, and local
    citizens groups, as well as municipal, state, and federal agencies and
    organizations. We will continue to integrate all possible stakeholders in
    the region to ensure that GRID truly improves life for ordinary citizens as
    well as government and business entities.
  impact_live: >-
    Between now and 2050, GRID will inexorably reduce freight truck traffic on
    local and regional roads and freeways, reducing the pollution and congestion
    that afflict communities rich and poor along the 710 corridor in eastern Los
    Angeles County. At the same time, GRID will support increase export/import
    traffic, which will bring more solid middle-class jobs to
    economically-challenged communities.
  who_benefit: "*All cities along the 710 corridor, from Long Beach to Santa Fe Springs to Pasadena\r\n*Inland Empire cities where distribution centers and major railyards are sited (eg, Colton, San Bernardino)\r\n*Residents of 710 corridor cities, who now suffer grave health effects from diesel pollution and intense traffic congestion\r\n*Working people in a broad area, who will have more access to middle-skill jobs that pay well in warehousing and distribution, as well as the docks and railyards.\r\n*The Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, who will suffer less truck traffic and will find new developable land in areas no longer needed for container storage\r\n*Anyone who commutes by car, bus, or bicycle through the 710 corridor, since GRID will take large numbers of heavy trucks off the roads and freeways\r\n*City, county, and state agencies who will enjoy extended road maintenance intervals as truck traffic is thinned out "
  partners_collaboration: "Sierra Club (letters of support; confirmed)\r\nCSUN (feasibility study awaiting funding; confirmed & enthusiastic)\r\nUSC (analysis; unconfirmed)"
  evaluate: "*If GRID draws more ship traffic to the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles\r\n\r\n*If GRID moves at least 70% of port container traffic onto commercial rail or our dedicated Freight Pipeline\r\n\r\n*If GRID reduces traffic congestion to levels significantly below current projections on streets and freeways in the 710 corridor"
  two_lessons: "*That we cannot solve the problems caused by our historical dependence on road traffic by simply making more and bigger roads--that simply makes the problems bigger.\r\n\r\n*That coordinated systems such as we have designed GRID to be work better than piecemeal efforts slapped together without a vision over time. (Please remember that GRID integrates with existing rail networks as well.)"
  one_sentence_org: >-
    We aim to boost throughput at the Ports of LA & Long Beach while actually
    reducing truck traffic & pollution along the 710 freight corridor
  major_challenges: "*We anticipate some resistance from municipal agencies, who tend to suffer from institutional inertia; that is why we are so strongly focused on building grassroots support from neighborhood, community, public health, environmental, and labor organizations.\r\n\r\n*We anticipate difficulty in obtaining financing for a large visionary project such as GRID, which we will address through the CSUN feasibility study."

  impact_metrics: "Reducing truck traffic along the 710 corridor reduces the most dangerous kinds of airborne pollution. This is  the primary contributor to childhood asthma rates, which are high in the region. Pollution and traffic also serve to keep kids indoors and inactive more, leading to obesity and reduced opportunities for socialization.\r\n\r\nThese pollutants also affect adults, causing heart and lung problems and increasing rates of some cancers.\r\n\r\nTraffic congestion hems in communities, keeps kids form exploring outside their neighborhoods, and causes twice-daily stress to commuters.\r\n\r\nCommunities isolated by barrier freeways have less access to jobs, food diversity, and healthcare, and are thus less resilient."
