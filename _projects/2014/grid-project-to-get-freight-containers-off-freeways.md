   Venice Beach, destination for 16 million tourist a year, is famous for its lovely beaches, canals, mussel beach, fancy shops and eccentric, healthy people. However few realize that Venice Beach is at risk of being transformed by global climate change. A recent report titled “Sea Level Rise Vulnerability Study for the City of Los Angeles," prepared by the University of Southern California Sea Grant Program, found that Venice is a “highly vulnerable population who may be unable to adapt to impacts of sea level rise because of social or economic challenges, including lower per capita income, lower education levels, linguistic isolation, older housing stock and high percentage of renters.” 
   
   Oakwood was originally set-aside as a settlement area for Black-Americans, who came to work in the oil fields, and build canals. Later it was populated by Mexican-American and other immigrants, as well as artists who tolerated the gang wars of the 80’s. Now it is a highly creative, mixed-use, mixed income neighborhood that is on the brink of being impacted by climate change. 
   
   Los Angeles Beaches Forever will tap into the inventive character of this community to address resiliency: the capacity to recover quickly from difficulties. Working with scientists, we will produce ideas that advance our ability to adapt. No idea is too crazy: build naturalized sand dunes at the beach, plant a green alley, and restore a beach lagoon. 
   
   We will hire and train twenty-five local youth to distribute information about the opportunities we have to adapt to climate change. We will plant three hundred trees which will reduce airborne pollution, cool surface temperatures, reduce skin cancer in our youth, absorb surface water, improve water quality at beaches, and reduce crime. We will reduce our water use by hundreds of gallons a year, by removing thirty turf lawns and installing fifty cisterns, rain barrels or rain gardens which slow sea level rise, reduce risk of salt-water intrusion and improve water quality. 
   
   We will build on three existing agency programs: City of LA, street tree planting program; and the Metropolitan Water Districts’ (MWD), Water Smart rain barrel rebate program, and turf removal program.
   
   We will launch an entire resiliency movement.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Los Angeles Beaches Forever will make LA a healthier place by instilling
  knowledge of environmental issues and developing long-term solutions. Our
  community will become more engaged and armed with tools to become a more
  resilient community. We will galvanize around a common cause and enhance our
  diverse community. 
   
   Local Impacts - Sea Level Rise- According to a report by USC, Venice is one of the most at risk communities as a result of sea level rise due to the highly vulnerable population who may be unable to adapt to sea level rise. Another report this month released by the Venice Neighborhood Council sites an LAUSD study that found our neighborhood children are 26 times more likely to get cancer due to Santa Monica Airport pollutants such as lead, black carbon and ultra fine particulates. 
   
   Los Angeles Beaches Forever will plant trees - By planting trees we will reduce carbon in the air and slow the speed of sea level rise. Trees absorb pollutants. Trees reduce the risk of skin cancer by providing shade. Trees will cool our streets by up to 10°F, by shading our homes and streets and reducing the heat island effect. Trees reduce the cost of running an air conditioner. Trees will provide habitat for birds and butterflies, which enriches the science-based education of our children. Additionally trees will reduce crime. According to a study in the June 2012 issue of Landscape and Urban Planning Magazine, "a 10 % increase in tree canopy was associated with a roughly 12% decrease in crime." 
   
   Los Angeles Beaches Forever will collect water - While sea level rise is our main focus, we will also address the drought, seawater intrusion and water quality. By collecting water we will reduce flooding and are more resilient when water is scarce. We will create clean beaches for our kids by reducing the amount of dirty water that ends up flowing into the ocean. Additionally we will reduce the risk of seawater intrusion into our underground water basin. According to the MWD “the risk for seawater intrusion is high” as the ground water is not replenished. Finally by collecting water we will save money. 19% of CA energy is used to move water around so by using less water, we use less energy as well. 
   
   We will train youth - Our youth leadership team will direct planting and water savings activities. They will become the face of climate resiliency, the problem solvers and activists that save our coastal community.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  This project benefits children, renters, homeowners, tourists, businesses and
  the entire region. 
   
   By planting trees, removing turf, installing cisterns and creating a long-term vision plan for resiliency, we will benefit children who will be able to grow-up in this coastal community, as have many of their parents for generations. By planting trees, children will be protected from the risk of cancer from the over 100,000 planes that take-off and land over our community. Trees will protect children from skin cancer, the most common form of cancer in the US, by reducing UV-B exposure by about fifty percent. 
   
   Children will benefit from local clean beaches when polluted storm water is reduced. Storm drain runoff is the greatest source of pollution to local beaches, flowing untreated to the coast, potentially contaminated with motor oil, animal waste, pesticides, yard waste and trash. The Brooks storm drain, which drains a large part of Oakwood, is the only Venice storm drain to receive a wet-weather grade of F from Heal the Bay. With more trees absorbing rain, more residents collecting rainwater and practicing water-smart gardening as a result of this program, the water quality at the Brooks storm drain will improve making swimming, fishing and playing at Brooks Beach, a safer experience. 
   
   With more community trees, children will have better places to play and more learning opportunities, since trees act as landmarks that give a neighborhood an identity and encourage civic pride. Children in the neighborhood, many of whom live in apartments, will benefit from exposure to the critters, such as butterflies and birds, which are attracted to trees. 
   
   Parents will benefit from knowing their children are safe from air pollution, skin cancer and crime. Parents will see reduced utility costs due to lower energy-use and water-use. 
   
   Our entire City and region will benefit from the reduced threat of seawater intrusion into the ground water, reduced demand for imported water and reduced air pollution. And Venice Beach will continue to be a bustling tourist destination.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Youth - To engage our youth ambassadors, we will collaborate with Venice High
  School and Westminster Avenue Elementary School. In the recent past, we
  collaborated with Coeur D’Alene Elementary School (CDA) to create abundant
  gardens and plant dozens of trees. The project is so successful that a full
  time gardening teacher was hired, parents are planning on implementing the
  next phase of unpaving and two local schools used our school as a model in
  creating their own “rain gardens.” 
   
   Community - To get community buy-in and support we will work with Oakwood Neighborhood Committee of the Venice Neighborhood Council (VNC) and the Education Committee of the Venice Chamber of Commerce. We have received grants from the VNC on two separate occasion to be used towards environmental education. Duvivier Architects, a chamber member, will the leader this effort. They received the 2014 County of LA Green Leadership Award, and an US Green Building Council Innovation Award, for their pioneering work in the integration of water resources and architecture. 
   
   Agencies - We will augment established programs by the MWD and City of LA. We previously received three grants from MWD for doing watershed education work including creating environmental maps and signage. One map, Santa Monica and Ballona Watershed Green Map serves as an international reference—from India to Africa— has been viewed by thousands at Japan Expo and 20 other international venues. This map is in the permanent collection of the Library of Congress and the New York, Los Angeles and Toronto Public Libraries. 
   
   Experts – We will receive professional support from Loyola Marymount University and Santa Monica Bay Restoration Commission (SMBRC). We worked successfully with both of these organizations on a community-building document for the Ballona Wetlands Restoration. We received funding in the past from the SMBRC. In fact the Executive Director, said this of our partnership, “It was due to Duvivier’s involvement in the CDA Rain Gardens that my organization provided seed funding to start the project. Duvivier overcame many challenges and brought everyone on board with her vision. We use it today in our outreach to state and national agencies and technical professionals looking to implement creative, low-cost water pollution mitigation with added community and educational benefits.”
