Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): |-
  LACE Center currently has 4 community partners, and is developing one more: 
   GENDER JUSTICE LA (a transgender rights and racial justice organization)
   TRUST SOUTH LA (a community land trust for affordable housing) 
   CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL (Mar Vista Gardens in Culver City, a continuation high school) 
   CHANGING WAYS (a theatre troupe of ex-lifers and formerly incarcerated youth workers).
   Each partner represents a different underheard experience in L.A., and each voice is represented on a Planning Team body that guides the path of the LACE Center. Each of these sites has ongoing Liberation Arts programs, and each program reaches different communities. For developing a LACE Institute, we are also partnered with Dignity and Power Now’s Freedom Harvest Arts Collective to gain from their experience of community curriculum development (Dandelions Rising Institute, #riseofthedandelions art series). Our primary team is made of 15 people, mostly from these organizations, who will carry out visioning, planning, logistically organizing, and team management as our Planning and Curriculum (PC) Team. 
   
   1) MONTH 1: SOLIDIFY PLANNING AND CURRICULUM (PC) TEAM, made of members and leaders from community partner organizations, community-based artists & educators, and other stakeholders as defined by our Planning Team.
   
   2) MONTH 2: PLAN CURRICULUM AND GROUP PRIORITIES We have a couple classes in motion already, with a couple in progress. Theatre of the Oppressed Theory and Praxis Class (led by Brent Blair), and Playback Theatre Class (led by Joyce Lu), which will begin this fall, the PC Team will pick 2 other classes to be taught on a biweekly basis, that the PC team will help implement, and potentially teach a 3rd class about strategies.
   
   3) MONTH 2-3: OUTREACH AND ENROLLMENT. Outreach to other progressive and forward-thinking orgs to be students/ co-participants. Our dream is to give some participant stipends so we can enhance working-class cultural work leadership, knowing that many folks cannot prioritize critical art and expressive work due to economic access.
   
   4) MONTHS 3-6, 8-11: IMPLEMENT CLASSES. We will have evaluations after every class so we can stay up-to-date with the needs of the participants. The outcomes for participants will be certificates of completion for each, along with 2 public performances for the year. 
   
   5) MONTHS 7 AND 12: PERFORMANCE AND EVALUATION. Period to assess previous gains, and implement best process for upcoming period.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  All humans are creative-- creative arts are a vital way that we can be human.
  Media and images are all around us-- billboards, magazines, films and music,
  art is in our consciousness every day, shaped by powerful industries many
  based in L.A. However, access to creative arts resources is at an all time low
  among underserved communities-- namely, low-income people of color, LGBT
  community, immigrant communities, youth and mothers. LAUSD has cut arts
  funding 76% in the last 5 years, and the industry of Hollywood is inaccessible
  to the majority of people in L.A.. Many other people (who have access and
  resource to do so) are telling stories about marginalized people in L.A.,
  people who may have no experience LIVING in these communities, and as such,
  continue narratives of violence, poverty and trauma. 
   
   At LACE Center, we know that underserved communities are creative and resilient. We are part of these communities. The true stories about us are already there, but how do we learn how to share them with each other? How can we develop our aesthetic around our stories? And ultimately, how do we make systemic change possible through our visions and imaginations? Liberation Arts and Community Engagement (LACE) is not only about art-resources-- it is a path through which we connect our struggles towards collective liberation. The LACE Institute is a way to spread seeds of tools, our communities make up the beautiful branches of experiences, and our visions, work, art make up the fragrance of the fruit and flowers of transformed conditions.
   LACE is playing games to devise theater. LACE is building a collective narrative through poetry lines. LACE is having dialogue not just through debate-like words, but also through embodied images that communicate on multiple layers. LACE Center is conscious of the power structures that exist, and learning how we are not only individually affected, but actually collectively affected. LACE is inclusive, seeking to build leaders in communities that are underrepresented, prioritizing sustainability through stipends. LACE is intersectional, bringing multiple experiences, identities and languages to create together. With LACE multiplied through LA, we will find common language and vision for a new LA in 2050, where play is encouraged, creativity is central to everyone’s daily life, and where we live in community with each other across borders and identities.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Our project will benefit a few regions: Southeast L.A., South L.A., Culver
  City, Mid-City, Downtown L.A. (specifically Skid Row community). 
   
   Ultimately, LACE Center believes collective liberation is possible, where all people have basic needs met, and are able to grow, learn, thrive, connect, love, and express themselves according to their self-determined ways of being. LACE aims to shape individual and collective consciousness towards building a world that includes many worlds, by resisting oppression through the process of art-making, as well as through the resulting art piece. As such, we see that Liberation Arts and Community Engagement framework is for everyone so we may achieve collective liberation together. 
   
   We are a multi-racial, multi-gendered, multi-generational coalition of artists, organizers, activists, students and educators.
   
   While our vision of collective liberation includes everyone, we also see a dire need for creative resources among particular communities. As such, we see ourselves as filling a gap, so our priorities in terms of the communities we serve will be- low-income communities, African-American communities, Latino communities, Asian Pacific Islander communities, LGBT community (specifically the under-resourced Transgender community), immigrant communities, community-based artists, community organizers, educators in our regions, counselors in our regions. 
   
   We see the impact of this grant reaching well beyond the institute participants. Each participant is part of a larger community, and part of their training is to create a Liberation Arts group in their own community using the skills they have learned in the institute. This allows even broader communities of people to be connected through the LACE Institute. We particular hope that families, classmates, spiritual communities, campaign-based organizations, grassroots organizations, people working in public schools build a firm grasp on Liberation Arts skills through the students/co-participants. 
   
   Our hope is that this project encourages more collaboration and co-investigation of people's conditions. It is important to build the power of local communities in expressive arts, while also connecting people with different experiences. This question ultimately determines the way we decide what and with whom we build. By building a strong core of Liberation Artists from the bottom-up, we see an LA transformed for and by the people who are most affected.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  The heart of the LACE Center is collaboration, these are relationships of 2
  yrs:
   
   Gender Justice L.A.: Collaboration confirmed, through Theatre of the Oppressed program; GJLA represents the grassroots voice of the transgender and gender non-conforming community in L.A., particularly of trans people of color.
   
   Changing Ways: Confirmed; Represents theatre troupe of ex-lifers, formerly incarcerated peoples with long-term sentences, who work with incarcerated and impacted youth along with outreach to other ex-lifers.
   
   TRUST South L.A.: Confirmed, through their affordable housing campaigns, and Escuelita program; TRUST South LA is a land trust committed to developing affordable housing for South LA residents
   
   Central High School, Mar Vista Gardens site: Confirmed with educator sponsor, Vitaly; Central High School represents low-income youth of color who are excluded from the Culver City School District-- Central is a safe, supportive and self-directed learning environment.
   
   Dignity and Power Now: Confirmed with Freedom Harvest Art Collective program; DPN is an organization fighting for the rights and dignity of people impacted by incarceration, particularly around the L.A. jail system, the world's largest jail. 
   
   Other Partners:
   Southern California Library: Confirmed space for classes in South L.A. and curriculum development support with librarians and historical archives. 
   
   Chucos Justice Center: Space in Inglewood, currently home to Changing Ways.
   
   Asian Americans Advancing Justice: Unconfirmed, Space, through LDIR program
   
   Three things to determining successful collaborations:
   1) Culture of diversity, inclusion, and working through problems. We believe that diversity of experience, language, class, cultural background, gender, race, & age are essential to creating vibrant and effective programs, especially for a landscape of L.A. that holds so many stories. As such, part of our culture is inclusion and working through problems together, knowing there are certain things that we might not agree, but that being together and working through it is the most important.
   
   2) Communication and consensus building. Because we honor so many people's stories, Spanish translation & funds transparency is important. We also work through building consensus so that all voices are heard in decisions
   
   3) Consistency to core vision of collective liberation and generating intersecting spaces to build our stories. Big-picture keeps us united.
