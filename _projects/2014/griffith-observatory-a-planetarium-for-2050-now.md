Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Funding from LA2050 will be used to hire animators and special consultants
  required to create the thrilling visuals that inspire cosmic perspective in
  our audiences. These technical experts will enable Griffith Observatory’s
  graphic staff to re-imagine the School Field Trip planetarium show, Water is
  Life, and to create a brand new planetarium show on the intriguing, popular
  topic of life in the universe. 
   
   Having the tools necessary to translate complex astronomical information into compelling and accurate programs, and being able to deliver those to eager minds of all ages in an enticing environment is important to our community and the future of our culture.
   
   These planetarium shows will utilize a new, state-of-the-art , digital 8k projection system. The combination of the new equipment and a professional quality animated show guarantees a high quality audience experience. This is critical because our scientific stories vie with Hollywood commercial productions for the visitor’s attention and memory.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Our national economic prosperity and security require that the USA be a world
  leader in science and technology. We must develop the ideas to transform and
  strengthen the economy, ensure a skilled workforce for American industry, and
  guarantee that American students have access to the educational resources and
  tools necessary to fully participate in the science- and technology-based
  economy of the 21st century. According to the National Science Board, the
  earlier children are exposed to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math)
  concepts, the more likely they are to be comfortable with them later in life.
  Improving the extent and quality of elementary STEM education should be a
  priority. But in California, students in elementary school have less than 15
  minutes of science a day on average. 
   
   In addition, a study sponsored by the National Science Foundation reports that experiences in informal settings can significantly improve science learning outcomes for individual groups which are historically underrepresented in science, such as women and minorities. This study recognizes that learning is broader than formal classroom schooling. Informal science environments and experiences play a crucial role. These experiences can jump-start and sustain long-term interests that involve sophisticated learning later in life. In fact, research has shown that interest in sciences during elementary school is a better predictor than test scores of which students take advanced math courses in high school and college. 
   
   Planetarium shows at Griffith Observatory help to bridge the gaps that exist in formal learning by providing a variety of informal learning experiences that are accessible to children, youth, and families in an environment that is inclusive and inspiring. In an era that often substitutes superficial contact for knowledge and insight, and confuses entertainment with inspiration, Griffith Observatory avoids fashionable jargon and empty impact and continues to promote meaningful experience. Griffith Observatory is unique in being able to have a major impact on both individuals and on the economic health of the community.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Over 300,000 visitors, not only from the greater Los Angeles region but also
  from around the world, see a planetarium show at Griffith Observatory each
  year. A visitor survey identified a demographic profile almost identical to
  the State of California: 43% Caucasian; 36% Hispanic; 9% Asian American; and
  6% African American. Underserved audiences make up nearly half of the
  Observatory's visitor base.
   
   In addition, over 26,000 fifth-grade students, most from Title 1 schools, attend special field trips that support fifth grade California educational science standards. The staffing and material costs are funded by FOTO so that all students may attend FREE. In additions, a “bus scholarship” may be requested to fund transportation.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  The only confirmed collaboration at this point is with the Fiske Planetarium
  at the University of Colorado, Boulder. Fiske already has installed the 8K
  planetarium dome projection system we will be purchasing. Until the
  Observatory system is purchased and installed, Fiske has agreed to let our
  graphics team view their work on the Fiske dome in exchange for being able to
  perform our new life in the universe show live in Boulder after it premieres
  in Los Angeles.
   Conversations have begun with biology and other visualization experts to identify a core group of animators to support the development of the new planetarium show. Conversations are also being held with different groups of Disney animators to assist with animation. Visualizations from NASA/JPL are likely to be incorporated. Also, a variety of scientific experts are partners to ensure accurate, authentic information.
