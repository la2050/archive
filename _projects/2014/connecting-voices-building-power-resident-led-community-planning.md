Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  ACT-LA will make LA the best place to Connect because we will develop a cadre
  of Angelenos with skills and ability to shape the future of development around
  transit. Los Angeles is undergoing a significant transformation with an
  aggressive light rail expansion and growing movement of getting people of
  their cars and using active transportation. The investment in public
  transportation will have a direct effect to the built environment and if
  directed well can support improvement 6 of the 8 LA2050 indicators, in
  particular housing, health, environmental quality, and social connectedness.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  ACT-LA seeks to advance a citywide transit equity campaign that will ensure
  the new transit system will work as planned – encourage healthy lifestyles,
  lowering environmental and climate impacts, and driving economic opportunity
  that benefits everyone in Los Angeles including those communities already
  located around transit corridors. 
   
   Currently, ACT-LA has a community working on developing curriculum to build collective resident leadership. The sessions are being held in various neighborhoods throughout the city along with community transit tours. ACT-LA membership groups bring people together at a neighborhood level and are working to build resident relationships across neighborhoods to develop a citywide policy which will enhance the unique character of each neighborhood while providing for the necessary neighborhood improvements. With the support of LA2050 we will build on our work and expand the platforms in which residents can be involved in the campaign. 
   
   ACT-LA will build popular momentum for equitable transit development by:
   1) Having resident organizing committees in at least three council districts.
   2) Hosting quarterly community transit tours for residents and elected officials.
   
   In addition to creating the spaces for in person dialogue and discussion and increase opportunities for residents to connect, ACT-LA will:
   1) Develop and implement a marketing and communications plan to increase knowledge of transit oriented development.
   2) Host at least two twitter parties as a space to gather qualitative data for the transit oriented development policy.
   3) Increase the use of social media to engage supporters and allies in the policy development.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Imagine a Los Angeles where residents are coming together to dialogue and
  develop solutions with the intention of solving the most challenging issues
  facing Los Angeles. Spaces where competing interests are put on the table and
  worked through to create policies which will support the people in most need.
  Through this project and the work of our coalition partners ACT-LA is working
  to transform how decision making is made in Los Angeles. We are creating
  spaces for people who have been cast to the sidelines of government processes
  to engage. 
   
   An ACT-LA value is that all people have the right to participate in the political decisions that affect their lives, and the low-income communities and communities of color who ride our buses, live along our rail lines, and work in our businesses should have priority in deciding our future. We believe in strong leadership development for those who are most affected by decisions. This starts with key member organizations who have an engaged based of community residents. Those member organizations have regular convening for their constituents to engage in educational, skill building and strategy sessions.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  ACT-LA will benefit all Angelenos by creating space and momentum for a
  citywide equitable transit development policy. Our coalition is turning the
  trickle-down theory upside down by having the heart of the community
  engagement efforts focus on the most vulnerable populations. By engaging,
  strengthening, and fostering opportunities for the largest segment of
  Angelenos, we believe we will make Los Angeles a better place for everyone. 
    
   We will be focused on connecting people who live around transit and use transit in discussions of how transit development can support a healthy environment for everyone. Our primary constituents through our member organizations are low-income renters of color. Los Angeles’ highly transit-impacted neighborhoods are 96% or more people of color. In Los Angeles, workers earning less than $25,000 use transit more than twice as often as higher earners and make up 75% of all riders. Our member organizations are deliberate in organizing and reaching all ages, gender and sexual orientation. Our base includes families with young children, young adults, and seniors. 
   
   ACT-LA’s members work with low-income community members who depend on a strong public transportation system to reach work, recreation, home and other daily needs. More transit options such as rail stops and improvements in bike and pedestrian infrastructure can help these residents only if they are able to remain living around these amenities. ACT-LA members have seen firsthand the effects of smart growth policies being enacted without equity in mind: resident displacement, business destruction, increases in eviction, loss of affordable housing, and a host of other related issues connected to transit impacts. It is because of these first-hand experiences at the neighborhood level that ACT-LA members have come together to encourage passage of a Citywide equitable TOD ordinance that will help prevent displacement and maintain and strengthen the economic and cultural fabric of these communities.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  Alliance for Community Transit-LA (ACT-LA) was formed by organizations in Los
  Angeles with policy advocacy, grassroots organizing, and community economic
  development expertise to unite separate neighborhood voices into a citywide
  voice for equitable transit investment. In 2010, we hosted two summits where
  over 40 organizations from diverse sectors participated including
  representation from labor, community organizing, environmental justice,
  transit equity, and affordable housing developers. Founding organizations
  remain active host committee members today and the coalition has 22 active
  member organizations.
   Since its inception, ACT-LA has served as the primary vehicle for regional collaboration amongst grassroots organizations and advocacy organizations to convene around the intersection of transportation, housing, public health, and environmental issues in Los Angeles. Three areas critical to our existing and continued success are:
   • Coalition values: ACT-LA spent time developing values for our work and all member organizations sign on to the values. We use them in our program and policy development as well as how we operate as a coalition. 
   • Strong internal communication: Ensuring all members are informed and connected to the work is critical to successful collaboration.
   • Holding the whole: Each partner brings strengths and different areas of focus. As a coalition we hold everyone’s priorities and work to move issues together because of their interconnectedness.

This policy would support having affordable housing near transit, keeping core transit riders near transit and improving the overall environment for residents. The project engages residents directly with government officials and demonstrates a democratic process of developing policy.  By engaging people in virtual spaces we would increase friends through social media.  \r\n"

  evaluate: "Success in our project is the increased level of community participation and the advancement of our campaign platform. Our ultimate goal is to have the City of Los Angeles adopt a citywide equitable TOD ordinance with this project positioning ACT-LA to have the ordinance during the timeline of this project. For this project the following three areas we will be tracking through our work:\r\n-Increased endorsements for the campaign to a total of 75.\r\n-Increase follower on twitter by 50% with at least 75% of them joining in the twitter parties.\r\n-At least 100 residents participate in the in-person activities.  \r\n"
  two_lessons: "ACT-LA members have extensive track records of neighborhood, regional, and statewide wins in their respective areas of expertise. The groups have also worked with each other in different formations as well as part of other collaborations. A recurring theme was a loss of connection to neighborhood work as transit oriented development policy was being developed at all levels and resources aligned to support those policies. From our collective experience, a lesson learned was the loss of community residents in the policy development process. This is why our project focuses on engaging residents, deepening their knowledge on issues and making the spaces to discuss areas that can be perceived as conflicting. \r\n\r\nIn addition, our experience in implementing and analyzing campaigns has also showed us the need to reach supporters beyond our membership, building popular discourse on the issues we are working to impact. The current environment of mass media and use of social media provides an opportunity to reach and connect more residents.   \r\n"
  achievable_goal: "Internally, ACT-LA spent the previous twelve months developing a transit equity campaign platform on housing, transportation and economic development. We wrote a white paper explaining our policy proposal and plan a release in Fall of 2014. We also launched a website, hosted social media actions and communications training. Additionally, we supported our member campaigns such as engagement with the Los Angeles Housing Element and advancing our campaign platforms in the West Adams, South and Southeast Community Plans. \r\n\r\nWe have laid a strong foundation for our policy work, built a diverse coalition, and are deepening the network of residents across neighborhoods working on this issue. ACT-LA’s success in the last twelve months has positioned us to take the next step to reach a greater scale of contact with Angelenos across the city through in person and virtual spaces.  \r\n"
  major_challenges: "For this project the two major barriers we anticipate are: \r\n1)\tHaving messages which resonate with population at large for the campaign and with the support of the LA2050, we will hire a Marketing and Communications consultant to work with the coalition in developing the messages and materials. \r\n2)\tHaving city council members strongly support equitable transit and neighborhoods. The overall project aims to address this challenge by building a large scale cohort of residents which can talk about the issues and engage councilmembers to support equitable transit oriented development. \r\n"
  competition: >-
    ACT-LA’s work will be the first to bring issues together and engage in a
    citywide equitable transit policy. ACT-LA is a coalition of diverse
    organizations working on issues which intersect with equitable transit. Past
    work, locally as well as in other cities, has focused on station by station
    community planning and engagement. Many of our members focus on neighborhood
    level planning or specific issue such as housing or walkability. The
    uniqueness of our work brings together organizations and issues to have
    success in 6 of the 8 indicators identified by LA2050. ACT-LA works with and
    intends to continue to deepen collaboration with other regional coalitions
    such as LA Thrives, SCANPH, and MOVE LA who share a similar outlook and
    vision but operate from different vantage points. 
  cost: >-
    We project total cost for this project to be $182,900. ACT-LA is actively
    seeking resources to support the work of the coalition. We have secured
    funding from the California Community Foundation and have applications in to
    Ben & Jerry’s, Enterprise Community Partners, and The California Endowment. 
  budget: "With the support of LA2050 we will fund the following items:\r\n25% of full time Coalition Manager: $22088\r\n8 at $5,000 each stipends to members for community engagement: $40000\r\nMarketing & Communications Consultant: $15000\r\nCollateral Materials (Design & Printing ex t-shirts, posters, etc): $12912 \r\nFiscal Sponsor 10% of total grant: $10,000\r\n"

      ACT-LA will make LA the best place to Connect because we will develop a

      development around transit. Los Angeles is undergoing a significant

      movement of getting people of their cars and using active transportation.
      The investment in public transportation will have a direct effect to the

By engaging, strengthening, and fostering opportunities for the largest segment of Angelenos, we believe we will make Los Angeles a better place for everyone. \r\n  \r\nWe will be focused on connecting people who live around transit and use transit in discussions of how transit development can support a healthy environment for everyone. Our primary constituents through our member organizations are low-income renters of color. Los Angeles’ highly transit-impacted neighborhoods are 96% or more people of color. In Los Angeles, workers earning less than $25,000 use transit more than twice as often as higher earners and make up 75% of all riders. Our member organizations are deliberate in organizing and reaching all ages, gender and sexual orientation. Our base includes families with young children, young adults, and seniors. \r\n\r\nACT-LA’s members work with low-income community members who depend on a strong public transportation system to reach work, recreation, home and other daily needs. More transit options such as rail stops and improvements in bike and pedestrian infrastructure can help these residents only if they are able to remain living around these amenities. ACT-LA members have seen firsthand the effects of smart growth policies being enacted without equity in mind: resident displacement, business destruction, increases in eviction, loss of affordable housing, and a host of other related issues connected to transit impacts. It is because of these first-hand experiences at the neighborhood level that ACT-LA members have come together to encourage passage of a Citywide equitable TOD ordinance that will help prevent displacement and maintain and strengthen the economic and cultural fabric of these communities. \r\n"

    explanation: >-
      We strongly support collaboration, please tell us a little more about your
      partnership.
    answer: "Alliance for Community Transit-LA (ACT-LA) was formed by organizations in Los Angeles with policy advocacy, grassroots organizing, and community economic development expertise to unite separate neighborhood voices into a citywide voice for equitable transit investment. In 2010, we hosted two summits where over 40 organizations from diverse sectors participated including representation from labor, community organizing, environmental justice, transit equity, and affordable housing developers. Founding organizations remain active host committee members today and the coalition has 22 active member organizations.\r\nSince its inception, ACT-LA has served as the primary vehicle for regional collaboration amongst grassroots organizations and advocacy organizations to convene around the intersection of transportation, housing, public health, and environmental issues in Los Angeles. Three areas critical to our existing and continued success are:\r\n•\tCoalition values: ACT-LA spent time developing values for our work and all member organizations sign on to the values. We use them in our program and policy development as well as how we operate as a coalition. \r\n•\tStrong internal communication: Ensuring all members are informed and connected to the work is critical to successful collaboration.\r\n•\tHolding the whole: Each partner brings strengths and different areas of focus. As a coalition we hold everyone’s priorities and work to move issues together because of their interconnectedness. \r\n"

This policy would support having affordable housing near transit, keeping core transit riders near transit and improving the overall environment for residents. The project engages residents directly with government officials and demonstrates a democratic process of developing policy.

  - name: two_lessons
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "ACT-LA members have extensive track records of neighborhood, regional, and statewide wins in their respective areas of expertise. The groups have also worked with each other in different formations as well as part of other collaborations. A recurring theme was a loss of connection to neighborhood work as transit oriented development policy was being developed at all levels and resources aligned to support those policies. From our collective experience, a lesson learned was the loss of community residents in the policy development process. This is why our project focuses on engaging residents, deepening their knowledge on issues and making the spaces to discuss areas that can be perceived as conflicting. \r\n\r\nIn addition, our experience in implementing and analyzing campaigns has also showed us the need to reach supporters beyond our membership, building popular discourse on the issues we are working to impact. The current environment of mass media and use of social media provides an opportunity to reach and connect more residents.   \r\n"
  - name: achievable_goal
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Internally, ACT-LA spent the previous twelve months developing a transit equity campaign platform on housing, transportation and economic development. We wrote a white paper explaining our policy proposal and plan a release in Fall of 2014. We also launched a website, hosted social media actions and communications training. Additionally, we supported our member campaigns such as engagement with the Los Angeles Housing Element and advancing our campaign platforms in the West Adams, South and Southeast Community Plans. \r\n\r\nWe have laid a strong foundation for our policy work, built a diverse coalition, and are deepening the network of residents across neighborhoods working on this issue. ACT-LA’s success in the last twelve months has positioned us to take the next step to reach a greater scale of contact with Angelenos across the city through in person and virtual spaces.  \r\n"

    answer: "For this project the two major barriers we anticipate are: \r\n1)\tHaving messages which resonate with population at large for the campaign and with the support of the LA2050, we will hire a Marketing and Communications consultant to work with the coalition in developing the messages and materials. \r\n2)\tHaving city council members strongly support equitable transit and neighborhoods. The overall project aims to address this challenge by building a large scale cohort of residents which can talk about the issues and engage councilmembers to support equitable transit oriented development. \r\n"

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      ACT-LA’s work will be the first to bring issues together and engage in a
      citywide equitable transit policy. ACT-LA is a coalition of diverse
      organizations working on issues which intersect with equitable transit.
      Past work, locally as well as in other cities, has focused on station by
      station community planning and engagement. Many of our members focus on
      neighborhood level planning or specific issue such as housing or
      walkability. The uniqueness of our work brings together organizations and
      issues to have success in 6 of the 8 indicators identified by LA2050.
      ACT-LA works with and intends to continue to deepen collaboration with
      other regional coalitions such as LA Thrives, SCANPH, and MOVE LA who
      share a similar outlook and vision but operate from different vantage
      points.
