Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  We plan on implementing this idea by first developing a fully functional
  interface where the organizations can upload the work. Account management will
  be done within our servers through either WooCommerce or a platform like
  Shopify. Payouts to the organizations will happen twice a month - we always
  makes sure that all sales are fully transparent to the account holders and
  their associated accounts. Much like Society6.com, we hope to offer prints and
  original artwork for sale (the major difference being we will deal
  specifically with underprivileged artists). A web developer will set up an API
  feed between the site and our manufacturing and printing partners so
  fulfillment can be instantly handled. Eventually, manufacturing and printing
  will all be managed in-house.
   
   After creating our site, we will continue securing partnerships with creative non-profits, foster homes, and any other foundation that supports disadvantaged artists to expand our gallery. Brochures, videos, and financial statements will all be made available to strengthen our pitch.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  As stated earlier, this project will hopefully bring together all of the
  art-based non-profits in Los Angeles to work together on improving the lives
  of the people they help. Through our website, we will create an ecosystem
  where non-profits can encourage their artists to not only create art but
  collaborate with similar groups of people. Furthermore, professional artists
  and groups can connect through our website to specific artists or non-profits
  that we have partnered with to teach, create, and inspire. 
   
   By 2050, we will hopefully be able to create a cohesive Los Angeles art unit, where creativity comes from all parts of Los Angeles and in different form of collaborations. Not only will we become a permanent gallery for artists and creative organizations, but a powerful support system as well.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Our project will ideally benefit all creatives in Los Angeles and eventually
  nationwide. 
   
   First, the underprivileged artists will be able to sell and showcase their work on our website at all times of the day, giving them the ability to independently present their work to anyone with internet access. Non-profits will be able to upload the work for the artists.
   
   Next, the creative non-profits can utilize our platform to showcase what they do. Each organization can have a biography and link to their own site, and if any of them want to reach out to each other, its as simple as clicking a button.
   
   Finally, all artists and creatives can connect with the artists or non-profits directly through our site. With proper funding, we can even host large scale collaborations, fundraisers, or art events that span all social groups.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Our current (confirmed) partnerships consist of businesses, non-profits, and
  creative studios:
   1) LA Lofts Realty helps provides their wonderful office on the corner of 6th and Spring twice a year on Art Walk for us to showcase the works of professional and underprivileged artists in a physical space.
   
   2) DTLALIFE magazine helps advertise our events to the ~200,000 readers they have. Similarly, the Downtown Art Walk featured us on their website's front page for our first show to help raise awareness.
   
   3) The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf provides free products for our events, which helps volunteers stay in top shape and the visitors to enjoy great coffee during the shows. Through their connections, NeuroGum connects Row Gallery with UCLA doctors to help tackle mental health from a medical perspective.
   
   4) Most importantly, the Lamp Community and their artists contribute their amazing artwork to the shows. We have showcased and sold their work and are looking forward to collaborating with them through our online platform as well. Furthermore, many volunteers that work with Lamp help us on our projects, giving us further support.
   
   5) In addition, we work with many art studios in the area. Andre Miripolsky, Eva Napp, and Mary Woronov all showed their amazing artwork at our shows, boosting the amount of foot traffic that comes in. These spaces can also provide art printing services for our online store.
   
   
   Given these relationships, the three factors most critical to our success are:
   1) Building a larger network of creative non-profits that all talk with each other. We want to expand Row Gallery because many creative non-profits fight for the same cause. If we come together, we can move one step closer to enriching lives.
   
   2) Increasing the amount of art education that goes into the LA community. Row Gallery hopes to provide the tools necessary to help empower people through art.
   
   3) Ensuring a space where the physical gallery can grow. Currently, there are no spaces in LA that specifically showcases artwork from both professionals and working artists. Why not change that?
