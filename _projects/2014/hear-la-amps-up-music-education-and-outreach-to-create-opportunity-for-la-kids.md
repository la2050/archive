Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Citizens of the World Charter School Mar Vista purposely reflects ethnic,
  racial, linguistic and socioeconomic diversity. CWC believes that children who
  have had experience of interacting with and learning from students who are
  different from themselves in some way will be better able to function
  effectively in 2050 and will view their neighborhood, city and world in a more
  informed, skillful and community-minded light. HEAR LA is a great example of
  our program in action and it could serve as a model for learning today and in
  the future. 
   
   CWC MV is partnering with HearMe, a non-profit organization. HearMe’s mission is to develop a powerful international community connecting young people, giving preference to disadvantaged youth, through music creation, recording and production. 
   
   This musical program transcends traditional classrooms. Students not only learn to play, but to express themselves in new and creative ways as they are inspired through their collaboration with other Los Angeles and global students. 
   
   HEAR LA will share the power of music in four ways: 
   
   1. By 2015, CWC MV 336 students will receive music instruction twice weekly in class instruction.
    
   2. CWC MV will be able to offer after-school enrichment classes such as a concert wind instrument band or songwriting.
   
   3. A key part of HEAR LA is opening Saturday classes to any preschool or elementary age student in Los Angeles who qualifies for free or reduced lunch. CWC MV, in partnership with HEARME, already has promotional materials and an outreach plan to ensure awareness of this program. The students in the weekend program will experience a weekly six-hour session, which includes a healthy, free snack and lunch.
   
   4. CWC MV will offer community "jam" sessions in various parts of LA in order to inspire similar programs across the city and increase our collaborative network. 
    
   CWC has already located highly qualified staff for the Hear LA program. HearMe will provide these instructors with technical training needed to set up and operate the network collaboration portion of the music program. We also have a detailed budget identifying all the necessary instruments and equipment for the HearMe Music Program and have made arrangements for preferred pricing for that equipment.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  There are numerous, well known benefits of music instruction to education,
  including higher graduation rates, increased proficiency in reading and
  mathematics abilities, and better test scores. However, public schools today
  struggle with dwindling resources. Musical instruction often falls by the
  wayside. HEAR LA provides its students with a vibrant music program and uses
  that program as a platform to renew interest in music instruction that will
  reverberate throughout Los Angeles. 
   
   Implementation of CWC MV's HEAR LA program today would result in immediate direct benefits to hundreds of students participating in the weekday and weekend HEAR LA program annually. These students would benefit from immediate exposure to quality music instruction that, in addition to boosting creativity and self-expression, will also increase the likelihood of successful graduation, reading and math achievement and higher test scores. 
   
   Additionally, we expect that in year one, the HEAR LA program will improve learning throughout Los Angeles by inspiring other schools and youth centers to develop similar programs and to participate in the HEAR ME network of youth-based collaborative music. When HEAR LA opens it will be one of at least six global Hub locations. By 2017, HearMe plans to expand to 125 locations across the world.
   
   By 2050, CWC MV expects that its in-class model will continue as CWC itself grows. We also anticipate using former HEAR LA students as mentors to current students. CWC MV further expects that the available network of musical collaboration partners will have expanded exponentially through the "ripple effect." By 2050, we hope for hundreds of participating schools/youth centers and network collaborators throughout Los Angeles and across the globe. 
   
   By 2050, the individuals who benefited from HEAR LA (whether as direct participants or indirectly as students of programs inspired by HEAR LA) will have become our city's taxpayers, voters, and decision-makers. By that time, we would expect these Angelinos will be more likely to have graduated from high school, achieved proficiency in reading and math, and scored higher on standardized tests than students without access to music programs. Additionally, we would expect that the Angelinos who participated in HEAR LA would have a higher degree of social connectedness, which as the LA2050 report recognizes, "is [itself] tied to educational attainment."
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  HEAR LA will directly and immediately benefit several groups in Los Angeles.
  First, each of CWC MV's 240 students will receive HEAR LA music instruction
  through its in-school and after-school programs. This number will increase
  annually, as CWC MV itself grows from a K-3 to a K-5 program. CWC MV plans to
  extend its charter to include a middle school as well. 
   
   CWC MV, is a member of a nation-wide network of high-achieving, community-based public schools that currently serves the culturally diverse populations of Mar Vista and nearby Westside neighborhoods. These neighborhoods are 51% Caucasian, 26% Latino, 7% Asian, 14% African-American, and 2% other. 
   
   CWC MV will act as a pilot program for the other Los Angeles based CWC schools located in Hollywood and Silver Lake, effectively tripling the initial impact of the program, through expansion of the in-class and after-school instruction. 
   
   CWC MV's HEAR LA program also will benefit an additional 72-144 low-income preschool and elementary school aged children annually through its weekend program in partnership with HearMe. These children are unlikely to benefit from a music instruction program without HEAR LA.
   
   We anticipate that the benefits of its HEAR LA Program also will echo throughout Los Angeles through the traveling demonstration or community "jam" session component of the Program. This will, in turn, expand the network of participants in other schools or youth centers throughout the city. Indeed, because HEAR LA is not limited by physical location, the potential reach of its impact is limitless.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: |-
  A key partner in the HEAR LA Program will be HearMe. http://www.hearmehub.org
   
   HearMe is a critical partner to HEAR LA success. HearMe already has developed a curriculum and software for virtual music collaboration. Through this partnership, HearMe will provide its curriculum and technical training to CWC MV's HEAR LA instructors. Additionally, HearMe will help funding for HEAR LA’s second and third year of weekend instruction for low-income students. Fundraising from both CWC MV and HearMe will supplement future years. We plan to expand it to the other CWC schools and hopefully other public LA schools. CWC MV and HearMe are excited to begin their collaboration and are in process of formalizing their agreement.
    
   CWC MV will also collaborate with various professionals in the music industry, who will lend their music-making and recording expertise to the success of this project. These professionals include composers and professional musicians
   
   HearMe has created an International Music Creation Network. This is a way for the various HearMe Hubs to connect through the web. HEAR LA would be one of the first hubs. As forerunners, our students would be learning cutting edge technology. As of now that connection is via SoundCloud, which enables sites to collaborate in virtual time. Every day there are new developments that HearMe follows and it looks like shortly, students will be able to collaborate in real time.
   
   3 crucial factors to making HEAR LA work are the International Music Creation Network, students from diverse backgrounds and their imaginations.
   
   HEAR LA gives students hands on experience with various software and music applications but also teaches them about teamwork, handling critiques and turning criticism into a positive. Every student will have the chance to be a leader and also to be a follower. By being a part of a global network, students will realize how big and how small the world is. They will get the chance to forge friendships across the global and bring new awareness to what is happening in those areas. HearMe plans to reach out to war torn countries and bring hope to children across the globe. Our LA students could be companions in peace and global unity and understanding.
