  Opportunity Fund's Food Truck Financing initiative will provide microloans to
  mobile food vendors throughout LA County, supporting economic and social
  vitality by creating jobs and bringing healthy food options to underserved
  communities across the region. Our goal is to provide $2M in microloans to
  local food truck entrepreneurs to upgrade or purchase food trucks (as part of
  our overall goal to invest $9M in 600 underserved small business owners in the
  region). By enabling low-income food truck entrepreneurs to access the capital
  and support they need to grow and create jobs, our microlending program drives
  economic mobility for these small business owners, while also generating
  demand to support local food truck manufacturers.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Opportunity Fund seeks to scale our microlending program in LA’s underserved
  communities to support more than 600 small business owners, including 80 food
  truck entrepreneurs, each year. In the coming year, we will: 
   à Invest $9M in small businesses in undercapitalized neighborhoods in LA, including $2M in food truck loans.
   à Create or retain more than 1,600 jobs, primarily in minority-owned and women-owned businesses, including 250+ jobs in the mobile food industry.
   à Generate $15 million in new annual economic activity in LA through new spending, wages, and tax revenues.
   
   Opportunity Fund’s borrowers have an impressive 90% business survival rate. Our financing and support help them increase business revenues by an average of more than 20%, while creating and sustaining 2.7 jobs per loan. This includes clients like Noel, who came to the U.S. several years ago with a dream to build a better future for his family. He started out working several low-wage jobs, but knew it would take more to reach his goals. Like many low-wage workers facing few options for good employment, Noel decided to start his own business. He began with a produce cart, and was quickly ready to expand. When Noel came to Opportunity Fund’s partner, Kareem’s Carts, to buy a food truck, he didn’t know how he would finance the purchase. Kareem referred Noel to Opportunity Fund, and we provided a $50,000 loan to fund the purchase. Today, with a second Opportunity Fund loan, Noel has grown his business—The Little Machin—to two food trucks and six employees. Noel’s family helps run the business, which serves authentic Mexican food using his mother’s recipes and high quality ingredients. “Building and growing a business is very difficult, but Opportunity Fund believed in me. They really care about the success of my business,” says Noel. "I want to teach my children how to run a family business. We are all part of the success." 
   
   Opportunity Fund has a vision that by 2050 every food truck entrepreneur—and every other small business owner in LA—can access the financing and support needed to realize his or her full potential to build a vibrant enterprise, increase household income, create jobs, and support a family and a future. By scaling microlending in LA, Opportunity Fund will help many thousands of entrepreneurs access hundreds of millions of dollars in microloans by 2050—supporting job creation at significant scale while driving economic growth in the communities that need it most.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Working families in Los Angeles face the challenges of managing insufficient
  money, finding affordable housing, raising healthy families, and preparing for
  the future. Nearly half of LA’s households do not earn enough to meet basic
  expenses. The region lacks adequate well-paying jobs in growth sectors. For
  many households, entrepreneurship is a primary route to financial stability.
  Small business ownership creates opportunities for low-income families to
  pursue stability and economic mobility, while creating jobs in their
  communities. Research has shown that if one in three microenterprises hired an
  additional person, the U.S. would return to full employment; if every
  microbusiness generated $5,000 more annually, this would add $20B to the
  economy. Mobile food trucks provide a unique opportunity for all types of
  individuals to create gainful and lasting employment for themselves, their
  family members, and their communities. Yet only 50% of small businesses
  survive, often due to an inability to access the capital they need to grow
  because of language and cultural barriers, limited assets, low capital needs,
  and poor/insufficient credit.
   
   The mainstream financial industry offers little to help small businesses access the capital they need to grow and thrive, especially in places like East LA, Boyle Heights, and Downtown. As a nonprofit, mission driven, financial institution, Opportunity Fund targets entrepreneurs who operate their businesses (and, in many cases, live their lives) outside the financial mainstream. Our strategy reaches out across neighborhoods, languages, and cultures; as a result, our client base reflects the region’s racial and ethnic diversity. Our borrowers in LA are 98% minority, and 40% are women. Our microloan clients have a median income of $24,000 and an average credit score of less than 600.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  LA’s food truck culture supports thousands of jobs through a symbiotic
  relationship between manufacturers, vendors, and residents who love street
  food. By providing financing to help food truck entrepreneurs start and grow
  mobile food businesses in LA, Opportunity Fund serves as an engine to drive
  growth in the industry. We have established strong collaborations with Los
  Angeles’ largest mobile food truck manufacturers—including Kareem Carts, West
  Coast Catering Trucks, and Polo’s Mobile Catering Trucks—who refer aspiring
  and current food truck owners to Opportunity Fund when they need financing for
  new or upgraded equipment. Together with these partners, we provide the
  equipment and financing necessary for these small business owners to grow
  their enterprises and realize their dreams. 
   
   When we provide a microloan to fill the financing gap for a food truck entrepreneur, Opportunity Fund also creates demand for a new food truck—supporting scores of local manufacturing jobs for people like Rocio, who is one of 23 people employed at Kareem Carts. Through our food truck financing, we foster entrepreneurship within LA’s underserved populations, support local manufacturing jobs, and create new employment opportunities for the region’s diverse and talented workforce. Opportunity Fund and our manufacturing partners are committed to expanding our impact through increased loan volume in the coming year.
   
   In addition to our unique collaboration with local food truck manufacturers, Opportunity Fund also partners with local bank branches, business services providers, and community organizations to identify small business owners who need access to financing.
