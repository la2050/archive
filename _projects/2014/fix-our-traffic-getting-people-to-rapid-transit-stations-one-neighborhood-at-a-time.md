Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  A lot of L.A. residents would use mass transportation if there were a way to
  get between home and the station. Our project is to develop a plan for moving
  people from where they live to the closest rapid transit. It is a critical
  element in developing L.A. connectedness.
   
   There are lots of ways to do this, ranging from fleets of small dedicated taxis, to electrically assisted bicycles, to electrically powered shuttle buses. A workable system needs all of these and more. What's been missing is a plan to ask for ideas from the public, and then put everything together in a comprehensive system.
   
   We intend to work with the public and with transit providers to find a mix of ways to get people to the stations and home again.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  This project will devise a practical solution for getting people from their
  homes to the nearest rapid transit station and back again. To do this, we need
  to work with L.A. residents who will use the new systems, as well as with
  manufacturers and transit agencies.
   
   Many L.A. people live far from train stations, including the stations that already exist and those that are yet to be built. Getting to the station will continue to be a problem if we don't come up with a practical solution.
   
   We believe that the light rail systems now being built will address some of the transportation deficit we now face. Another rapid transit technology known as personal rapid transit (PRT) is currently being developed by several companies. PRT basically consists of passenger carriers (pods) that are elevated above the street, and can take people without intermediate stops to their destinations. 
   
   We have been collecting ideas for getting people to and from the rapid transit stations. This project will develop a comprehensive concept for a system with multiple types of connections, and then do a specific design for two neighborhoods.
   
   For example, a fleet of electric taxicabs, accessible by cellphones, and serving the public on a fixed price basis, could be one part of the solution. We are also very intrigued by the newly developed hydrogen fueled electric bicycles, which can be adapted for commuting. We think that it's also important that if personal rapid transit comes to L.A., that the passenger pods be designed and built so that bike riders can take their bikes along.
   
   Too often, governmental decision making has been from the top down. We feel strongly that the design and planning of a neighborhood friendly solution to getting people to rapid transit has to be put together with and by the people who will be directly afffected, and who stand to gain or lose. We therefore are planning this as a public participation project from the very start.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The long range goal is to make Los Angeles easier to get around. This includes
  commuting to work as well as traveling to all the destinations that make
  living in the city a rewarding experience. We all know how overstressed the
  freeway system has become. We know how frustrating it is to be driving down
  the freeway, only to see a wall of tail lights go on just ahead of us.
   
   Imagine how useful it would be if we were able to travel quickly and easily to a train station or to a personal rapid transit station, board the train or the PRT pod, and get to the destination quickly.
   
   Residents of Los Angeles have an amazing choice of destinations, everything from the Music Center to sports centers to our major shopping centers. There are museums, universities, community colleges, and restaurants.
   
   Frustratingly, our Los Angeles of 2014 suffers from heavy traffic and the slow but inexorable increase in gasoline costs.
   
   The goal of building rapid transit is to connect the people of Los Angeles with all of these different destinations. The intent of our project is to consider and then design the critical link that gets people to the mass transit services themselves. In short, our project is the final element in aiding Los Angeles residents connect to work, play, and study.
   
   Without the new rapid transit systems, we are stuck in a descending spiral of traffic and fouled air. We have to figure out how to make it easy for people to use mass transportation, and that is the goal of our project.
   
   Transportation experts refer to the problem of getting people to and from mass transit systems as the "first mile, last mile" question. We believe that an intelligent choice of solutions (and it must be solutions, not just one solution) can not only solve that problem, it can increase the range to several miles. For example, we will explore the idea of how to make carry-on bikes a regular part of the commuter experience. Other methods such as the dedicated taxi fleet would be required by other people. Personal, human connectivity with the full geography of Los Angeles is our goal.
   
   It is critically important to have the next generation of rapid transit riders be a part of this planning process. In the short term, L.A. residents will begin to appreciate the idea of using rapid transit, and in the year 2050, much of Los Angeles commuting and recreation will use rapid transit.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  It is obvious that developing a citywide and countywide system of mass
  transportation will benefit practically everyone who lives in the Los Angeles
  area. We all need to move around in the city, but we are currently caught in
  an overstressed system that does not provide enough freeway lanes or city
  streets to serve our needs. Even freeway commuters will be helped as many of
  us leave the freeways and use alternative transportation.
   
   But commuters and travelers are not the only people who will benefit. One outcome of a newly invigorated rapid transit network in L.A. will be to stimulate manufacturing, particularly as the city and county engage in local sourcing of some components. One possibility is that by making Los Angeles a leader in rapid transit technology, L.A. can become the leader in a newly created export industry.
   
   None of this is inevitable, but a concerted effort by planners and designers has a good chance of getting to this highly desirable goal.
   
   We also need to mention some other benefits that go beyond the ability to get from one place to another quickly.
   
   A citywide system of electrically operated personal rapid transit and light rail will replace a large part of the carbon dioxide that is currently emitted by cars. What we will achieve is a city that is cleaner, that suffers from less vehicular noise, and which will carry its own weight in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
   
   Development of support systems for rapid transit, such as dedicated fleets of minicabs, will create new jobs in whole new sectors of the local economy. Providing citywide mobility for handicapped people is an essential element of any system we develop.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  Interestingly, our collaborators include not only our nonprofit organization
  members including the Transit Coalition, they also include neighborhood
  councils created by the City of Los Angeles, mass transit providers, companies
  that are currently developing personal rapid transit, and academic experts in
  the field of transportation.
   
   We currently have an ongoing relationship with the one personal rapid transit company that is based in California, Skytran Inc. Skytran is currently designing and building a PRT demonstration overseas. We have been discussing the acquisition of a PRT system for Los Angeles not only with Skytran, but with our elected officials.
   
   City Councilman Paul Koretz and his staff are important collaborators whom we have been working with for several years on the subject of improved transportation. We will ask his staff to collaborate with us on the project. 
   
   Several members of our group have been active members of the city's neighborhood council system going back to its inception. Neighborhood councils have active transportation committees that we shall work with. We are currently negotiating with the Neighborhood Council Congress, a yearly gathering of more than 500 people, for a breakout session on "Getting to the station: the final link."
   
   We feel that we have an important collaborator in the public as a whole. In fact, our interest in studying and solving the "first mile, last mile" problem came out of a transportation discussion at a public venue. One of the audience, a professor at Harbor UCLA Medical Center, explained that she lives in Mar Vista and needs to get to Harbor UCLA in Torrance for her work. She explained that unless she has a mass transit station nearby, or some convenient way of getting to the station, she will be stuck with taking her car to work.
   
   Since the proposed project involves interviewing residents of Los Angeles about their needs and wants, we consider all of our future contacts to be collaborators.
   
   We hope to develop working relationships with several other companies that are currently developing innovative new systems in Europe, Asia, and other parts of the United States. We feel that designing the vehicles in a way that works seamlessly with our "first mile, last mile" solutions is critical.
