Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): |-
  The i.am Makerspace will provide the following: 
   
   EDUCATION: We will focus on high-tech skills-based education. We will provide classes and workshops in coding, app development, robotics, product design, 3D printing, prototyping, web development, graphic design, entrepreneurship and business plan formation. 
   
   MENTORSHIP: We will provide a forum for mentorship between local aspiring entrepreneurs and experienced business experts. Through will.i.am’s support, our team is well-connected to the worlds of entertainment, technology, philanthropy, and investment not just in Los Angeles but on an international level. We can attract world-class experts to share their knowledge with our i.am Makers. 
   
   CREATIVE SPACE: Our space will be a creative studio that fosters local innovation. We will provide coworking space to locally-focused startups, as well as studio space to promising local artists and artisans. We will also dedicate space for K-12 students to play and learn through STEM activities, host several neighborhood FIRST robotics teams, and host hackathons. It will be a space for the cross-pollination of ideas that leads to innovation. 
   
   OPPORTUNITY: We aim to create a network of skilled professionals who are capable of creating jobs in tech and startups, not just in Boyle Heights but for the entire city of Los Angeles.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  An i.am Makerspace in Boyle Heights will benefit ALL of Los Angeles, not just
  the east side. 
   
   Here’s why: 
   
   This space improves the creative ecosystem for the entire city of Los Angeles, by fostering a larger and more diverse pool of entrepreneurial talent. The future needs solutions that involve innovation from everyone.
   
   This space will foster entrepreneurship in a struggling community that is burdened with crime, violence, and unemployment. By providing education and opportunity, we will empower local residents to gain the high-demand and high-paying skills needed to work in tech, or even create their own tech companies.
   
   This has a halo effect on many other factors. Not only could it boost the local economy, creating jobs for local young people, but they will also be more likely to stay in the neighborhoods and continue to improve them. It could reduce crime and violence, and increase safety in these struggling neighborhoods and surrounding areas. 
   
   Our mission is for the i.am Makerspace to be a model for other similar communities around the world.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Our most immediate goal is serving the people of Boyle Heights and surrounding
  neighborhoods. We want to turn Boyle Heights into a model community, with
  ideas and practices that could be adapted by similar underserved neighborhoods
  around the country. 
   
   Boyle Heights is a working-class, mostly immigrant, youthful neighborhood of almost 100,000 residents. The district has over 20 public schools, many of which have a reputation of being “dropout factories.” Just 5% of Boyle Heights residents aged 25 and older had earned a four-year degree by 2000, an abysmally low percentage for the city. 
   
   The conditions are grim for the youth of Boyle Heights, so we aim to serve primarily students and young adults including: 
   - K-12 students 
   - Young adults (18-30) who are not in college or have 4-year degrees
   - Recent graduates who are struggling to find jobs 
   - Veterans 
   - Local makers, artisans, and artists
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  The i.am.angel Foundation has existing partnerships with leading tech
  companies and organizations, who are all ready to expand and take our programs
  to the next level. Here are some of our confirmed collaborators who have an
  excellent track record of supporting creators: 
   
   FIRST Robotics: FIRST Robotics is the premier, international robotics competition for K-12 students founded by inventor Dean Kamen. i.am.angel recently founded and sponsored the first ever FIRST Robotics team at Roosevelt High School, and we have the structure and fundraising power to sponsor and support several more teams in Boyle Heights and surrounding neighborhoods. We want the i.am Makerspace to be a hub for local FIRST teams. 
   
   Esri: Esri's ArcGIS is the premier tool used by GIS mapping professionals all over the world. We've teamed up with Esri to teach Boyle Heights students how to use sophisticated ArcGIS software to map their own data to highlight issues such as gang violence, pollution, and health and wellness. We're ready to provide the same training to anyone interested in becoming a GIS data scientist, which doesn't require an advanced degree, and can open up a new world of job opportunities. 
   
   Dassault Systems: Dassault's CATIA 3D design software is used by top aerospace and car companies such as Boeing and GM. We teamed with Dassault to teach Boyle Heights students how to use this sophisticated industry software to design and prototype their own products such as electronics and musical instruments.
   
   3D Systems: 3D Systems is a top 3D Printing company that has teamed up with will.i.am on creative innovation. They will be providing 3D printers to all i.am.angel program spaces in Boyle Heights. 
   
   General Assembly: General Assembly is an ed tech company that has been great supporters of our Hack for LA hackathons, and we'd love to team up with them to provide high-tech skills training such as web and app development to Boyle Heights residents. i.am.angel plans to subsidize the cost of these workshops in order to make classes more affordable for the Boyle Heights community.
