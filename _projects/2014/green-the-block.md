  more_detail: "The Green the Block Pilot, is a collaborative effort led by Green Education Inc., a 501c3 organization, along with 5 other local organizations based in Long Beach, CA., which will transform one residential block of homes in the West Long Beach area most impacted by GHG emissions.

  two_lessons: "Over the past several years, millions of dollars were spent on an energy efficiency initiative called \"Energy Upgrade CA\" that basically excluded low-income homeowners and neighborhoods because of up-front costs and long delays in receiving rebates. Time after time, we conducted program overviews for homeowners that simply could not afford to participate in the program, which was extremely disheartening for homeowners and for our organization as well.\r\n\r\nGreen Education Inc. was recently involved with a small business energy efficiency outreach program for LADWP. Their small business and home energy efficiency installation programs provided business and homeowners in low-income underserved communities with the opportunity to create healthier homes and businesses, save energy and lower energy bills, and these programs also created apprenticeships with local unions that prepared community members with eventual jobs at LADWP.  \r\n\r\nThe Green The Block initiative was influenced by these two projects - one that was unreachable for underserved communities and the other that has become an example of a project that not only creates healthier homes, businesses and neighborhood environments, but also creates union-connected, good paying jobs as well."
  achievable_goal: "Our estimation for initial outreach and education to an entire block of homeowners is approximately 60 days. Once we accomplish this first phase, we can move into the home & yard audits phase, which is approximately 45 days.\r\n\r\nUrban farm groups, native landscapers and energy efficiency contractors will then be tasked with completing their specific function over the next 7-9 months.\r\n\r\nThis initiative is achievable because of the subject matter experts that will be completing the work. They have many years of experience in their areas of expertise and are extremely knowledgeable in change management and behavioral change approaches for these types of long-term projects as well."
  major_challenges: "1. Resistance or mistrust from families regarding the initiative: Continuous outreach via neighborhood associations, churches, PTSA at local high school, and through local community groups established in the area.\r\n\r\n2. Families reverting back to pre-Green The Block behaviors (using excess energy and water, not tending to Community Garden, Victory Farm and native landscaped yards): Recognize, reward and incentivize families to encourage continuous and sustainable behavior change. Set clear expectation that families will be involved with other components of initiative (sweat equity) to ensure families continue to be engaged.\r\nEnsure partners establish the above systems/processes for their specific segment of the initiative.\r\nEnsure program metrics are evaluated every 3-6 months to determine transfer of knowledge and sustainability of entire program."
  competition: "There are organizations focused on urban farming, community gardening or on native landscaping, but there are no other organizations attempting to create an initiative that brings together, highlights and manages the various components of creating a healthy neighborhood (block).\r\n\r\nThis project will demonstrate to the city, utility companies, educational and workforce development institutions and key stakeholders that we have the capacity to create actual good, long-term jobs and entrepreneurial opportunities via green block initiatives focused on energy efficiency home improvements, urban farming, native landscaping, and sustainability education for community members."
  cost: "We estimate that approximately $850,000 is required for pilot initiative. \r\n\r\nWe are submitting RFPs for SB535 grant monies, as well as requesting monies from organizations such as LB Gas & Oil, Port of Long Beach, local refineries, SCE, grants from local foundations such as The CA Endowment, and discretionary dollars from the local Councilmember and Mayor of Long Beach."
  budget: "$25,000: Marketing and Community Outreach - Canvassers, phone bankers and small group presenters\r\n$20,000: Create and distribute Green The Block initiative outreach & education materials to be utilized by subject matter experts and trainers for ongoing training purposes. Train-the-Trainer process included in this budget item.\r\n$25,000: Conduct initial energy efficiency, urban/community farming, native landscaping and gray water system maintenance workshops. \r\n$30,000: Conduct energy efficiency audits to one-block radius of homes.\r\n"

  impact_metrics: "Victory Farms will be established at each homeowner's back/front yard, as well as a Community Garden established within a 1-mile radius of homes. Families will be trained in growing and maintaining fresh, healthy food for their households and for their community.\r\n\r\nEnergy Efficiency audits at each home will determine indoor air quality issues and the measures required to remediate these issues, as well as ensuring a healthy, tight and energy-saving indoor environment.\r\n\r\nThe Green The Block initiative will work specifically with low-income families in West Long Beach, an area that is seriously impacted by  local pollution and GHG emission sources.  According to 2014 Census reports, median household income for West Long Beach is $43,464, which is 48% lower than that of Los Angeles. \r\n\r\nThis initiative will not only create healthier homes for families with individuals suffering from asthma and upper respiratory diseases, but it will also provide homeowners with increased value to their homes and create a \"Pride of Ownership\" mentality for entire neighborhoods.\r\n\r\n"
Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  SFCLA will open access to nutritious groceries and fresh produce at three
  geographically and culturally diverse food deserts in Los Angeles: East Los
  Angeles, Boyle Heights and East Hollywood. Fortunately, SFCLA has the
  expertise and infrastructure already in place at its headquarters downtown to
  implement the project with relative ease. Our 600 square foot refrigerator can
  house thousands of pounds of fresh produce and perishable items, and SFCLA
  already owns two delivery trucks. By rotating produce in and out of our
  refrigeration system at a higher frequency as we expand service to more areas,
  we will maximize the freshness and amount of food that is available to the
  people we serve. It is a win-win for all involved!
   
   To get the project up and running, SFCLA and parish staff and volunteers will commit to a set schedule that can be advertised to the public and relied upon by the community. We’d like to note that our partners, the 3 Franciscan parishes of Los Angeles, share SFCLA’s philosophy of serving any person in need, without judgment or religious consideration, and without any type of obligation in return. 
   SFCLA has a large and dedicated volunteer base that helps cook and serve meals, organize and distribute donations of food and clothing, and even provide administrative assistance. Whether they are part of a volunteer organization, from a local high school, or individuals with a heart for their community, SFCLA has historically and consistently been fueled by the efforts of dedicated volunteers. Last year, SFCLA engaged more than 2,100 volunteers in nearly 20,000 hours of service, which is equivalent to having 10 full-time employees! We will be delighted to put more volunteers into service to help drive our expansion. It is community helping community to make Los Angeles a healthier place.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  SFCLA’s fresh produce pantry project will help make LA the healthiest place to
  live today by providing free groceries filled with fresh produce and balanced,
  nutritious ingredients, many of which are hard to come by at other pantries.
  Our high-tech refrigeration system will allow us to receive donations of fresh
  meat and dairy and deliver them to the sites safely. We will start service on
  a bi-weekly basis and transition to weekly service by the fourth quarter of
  the grant year. 
   
   For many people in Los Angeles, the terms “vegan”, “gluten-free”, and “organic” are familiar terms that describe a lifestyle that is health-conscious. These labels can be found in the grocery stores where they shop, at the farmers markets they visit, and the restaurants they frequent. This concept is so common that the idea of living a nutrition-centered life is indelibly linked to the personality of Los Angeles. Unfortunately, for too many families in our county, access to healthy groceries and fresh produce is NOT a reality. The reality for many low-income families is that large grocery stores and their vast selections and lower prices can be few and far between. The groceries and produce they do have access to are of poor quality or are over-priced. As a result, many meals come from fast food restaurants that are inexpensive or are made from ingredients that lack nutritional value. Anyone who has been to a grocery store has seen that you can get a bag of Cheetos for $1.50 but it costs a family twice that amount for a meager bag of spinach.
   
   Our project will help make LA the healthiest place to live in 2050 by ensuring the long-term health and well-being of LA's residents. Providing groceries and produce to families in need is not only about sustenance, but about the long-term effects of improving the health of a family. Often times, diseases like diabetes can be avoided when children are given fruits and vegetables instead of fast food or processed treats that come so cheap. While a fresh salad to many in Los Angeles is just another meal, it can make all the difference to a child who needs those nutrients to develop properly. By giving all Angelenos the resources they need to live healthy lives, we are investing in our society as a whole.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  This project will benefit extremely low-income families, youth, seniors,
  veterans, and disabled adults in Boyle Heights, East Hollywood, East Los
  Angeles and downtown LA. The federal poverty level for a family of four is
  $23,550, but families who utilize SFCLA’s current pantry services have an
  average monthly income of only $1,020, HALF the federal poverty level (SFCLA
  2013 internal census). 
   
   88% of pantry participants at our downtown LA center self-identify as Hispanic or Latino, 9% as African American or Black, 2% as Caucasian or White, and 1% as Asian. 
   
   Extremely low incomes combined with Los Angeles’ expensive housing market means that the majority of our guests’ income is going to shelter. 
   
   Currently, SFCLA provides fresh produce and groceries to 400 families per week - over 20,000 families a year. This satellite pantry project will allow SFCLA to increase the number of families served to at least 600 per week, or 30,000 annually by the end of the grant period. This is a 50% increase in the number of families SFCLA serves annually!
   
   “With my family, we began to eat more vegetables and fruits. Instead we eat at home more instead of take out. We read more labels on foods.” - Anna, 15 years old. 
   
   As a nation with so many resources and such an abundance of wealth, it is IMPERATIVE that we see the future prosperity of our society as an issue that is rooted in the well-being of all citizens, no matter their tax-bracket.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  SFCLA has the confirmed partnership of the Franciscan parishes of Our Lady of
  Victory, Assumption, and Saint Francis of Assisi. These 3 parishes bring a
  unique awareness to the partnership: that of the specific trials, needs,
  concerns, and hopes of the communities they serve. The history of working to
  meet their constituent’s spiritual needs is now being translated into our
  combined efforts to meet the physical needs of their parishioners. Because the
  parishes serve as vibrant community centers in these neighborhoods, they are
  ideal locations for distributing groceries to those in need.
   
   We have longstanding partnerships with many food suppliers – from large chain stores to regional food banks – that donate the food we distribute. Last year, SFCLA distributed over 1.1 MILLION pounds of food, the vast majority of it donated. Some of our key partners include Lucky Supermarkets, LA Food Bank, Heart of Compassion, and Food Finders. 
   
   Every month new volunteers join our existing rank of hundreds. Half of our volunteers come as individuals, half come with organizations. They are high school students involved in a service-learning project, volunteers from corporations, churches and service groups. Some give a few hours of their time, others have volunteered daily for years. The diversity of our volunteers with regards to background and regularity is remarkable. Without these valuable members of our team, SFCLA would be unable to deliver its services so efficiently or to cultivate the personal relationships with those who come to us in their time of need. 
   
   Our mutual history has yielded so much success due to many factors. (1) The deep commitment to not only provide for the immediate hunger of those in need, but also for their long-term health, is first and foremost; 
   (2) the diversity of those we collaborate with is also imperative for creating the greatest impact through our program. If we had volunteers but no food, or food but no sense of the comprehensive needs and wishes of our families, it would be impossible to serve people in the way that we do; 
   (3) The shared heart-centered philosophy of serving without judgment or obligation is imperative to our success.

    answer: "Victory Farms will be established at each homeowner's back/front yard, as well as a Community Garden established within a 1-mile radius of homes. Families will be trained in growing and maintaining fresh, healthy food for their households and for their community.\r\n\r\nEnergy Efficiency audits at each home will determine indoor air quality issues and the measures required to remediate these issues, as well as ensuring a healthy, tight and energy-saving indoor environment.\r\n\r\nThe Green The Block initiative will work specifically with low-income families in West Long Beach, an area that is seriously impacted by  local pollution and GHG emission sources.  According to 2014 Census reports, median household income for West Long Beach is $43,464, which is 48% lower than that of Los Angeles. \r\n\r\nThis initiative will not only create healthier homes for families with individuals suffering from asthma and upper respiratory diseases, but it will also provide homeowners with increased value to their homes and create a \"Pride of Ownership\" mentality for entire neighborhoods.\r\n\r\n"

    answer: "Over the past several years, millions of dollars were spent on an energy efficiency initiative called \"Energy Upgrade CA\" that basically excluded low-income homeowners and neighborhoods because of up-front costs and long delays in receiving rebates. Time after time, we conducted program overviews for homeowners that simply could not afford to participate in the program, which was extremely disheartening for homeowners and for our organization as well.\r\n\r\nGreen Education Inc. was recently involved with a small business energy efficiency outreach program for LADWP. Their small business and home energy efficiency installation programs provided business and homeowners in low-income underserved communities with the opportunity to create healthier homes and businesses, save energy and lower energy bills, and these programs also created apprenticeships with local unions that prepared community members with eventual jobs at LADWP.  \r\n\r\nThe Green The Block initiative was influenced by these two projects - one that was unreachable for underserved communities and the other that has become an example of a project that not only creates healthier homes, businesses and neighborhood environments, but also creates union-connected, good paying jobs as well."

    answer: "Our estimation for initial outreach and education to an entire block of homeowners is approximately 60 days. Once we accomplish this first phase, we can move into the home & yard audits phase, which is approximately 45 days.\r\n\r\nUrban farm groups, native landscapers and energy efficiency contractors will then be tasked with completing their specific function over the next 7-9 months.\r\n\r\nThis initiative is achievable because of the subject matter experts that will be completing the work. They have many years of experience in their areas of expertise and are extremely knowledgeable in change management and behavioral change approaches for these types of long-term projects as well."
  - name: major_challenges
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "1. Resistance or mistrust from families regarding the initiative: Continuous outreach via neighborhood associations, churches, PTSA at local high school, and through local community groups established in the area.\r\n\r\n2. Families reverting back to pre-Green The Block behaviors (using excess energy and water, not tending to Community Garden, Victory Farm and native landscaped yards): Recognize, reward and incentivize families to encourage continuous and sustainable behavior change. Set clear expectation that families will be involved with other components of initiative (sweat equity) to ensure families continue to be engaged.\r\nEnsure partners establish the above systems/processes for their specific segment of the initiative.\r\nEnsure program metrics are evaluated every 3-6 months to determine transfer of knowledge and sustainability of entire program."

    answer: "There are organizations focused on urban farming, community gardening or on native landscaping, but there are no other organizations attempting to create an initiative that brings together, highlights and manages the various components of creating a healthy neighborhood (block).\r\n\r\nThis project will demonstrate to the city, utility companies, educational and workforce development institutions and key stakeholders that we have the capacity to create actual good, long-term jobs and entrepreneurial opportunities via green block initiatives focused on energy efficiency home improvements, urban farming, native landscaping, and sustainability education for community members."
