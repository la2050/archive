Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Did you know that thousands of volunteers throughout the United States drive
  one of the most effective anti-poverty strategies in the country? Volunteer
  Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program utilizes IRS trained and certified
  volunteers to provide free income tax filing to low- and moderate-income
  taxpayers, connecting these working families with deductions and refundable
  tax credits without losing a single cent to tax preparation fees. In our
  vision of a civically engaged and connected Los Angeles in 2050, Koreatown
  Youth and Community Center (KYCC) will work with schools, corporations,
  nonprofit organizations and government entities to build a VITA collaborative
  in Los Angeles and work with over 500 volunteers for the 2015 tax season.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  KYCC has been a successful VITA provider since 2006, serving over 20,000
  low-income families throughout Central Los Angeles and returning more than
  $17.5 million in refunds back to the families that we serve. Although these
  are impressive numbers, there is more that KYCC can and will do. In Los
  Angeles County, there were 2.6 million tax returns filed with the IRS in 2012.
  Among them, 28.13% were self prepared, 70.28% were paid prepared, and 1.56%
  were volunteer prepared. The last figure is telling. Of all of the taxpayers
  eligible for free VITA services in Los Angeles County, only 1.56% took
  advantage of the program. Why is this the case? Unlike San Francisco or New
  York where there are coordinated VITA infrastructures, Los Angeles lacks such
  coordination. Through our proposed collaborative, KYCC will bring such unified
  services and structure to the VITA programs throughout Los Angeles County.
   
   Most importantly, KYCC will implement a coordinated volunteer management program with our VITA collaborative. First, KYCC and the collaborative will coordinate the recruitment of volunteers by working with local schools such as UCLA Extension and Cal State Long Beach, local banks and other corporations, youth, and retirees. Second, once volunteers have committed to work with VITA, KYCC will coordinate the training. IRS requires VITA volunteers to receive tax preparation trainings. KYCC will provide both online and in-class training opportunities. The VITA collaborative partners will also be trained and in turn provide training to volunteers who come to their organizations. Third, KYCC and the VITA collaborative will manage the assignment of volunteer opportunities with trained volunteers. In the past, some VITA sites had an over abundance of volunteers while other sites had tremendous difficulty even finding one. By recruiting volunteers from throughout Los Angeles County, KYCC will facilitate placement of volunteers at sites near where they work, live or play, reducing some of the barriers to volunteering. Finally, the volunteer retention strategy for KYCC and the VITA collaborative is based on ensuring that volunteers are supported, guided and engaged consistently throughout all VITA sites. In addition to adequate training, KYCC and the VITA collaborative will ensure that all logistics are prepared for volunteers to do their work without interruptions or distractions (e.g., appointment scheduling, adequate staff presence, necessary technology and supplies).
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Envision a Los Angeles where Angelenos care about one another – today and in
  2050. Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program is about more than free
  tax preparation. Volunteers who commit to VITA go through rigorous training
  and dedicate many hours from January to April to work with low-income working
  families, helping them connect with hundreds and thousands of dollars in
  refunds that not only help the families financially but also feed the local
  economy. By inspiring over 500 volunteers to commit to VITA in 2015, KYCC will
  begin the process of bringing a culture of compassion and helping one another
  to Los Angeles. Through our VITA collaborative’s volunteer program, each VITA
  volunteer will know the impact that they are making in the lives of each of
  the low-income, working families who receive VITA services. For example, each
  volunteer will learn that, in 2014, VITA volunteers completed 44,575 tax
  returns in Los Angeles County for a refund of almost $46 million back to our
  families (and the local economy). Volunteers will feel good about the
  difference that they are making in the lives of their neighbors and continue
  to make VITA an annual volunteer commitment. 
   
   By 2050, the work and dedication begun by the first 500 VITA volunteers in 2015 will have made an impact in Los Angeles and the decades of fostering a culture of compassion and helping one another will have born fruit. Each year following 2015, KYCC will have increased the number of Angelenos volunteering with VITA, and that means more and more low-income, working families eligible for VITA services will have known about it and have taken advantage of the free tax preparation. In turn, that means that the amount of refunds to our families each year will have exceeded the $46 million returned in 2014 and that more eligible working families will have received the Earned Income Tax Credit. And by receiving larger refunds including the EITC, research indicates that children of such recipients do better in school, are likelier to attend college, and earn more as adults. All these benefits will also spur spending and development in our local economy. Finally, with more volunteers each year, the VITA collaborative will add new partner organizations and grow into a stronger network. So by 2050, through KYCC’s VITA collaborative, Angelenos of different socioeconomic backgrounds will have come together to help one another and to develop a sense that we are all Angelenos.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  KYCC and our VITA collaborative will directly benefit low- and very low-income
  residents of Los Angeles, who are oftentimes linguistically isolated
  (monolingual Spanish, Korean or Chinese speakers) or have other barriers
  (cultural, educational, etc.) hindering access to basic and/or mainstream
  financial services. For example, KYCC and our partner VITA organizations work
  primarily within Los Angeles’ low-income areas such as Koreatown, Boyle
  Heights, East Los Angeles, South Los Angeles, Chinatown, El Sereno, and
  Lincoln Heights. These areas are home primarily to a majority of Latino
  residents as well as other immigrant groups such as Koreans and Chinese; as
  immigrant communities, many of these residents speak little to no English and
  have difficulty accessing mainstream services such as banking and even
  government benefits. Additionally, these neighborhoods tend to have much
  higher poverty rate than the rest of Los Angeles County. For example, in
  Koreatown, the estimated median household income in 2008 was $27,438 with 45%
  of residents falling below the federal poverty line. In Boyle Heights, for
  another example, the family poverty level is nearly three times the state
  average (28.4% vs. 9.8%) with high incidences of foreclosures and low
  homeownership rates compared with Los Angeles County (23% vs. 47.8%).
  Moreover, City of Los Angeles FamilySource Centers are located in the most
  economically distressed areas of the city and specifically provide
  comprehensive academic and economic development services to low-income
  residents of those areas. Overall, most of the residents are working poor that
  live paycheck to paycheck and are not ready for any financial emergencies. 
   
   In addition, KYCC’s VITA collaborative will specifically benefit working low-income families in Los Angeles County who fail to claim Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) refunds every year. According to the New America Foundation, EITC is widely regarded as the nation’s most effective and efficient anti-poverty program. But in Los Angeles County, the IRS estimates that 21% of all eligible families who qualify for EITC do not file a federal tax return to claim the credit. That means residents are leaving behind at least $300 million in EITC in Los Angeles County each year. That is money that could have helped low-income families save for emergencies, pay for higher education or child care, and many other things to improve their lives.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  For 2015 and beyond, KYCC will lead a VITA collaborative with Chinatown
  Service Center (CSC), East LA Community Corporation (ELACC), Mexican American
  Opportunity Foundation (MAOF), Children’s Institute (CII), and 19 City of Los
  Angeles FamilySource Centers (FSCs). This collaborative is confirmed, and we
  have been working together as an informal VITA collaborative for the past few
  years.
   
   Each VITA partner organization brings its cultural and linguistic capacity to serve low-income, linguistically isolated populations. Culturally, immigrant communities are very reluctant to seek help, even if they are eligible for it (either government or social support services). The decades of service provided by KYCC, CSC, ELACC, MAOF, CII and FSCs within their communities have enabled each organization to build trust and good reputation necessary to lower barriers for clients to seek out our assistance. Together, the collaborative has the cultural, linguistic and organizational capacity to provide high quality VITA programs to a very large number of clients in the Latino, Korean, and Chinese communities – more than other nonprofits in the greater Los Angeles area. Very few organizations offer free tax preparation for Korean and Chinese communities and none has the same volume capacity and longstanding successful track record as KYCC and CSC. In addition, our sites are located centrally to the geographic areas where these immigrant communities meet and congregate, and these areas are easily accessible by public transportation – further lowering barriers for accessing our programs. 
   
   Finally, three factors critical to the success of KYCC’s VITA collaborative include (1) buy-in from each organization, (2) effective volunteer engagement and (3) ability to sync with other anti-poverty initiatives. Although KYCC has been working informally with the partner organizations, each VITA partner’s commitment to the collaborative is key. Moreover, volunteers are the most important component of VITA services since they provide the actual tax preparation that brings refunds and credits back to our low-income communities. To ensure that volunteers enjoy their experience, the VITA collaborative must provide effective volunteer management. Finally, VITA services alone cannot combat poverty in Los Angeles. The collaborative must partner with other anti-poverty initiatives in the city such as the Mayor’s Working Families, City of Los Angeles Office of Financial Empowerment, and others.
