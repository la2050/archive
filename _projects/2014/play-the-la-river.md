Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Since 2012, the team at Project 51 has laid the groundwork with our partners
  to launch Play the LA River this fall around the project’s three main
  elements.
   
   Our playable card deck is a unique guide to the LA River, which we will disseminate for free at events and via community outreach. With 52 river sites and 4 off-river “wild card” sites all organized into 4 geographic “suits,” the card deck features greenways and parks along with places that river revitalization has yet to touch but that hold meaning for local communities. Each card is both a tool and an artwork––with a custom map, “dashboard” of site features, access instructions, and tips on how to play. The cards also invite Angelenos to share how THEY play the LA River: dance, picnic, skate, juggle, kayak, bird-watch, bike, paint, swing, BBQ, practice yoga, ride horses, play soccer, play music, fly kites, and the possibilities continue! After extensive scouting, we have finished the card deck and will distribute an initial 2,500 this fall.
   
   In collaboration with partners, we are also producing a 51-week series of public events––including a launch extravaganza at the Frogtown Artwalk on September 13, a closing festival in September 2015, and smaller-scale riverside events across all 4 geographic “suits” (Valley, Glendale Narrows, Downtown, and South). For example, LA River Corp will take the lead in producing a “mobile play” series featuring neighborhood scavenger hunts and bicycle theater. In addition to the programs we implement, Play the LA River will do outreach to an array of organizations—from cultural, sports, and youth groups to gamers, performers, and scientists––in order to galvanize diverse forms of play along the river. To support others in organizing their own play programs and to facilitate spontaneous riverside play, we will develop a toolkit in English and Spanish. The toolkit will include practical resources on river access plus illustrative ideas for self-organized gatherings and projects. 
   
   Finally, our website will include mobile-friendly versions of the toolkit and cards (complete with interactive maps of our 56 sites), an events calendar, and curated multimedia exhibits featuring select Play the LA River events and projects. Through a community-generated and multilingual “stream” of social media posts, the website will also integrate stories, pictures, recordings, and videos showcasing how Angelenos play the LA River today and how they aspire to play there in the future.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  The “play” in Play the LA River is an invitation to communities across
  metropolitan Los Angeles to learn about, connect with, and help create a
  vibrant future for a river that has been hidden for decades but has been
  coming back to life thanks to revitalization efforts. “Play” runs the gamut
  from the performing arts to youth sports to game playing. “Play” involves
  Angelenos in participatory activities that will inspire broad investment in
  the potential of the LA River to connect, celebrate, and green communities.
  And “play” taps into the multiethnic and geographic diversity of art, culture,
  and recreation across LA.
   
   To envision the river as the geographic and social heart of the LA area, Angelenos first have to know that the river exists, where it flows, and how to access and enjoy it. Play the LA River meets these needs through a public programming and outreach project that contributes to ongoing river revitalization projects and that catalyzes wider civic engagement with the development of parks, greenways, wildlife habitats, sustainable water infrastructure, and cultural centers. However, we focus on the LA River not only to widen the involvement of local communities in river revitalization efforts but also to address critical issues in Los Angeles of park space, neighborhood-centered art and recreation, urban sustainability, and environmental justice.
   
   Most LA River advocacy groups have specific geographical and administrative boundaries (such as the City of LA River Revitalization Master Plan and the City of Long Beach RiverLink Plan). As of yet, no organization has connected the entire river through cultural programming. Play the LA River promises to serve this vital role by providing a hub for events and projects along the river’s entire length and by reaching out to thousands of Angelenos who are new to the river and including them in shaping its future.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  To date, public engagement efforts around the LA River have been significant
  and often highly creative—beginning with the artists who founded what seemed
  like an improbable movement in the 1980s. However, public knowledge of the LA
  River and its revitalization continues to lag behind costly civil engineering
  and time-intensive policymaking. We strongly believe that to be successful,
  this innovative civic reengineering project requires collective acts of
  re-imagination.
   
   Play the LA River encourages Angelenos to get to know the entire river—including its most challenged places that master planning efforts have yet to reach. The project pays special attention to communities who live along the river, while welcoming everyone across the region to participate. The project brings Angelenos of all ages and social groups to 52 river sites––which include bike paths, shady parks with playing fields, public art installations, and quiet spots from which simply to take the river in—so as to make the river more compelling to all. The project in turn builds public support and public dialogue around revitalization plans. By working with riverside communities from Canoga Park to Long Beach to view the river as their essential public space, we hope Play the LA River will empower Angelenos to insist that the revitalization process remains democratic and fulfills promises that the greening of the river will benefit existing communities as well as future residents and visitors. 
   
   Play the LA River will ultimately benefit a wide network of groups and individuals in the LA area who focus on river revitalization, park space, visual and performing arts, youth education and recreation, and environmental and social justice. The project will realize these community benefits in part through public programming and in part by awarding stipends to artists, schools, community groups, and other civic-minded folks who are active in river-adjacent communities and who can help to activate play at each of our sites. In tandem, the project website will serve as a virtual river community and living-breathing public art project that will provide unprecedented tools for accessing and navigating the LA River, crowd-sourcing river events, and showcasing the possibilities for playing the river now and in LA 2050!
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  The Project 51 arts collective is one key player in a larger field of groups.
  Play the LA River has been developed as an umbrella for collaboration, and the
  project contributes to ongoing projects and invites other groups to play! Our

   Non-Profit Organizations:
   - LA River Corp is dedicated to sustainable development and placemaking along the LA River corridor. At the core of its mission is transforming the LA River into a vibrant public space through their LA River Regatta Club (a platform for community engagement and innovative events). LA River Corp is a leading partner in the Play the LA River programming efforts. 
   
   - artworxLA is an arts program that creatively links overlooked alternative high school students with professional artists, cultural institutions, and communities to produce and present new work. In 2014-15, artworxLA will guide students to create art projects that connect to Play the LA River in 27 alternative arts classrooms throughout LA County. Each 11-week workshop will culminate in a student exhibition and presentations at the LA River Center and Gardens. 
   
   - The Elysian Valley Arts Collective is collaborating with Project 51, LA River Corp, and MRCA on the Play the LA River launch, which will take place in conjunction with their annual Frogtown Artwalk.
   
   -Clockshop, a nonprofit arts organization based in Elysian Valley, provides cultural programming to activate the as-yet-undeveloped Bowtie Parcel for California State Parks. Clockshop also supports other projects by artists, writers, and civic leaders. Clockshop is collaborating with Project 51 on public engagement events, including campouts, storytelling, and screenings at Bowtie, along the river.
    
   -LA River Expeditions will partner with us on Summer 2015 kayak tours on the river.
