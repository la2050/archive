Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  To implement this project, founder Oscar Menjivar, and our team of over 20
  mentor-coders from URBAN TXT, will bring together Black and Latino youth from
  the areas of South LA, Watts, East LA, and Pico Union to teach them basic and
  advanced skills in computer programming and design. Much of the initial
  training will take place within ‘The Cube’, UrbanTxt’s newly renovated ‘Hacker
  Space’ Headquarters on the outskirts of campus at USC. The students will take
  these skills, and use them to create simulated scale environments of their own
  neighborhoods within the Minecraft video game world, as the students envision,
  and create, what their neighborhoods will look like in the year 2050. Young
  people will work collaboratively within project management groups, to
  construct these virtual LA neighborhoods of the future. Many of the youth who
  participate in our program come from disadvantaged backgrounds. Teens will be
  learning while playing, having fun, connecting across the city and developing
  skills that will help create a diverse tech workforce in Los Angeles. Teens
  who have previously participated in URBAN TXT curriculum will mentor and teach
  new students how to code, and how to reimagine present day low-income
  neighborhoods as new communities of the future. #EnvisionLA is an opportunity
  for young people to create their own utopian worlds, filled with as much hope
  and opportunity as they wish to fill it. Classes for youth participating in
  the project will take place at our HackerSpace and at the locations of
  participating partners. We will train 20 mentors to implement the program and
  1 full staff member, and expect it will take four sessions of coding and
  design classes per week to teach youth the necessary skills. Our equipment
  needs include computers, a server, and Minecraft related software to complete
  the project. We expect to complete the #VisonLA virtual world project by 
   September of 2015.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Our idea will make LA the best place to create today, because we are engaging
  young innovators who come from disadvantaged backgrounds, and have great
  ideas, to make their communities a better place. These young innovators want
  to start creating and sharing their ideas today. The over 150 students we have
  interviewed in the past year are ready to be part of an LA that encourages
  them to create and design new environments, and where they will learn the
  skills of the 21st century. 
   
   Minecraft already serves as a phenomenon of creativity and collaboration within the gaming community. Our #EnvisionLA project only seeks to harness the collective, and often untapped, resources of creativity and collaboration within the disadvantaged neighborhoods of Los Angeles. Where gang rivalries and violence act as detractors and deterrents to living in these neighborhoods, and delivering good-paying jobs to these same communities, our #EnvisionLA project will serve as a reason to bring hope there. Not only because these communities will be transformed through the collaborative efforts of our coding teams rendering new designs of them in the virtual world, but because these teams will have learned the skills necessary for each team member to get that well-paying job- today. It is currently reported that only 10% of our nation’s K-12 schools have computer programming classes http://cbsloc.al/1nJEWfc. In LA’s inner city, this number is closer to 1% 
   
   In 2050, our project will have served as the project that gave young people of color an opportunity to be part of the tech world. Our project will undoubtedly increase the amount of students who are interested in coding and designing. In 2050, LA will be the best place to create because, by then, we will have a more diverse group of people being part of the tech and innovation industry. Today, a 10 year old kid living in Watts who is inspired by our project could easily be the one who creates the next big tech start up in South Los Angeles. The skills they learn through #EnvisionLA will make them part of a workforce that allows Los Angeles to create the best products and businesses possible, and solve LA’s most pressing problems. If we don’t help kids in low- income communities engage with coding and design today, LA will lack creativity and innovation in the future. URBAN TxT, through #EnvisionLA, will help create a future workforce that inspires the culture and vibrancy of an innovative Los Angeles.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Directly, our project will benefit the 400 young people who will participate
  in #EnvisionLA , which will teach them the computer programming skills they
  need to become employable within the programming industry. Indirectly, our
  impact through this project solution has the potential to be much greater.
  Currently, the LAUSD high school student body is 75 percent Latino, 9 percent
  African American, 4 percent Asian, 9 percent White, 3 percent Filipino, and 74
  percent of this cohort is economically disadvantaged ( LA 2050 report, p. 13),
  According to this same report, unemployment rates for African American and
  Latinos are the highest among any ethnic group in Los Angeles. As UrbanTxt
  serves youth through this project, we expect the ratio of participants to be
  approximately 60% Latino and 40% African-American, and we expect for 100% of
  these youth to have employable skills in computer programming by the end of
  this project’s duration. 
   
   
   In Los Angeles County the unemployment rate for African Americans and Latinos is 21 percent and 14 percent, respectively (LA 2050 report, p. 18). This LA County demographic make-up (with a large share of the population being Latino and African American) implies that the region will persistently suffer from elevated rates of unemployment in the future. Based on these factors, the Los Angeles of 2050 will continue to be a region of haves and have-nots. However, the #EnvisionLA project will provide skills to teens that will encourage them to continue creating and designing with the programming skills they learn. If each one of our 400 program participants touched the lives of a mother, father, sister and brother through their contribution to the local/global economy, we fully expect the impact of #EnvisionLA to impact over one thousand lives.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  As of January 2014, UrbanTxt has trained over 60 kids in four computer
  programming languages. Our students have created their own apps, and some have
  even gone on to sell their apps within the Apple App Store. Now we are going
  to share our knowledge of design and code with ten other organizations around
  Los Angeles. We already have partner agreements with ICEF and Alliance Charter
  Schools, and we have discussed the project with Boys and Girls clubs,
  Brotherhood Crusade, #YesWeCode, Manual Arts HS, Markham Middle School, Arts+
  Practice Foundation, YMCA and ELACC. URBAN TxT has a history of collaborating
  with each of these organizations, and now we want to bring coding to the kids
  they serve. Every year URBAN TxT receives over 150 applications for our Summer
  Computer Leadership Academy. Most of our applicant pool comes from our
  partners, who help us recruit. Currently we are working with over 25 schools
  all over Los Angeles. 
   
   Three factors that will be critical to the success of our collaboration are:
   1. Organizations allowing us to use their facilities to provide the Minecraft and coding training at their locations. 
   2. Providing an online resources system that will allow the participants to communicate with us remotely when we are not at their location. We have already developed an internal online social media tool for teens to safely communicate with our mentors and staff
   3. A quarterly meeting where all teens participating gather to share the work they are doing. It will be important that we support all collaborators with troubleshooting assistance to meet their technology needs.
