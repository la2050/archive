Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  To implement this project, founder Oscar Menjivar, and our team of over 20
  mentor-coders from URBAN TXT, will bring together Black and Latino youth from
  the areas of South LA, Watts, East LA, and Pico Union to teach them basic and
  advanced skills in computer programming and design. Much of the initial
  training will take place within ‘The Cube’, UrbanTxt’s newly renovated ‘Hacker
  Space’ Headquarters on the outskirts of campus at USC. The students will take
  these skills, and use them to create simulated scale environments of their own
  neighborhoods within the Minecraft video game world, as the students envision,
  and create, what their neighborhoods will look like in the year 2050. Young
  people will work collaboratively within project management groups, to
  construct these virtual LA neighborhoods of the future. Many of the youth who
  participate in our program come from disadvantaged backgrounds. Teens will be
  learning while playing, having fun, connecting across the city and developing
  skills that will help create a diverse tech workforce in Los Angeles. Teens
  who have previously participated in URBAN TXT curriculum will mentor and teach
  new students how to code, and how to reimagine present day low-income
  neighborhoods as new communities of the future. #EnvisionLA is an opportunity
  for young people to create their own utopian worlds, filled with as much hope
  and opportunity as they wish to fill it. Classes for youth participating in
  the project will take place at our HackerSpace and at the locations of
  participating partners. We will train 20 mentors to implement the program and
  1 full staff member, and expect it will take four sessions of coding and
  design classes per week to teach youth the necessary skills. Our equipment
  needs include computers, a server, and Minecraft related software to complete
  the project. We expect to complete the #VisonLA virtual world project by 
   September of 2015.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Our idea will make LA the best place to create today, because we are engaging
  young innovators who come from disadvantaged backgrounds, and have great
  ideas, to make their communities a better place. These young innovators want
  to start creating and sharing their ideas today. The over 150 students we have
  interviewed in the past year are ready to be part of an LA that encourages
  them to create and design new environments, and where they will learn the
  skills of the 21st century. 
   
   Minecraft already serves as a phenomenon of creativity and collaboration within the gaming community. Our #EnvisionLA project only seeks to harness the collective, and often untapped, resources of creativity and collaboration within the disadvantaged neighborhoods of Los Angeles. Where gang rivalries and violence act as detractors and deterrents to living in these neighborhoods, and delivering good-paying jobs to these same communities, our #EnvisionLA project will serve as a reason to bring hope there. Not only because these communities will be transformed through the collaborative efforts of our coding teams rendering new designs of them in the virtual world, but because these teams will have learned the skills necessary for each team member to get that well-paying job- today. It is currently reported that only 10% of our nation’s K-12 schools have computer programming classes http://cbsloc.al/1nJEWfc. In LA’s inner city, this number is closer to 1% 
   
   In 2050, our project will have served as the project that gave young people of color an opportunity to be part of the tech world. Our project will undoubtedly increase the amount of students who are interested in coding and designing. In 2050, LA will be the best place to create because, by then, we will have a more diverse group of people being part of the tech and innovation industry. Today, a 10 year old kid living in Watts who is inspired by our project could easily be the one who creates the next big tech start up in South Los Angeles. The skills they learn through #EnvisionLA will make them part of a workforce that allows Los Angeles to create the best products and businesses possible, and solve LA’s most pressing problems. If we don’t help kids in low- income communities engage with coding and design today, LA will lack creativity and innovation in the future. URBAN TxT, through #EnvisionLA, will help create a future workforce that inspires the culture and vibrancy of an innovative Los Angeles.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Directly, our project will benefit the 400 young people who will participate
  in #EnvisionLA , which will teach them the computer programming skills they
  need to become employable within the programming industry. Indirectly, our
  impact through this project solution has the potential to be much greater.
  Currently, the LAUSD high school student body is 75 percent Latino, 9 percent
  African American, 4 percent Asian, 9 percent White, 3 percent Filipino, and 74
  percent of this cohort is economically disadvantaged ( LA 2050 report, p. 13),
  According to this same report, unemployment rates for African American and
  Latinos are the highest among any ethnic group in Los Angeles. As UrbanTxt
  serves youth through this project, we expect the ratio of participants to be
  approximately 60% Latino and 40% African-American, and we expect for 100% of
  these youth to have employable skills in computer programming by the end of
  this project’s duration. 
   
   
   In Los Angeles County the unemployment rate for African Americans and Latinos is 21 percent and 14 percent, respectively (LA 2050 report, p. 18). This LA County demographic make-up (with a large share of the population being Latino and African American) implies that the region will persistently suffer from elevated rates of unemployment in the future. Based on these factors, the Los Angeles of 2050 will continue to be a region of haves and have-nots. However, the #EnvisionLA project will provide skills to teens that will encourage them to continue creating and designing with the programming skills they learn. If each one of our 400 program participants touched the lives of a mother, father, sister and brother through their contribution to the local/global economy, we fully expect the impact of #EnvisionLA to impact over one thousand lives.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  As of January 2014, UrbanTxt has trained over 60 kids in four computer
  programming languages. Our students have created their own apps, and some have
  even gone on to sell their apps within the Apple App Store. Now we are going
  to share our knowledge of design and code with ten other organizations around
  Los Angeles. We already have partner agreements with ICEF and Alliance Charter
  Schools, and we have discussed the project with Boys and Girls clubs,
  Brotherhood Crusade, #YesWeCode, Manual Arts HS, Markham Middle School, Arts+
  Practice Foundation, YMCA and ELACC. URBAN TxT has a history of collaborating
  with each of these organizations, and now we want to bring coding to the kids
  they serve. Every year URBAN TxT receives over 150 applications for our Summer
  Computer Leadership Academy. Most of our applicant pool comes from our
  partners, who help us recruit. Currently we are working with over 25 schools
  all over Los Angeles. 
   
   Three factors that will be critical to the success of our collaboration are:
   1. Organizations allowing us to use their facilities to provide the Minecraft and coding training at their locations. 
   2. Providing an online resources system that will allow the participants to communicate with us remotely when we are not at their location. We have already developed an internal online social media tool for teens to safely communicate with our mentors and staff
   3. A quarterly meeting where all teens participating gather to share the work they are doing. It will be important that we support all collaborators with troubleshooting assistance to meet their technology needs.

    #EnvisionLA is a year long interactive, collaborative online project which
    harnesses the creative potential within the Minecraft video game platform,
    and asks youth from disadvantaged areas of Watts, East LA, Pico Union, and
    South LA to re-create their current neighborhood within the game. URBAN TXT
    will teach kids ages 10-17 to code and design. They will be empower and help
    us create how the inner city should look like in the year 2050. The Java
    programming language URBAN TXT teaches, will allows kids to modify the
    Minecraft world to create their own designs. Participating youth will
    re-create their neighborhoods as they envision it will exist in the year
    2050, using their imagination, acquired skills, and collaborative efforts.

    Our project is hitting many areas for today and LA2050. As mentioned before
    there are very few Latinos and Blacks in the creative industry. We hope to
    inspire more Latinos and Blacks to become owners of tech startups. We know
    that LA will not survive if we do not trained the disfranchised individuals
    in low income communities. The more we inspired them to code and design, the
    more minority owned firms we will see in the future. We must tapped into the
    assets of low income communities in order for LA to be a vibrant and
    prosperous town in the year 2050. We cant be a prosperous without those who
    have less resources, specially resources in tech and design.

  evaluate: "During our #EnvisionLA program, we will evaluate student experiences through pre and post surveys, focus groups, final product presentations review, informal feedback and evaluation assessing change of mindset (e.g. did you think you would be able to learn to code, did you think you could create your own neighborhood using the skills you learned, etc.). As students progress, URBAN TxT leadership and staff are also in contact with graduates through a private internal social media alumni network in which they are able to share their personal and academic successes with other alumni and current program participants. \r\n1.\t100% Students will learn the fundamentals of computer programming\r\n2.\t100 students will have created meaningful friendships through their online collaboration \r\n3.\tAt least 2 housing projects would have been redesigned using minecraft \r\n"
  two_lessons: "According to the Minecraft homepage, https://minecraft.net/, as of July 26, 2014, over 16,341,000 people have purchased the PC/Mac version of Minecraft. This is a game that today, at this very moment, thrives on its connectivity and shared purpose in achieving a single goal. Every year we receive 150 applications to participate in our computer programming classes. Every year we reject 130 kids. LA2050 can help us serve over 400 students. Not one kid who tell us that they want to learn to code or design will be left behind. In the last two years we have interviewed over 300 kids and they all have said that they want to create by learning to code. Our alumni have confirmed that one of the best way to reach more students is to use Minecraft. Minecraft is being used world wide and is time that Los Angeles uses it to create and nurture the future innovators of our city.\r\nWhile visiting the Jordan down projects in Watts, Jonathan one of the students in Urban Txt ,came out of his building and said, “So, when are we going to teach how to code here in Watts? How can we get younger kids to learn to code? ” And so we started kicking around ideas about what might be the best way to go about doing it, and our teens agreed that Minecraft would be a way to engage new younger kids. \r\n\r\nAfter this first experience, we talked to other young people in the projects, and found out many of them had played the game. We ended up talking to a bunch of kids from these neighborhoods that knew what Minecraft was and knew how to play it, but couldn’t at home because of lack of connectivity and resources. We interviewed over 30 kids and asked them if they thought recreating their neighborhoods with new designs, maybe a few new parks, and new buildings, and making the neighborhood into something fresh using computers sounded interesting? In fact, most of the kids we talked to said that the one thing they would love to know how to do is recreate their communities, change the things they thought we wrong with it. The young people spoke, so we showed up.\r\n"
  achievable_goal: >-
    Implementing this project within the next 12 months is an achievable goal
    for UrbanTxt, partly because we already have a number of strategic
    partnerships with schools and youth organizations in place that will allow
    us access to some of the brightest and most highly motivated students in Los
    Angeles. Our current partnerships include linkages with middle and  high
    schools and the following orgs in Los Angeles: Alliance Charter Schools,
    Boys and Girls Club, ICEF Charter Schools, Manual Arts, Brotherhood
    Crusades, YMCA, ELACC, YesWeCode, Riordan Foundation, California Community
    Foundation, and the St. Vincent of Paul organization. From the pool of young
    people that attend and participate in these organizations, in addition to
    the waiting list of 300 students we have the UrbanTxt program, we will be
    able to assemble our group of 400 EnisionLA students and tomorrow’s
    technology entrepreneurs. Our track record of having trained over 300 young
    men of color how to computer program within the languages of Java,
    Javascript , html and css, proves that we know how to give young people the
    training and programming skills they need, and it proves we know how to
    teach them how to acquire these skills. We are supremely confident that we
    will be able to implement the VisionLA project within the next 12 months. We
    have key curriculum which trains trainers; we need to recruit students from
    list of 300 on our waiting that want to do something like this. Now only do
    we have the support of local organizations but also national organizations
    like Google , Yahoo, and YesWeCode. These organizations are ready to help us
    recruit volunteers and mentors if we need them. They have provided trainers
    for the past year. Bottom line is that over the past two years kids and orgs
    from all over Los angeles have asked us to expand, now we are ready to do
    it. We are ready to do it in a meaningful and unique way. A way that allows
    teens to connect, play, and learn across city borders. Is time to give all
    kids in low income community an opportunity to design and code. 
  major_challenges: "One of the challenges that we see in implementing the VisionLA project will be the fact that the neighborhoods and communities that we create within the game will only be accessible through our own network ‘servers’. A server is a computer system, which is used as a repository of data and various programs that are shared by users within a network. Typical computing serves are database servers, mail servers, and gaming servers- all of which house information which people within a network, or organization, can use. If you don’t have access to the server, you won’t be able to access the game. We will need to develop our own server and allow enough bandwith for everyone to join the network. \r\n\r\nA second challenge we will need to address is the need for enough paid registered licenses so all of our program participants will be able to play- legally. As of February 2014, the creators of Minecraft stated that the game has over 100 million registered users worldwide. However, their website states that only 16 million of these users have paid for their licenses. This means that over 84 million people have downloaded the game illegally and are not practicing the precepts of digital citizenship. Citizenship, is formally defined as “the quality of an individual’s response to membership in a community”, so digitial citizenship would be “the self-monitored habits that sustain and improve the digital communities we enjoy or depend on”, e.g. not stealing content or not bullying others while youth are playing the game. So we intend to make learning model behaviors of digital citizenship part of the process of taking part in VisionLA. By embedding these behaviors as part of the process of teaching programming skills, we will be able to at least lay the foundation of participants in our program learning appropriate behaviors when participating in a digital community.\r\n"
  competition: "There are other orgs using Minecrafte as teaching tool as Davinci High School, but we’re one of a kind using Minecraft to teach kids how to code and reimagine the projects and communities where our kids are coming from. There are definitely teachers all over the world using the game as a teaching tool, emphasizing collaboration, the sharing of resources, turn taking, etc. and these are all elements we would like to teach as well in the reimagining of some pretty tough neighborhoods. A testimonial of the different skills kids can learn, in addition the to programming skills, comes from a teacher who has a blog called, The Minecraft Teacher,\r\n\r\n“From day one, the kids are all playing together in a single world,” explained Levin. “They must share resources, take turns, work together, and, frankly, be nice to each other. This is usually the first time these kids have had to think about these concepts in a game, but it goes hand in hand with the big picture stuff they are learning in their homerooms. It’s amazing to see how many real world issues get played out in the microcosm of the game. Kids have territorial disputes over where they are building. Kids have said mean things to each other within the game or have been destructive with each other’s creations.”  http://onforb.es/1rEqALb \r\n\r\nWhat we’re proposing isn’t simply a game- it’s all of the elements of digital citizenship which can be translated to the real world. We’re not just trying to help create better programmers through EnvisionLA, we’re shaping better habits as people- that’s the beauty of the game, and our instructional technique. We are developing real skills that kids will use in todays and tomorrow economy. \r\n"
  cost: >-
    We believe the cost will be approximately 105,000 dollars. We have already
    raised $10,000 from a pitch competition we had at the UCLA Social Enterprise
    Academy. 
  budget: "Minecraft Coaches - $41,000 Total\r\nWe will provide partner agencies with Minecraft instructors to come and teach one session a week to 10 – 12 children per session (Agencies can have multiple classes. However each class must maintain a small class size to have a more enriching environment to learn.) We will have a mix of outside consultants along with Urban TxT alumni training students this Minecraft. This creates jobs for students in lower income communities while allowing them to engage in their community. The cost for the instructor will be $800 each group of students. This includes payment for a 2-hour class each week for 16 week and mileage reimbursement. \r\n\r\nSoftware - $10,400\r\nWe will provide a Minecraft license to all students participating in the competition. Although many students are currently playing Minecraft, most have downloaded the game illegally and would not be eligible to compete in the competition. We will provide up to 400 licenses to students participating in competition, each license costing $26 dollars.\r\n\r\nServer & Bandwidth $5,000\r\nIn order to allow students to build these massive world, we will need to buy and install servers to ensure users have a fluid experience building world and exploring other participant environments. \r\n\r\nPrize $10,000\r\nPrizes include scholarship funds of $4,000 to be split amongst the winning team along with runner up prizes which include gift cards and Exclusive Minecraft items.\r\n\r\nMarketing $4,000\r\nWe will create high end marketing materials to attract the most disfranchised youth in Los Angeles. URBAN TxT already has a method and we will implemented by marketing in the most creative ways. ( i.e ice cream trucks, shirts, and referal prizes) \r\n\r\nEvaluation Consultant $5,000\r\nEvaluation Consultant will help us to measure the outcomes of this project with the hopes of scaling training to serve more students and making curriculum available to others that would like to implement training.\r\n\r\nProgram Manager $10,000\r\nProgram manager will help to build a curriculum that implements Minecraft in our coding training. Will also oversee instructors and evaluation consultant.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdminitration/ Staff $19,100\r\nWe must have someone who needs to run and manage the overall project. The administrative cost will also include the cost of back office transactions. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Total – $104,500\r\nThe Total cost will be 104,500. We will cover the additional $4,500 with the $10,000 in funding received for winning in the UCLA Social Enterprise Academy\r\n"

      #EnvisionLA is a year long interactive, collaborative online project which
      harnesses the creative potential within the Minecraft video game platform,
      and asks youth from disadvantaged areas of Watts, East LA, Pico Union, and
      South LA to re-create their current neighborhood within the game. URBAN
      TXT will teach kids ages 10-17 to code and design. They will be empower
      and help us create how the inner city should look like in the year 2050.
      The Java programming language URBAN TXT teaches, will allows kids to
      modify the Minecraft world to create their own designs. Participating
      youth will re-create their neighborhoods as they envision it will exist in
      the year 2050, using their imagination, acquired skills, and collaborative
      efforts.

    answer: "To implement this project, founder Oscar Menjivar, and our team of over 20 mentor-coders from URBAN TXT, will bring together Black and Latino youth from the areas of South LA, Watts, East LA, and Pico Union to teach them basic and advanced skills in computer programming and design.  Much of the initial training will take place within ‘The Cube’, UrbanTxt’s newly renovated ‘Hacker Space’ Headquarters on the outskirts of campus at USC. The students will take these skills, and use them to create simulated scale environments of their own neighborhoods within the Minecraft video game world, as the students envision, and create, what their neighborhoods will look like in the year 2050. Young people will work collaboratively within project management groups, to construct these virtual LA neighborhoods of the future. Many of the youth who participate in our program come from disadvantaged backgrounds. Teens will be learning while playing, having fun, connecting across the city and developing skills that will help create a diverse tech workforce in Los Angeles. Teens who have previously participated in URBAN TXT curriculum will mentor and teach new students how to code, and how to reimagine present day low-income neighborhoods as new communities of the future. #EnvisionLA is an opportunity for young people to create their own utopian worlds, filled with as much hope and opportunity as they wish to fill it. Classes for youth participating in the project will take place at our HackerSpace and at the locations of participating partners. We will train 20 mentors to implement the program and 1 full staff member, and expect it will take four sessions of coding and design classes per week to teach youth the necessary skills. Our equipment needs include computers, a server, and Minecraft related software to complete the project. We expect to complete the #VisonLA virtual world project by \r\nSeptember of 2015. \r\n\r\n"

    answer: "Our idea will make LA the best place to create today, because we are engaging young innovators who come from disadvantaged backgrounds, and have great ideas, to make their communities a better place. These young innovators want to start creating and sharing their ideas today. The over 150 students we have interviewed in the past year are ready to be part of an LA that encourages them to create and design new environments, and where they will learn the skills of the 21st century.  \r\n\r\nMinecraft already serves as a phenomenon of creativity and collaboration within the gaming community. Our #EnvisionLA project only seeks to harness the collective, and often untapped, resources of creativity and collaboration within the disadvantaged neighborhoods of Los Angeles. Where gang rivalries and violence act as detractors and deterrents to living in these neighborhoods, and delivering good-paying jobs to these same communities, our #EnvisionLA project will serve as a reason to bring hope there. Not only because these communities will be transformed through the collaborative efforts of our coding teams rendering new designs of them in the virtual world, but because these teams will have learned the skills necessary for each team member to get that well-paying job- today. It is currently reported that only 10% of our nation’s K-12 schools have computer programming classes http://cbsloc.al/1nJEWfc. In LA’s inner city, this number is closer to 1% \r\n\r\nIn 2050, our project will have served as the project that gave young people of color an opportunity to be part of the tech world. Our project will undoubtedly increase the amount of students who are interested in coding and designing. In 2050, LA will be the best place to create because, by then, we will have a more diverse group of people being part of the tech and innovation industry. Today, a 10 year old kid living in Watts who is inspired by our project could easily be the one who creates the next big tech start up in South Los Angeles. The skills they learn through #EnvisionLA will make them part of a workforce that allows Los Angeles to create the best products and businesses possible, and solve LA’s most pressing problems. If we don’t help kids in low- income communities engage with coding and design today, LA will lack creativity and innovation in the future. URBAN TxT, through #EnvisionLA, will help create a future workforce that inspires the culture and vibrancy of an innovative Los Angeles. \r\n"

    answer: "Directly, our project will benefit the 400 young people who will participate in #EnvisionLA , which will teach them the computer programming skills they need to become employable within the programming industry. Indirectly, our impact through this project solution has the potential to be much greater. Currently, the LAUSD high school student body is 75 percent Latino, 9 percent African American, 4 percent Asian,  9 percent White, 3 percent Filipino, and 74 percent of this cohort is economically disadvantaged ( LA 2050 report, p. 13), According to this same report, unemployment rates for African American and Latinos are the highest among any ethnic group in Los Angeles. As UrbanTxt serves youth through this project, we expect the ratio of participants to be approximately 60% Latino and 40% African-American, and we expect for 100% of these youth to have employable skills in computer programming by the end of this project’s duration. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn Los Angeles County the unemployment rate for African Americans and Latinos is 21 percent and 14 percent, respectively (LA 2050 report, p. 18). This LA County demographic make-up (with a large share of the population being Latino and African American) implies that the region will persistently suffer from elevated rates of unemployment in the future. Based on these factors, the Los Angeles of 2050 will continue to be a region of haves and have-nots. However, the #EnvisionLA project will provide skills to teens that will encourage them to continue creating and designing with the programming skills they learn. If each one of our 400 program participants touched the lives of a mother, father, sister and brother through their contribution to the local/global economy, we fully expect the impact of #EnvisionLA to impact over one thousand lives.\r\n"

    answer: "As of January 2014, UrbanTxt has trained over 60 kids in four computer programming languages. Our students have created their own apps, and some have even gone on to sell their apps within the Apple App Store. Now we are going to share our knowledge of design and code with ten other organizations around Los Angeles. We already have partner agreements with ICEF and Alliance Charter Schools, and we have discussed the project with Boys and Girls clubs, Brotherhood Crusade, #YesWeCode, Manual Arts HS, Markham Middle School, Arts+ Practice Foundation, YMCA and ELACC. URBAN TxT has a history of collaborating with each of these organizations, and now we want to bring coding to the kids they serve. Every year URBAN TxT receives over 150 applications for our Summer Computer Leadership Academy. Most of our applicant pool comes from our partners, who help us recruit. Currently we are working with over 25 schools all over Los Angeles. \r\n\r\nThree factors that will be critical to the success of our collaboration are:\r\n1.\tOrganizations allowing us to use their facilities to provide the Minecraft and coding training at their locations. \r\n2.\tProviding an online resources system that will allow the participants to communicate with us remotely when we are not at their location. We have already developed  an internal online social media tool for teens to safely communicate with our mentors and staff\r\n3.\tA quarterly meeting where all teens participating gather to share the work they are doing. It will be important that we support all collaborators with troubleshooting assistance to meet their technology needs. \r\n"

    answer: "According to the Minecraft homepage, https://minecraft.net/, as of July 26, 2014, over 16,341,000 people have purchased the PC/Mac version of Minecraft. This is a game that today, at this very moment, thrives on its connectivity and shared purpose in achieving a single goal. Every year we receive 150 applications to participate in our computer programming classes. Every year we reject 130 kids. LA2050 can help us serve over 400 students. Not one kid who tell us that they want to learn to code or design will be left behind. In the last two years we have interviewed over 300 kids and they all have said that they want to create by learning to code. Our alumni have confirmed that one of the best way to reach more students is to use Minecraft. Minecraft is being used world wide and is time that Los Angeles uses it to create and nurture the future innovators of our city.\r\nWhile visiting the Jordan down projects in Watts, Jonathan one of the students in Urban Txt ,came out of his building and said, “So, when are we going to teach how to code here in Watts? How can we get younger kids to learn to code? ” And so we started kicking around ideas about what might be the best way to go about doing it, and our teens agreed that Minecraft would be a way to engage new younger kids. \r\n\r\nAfter this first experience, we talked to other young people in the projects, and found out many of them had played the game. We ended up talking to a bunch of kids from these neighborhoods that knew what Minecraft was and knew how to play it, but couldn’t at home because of lack of connectivity and resources. We interviewed over 30 kids and asked them if they thought recreating their neighborhoods with new designs, maybe a few new parks, and new buildings, and making the neighborhood into something fresh using computers sounded interesting? In fact, most of the kids we talked to said that the one thing they would love to know how to do is recreate their communities, change the things they thought we wrong with it. The young people spoke, so we showed up.\r\n"
  - name: achievable_goal
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      Implementing this project within the next 12 months is an achievable goal
      for UrbanTxt, partly because we already have a number of strategic
      partnerships with schools and youth organizations in place that will allow
      us access to some of the brightest and most highly motivated students in
      Los Angeles. Our current partnerships include linkages with middle and 
      high schools and the following orgs in Los Angeles: Alliance Charter
      Schools, Boys and Girls Club, ICEF Charter Schools, Manual Arts,
      Brotherhood Crusades, YMCA, ELACC, YesWeCode, Riordan Foundation,
      California Community Foundation, and the St. Vincent of Paul organization.
      From the pool of young people that attend and participate in these
      organizations, in addition to the waiting list of 300 students we have the
      UrbanTxt program, we will be able to assemble our group of 400 EnisionLA
      students and tomorrow’s technology entrepreneurs. Our track record of
      having trained over 300 young men of color how to computer program within
      the languages of Java, Javascript , html and css, proves that we know how
      to give young people the training and programming skills they need, and it
      proves we know how to teach them how to acquire these skills. We are
      supremely confident that we will be able to implement the VisionLA project
      within the next 12 months. We have key curriculum which trains trainers;
      we need to recruit students from list of 300 on our waiting that want to
      do something like this. Now only do we have the support of local
      organizations but also national organizations like Google , Yahoo, and
      YesWeCode. These organizations are ready to help us recruit volunteers and
      mentors if we need them. They have provided trainers for the past year.
      Bottom line is that over the past two years kids and orgs from all over
      Los angeles have asked us to expand, now we are ready to do it. We are
      ready to do it in a meaningful and unique way. A way that allows teens to
      connect, play, and learn across city borders. Is time to give all kids in
      low income community an opportunity to design and code. 
  - name: major_challenges
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "One of the challenges that we see in implementing the VisionLA project will be the fact that the neighborhoods and communities that we create within the game will only be accessible through our own network ‘servers’. A server is a computer system, which is used as a repository of data and various programs that are shared by users within a network. Typical computing serves are database servers, mail servers, and gaming servers- all of which house information which people within a network, or organization, can use. If you don’t have access to the server, you won’t be able to access the game. We will need to develop our own server and allow enough bandwith for everyone to join the network. \r\n\r\nA second challenge we will need to address is the need for enough paid registered licenses so all of our program participants will be able to play- legally. As of February 2014, the creators of Minecraft stated that the game has over 100 million registered users worldwide. However, their website states that only 16 million of these users have paid for their licenses. This means that over 84 million people have downloaded the game illegally and are not practicing the precepts of digital citizenship. Citizenship, is formally defined as “the quality of an individual’s response to membership in a community”, so digitial citizenship would be “the self-monitored habits that sustain and improve the digital communities we enjoy or depend on”, e.g. not stealing content or not bullying others while youth are playing the game. So we intend to make learning model behaviors of digital citizenship part of the process of taking part in VisionLA. By embedding these behaviors as part of the process of teaching programming skills, we will be able to at least lay the foundation of participants in our program learning appropriate behaviors when participating in a digital community.\r\n"

    answer: "There are other orgs using Minecrafte as teaching tool as Davinci High School, but we’re one of a kind using Minecraft to teach kids how to code and reimagine the projects and communities where our kids are coming from. There are definitely teachers all over the world using the game as a teaching tool, emphasizing collaboration, the sharing of resources, turn taking, etc. and these are all elements we would like to teach as well in the reimagining of some pretty tough neighborhoods. A testimonial of the different skills kids can learn, in addition the to programming skills, comes from a teacher who has a blog called, The Minecraft Teacher,\r\n\r\n“From day one, the kids are all playing together in a single world,” explained Levin. “They must share resources, take turns, work together, and, frankly, be nice to each other. This is usually the first time these kids have had to think about these concepts in a game, but it goes hand in hand with the big picture stuff they are learning in their homerooms. It’s amazing to see how many real world issues get played out in the microcosm of the game. Kids have territorial disputes over where they are building. Kids have said mean things to each other within the game or have been destructive with each other’s creations.”  http://onforb.es/1rEqALb \r\n\r\nWhat we’re proposing isn’t simply a game- it’s all of the elements of digital citizenship which can be translated to the real world. We’re not just trying to help create better programmers through EnvisionLA, we’re shaping better habits as people- that’s the beauty of the game, and our instructional technique. We are developing real skills that kids will use in todays and tomorrow economy. \r\n"
