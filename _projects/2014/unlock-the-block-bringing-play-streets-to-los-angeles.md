  ‘Children must play, and children, if they live in the cities, must play in
  the streets.’ -1914 New York Times. For generations, residential streets
  served as informal play spaces for children. In recent decades, streets have
  become increasingly dominated by automobiles with little accommodation for
  other needs, even though many neighborhoods continue to lack safe, accessible
  spaces to play. More recently, research has revealed the key role of play in
  physical health and intellectual and social development. Cities like San
  Francisco and New York have responded to these issues by launching “play
  streets” programs: temporary, car-free street spaces where residents can play.
   
   In Los Angeles city our largest available public space is the 6,500 mile street network that connects our communities. Over the last year the City has recognized the value of re-purposing streets into multimodal space through efforts like the Great Streets Initiative, People St, and Ciclavia.
   
   We propose to build on the foundation of those programs to create a uniquely LA version of play streets called “Unlock the Block;” to do this we will enlist the help of our play “experts,” the children and families of LA. Over the next 12 months we will lay the foundation for a full-scale Unlock the Block (UtB) program by:
   1. Conducting outreach and workshops in up to 5 park-poor LA communities to understand how, where, and when residents want to play and help them envision up to 5 unique Unlock the Block demonstration events.
   2. Creating a Resource Guide for implementing a UtB event. Contents will include information on permit processes, logistics, programming and publicity, and a “Kit-of-Parts”- a box to be lent-out for any UtB event containing simple objects and activities that activate play and learning.
   3. Implementing up to 5 UtB demonstration events in partnership with communities. Each event will reflect the unique wishes of the host community but examples of programming include art, dance, gaming, martial arts/yoga. Events will be limited to residential streets selected for minimal impact on vehicular traffic congestion.
   4. Developing a proposal of policy and program recommendations to implement a citywide UtB program. This proposal will detail the need and feasibility of a play street program like UtB in LA and recommend a publicly-accessible, streamlined program housed by an appropriate city agency, to create sustainable access to temporary open space for all LA residents.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  The beauty of Unlock the Block is its simplicity and agility. Within months of
  starting, we can bring safe and dynamic play to the people and places in LA
  with the highest need and demand. Within years, we can transform our
  streets—and the perception of our streets—into safe and sustainable spaces for
  community play. By 2050, it is feasible that everyone who wants to play can
  play regularly, regardless of the availability of traditional park resources
  in their neighborhood. 
   
   UtB increases access to play for all LA residents. While UtB starts in the City of LA, our ultimate goal is to replicate our model across LA County. Communities who currently lack adequate recreational spaces and programming will be able to creatively unlock new ways to play. UtB can be implemented by anyone, is low-cost, and can immediately increase access to safe and sustainable recreational opportunities across LA. UtB is not designed as a substitute for permanent parks; rather Unlock the Block builds on other efforts to increase park access by bringing open space to the front door of LA residents.
   
   UtB repurposes our streets to enable play. In the dense, urban environment of LA, a neighborhood street may be the only public space within walking distance for children and families. While streets are typically designed and used for vehicles only, there is great potential in reclaiming and sharing this space for other needs. UtB addresses one of these needs: play.
   
   UtB redefines play by letting residents determine what it means to play. Through direct community engagement we will simply ask residents of all ages how, when, and why they want to play and from their answers create new and innovative techniques for intergenerational play for all Angelenos. UtB will remind people of the infinite ways to engage with our community without the use of video games or social media and without traversing the city.
   
   UtB builds safer neighborhoods by putting more “eyes on the street” and increases social cohesion through promoting shared use of public space. Beyond the event itself, there is educational value in community members re-envisioning how their streets can be used. Play streets have the potential to increase awareness of the health and safety benefits of active transportation, like walking and bicycling. Furthering support for multimodal and safer streets through UtB, may also lead to other versions of play such as walking/jogging groups or bicycle clubs.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Unlock the Block (UTB) will benefit all communities in LA. But we will begin
  by addressing the needs of LA’s underserved neighborhoods. We will prioritize
  parts of the city where there is a shortage of open space, or parks, and areas
  that fall outside the boundaries of other community investment programs (like
  Promise Neighborhoods, Building Healthy Communities, or gang intervention
  programs), so that communities who have been left out of the discussion on
  where and how play takes place, will have the opportunity to contribute their
  ideas and make play happen in their streets, on their terms, with or without
  the presence of a park. We anticipate that, in the pilot phase Unlock the
  Block events will target neighborhoods in each of LA’s main geographic
  regions. In success, the city program is easily adopted or scaled to cover all
  of LA County.
   
   UtB will benefit all residents of LA. Play is important no matter what stage you are in in life and UtB aims to create safe and sustainable spaces for all ages and abilities. Play stimulates intellectual and physical development in youth, but today’s youth often do not have sufficient opportunities for play (for example, LAUSD is being sued for providing insufficient physical education classes and many parents do not let their kids play outside because it is not safe). For adults, play promotes better health through physical activity and reduced stress. All residents will also benefit from the increased social connectivity and cooperation that results from playing together.
   
   UtB will not only benefit a community’s residents; other stakeholders, including business owners, school staff, church members, and community organizations, will be empowered and better-connected through UtB efforts. All groups will work together to create regular, on-going, age- and culturally- appropriate programs that benefit their neighborhood socially, physically, and economically. While we expect each demonstration event to be unique to its neighborhood, the lessons learned during the process will be used to guide other neighborhoods in creating their own UtB event and to determine the changes needed to help pilot neighborhoods sustain or adapt their UtB programs.
   
   Our project will also benefit the City’s governing forces by building positive, working relationships with residents that can spill-over into other Government-led change initiatives.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Unlock the Block brings together a number of Los Angeles-based organizations
  currently working to improve play, health, environment, and economy for our
  under-resourced communities. Kounkuey Design Initiative’s (KDI) confirmed
  partners for this project include Community Health Councils (CHC) and Jubilee
  Consortium. Together our organizations bring experience and expertise in three
  areas critical to the success of our project:
   
   1. Knowledge in street design and experience activating non-traditional spaces for public use through a participatory design practice;
   2. Experience in advocating and creating policy change, and possession of relationships with policy makers;
   3. Experience in creating intergenerational programming and play throughout Los Angeles.
   
   KDI has been a member of the Coalition for an Active South Los Angeles (CASLA), led by CHC, for 2 years. Since late 2013, KDI and CHC have been working together (with 4 other organizations) on Free Lots Angeles, an initiative in South Los Angeles to transform vacant lots into active and productive community spaces. Over the past 2 years Jubilee Consortium and CHC, have worked together on a number of projects in Los Angeles, including a federally-funded chronic disease prevention effort.
   
   CHC brings to the project a strong expertise in policy work and community engagement. They have a wide presence and reputation among residents in the communities where we would like to pilot UtB, and also have relationships with City Council offices that can provide political support for making play accessible in park-poor communities. For more than two decades, CHC has been at the forefront of advocacy to eliminate health disparities by expanding healthcare coverage, increasing access to quality healthcare, and improving the built environment for under-resourced communities.
   
   Jubilee Consortium brings an expertise in designing active programming for all ages in non-traditional venues throughout Los Angeles. Jubilee Consortium has offered low-cost physical fitness and nutrition programs in underserved neighborhoods since its founding in 2001. For the past two years, Jubilee Consortium has trained community members to become Health Advocates for their communities as part of the United for Health collaborative led by CHC. The Jubilee Consortium creates healthy and just neighborhoods through enrichment opportunities and leadership programs centered on healthy lifestyles.
