  more_detail: "If Los Angeles is to become a Smart City by 2050, the community needs to take an active role in the transition. Our local government has adopted an open-data initiative for the first time in history, but without logical, efficient applications and skilled web developers the data is useless. Apps4LA seeks to bring a solution to this imbalance while creating a civic playbook for other cities to adopt.\r\n\r\nApps4LA is a mashup of a hackathon and a startup accelerator program. The event takes place in three stages: a one-day Ideafest, a 3 month mobile application build, and a media-driven launch party.\r\n\r\nThe funded apps will be FREE for public download and maintained for a year on the Apps4LA website."
  implement: "Beginning with a one-day Ideafest on a local university campus, industry experts, city department officials, and web developers will compete in teams to develop pitch decks of mobile apps that are civic minded, sustainable, and viable.  The Econony, Education, Connectivity, Arts/Culture, and Health will be the areas of focus. At the end of the day, the best 3-5 apps will be selected by a board of technical advisors and moved into the accelerator program.\r\n\r\nA contracted mobile app development agency will build the applications over the next 3-4 months with the assistance of paid interns from the local university computer science departments. Weekly progress updates with technical advisors will take place to ensure the development teams maintain the production schedule.\r\n\r\nWhen the apps are ready for use, a high-profile launch party with Ideafest participants, guests, dignitaries and press will take place to celebrate the project completion.\r\n\r\nThe success of Apps4LA will be accomplished with the help of the community. Beginning with the formation of an operations team, we will conduct research to identify industry experts that have a deep understanding of the flaws that exist within the infrastructure of our city. This includes private businesses, non-profit organizations, academic institutions, and city departments.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the event, procurement of venue, selection of participants, and pre-event marketing will be conducted early in the process.  The Ideafest will be coordinated and managed by the Apps4LA team with the help of volunteers. A preselected advisory board will determine the 3-5 mobile apps that have the best viability and will oversee their development. We will contract Dogtown Media, an app development creative agency to construct and manage the projects through beta.\r\n\r\nWhen the mobile apps are ready for distribution, the operations team will host a launch party for the Ideafest participants, city officials, dignitaries, media, and invited guests. \r\n\r\nAll apps will be FREE to the public and available for download on both iOS and Android devices. Apps4LA will continue to market the apps to the public, and manage the backend maintenance.\r\n"
  impact_create: "Los Angeles has a sluggish economy due to the loss of several major industries. Developing a strong tech industry will enable our city to thrive in the future. Each app requires a team of mobile app developers, marketers, administrators, interns and advisors that will stimulate new business opportunities. According to a recent report from the Economist, “for every one tech job that is created, four more will follow.”\r\n\r\nAs the years progress, Los Angeles county will gain a collection of practical mobile apps that address the needs of its residents while becoming a leader in digital connectivity.\r\n"
  who_benefit: "Apps4LA will CREATE:\r\n\r\n1.) jobs for local mobile app developers and marketing professionals\r\n2.) paid internships for local college students\r\n3.) useful civic apps for the residents of Los Angeles county. "
  partners_collaboration: "We have connected with and will be working with the following people and organizations...\r\n\r\nCity of LA, CIO, Peter Marx- 1st Innovations Officer for the city. Previously worked with Qualcomm and Mattel. Has great insights into digital applications and the inner workings of the city. \r\n\r\nCity of LA, Controller, Ron Galperin- Spearheading the LA open-data initiative and connecting Apps4LA with city department officials. \r\n\r\nIBM “smart city” architect, Mark Dixon- A leader in the digitizing of cities, Mark will help structure the program and serve as a Tech Advisor. \r\n\r\nDevelopment Services Director of Palo Alto, Peter Pirnejad- Currently getting his doctorate in civic app development from USC, Price School of Public Policy. He is organizing a government/academic summit to coincide with Apps4LA.\r\n\r\nLos Angeles User Experience Group-  Crystal Ehrlich, UX Consultant, will assist with event management, publicity, and volunteers from the LAUX group (over 3000 members).\r\n\r\nTechJobsLA- Noel Saw, software developer, organizes a bi-annual Tech Job Fair.\r\n   \r\nLAX Chamber of Commerce- Rachel Horning, will connect Apps4LA with local business owners for sponsorships and participation.\r\n\r\nInternships.com, Yair Riemer- Sponsor and supplier of quality interns.\r\n\r\nDogtown Media- Marc Fischer, CEO, local mobile app developer and professor at Santa Monica college will be contracted to build the selected app projects.\r\n"

  evaluate: "Mobile apps developed by Apps4LA must meet the following criteria to be considered for development.\r\n\r\n1.) sustainable \r\n2.) scalable \r\n3.) appeal to the masses\r\n\r\nSuccess of the event would be determined by level of participation, efficiency of the developed digital products, and the number of downloads from the community.\r\n"
  two_lessons: "As a co-organizer of Code for LA and a participant in #LA2050Listens Community Engagement at Hub LA I’ve learned that...\r\n\r\n1.) everyone has ideas to make our city a better place\r\n2.) great ideas are not being executed because of lack of funding and access to developer talent."
  achievable_goal: >-
    We have enlisted our tech advisors, officials from the city, and app
    developer talent; and have corporate sponsorship interest from Silicon
    Beach, IBM Foundation, HP, and several independent VCs to help launch this
    program.
  major_challenges: "Barrier 1: Apps4LA is dependent upon seed funding. \r\nSolution: The $100,000.00 grant from LA2050 will provide a catalyst for corporate sponsors to invest in the life of civic apps.\r\n\r\nBarrier 2: Meeting mobile app development deadlines.\r\nSolution: Successful web development is contingent upon setting timelines and maintaining a fluid workflow. To achieve a digital product that is ready for distribution, technical advisors must be present from concept to completion.\r\n\r\nSelecting apps that are less complicated from the beginning, will produce a product within the given timeline and budgetary constraints. In other words, parameters for viable apps will be made at the selection process by the tech advisory board. "
  competition: "Hackathons have become commonplace these days, however, they are missing the bridge that connects a viable idea with the necessary funding and support to take their ideas from concept to distribution. Building any product in an unrealistic time frame (often 24- 48 hours) jeopardizes the quality of the end product. Great ideas have won prize money, but seldom do these ideas make it past the hackathon.\r\n\r\nCivic mobile apps need time to be developed thoroughly and marketed properly just like any other commercial product. Apps4LA flushes the ideas from community experts and unites those ideas with the funding and technical expertise of mobile web developers and professional marketers.   \r\n"
  cost: "The $100,000 grant is budgeted for the operations and management of the programs events. \r\n\r\nPrivate investment will be secured for the accelerator portion. Each app will require a minimum of $20,000.00 per month for 3 months in addition to marketing expenses.  "
  budget: "Operations team-    $  50,000.00\r\nMarketing-                     15,000.00\r\nIdeafest-                         15,000.00\r\nLaunch party-               20,000.00\r\n\r\nTotal Seed Capital- $100,000.00"
