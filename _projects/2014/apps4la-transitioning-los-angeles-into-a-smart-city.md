Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Beginning with a one-day Ideafest on a local university campus, industry
  experts, city department officials, and web developers will compete in teams
  to develop pitch decks of mobile apps that are civic minded, sustainable, and
  viable. The Econony, Education, Connectivity, Arts/Culture, and Health will be
  the areas of focus. At the end of the day, the best 3-5 apps will be selected
  by a board of technical advisors and moved into the accelerator program.
   
   A contracted mobile app development agency will build the applications over the next 3-4 months with the assistance of paid interns from the local university computer science departments. Weekly progress updates with technical advisors will take place to ensure the development teams maintain the production schedule.
   
   When the apps are ready for use, a high-profile launch party with Ideafest participants, guests, dignitaries and press will take place to celebrate the project completion.
   
   The success of Apps4LA will be accomplished with the help of the community. Beginning with the formation of an operations team, we will conduct research to identify industry experts that have a deep understanding of the flaws that exist within the infrastructure of our city. This includes private businesses, non-profit organizations, academic institutions, and city departments.
   
   The structure of the event, procurement of venue, selection of participants, and pre-event marketing will be conducted early in the process. The Ideafest will be coordinated and managed by the Apps4LA team with the help of volunteers. A preselected advisory board will determine the 3-5 mobile apps that have the best viability and will oversee their development. We will contract Dogtown Media, an app development creative agency to construct and manage the projects through beta.
   
   When the mobile apps are ready for distribution, the operations team will host a launch party for the Ideafest participants, city officials, dignitaries, media, and invited guests. 
   
   All apps will be FREE to the public and available for download on both iOS and Android devices. Apps4LA will continue to market the apps to the public, and manage the backend maintenance.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Los Angeles has a sluggish economy due to the loss of several major
  industries. Developing a strong tech industry will enable our city to thrive
  in the future. Each app requires a team of mobile app developers, marketers,
  administrators, interns and advisors that will stimulate new business
  opportunities. According to a recent report from the Economist, “for every one
  tech job that is created, four more will follow.”
   
   As the years progress, Los Angeles county will gain a collection of practical mobile apps that address the needs of its residents while becoming a leader in digital connectivity.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: |-
  Apps4LA will CREATE:
   
   1.) jobs for local mobile app developers and marketing professionals
   2.) paid internships for local college students
   3.) useful civic apps for the residents of Los Angeles county.
