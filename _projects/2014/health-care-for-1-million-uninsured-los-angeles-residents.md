  This project will create a framework to implement programs that address public
  health, connectivity, and maximizing local health infrastructure. The
  logistics will operate as two symbiotic initiatives: the “community hub” and
  the transportation network. Technology will also play a vital role. Mobile
  applications can facilitate the efficiency and integration of our programs.
  Using this technology, a user could purchase fresh produce located at the hub,
  track and easily access the shuttle service, and communicate with health
  service centers. This mobile app will also help to collect data, and create
  metrics of analysis.
   
   • Community Hub: 
   We envision an innovative entity that consolidates public services into a singular site. This hub will contain health services, a daily produce market (recently funded by USC), and a central transportation stop—the hub will be a point of ingress to LACUSC Med Center and throughout the community. Given the lack of access to fresh produce, we have already partnered with USC to create a weekly farmers’ market and daily produce market. Complimented by preventative health services, providing a consistent source of fresh produce will help a community that is vulnerable to nutritional diseases. As part of our comprehensive health program and effort to bring USC Med Center and Los Angeles County Hospital further into the community, we are partnering with the medical school to bring preventative health services administered by USC. Located on the same site, these services could include mobile testing units, health information kiosk, and an active residency/internship program.
   
   • Transportation Network: Lincoln Heights has internal gaps in transportation infrastructure, and barriers exist within the built environment that inhibit movement, access to public services, and connections to the larger network. To transcend these impediments and create a more robust system, we are creating a service network that connects the community hub, Metro Gold Line, the LACUSC campuses, and other underserved areas such as the Ramona Gardens Housing Projects. The community hub, therefore, becomes an emanation point to access supportive services, hard to access medical services, and the larger public transportation network. This program can be implemented quickly through local operators and become phased into MTA service.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  In LA, mobility is an issue of equity. The size of LA has allowed a great
  diversity of people to live within its sprawl. The unsustainable compromise,
  however, is that this lack of density creates areas without adequate support.
  The result is that entire neighborhoods, often segregated by their
  socio-economic circumstance, are bereft of services and therefore vulnerable
  to poor health. In LA, access to transportation can define the health of a
  community. While the city is making improvements to the subway system,
  underserved neighborhoods need better pathways to connect to services and the
  larger transportation network. The LHHI model is designed to create access to
  health services, supported by community-based transportation and the
  concentration of public services. The Lincoln Heights’ demographics and risk
  factors are similar to many areas throughout East and South LA; the impact of
  creating independent nodes that support health would be profound. 
   
   This engagement reflects the disparate nature of the city itself. Within the sprawl, thriving diverse communities are isolated from one another. A healthier LA will be one that can move throughout the city with ease, within the neighborhood and beyond. If replicated, the underserved communities of Los Angeles will create nodal networks that overcome the disparities of access to health and healthy environments. Additionally, these nodes would generate investment and development, bending the built environment to service its most vulnerable residents. 
   
   Major health institutions will have a model for community engagement and accessibility that reflects the comprehensive care model mandated by the new Affordable Care Act. To wit, health care providers must institute preventative mechanisms to offset the unsustainable cost curve of treating chronic and endemic diseases prevalent in underserved communities. According to the American Public Health Association, 7 in 10 deaths in the US are related to chronic conditions such as obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease, which are often preventable. Shockingly, 75% of our health care dollars are spent on treating such diseases while only 3% are spent on prevention. 
   
   LHHI will target the nearly 40,000 residents in the neighborhood, supporting the population before the individual is affected. The project is designed to be replicated in similar conditions throughout the city.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The LHHI will represent a consortium of care providers, business leaders, and
  community partners that will drive holistic, community-based strategies for
  achieving a healthy, equitable, and sustainable LH. The initiative combines
  the best practices of an accountable care organization with a neighborhood
  improvement district to address simultaneously public health disparities and
  connectivity concerns. Its mission is informed by the alarming disconnect
  between the economic and spatial dominance of the LACUSC Med Center and the
  public health vulnerability of the community.
   In response to data describing the current condition in Lincoln Heights, it is apparent that a holistic development strategy would benefit the majority of the community. 
   
   48% - High School Graduation Rate
   46.2% - Experience Housing Burden
   $29.825 – Median Household Income
   65.8% - Federal Poverty Level
   
   Cross referencing the social determinants of health with the LH ethnographic data, the Latino and Asian/Pacific Islander populations are severely at-risk. The Latino population is at risk for metabolic, nutritional, and cardiovascular disease, while chronic hepatitis B and C are prevalent in Asian/Pacific Islander populations. Both are precursors for increased incidence of liver cancer. Untreated, these conditions can have serious health effects throughout a population. This project, however, is meant to reach beyond access to direct medical services and address the larger environment. The social determinants of health affect those in the population who are not necessarily sick, but do not have the resources to support healthy living and become vulnerable. These determinants are being increasingly recognized as interconnected. 
   
   Former Secretary of HUD, Shaun Donovan articulated this when describing new metrics for measuring housing affordability as factors of transportation costs, noting that for most families, transportation is their second-highest monthly expense after housing. This project will benefit the nearly 20,000 people who experience housing burden in LH who may not have the available resources to address health and transportation. Engaging quality of care on this scale will initiate a redistribution of resources that will affect other social determinants of health.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Citymart: is a tech company based in Europe that generates and disseminates
  “smartcity” solutions to governments and developers. We will contract with
  this forward thinking group to develop and license the mobile applications
  used our transportation and service networks. 
   
   LA PREP, LA KITCHEN: LA PREP will house incubator and training kitchens for local entrepreneurs and non-profits dedicated to social enterprise and culinary programs. These entities are confirmed partners and collaborators on our farmers’ market grant.
   
   Diabetes and Obesity Research Institute: DORI will provide medical and research expertise and design and administer the health metrics to measure success. DORI is located in Lincoln Heights and is familiar with the area, demographics, and health risks.
   
   USC Violence Intervention and Prevention Clinic: An early supporter of our initiative, Dr. Astrid Heger and the VIP work to create healthy environments and pathways to supportive services. Dr. Heger has acted as a consultant and facilitator within USC for the LHHI.
   
   UCLA-USC CENTER FOR POPULATION HEALTH AND HEALTH DISPARITIES: Like the DORI, this center is essential to facilitating and providing the best support for the public health of this population. We will collaborate with them to generate and analyze data, commission studies, and consult on strategy.
   
   EL ARCA: Provides essential services to the developmentally disabled population of Greater LA. EL ARCA operates a bus fleet to transport their clients throughout the city, which we may contract for our transportation network. We have worked closely with this group on the farmers’ market grant. 
   
   Clinica Romero: Another important community health center, as they conduct outreach to the Ramona Gardens Housing Project. We hope to learn from their experience and include them in the connectivity network.
   
   Arroyo Vista Family Health Center: Their services and presence will help to establish a wellness district along the Broadway corridor.
   
   LACUSC Med Center: The objectives of the LHHI, align with LACUSC strategic interests as it seeks to minimize costs and improve community relations.
   
   CITY OF LA: Aligns with many of the public health, transportations, and economic development strategies pursued by various city agencies. By pooling the resources of the city and health centers, the LHHI can promote the area as an ideal location for health targeted industry clusters and health infrastructure.

    A healthy community means health care for all.  Despite the Affordable Care
    Act’s progress in expanding health coverage, an estimated 1 million people
    in LA remain uninsured.  They include undocumented residents (≈40%);
    families caught in the family “glitch,” that makes family coverage
    unaffordable for low wage workers (≈30%-40%); and individuals eligible for
    but not enrolled in Medi-Cal or Covered CA (≈20%-30%).  Western Center will
    work with health care stakeholders to repair broken systems and amend
    policies and procedures to ensure that L.A. residents access the best health
    services available to them.   
  implement: "Western Center will help the County of Los Angeles and the State of California develop and implement specific and sweeping policy solutions to ensure health care access for the remaining uninsured. \r\n\r\nFor nearly five decades, Western Center has successfully blended effective policy advocacy and strategic impact litigation to achieve major system-wide victories for poor Californians.  With offices in Los Angeles, Sacramento and Oakland, we are able to work with state and local governments and stakeholders throughout the state to achieve policy changes on behalf of millions of poor families and individuals.\r\n\r\nTo address the eligible but unenrolled, we will engage in a collaborative process to create pathways that make it easier for LA residents to enroll in coverage.  We will conduct detailed program analysis of Medi-Cal and Covered CA; identify procedural enrollment obstacles and inefficiencies; review enabling regulations, All County Welfare Directors Letters, notices to consumers, website designs, training materials and marketing materials; deliver detailed recommendations to policymakers and advocate for their adoption.  Beyond internal systems, we will work with stakeholders who are developing media savvy messaging aimed at persuading “young invincibles” to enroll in affordable health care programs . \r\n\r\nWe will engage in local, state and national advocacy to address and resolve the family glitch issue.  The most likely “fix” involves a reasonable and simple change in the definition of affordability within the Affordable Care Act to permit family members who can’t obtain affordable employer sponsored insurance coverage to access subsidies in the Exchange (Covered CA). \r\n\r\nWe will educate policymakers about the remaining uninsured, including undocumented people.  We will develop helpful tips informing advocates and consumers of how to maximize underutilized resources for the remaining uninsured including county indigent care mandates under Section 17000 of the CA Welfare & Institutions the Ability to Pay program, Healthy Way LA Unmatched, Medi-Cal for DACA eligible youth, the Kaiser Permanente Child Health Program, selected Medi-Cal services, community health clinics and emergency rooms, and the Hospital Fair Pricing Act.  We will simultaneously seek a system-wide solution to ensure coverage for all Angelenos, regardless of immigration status."
  impact_live: "Healthy communities offer quality, affordable and available health care to all of its residents.   Families and individuals can take advantage of preventative and primary care, rather than relying on costly emergency rooms.  People have health insurance and patients don’t “fall through the cracks.\" The entire community is broadly committed to expanding access and improving the quality of health care services and systems.\r\n\r\nQuite simply, Los Angeles falls short.  The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which ranks counties within states by the quality of the clinical care available to residents reported that in 2014 Los Angeles ranked 49th among  California’s 58 counties.  The Foundation cites access to care as one of the principal pathways to improve health outcomes.  \r\n\r\nBy helping the state and county expand health care access, Western Center will have a direct positive effect on 1 million people in Los Angeles and simultaneously improve the health of the community at large.\r\n\r\nExpanding coverage and access makes also sound financial sense.  The UCLA Center for Health Policy Research notes in their May 2014 study, A Little Investment Goes a Long Way: Modest Cost to Expand Preventive and Routine Health Services to All Low-Income Californians, that expanding coverage to those who are uninsured would cost about 2% of the state’s Medi-Cal spending and would be substantially offset by increased sales tax revenue and reduced county spending.\r\n\r\nThe expansion of health care to all Los Angeles residents will not simply help people today but will establish the programs and systems that will be able to deliver high quality health care services to our community for years to come. \r\n"
  who_benefit: "The project will directly benefit the 1 million people who do not currently have health care coverage.  For these families and individuals, it will improve their health; limit preventable, early deaths; and reduce financial and emotional stress.  As noted above they include:\r\n\r\n1.  Undocumented residents (≈40%) who are not eligible for coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\r\n2.  Families caught in the family “glitch,” that makes family coverage unaffordable for low wage workers (≈30%-40%).  This means families with one or both parents working at low paid jobs and receiving individual, but not family health insurance through their employment.  The current Affordable Care Act regulations provide that even if the uncovered spouse and children are financially eligible for ACA insurance and subsidies, they may not take advantage of that opportunity.  Their only choice is to pay for prohibitively expensive family coverage through the employed parent’s work.\r\n3.  Individuals eligible for but not enrolled in Medi-Cal or Covered CA (≈20%-30%).  These people fall into two sub-categories: those who are eligible for free care via Medi-Cal or subsidized care through Covered CA and those who simply refuse to purchase health insurance, often believing that they don’t need it.  The latter group has been dubbed “the young invincibles”, young healthy people who don’t believe they will get sick or need medical care.\r\n\r\nThe project will also benefit the broader community.  It will minimize uncompensated care; reduce reliance on overstretched emergency rooms, increase the health care system delivery capacity;  strengthen the local economy; and improve public health.\r\n"
  partners_collaboration: "Western Center’s partnerships with California’s 95 legal aid organizations, including 20 in Los Angeles, are well known.  We deliver in-depth legal support, including technical assistance by email and phone, on-site trainings, conferences, webinars, publications and litigation support to 700 legal aid attorneys in the state. \r\n\r\nEqually important are our longstanding, working partnerships with virtually every significant policy organization working on health care issues.  This includes organizations such as Health Access, Consumers Union, California Pan-Ethnic Health Network, California Immigrant Policy Center, Insure the Uninsured, Tenants Together, Los Angeles Community Action Network, and CA Partnership.   Our work is recognized and supported by the California Endowment, the California Wellness Foundation and other philanthropic organizations dedicated to improving the health of Californians.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we maintain strong relationships with local, state and federal public sector stakeholders, including Covered California; the California Departments of Health Care Services, Managed Health Care, Housing and Community Development, and Social Services; County Welfare Directors Association, California State Association of Counties along with legislators and legislative staff.  We are a unique highly effective voice in Sacramento representing the health care needs of low-income Californians, and collaboration is part of the fabric of our work.\r\n\r\nThree factors critical to Western Center's collaborative success are:\r\n1)  This is a winnable but immensely complicated project with many moving parts.\r\n2)  There are distinct yet intertwined roles for each of the partners that must be appropriately woven together.\r\n3)  The partners will need to maintain a nimble and flexible strategy that fluidly adjusts to shifting policy currents.\r\n"

Western Center will accomplish this by vastly expanding health care access, health insurance enrollment, services for people with mental illness and the overall system-wide capacity to deliver health care services in Los Angeles.\r\n"

  evaluate: "The project will establish both interim and final goals.  Interim goals may include items such as increased media outreach to eligible but unenrolled individuals; changes in the application that streamline and ease the process; translation of application and related materials into new, needed languages; removal of bureaucratic barriers to application and enrollment; expansion of the health care delivery system; and changes in regulations and policies that prevent access to health care services. Final goals are described below and include both quantitative and qualitative measures.  The evaluation will be conducted by attorneys, who will assess on a monthly basis the progress made towards both incremental and final goals.  They will utilize state and county data, documents and reports; assessments by collaborative partners and other stakeholders; and reports from potential beneficiaries of the project. \r\n\r\nQuantitatively, Western Center will measure:\r\n1.  The number of undocumented people who obtain health care;\r\n2.  The number of new enrollees among those eligible but not presently enrolled in Medi-Cal or Covered CA;\r\n3.  Increased coverage flowing from changes in regulations that eliminate or mitigate the negative impacts of the kid/family glitch\r\n\r\nQualitatively, we will look at the lives of our clients -- are they better off today than yesterday? We will hear the stories from those who benefit from the policy changes we secure."
  two_lessons: "1.  SUCCESS: Solutions can be crafted to solve complex, system wide challenges.  For 47 years, Western Center has led the charge for policy change on behalf of poor Californians.  In 1971, we litigated Serrano v. Priest, which established the rule that school finance systems can’t discriminate against children from low income communities.  In 1985, we eliminated mandatory county “poor houses”.  In 1999, we established that the county must provide last resort medical care to those who can’t afford it.  In 2004, we kept Rancho Los Amigos Hospital open, preserving residential services for thousands of severely disabled people.  In 2012, we helped the state enroll over 500,000 people in the Low Income Health Program.  We have a history of success. \r\n\r\n2.  PERSEVERANCE: Policy problem solving is not a “one shot” affair.  Western Center tackles big problems that often require strategic, staged solutions.  There is no “magic wand” to change the way complicated public and private systems work.  Policy change is often incremental, building upon past victories to construct new wins.  Whether its civil rights, gay rights, civil liberties or expanding health care, the path to victory has been and is often twisting and indirect.  Western Center understands that campaigns take time.  The proposed project stands on the shoulders of our historic health care work that in 2014 helped millions of people in California obtain health coverage for the first time.\r\n"
  achievable_goal: "There is a broad and deep coalition of likely and unlikely allies who support the continued expansion of health care reform in California, including elected officials, government health departments, the medical community, patient advocates and residents.  Each group of stakeholders has much to gain from the provision of health care to an additional 1 million people in Los Angeles.  Some stand to benefit financially while others simply need quality health care.  All benefit from the overarching community advantages of expanded access to health care.\r\n\r\nGiven the intertwining agendas of the various power stakeholders, it is an opportune time to make significant policy changes to achieve our goal.  The State and County stand to gain millions of dollars should the family glitch be addressed and fixed and they therefore stand shoulder to shoulder with advocates working on this issue.  The medical community, along with Covered CA and the State insurance pool, will similarly benefit financially if those who are unenrolled but eligible for insurance sign up.  As noted in the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research report, there is overwhelming and bi-partisan support among Californians for immigration law changes that improve conditions for undocumented immigrants and similarly support the state making its own policies apart from the federal government regarding undocumented persons.  Twenty six state Senators and Assembly members are co-authoring legislation to expand coverage to undocumented people.\r\n\r\nThis is not to say that it will be easy or certain.  However, there is already a great deal of momentum among the public and private sector towards full coverage…momentum that must be seized, nurtured and encouraged.  Achieving the goal of health care access for 1 million people without coverage in Los Angeles is within our reach through the adept implementation of regulatory and policy change along with meaningful public education—all Western Center areas of expertise.  It can be done."
  major_challenges: "1.  Financial Barriers\r\nThere are costs associated with covering 1 million uninsured Angelenos.  For the 60% - 70% who fall in the family glitch and the eligible but not enrolled categories, those costs will be met through federal Affordable Care Act subsidies.  Costs will be offset through decreased use of emergency rooms, reduced mortality, increased productivity in employment, and better risk sharing in the state insurance pool.\r\n\r\n2.  Bureaucratic Barriers\r\nDeveloping the systems and infrastructure to cover and deliver health care to 1 million people is a complex project with many moving parts.  Barriers to coverage include computer problems in determining eligibility; out of date policies that impede access to services; and misinformation regarding coverage availability.   State and county government have undertaken similarly complex projects in the past and are able to appropriately create programs and systems to meet the challenge.\r\n\r\n3.  Policy Barriers\r\nExpanding health care to people without documents raise passions that, as the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research says, “get in the way of good public policy design”.  The Center’s report, Ensuring California’s Future by Insuring California’s Undocumented, describes how expanding coverage not only improves patient’s health and results in economic stability for undocumented Californians and their citizen children but also strengthens Covered CA by adding people who are generally younger and healthier to the insurance pool."
  competition: >-
    Western Center works collaboratively with a wealth of organizations
    dedicated to expanding health coverage in California.  Some of those
    organizations are described elsewhere in the proposal.  Western Center’s
    unique contribution is this -- our singular synthesis of education, impact
    litigation, and policy advocacy to leverage change.  We serve as the “voice
    of the poor” in Sacramento.  We intimately understand the detailed
    intricacies of the Affordable Care Act and related state laws and
    regulations.  State and local stakeholders routinely consult with and rely
    upon Western Center staff with regard to building health care regulatory and
    procedural policies.  We back up our education and advocacy work with the
    “stick” of litigation, offering additional leverage to our network of
    advocates.

      A healthy community means health care for all.  Despite the Affordable
      Care Act’s progress in expanding health coverage, an estimated 1 million
      people in LA remain uninsured.  They include undocumented residents
      (≈40%); families caught in the family “glitch,” that makes family coverage
      unaffordable for low wage workers (≈30%-40%); and individuals eligible for
      but not enrolled in Medi-Cal or Covered CA (≈20%-30%).  Western Center
      will work with health care stakeholders to repair broken systems and amend
      policies and procedures to ensure that L.A. residents access the best
      health services available to them.   
  - name: implement
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Western Center will help the County of Los Angeles and the State of California develop and implement specific and sweeping policy solutions to ensure health care access for the remaining uninsured. \r\n\r\nFor nearly five decades, Western Center has successfully blended effective policy advocacy and strategic impact litigation to achieve major system-wide victories for poor Californians.  With offices in Los Angeles, Sacramento and Oakland, we are able to work with state and local governments and stakeholders throughout the state to achieve policy changes on behalf of millions of poor families and individuals.\r\n\r\nTo address the eligible but unenrolled, we will engage in a collaborative process to create pathways that make it easier for LA residents to enroll in coverage.  We will conduct detailed program analysis of Medi-Cal and Covered CA; identify procedural enrollment obstacles and inefficiencies; review enabling regulations, All County Welfare Directors Letters, notices to consumers, website designs, training materials and marketing materials; deliver detailed recommendations to policymakers and advocate for their adoption.  Beyond internal systems, we will work with stakeholders who are developing media savvy messaging aimed at persuading “young invincibles” to enroll in affordable health care programs . \r\n\r\nWe will engage in local, state and national advocacy to address and resolve the family glitch issue.  The most likely “fix” involves a reasonable and simple change in the definition of affordability within the Affordable Care Act to permit family members who can’t obtain affordable employer sponsored insurance coverage to access subsidies in the Exchange (Covered CA). \r\n\r\nWe will educate policymakers about the remaining uninsured, including undocumented people.  We will develop helpful tips informing advocates and consumers of how to maximize underutilized resources for the remaining uninsured including county indigent care mandates under Section 17000 of the CA Welfare & Institutions the Ability to Pay program, Healthy Way LA Unmatched, Medi-Cal for DACA eligible youth, the Kaiser Permanente Child Health Program, selected Medi-Cal services, community health clinics and emergency rooms, and the Hospital Fair Pricing Act.  We will simultaneously seek a system-wide solution to ensure coverage for all Angelenos, regardless of immigration status."

    answer: "Healthy communities offer quality, affordable and available health care to all of its residents.   Families and individuals can take advantage of preventative and primary care, rather than relying on costly emergency rooms.  People have health insurance and patients don’t “fall through the cracks.\" The entire community is broadly committed to expanding access and improving the quality of health care services and systems.\r\n\r\nQuite simply, Los Angeles falls short.  The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which ranks counties within states by the quality of the clinical care available to residents reported that in 2014 Los Angeles ranked 49th among  California’s 58 counties.  The Foundation cites access to care as one of the principal pathways to improve health outcomes.  \r\n\r\nBy helping the state and county expand health care access, Western Center will have a direct positive effect on 1 million people in Los Angeles and simultaneously improve the health of the community at large.\r\n\r\nExpanding coverage and access makes also sound financial sense.  The UCLA Center for Health Policy Research notes in their May 2014 study, A Little Investment Goes a Long Way: Modest Cost to Expand Preventive and Routine Health Services to All Low-Income Californians, that expanding coverage to those who are uninsured would cost about 2% of the state’s Medi-Cal spending and would be substantially offset by increased sales tax revenue and reduced county spending.\r\n\r\nThe expansion of health care to all Los Angeles residents will not simply help people today but will establish the programs and systems that will be able to deliver high quality health care services to our community for years to come. \r\n"
  - name: who_benefit
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "The project will directly benefit the 1 million people who do not currently have health care coverage.  For these families and individuals, it will improve their health; limit preventable, early deaths; and reduce financial and emotional stress.  As noted above they include:\r\n\r\n1.  Undocumented residents (≈40%) who are not eligible for coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\r\n2.  Families caught in the family “glitch,” that makes family coverage unaffordable for low wage workers (≈30%-40%).  This means families with one or both parents working at low paid jobs and receiving individual, but not family health insurance through their employment.  The current Affordable Care Act regulations provide that even if the uncovered spouse and children are financially eligible for ACA insurance and subsidies, they may not take advantage of that opportunity.  Their only choice is to pay for prohibitively expensive family coverage through the employed parent’s work.\r\n3.  Individuals eligible for but not enrolled in Medi-Cal or Covered CA (≈20%-30%).  These people fall into two sub-categories: those who are eligible for free care via Medi-Cal or subsidized care through Covered CA and those who simply refuse to purchase health insurance, often believing that they don’t need it.  The latter group has been dubbed “the young invincibles”, young healthy people who don’t believe they will get sick or need medical care.\r\n\r\nThe project will also benefit the broader community.  It will minimize uncompensated care; reduce reliance on overstretched emergency rooms, increase the health care system delivery capacity;  strengthen the local economy; and improve public health.\r\n"

      We strongly support collaboration, please tell us a little more about your

    answer: "Western Center’s partnerships with California’s 95 legal aid organizations, including 20 in Los Angeles, are well known.  We deliver in-depth legal support, including technical assistance by email and phone, on-site trainings, conferences, webinars, publications and litigation support to 700 legal aid attorneys in the state. \r\n\r\nEqually important are our longstanding, working partnerships with virtually every significant policy organization working on health care issues.  This includes organizations such as Health Access, Consumers Union, California Pan-Ethnic Health Network, California Immigrant Policy Center, Insure the Uninsured, Tenants Together, Los Angeles Community Action Network, and CA Partnership.   Our work is recognized and supported by the California Endowment, the California Wellness Foundation and other philanthropic organizations dedicated to improving the health of Californians.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we maintain strong relationships with local, state and federal public sector stakeholders, including Covered California; the California Departments of Health Care Services, Managed Health Care, Housing and Community Development, and Social Services; County Welfare Directors Association, California State Association of Counties along with legislators and legislative staff.  We are a unique highly effective voice in Sacramento representing the health care needs of low-income Californians, and collaboration is part of the fabric of our work.\r\n\r\nThree factors critical to Western Center's collaborative success are:\r\n1)  This is a winnable but immensely complicated project with many moving parts.\r\n2)  There are distinct yet intertwined roles for each of the partners that must be appropriately woven together.\r\n3)  The partners will need to maintain a nimble and flexible strategy that fluidly adjusts to shifting policy currents.\r\n"

  - name: two_lessons
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "1.  SUCCESS: Solutions can be crafted to solve complex, system wide challenges.  For 47 years, Western Center has led the charge for policy change on behalf of poor Californians.  In 1971, we litigated Serrano v. Priest, which established the rule that school finance systems can’t discriminate against children from low income communities.  In 1985, we eliminated mandatory county “poor houses”.  In 1999, we established that the county must provide last resort medical care to those who can’t afford it.  In 2004, we kept Rancho Los Amigos Hospital open, preserving residential services for thousands of severely disabled people.  In 2012, we helped the state enroll over 500,000 people in the Low Income Health Program.  We have a history of success. \r\n\r\n2.  PERSEVERANCE: Policy problem solving is not a “one shot” affair.  Western Center tackles big problems that often require strategic, staged solutions.  There is no “magic wand” to change the way complicated public and private systems work.  Policy change is often incremental, building upon past victories to construct new wins.  Whether its civil rights, gay rights, civil liberties or expanding health care, the path to victory has been and is often twisting and indirect.  Western Center understands that campaigns take time.  The proposed project stands on the shoulders of our historic health care work that in 2014 helped millions of people in California obtain health coverage for the first time.\r\n"
  - name: achievable_goal
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "There is a broad and deep coalition of likely and unlikely allies who support the continued expansion of health care reform in California, including elected officials, government health departments, the medical community, patient advocates and residents.  Each group of stakeholders has much to gain from the provision of health care to an additional 1 million people in Los Angeles.  Some stand to benefit financially while others simply need quality health care.  All benefit from the overarching community advantages of expanded access to health care.\r\n\r\nGiven the intertwining agendas of the various power stakeholders, it is an opportune time to make significant policy changes to achieve our goal.  The State and County stand to gain millions of dollars should the family glitch be addressed and fixed and they therefore stand shoulder to shoulder with advocates working on this issue.  The medical community, along with Covered CA and the State insurance pool, will similarly benefit financially if those who are unenrolled but eligible for insurance sign up.  As noted in the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research report, there is overwhelming and bi-partisan support among Californians for immigration law changes that improve conditions for undocumented immigrants and similarly support the state making its own policies apart from the federal government regarding undocumented persons.  Twenty six state Senators and Assembly members are co-authoring legislation to expand coverage to undocumented people.\r\n\r\nThis is not to say that it will be easy or certain.  However, there is already a great deal of momentum among the public and private sector towards full coverage…momentum that must be seized, nurtured and encouraged.  Achieving the goal of health care access for 1 million people without coverage in Los Angeles is within our reach through the adept implementation of regulatory and policy change along with meaningful public education—all Western Center areas of expertise.  It can be done."
  - name: major_challenges
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "1.  Financial Barriers\r\nThere are costs associated with covering 1 million uninsured Angelenos.  For the 60% - 70% who fall in the family glitch and the eligible but not enrolled categories, those costs will be met through federal Affordable Care Act subsidies.  Costs will be offset through decreased use of emergency rooms, reduced mortality, increased productivity in employment, and better risk sharing in the state insurance pool.\r\n\r\n2.  Bureaucratic Barriers\r\nDeveloping the systems and infrastructure to cover and deliver health care to 1 million people is a complex project with many moving parts.  Barriers to coverage include computer problems in determining eligibility; out of date policies that impede access to services; and misinformation regarding coverage availability.   State and county government have undertaken similarly complex projects in the past and are able to appropriately create programs and systems to meet the challenge.\r\n\r\n3.  Policy Barriers\r\nExpanding health care to people without documents raise passions that, as the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research says, “get in the way of good public policy design”.  The Center’s report, Ensuring California’s Future by Insuring California’s Undocumented, describes how expanding coverage not only improves patient’s health and results in economic stability for undocumented Californians and their citizen children but also strengthens Covered CA by adding people who are generally younger and healthier to the insurance pool."
