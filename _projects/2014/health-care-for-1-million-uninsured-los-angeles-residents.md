  This project will create a framework to implement programs that address public
  health, connectivity, and maximizing local health infrastructure. The
  logistics will operate as two symbiotic initiatives: the “community hub” and
  the transportation network. Technology will also play a vital role. Mobile
  applications can facilitate the efficiency and integration of our programs.
  Using this technology, a user could purchase fresh produce located at the hub,
  track and easily access the shuttle service, and communicate with health
  service centers. This mobile app will also help to collect data, and create
  metrics of analysis.
   
   • Community Hub: 
   We envision an innovative entity that consolidates public services into a singular site. This hub will contain health services, a daily produce market (recently funded by USC), and a central transportation stop—the hub will be a point of ingress to LACUSC Med Center and throughout the community. Given the lack of access to fresh produce, we have already partnered with USC to create a weekly farmers’ market and daily produce market. Complimented by preventative health services, providing a consistent source of fresh produce will help a community that is vulnerable to nutritional diseases. As part of our comprehensive health program and effort to bring USC Med Center and Los Angeles County Hospital further into the community, we are partnering with the medical school to bring preventative health services administered by USC. Located on the same site, these services could include mobile testing units, health information kiosk, and an active residency/internship program.
   
   • Transportation Network: Lincoln Heights has internal gaps in transportation infrastructure, and barriers exist within the built environment that inhibit movement, access to public services, and connections to the larger network. To transcend these impediments and create a more robust system, we are creating a service network that connects the community hub, Metro Gold Line, the LACUSC campuses, and other underserved areas such as the Ramona Gardens Housing Projects. The community hub, therefore, becomes an emanation point to access supportive services, hard to access medical services, and the larger public transportation network. This program can be implemented quickly through local operators and become phased into MTA service.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  In LA, mobility is an issue of equity. The size of LA has allowed a great
  diversity of people to live within its sprawl. The unsustainable compromise,
  however, is that this lack of density creates areas without adequate support.
  The result is that entire neighborhoods, often segregated by their
  socio-economic circumstance, are bereft of services and therefore vulnerable
  to poor health. In LA, access to transportation can define the health of a
  community. While the city is making improvements to the subway system,
  underserved neighborhoods need better pathways to connect to services and the
  larger transportation network. The LHHI model is designed to create access to
  health services, supported by community-based transportation and the
  concentration of public services. The Lincoln Heights’ demographics and risk
  factors are similar to many areas throughout East and South LA; the impact of
  creating independent nodes that support health would be profound. 
   
   This engagement reflects the disparate nature of the city itself. Within the sprawl, thriving diverse communities are isolated from one another. A healthier LA will be one that can move throughout the city with ease, within the neighborhood and beyond. If replicated, the underserved communities of Los Angeles will create nodal networks that overcome the disparities of access to health and healthy environments. Additionally, these nodes would generate investment and development, bending the built environment to service its most vulnerable residents. 
   
   Major health institutions will have a model for community engagement and accessibility that reflects the comprehensive care model mandated by the new Affordable Care Act. To wit, health care providers must institute preventative mechanisms to offset the unsustainable cost curve of treating chronic and endemic diseases prevalent in underserved communities. According to the American Public Health Association, 7 in 10 deaths in the US are related to chronic conditions such as obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease, which are often preventable. Shockingly, 75% of our health care dollars are spent on treating such diseases while only 3% are spent on prevention. 
   
   LHHI will target the nearly 40,000 residents in the neighborhood, supporting the population before the individual is affected. The project is designed to be replicated in similar conditions throughout the city.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The LHHI will represent a consortium of care providers, business leaders, and
  community partners that will drive holistic, community-based strategies for
  achieving a healthy, equitable, and sustainable LH. The initiative combines
  the best practices of an accountable care organization with a neighborhood
  improvement district to address simultaneously public health disparities and
  connectivity concerns. Its mission is informed by the alarming disconnect
  between the economic and spatial dominance of the LACUSC Med Center and the
  public health vulnerability of the community.
   In response to data describing the current condition in Lincoln Heights, it is apparent that a holistic development strategy would benefit the majority of the community. 
   
   48% - High School Graduation Rate
   46.2% - Experience Housing Burden
   $29.825 – Median Household Income
   65.8% - Federal Poverty Level
   
   Cross referencing the social determinants of health with the LH ethnographic data, the Latino and Asian/Pacific Islander populations are severely at-risk. The Latino population is at risk for metabolic, nutritional, and cardiovascular disease, while chronic hepatitis B and C are prevalent in Asian/Pacific Islander populations. Both are precursors for increased incidence of liver cancer. Untreated, these conditions can have serious health effects throughout a population. This project, however, is meant to reach beyond access to direct medical services and address the larger environment. The social determinants of health affect those in the population who are not necessarily sick, but do not have the resources to support healthy living and become vulnerable. These determinants are being increasingly recognized as interconnected. 
   
   Former Secretary of HUD, Shaun Donovan articulated this when describing new metrics for measuring housing affordability as factors of transportation costs, noting that for most families, transportation is their second-highest monthly expense after housing. This project will benefit the nearly 20,000 people who experience housing burden in LH who may not have the available resources to address health and transportation. Engaging quality of care on this scale will initiate a redistribution of resources that will affect other social determinants of health.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Citymart: is a tech company based in Europe that generates and disseminates
  “smartcity” solutions to governments and developers. We will contract with
  this forward thinking group to develop and license the mobile applications
  used our transportation and service networks. 
   
   LA PREP, LA KITCHEN: LA PREP will house incubator and training kitchens for local entrepreneurs and non-profits dedicated to social enterprise and culinary programs. These entities are confirmed partners and collaborators on our farmers’ market grant.
   
   Diabetes and Obesity Research Institute: DORI will provide medical and research expertise and design and administer the health metrics to measure success. DORI is located in Lincoln Heights and is familiar with the area, demographics, and health risks.
   
   USC Violence Intervention and Prevention Clinic: An early supporter of our initiative, Dr. Astrid Heger and the VIP work to create healthy environments and pathways to supportive services. Dr. Heger has acted as a consultant and facilitator within USC for the LHHI.
   
   UCLA-USC CENTER FOR POPULATION HEALTH AND HEALTH DISPARITIES: Like the DORI, this center is essential to facilitating and providing the best support for the public health of this population. We will collaborate with them to generate and analyze data, commission studies, and consult on strategy.
   
   EL ARCA: Provides essential services to the developmentally disabled population of Greater LA. EL ARCA operates a bus fleet to transport their clients throughout the city, which we may contract for our transportation network. We have worked closely with this group on the farmers’ market grant. 
   
   Clinica Romero: Another important community health center, as they conduct outreach to the Ramona Gardens Housing Project. We hope to learn from their experience and include them in the connectivity network.
   
   Arroyo Vista Family Health Center: Their services and presence will help to establish a wellness district along the Broadway corridor.
   
   LACUSC Med Center: The objectives of the LHHI, align with LACUSC strategic interests as it seeks to minimize costs and improve community relations.
   
   CITY OF LA: Aligns with many of the public health, transportations, and economic development strategies pursued by various city agencies. By pooling the resources of the city and health centers, the LHHI can promote the area as an ideal location for health targeted industry clusters and health infrastructure.
