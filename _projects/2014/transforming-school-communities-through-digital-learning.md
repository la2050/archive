Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  CFY will provide wrap-around support for students, teachers, and families at 5
  low-income LAUSD middle schools where we will implement our Digital Learning
  Program in 2014-15. The Digital Learning Program includes three key elements:
  Family involvement in learning, professional development for educators, and
  PowerMyLearning.
   
   FAMILY INVOLVEMENT IN LEARNING:
   
   CFY provides workshops for parents and students at our partner schools that are designed to increase students’ self-directed learning, empower parents, and provide access to technology at home. They include:
   
   1. Essentials of Home Learning: A highly engaging workshop in which families learn how to use home technology to improve student learning. Families also receive a free refurbished home computer that is theirs to keep. The workshop encourages families' ongoing use of the technology for learning.
   
   2. Additional workshops such as “The Internet as a Learning Tool,” “Supporting Student Learning at Home,” and “Planning for the Future with Your Student – High School and Beyond.”
   
   PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR EDUCATORS:
   
   CFY’s support for educators is designed to help them leverage technology in an instructionally effective way (not just to replace paper worksheets) so that they can provide personalized instruction to their students, make the transition to the rigor of the new Common Core standards, and take full advantage of the iPad roll-out in LAUSD. Support includes:
   
   1. Intensive in-school 1-on-1 coaching support for teachers to adopt blended learning strategies. Research indicates that this type of coaching is one of the most effective ways to help teachers adjust their instructional techniques in a sustainable way that respects teachers’ expertise and goals.
   
   2. Educator Workshops an entire school staff that introduce them to the benefits of digital learning and to PowerMyLearning.
   
   POWERMYLEARNING:
   
   PowerMyLearning.org is CFY’s innovative K-12 learning platform that enables students, educators, and parents to find and use thousands of carefully curated academic games, videos, and interactive simulations that are tagged by Common Core standard, subject, grade, Spanish-language support, and more. It includes powerful tools that enable teachers to fully personalize the learning experience for their students and it provides parents with a reliable source of digital content and helps them better support their children's learning.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Throughout the greater Los Angeles community, a substantial opportunity gap
  persists between low-income and higher-income families. Large numbers of
  students in LA’s low-income communities are not graduating from high school on
  time, and even larger numbers are inadequately prepared for college and
  careers. This, in turn, is contributing to an unprepared workforce and growing
  income inequality.
   
   Additionally, teachers are facing growing pressure to provide personalized instruction to large classes of students with diverse needs and learning levels. The new Common Core standards require teachers to re-focus their curricula and LAUSD’s related iPad roll-out means figuring out how to use these new tools effectively as well.
   
   CFY is addressing these problems by helping all the key constituencies in the learning process—students, teachers, and parents—use digital learning more effectively in school and at home.
   
   Our Digital Learning Program helps teachers provide more personalized learning for students. Instead of giving one lesson to their class, teachers have a CFY coach who empowers them to create playlists of digital learning activities (videos from different publishers, educational games, simulations, and more) and then assign those playlists to targeted groups of students. In this model, students receive instruction at their level in the areas they need the most help.
   
   This student-centered classroom experience also inspires students to be more self-directed learners. After completing their assigned playlist of activities, students are free to explore their passions and areas of need. This higher-level thinking and metacognition is essential for success in high school, college, and career.
   
   Home access to technology, along with an adult who is trained in how to use it for learning, can transform students’ home learning environments to create rich learning experiences. Families who participate in CFY family learning workshops leave empowered with the tools and knowledge to strengthen the learning environment at home.
   
   Currently, students and teachers in low-income communities have less access to personalized learning, high-impact professional development, and technology than their higher-income peers. CFY seeks to close this divide and provide equal access to students, families, and teachers regardless of their zip code.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  CFY's Digital Learning Program targets middle school students, their families,
  and teachers at partner schools where at least 75% or more of students qualify
  for free or reduced-cost lunch. Last year, approximately 87% of CFY families
  in Los Angeles had annual incomes of $35,000 or less.
   
   Our program is designed to meet the needs of non-native English speakers and approximately 70% percent of our workshops are taught in Spanish by bilingual facilitators.
   
   We focus on the middle school years as research shows that this is the time period where the greatest drop-off in academic achievement occurs. According to an ACT research report, "the progress toward college and career readiness that students have made by eighth grade is crucial to their future success."
   
   Teachers are also direct beneficiaries of the Digital Learning Program. Educators receive one-on-one coaching with a CFY Blended Learning Consultant. We also provide interactive educator workshops to help all faculty access the benefits of digital learning and PowerMyLearning.org.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Please specify whether or not these collaborators are confirmed. What added
  benefit does each partner bring to your project? Have you worked together in
  the past? Please list three factors that are critical to the success of your
  proposed collaboration.
   
   In 2014-15, CFY has solidified partnerships with 5 schools as part of our core Digital Learning Program. They include:
   
   - Dr. Julian Nava Learning Academy of Arts & Culture (South LA)
   - Dr. Julian Nava Learning Academy of Business and Technology (South LA)
   - Valor Academy (Arleta)
   - Stella Middle Charter Academy (West Adams)
   - Jack H. Skirball Middle School (Watts)
   
   Additionally, we plan to work with additional school partners on select portions of the Digital Learning Program. We are still in the process of securing those additional partners.
   
   CFY also works closely with other leaders in the digital learning and educational technology space. We were a member of the Los Angeles Next Generation Learning Systems collaboration that submitted a proposal to the Gates Foundation to scale personalized learning district-wide. Members of the team included LAUSD, KIPP LA, and the Partnership for Los Angeles Schools. CFY has also partnered with Alliance College-Ready Public Schools to provide a portion of their blended learning professional development during their summer institute for teachers.
