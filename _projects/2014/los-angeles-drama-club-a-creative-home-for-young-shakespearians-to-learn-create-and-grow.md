Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  We are determined to have our own space within the next three to five years,
  but this grant will allow us to make it happen in one year. We have already
  begun to move forward!
   
   We are researching available space on West Adams, Washington, Venice, Jefferson, and Crenshaw, and have already targeted two possible properties. In addition, we have a working relationship with the City of LA and its relevant representatives on this matter. 
   
   We have a strong relationship with the West Adams and MidCity Neighborhood Councils and have built much support for this endeavor in District 10. 
   
   We will choose a building that will benefit the needs of LADC and the local community. Our location will be specifically chosen to cater to local schools and it will be centrally located in relationship to the communities we serve, establishing ideal proximity to our students and further simplifying, if not eliminating, transportation challenges. 
   
   We are establishing relationships with other artists and programs to whom we will rent space - benefiting our children, by giving them the opportunity to interact with working artists and professionals in the LA community, and the artists, who will have a safe and inspiring place to work. 
   
   We have secured volunteer professionals: IATSE LOCAL 33 trained stage technicians who will set up the performance space and help transform the space into a true “Arts Center” - free for the children of Los Angeles. 
   
   We will then hold an Opening Fundraiser in the New Space to bring awareness to our programs, to our mission, and to our communities. In future years, the space will host our star-studded Annual Gala Benefit (celebrities perform with our students as scene partners in excerpts from Shakespeare’s plays) again helping bring awareness to our organization and to the neighborhood.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  We are the nation’s youngest Shakespeare Troupe and have had great success in
  creating a lens through which our players view Shakespeare’s plays, and
  discover a rich world that has immediate relevance in their lives. We are
  passionate about guiding our students on a journey to confidence and
  self-discovery. Some of our students come with dyslexia, ADHD, Asperger’s
  Syndrome and other learning & social challenges. Traditional school has not
  served these children well, but theater offers a learning environment that
  allow children with different strengths and learning styles to work together
  to create magic. 
   
   Come to one of our shows - you would be stunned to learn that the boy who is bringing the house down with his antics was too shy to speak when he first came to class. The child who is nimbly navigating the verbal twists and turns of that monologue had a hard time deciphering a single line just 14 weeks ago. The girl who is fighting for her character’s objective with focus and commitment has severe ADHD - after years of battling over lost homework and books left here and there, her parents have told us that she always knows exactly where her Shakespeare folder is. 
   
   During their time with us, students become intimately acquainted with as many as over a dozen of Shakespeare’s plays. We discuss and decipher and debate the morals and life messages for which Shakespeare is famous - imagine what will happen to our city as these children are let loose, and become the civic leaders of tomorrow. 
   
   We know, first-hand, the magic that theater can work. We also know that, within LA, there are communities that do not have the financial resources to experience to the cultural, educational, and artistic treasures of LA. The Los Angeles Drama Club serves as an access point for the youth of Los Angeles, and opens their eyes to the possibilities. We ask for the children’s participation, not only as performers in our Shakespeare productions, but as citizens in our community. As a parent recently wrote, “We are truly grateful for the chances you have given our son. He always came home excited about what he had learned. Thanks to you, a whole new world has opened up to him.”
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  We help children in Mid City, West Adams, South LA and beyond. While our
  primary focus is Los Angeles’s District 10, families bring their children from
  Inglewood, Compton, Lennox, Leimert Park, Norwalk and San Pedro. In our
  current neighborhood, there are few walkable community centers, active arts
  programs, or central merchant-lined streets. Yet, there are hundreds of youth
  on the streets who need a productive and safe way to spend their time - these
  children are our target. 
   
   According to the LA Times, the median household income in our target area is around $40,000, and the percentages of households that earn $20,000 or less and $20,000 to $40,000 are high for the county. Only about 20% of residents 25 and older have a four-year degree, and about 30% of families are headed by single parents. 
   
   These statistics paint a picture of a typical family that does not have a lot of disposable income to spend on enrichment programs, a parent who may not have first-hand experience with the benefits an arts education can provide, a parent who does not have the freedom and flexibility to chauffeur children across the city. These families are our target.
   
   There is no better way to explain the benefits of our organization, than to share with you some of the things our families have to say:
   
   “We are a low-middle class family, and there isn’t a lot of support when you’re in the middle. The fact that the classes were free allowed my daughter to experience this life-changing program while we focused on keeping the lights on at home.” 
   - Myshell Tabu, parent in Mid City.
   
   “L.A. Drama Club is an extraordinary organization that introduces kids to Shakespeare, not by dumbing it down or "kid-ifying" it, but by actually teaching the young actors to understand and interpret the text.” 
   - Dee Dee Cooper, teacher in Mid City.
   
   “You can see the impact that it has on the youth simply by witnessing a rehearsal, workshop, or performance. Bringing Shakespeare to Los Angeles youth is not only great for the children, it's great for Los Angeles and our arts community. This is a professional and passionate project of the heart that deserves your support.” 
   - Scott Fifer, Go Campaign
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  We have been sharing space and “playing well with others” for 9+ years. As we
  move into the next phase, we feel our organization will be best served by
  having the freedom and independence to make the artistic and administrative
  choices that will best serve our students, rather than making compromises that
  best serve the groups with whom we have shared space. 
   
   That said, we are drawing on the expertise of the following individuals: 
   
   Real Estate Professional (this individual has not been confirmed, though we are in discussions with three people) - Having a knowledgeable “eye” on the areas we are targeting will help insure that we are made aware of all appropriate spaces that become available. Three factors critical to our success:
   - An extensive knowledge of the real estate in our target area.
   - A passion for improving our communities.
   - An ability to think creatively about alternative space. We don’t expect an actual theater to become available, so we need to work with someone who can see the possibilities. 
   
   Stage Specialist (Dante Larsen, IATSE Local 33) - Dante will be instrumental in designing the performance space to be cost-efficient, environmentally-friendly, and above all, safe. We have been working with him since the beginning of our organization. Three factors critical to our success:
   - Extensive knowledge of stage construction and lighting set-up
   - A passion for helping young people succeed
   - A network of stage professionals to draw on for volunteer labor
   
   A remarkable characteristic of our organization is the enthusiasm it incites in those who discover our community: we have had many parents, friends, associates, fellow artists, community leaders, neighborhood councils, local merchants, and independent business take interest in our children and our mission. With our own space, we look forward to embracing more of the people who are interested in being a part of LADC. We envision a creative learning community and look forward to welcoming other like-minded organizations to our space, as we have been welcomed in our past, and giving them a place to grow.
