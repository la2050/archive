Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Our project will take a three part approach to making LA the best place for
  people to play and birds to thrive in 2050.
   
   First, we will continue our work at five nature locations around Los Angeles, at Debs Park, Baldwin Hills Scenic Overlook, Kenneth Hahn Park, Los Angeles River, and Harbor Park. Our work at these locations focuses on engaging teens through three popular and effective programs: The Arroyo Green Team (Debs), Audubon Youth Environmental Stewards (Harbor Park and LA River), and the Environmental Stewardship Program (Baldwin Hills). At these locations, teens monitor wildlife populations, restore native habitats, and create fun nature activities that educate and enlighten park visitors and younger people from their communities. These young environmentalists will be essential to the second step of this project.
   
   Second, taking what we have learned from the network programs, we will engage people of all ages at neighborhood parks and other open spaces to observe the birds in their area and to celebrate their local parks as places to explore, play and gain an appreciation of nature. We will work with a GIS (Geographic Information System) specialist, to train our youth to identify and map park space that meet a series of social and natural criteria (developed by the youth). Through this process, we will identify new potential partners, in the form of recreation centers or social service NGOs who work near these parks. Our teens and our chapter members will inventory the parks using Audubon’s Citizen Science approach and new technologies. Here is an opportunity for the varied skill sets of the young and older people to share their knowledge - teens may teach older chapter members about technology, while chapter members help teach the teens bird identification skills. There are many exciting new apps that can be used for bird identification and recording information. Using social media is a fun and easy way for the program participants and the public to communicate the natural wonders found in our city parks.
   
   Finally, we’ll work with new partners to host events in these parks. Events may consist of bird watching walks, conducted in English and Spanish, arts and cultural activities, health and passive recreation connections, and environmental action projects. Our hope is to help people understand that our parks and our birds are our connection to health and well-being in our communities and that finding birds is a great way to play in L.A.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Audubon youth will help people gain a better understanding and appreciation of
  nature in their urban parks, the value of native plants, water conservation,
  wildlife and habitat preservation. We will connect people of all ages to the
  great outdoors in recreational activities and fun restoration/conservation
  events and show that nature in LA thrives!
   
   We will take what we have learned to create a guide for shaping Bird-friendly Parks. Greater bird diversity is better for the parks and better for the people that live there. The Guide to Bird Friendly Parks will help communities advocate for new parks and to make their existing parks sanctuaries for people and birds. Being in nature has health and developmental benefits that have been shown and summarized in works such as Louv’s Last Child in the Woods. In many cases, our parks may be one of our only outlets to the natural world, and urban youth in particular may suffer from what has been called “nature-deficit disorder,” with no backyards or areas to play in. Parks, green space, and open space are vital to combat obesity and type 2 diabetes, help children develop motor skills and contribute to civic engagement. 
   
   We envision, in 2050, youth participating in this project holding the reins of city and regional government, fully convinced of the importance of nature to young people, of the joy of finding birds in their parks, and committed to prioritizing efforts to ensure that every person in Los Angeles has access to nature nearby to play in, discover, grow, feel safe.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  This project has a few target audiences. First the project will benefit teens
  that are involved in our after-school programs. These programs provide a
  pathway to higher educational and career opportunities for under-served youth.
  The Audubon Center at Debs Park program serves youth primarily from northeast
  Los Angeles communities. Students are predominantly Latino, ages 12-18.
  Audubon YES participants consist of both middle and high school students from
  throughout the South Bay. High School student interns in Los Angeles Audubon’s
  Greenhouse & Environmental Stewardship Program are from Dorsey High whose
  student body identifies as 57% African-American and 42% Hispanic. All of these
  programs serve economically disadvantaged youth. Nearly all the graduates from
  these programs go on to four-year colleges, and many are the first in their
  families to do so.
   
   The project will also benefit our older chapter membership. They will lend their organizational and life skills, working with youth from our programs to help create the report that identifies targeted parks. We believe that this type of inter-generational learning will benefit all participants.
   
   People residing near these parks will benefit from learning new skills (bird identification, water-wise native plant species) and seeing their parks as both a recreational place and a wildlife habitat. Increased activity at parks will help remove real and perceived barriers to participation, for example, is the park safe? With more planned activities, parks can be a beacon for families to gather and to enjoy and learn about nature. 
   
   Finally, the birds of LA will benefit from more public conservation awareness that will lead to community action to improve our parks.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  We have confirmed collaboration with the Los Angeles Audubon Society and Palos
  Verdes/South Bay Audubon Society and partnerships with San Fernando Valley
  Audubon Society, and Santa Monica Bay Audubon Society. These separate Audubon
  chapters have worked together in sharing research and have been working for
  the past year to bring youth from their environmental education programs
  together to build support networks, advocate for conservation, and share
  ideas. All of these entities are their own non-profit organizations, operating
  independently, but with similar goals and missions. 
   
   The Chapters bring skills and expertise in bird identification and environmental science. Each of the chapters take a community based approach to conservation and youth engagement. For example, Los Angeles Audubon through its partnership with California State Parks, and The Baldwin Hills Conservancy will provide access to people of all ages to learn more about the parks at student-led environmental restoration events, and bird walks that provide insight to the unique ecology, geology, wildlife, and plantlife found in these urban oases.
   The project hopes to identify new collaborators where we can add value to their work and they can provide skills and expertise to enhance the project.
   
   Audubon has been working in Los Angeles since 1910, advocating for birds and nature, and providing opportunities for people to connect with nature. In the City of Los Angeles, four, independent, local chapters – Los Angeles Audubon, Palos Verdes / South Bay Audubon, San Fernando Audubon, and Santa Monica Bay Audubon- work with local schools, advocate for nature, and engage all ages with birds, wildlife and LA’s natural places. Additionally, the Audubon Center at Debs Park, operated by Audubon California, takes on these roles in the neighborhoods in northeast Los Angeles. Working together, we have the entire city covered.
