Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  We completed our first full year of implementation as one of only five
  recipients (out of over 250 applicants) of the national Toyota Family Learning
  grant (toyotafamilylearning.org). This project is a new six-year nationwide
  initiative led by the National Center for Families Learning (NCFL) and funded
  by Toyota. This prestigious award provides us with partial funding to more
  fully execute this model over the next three years. Our planned programming
  includes the expansion and provision of: 
    
   1. Parent Time/Education - Education will include "Raising Thriving Kids" (5 week asset building program), Muffins for Moms (home literacy) and Donuts for Dads (engaging dads in education). 
   2. PACT Time - This past year, we began providing a joint parent/child literacy program for pre-school aged children. For our older children, we offer two evening (at pickup time from 6:00 - 7:30 p.m.) teacher-led PACT programs. The first is a family homework support program where parents and children jointly work on strengthening homework and test-taking skills. The second is a study skills program where families jointly learn to improve study strategies, school behaviors, time management, and organizational skills. 
   3. Family Literacy/Shared Reading - In conjunction with our Family Literacy program, our families utilize TNC’s library to select books for reading together. Families are shown how to use the dictionary to understand the meanings of words and how to identify the type of text structure presented in the material. 
   4. Developmental Assets® Programming - Direct instruction and development of building blocks is provided to children throughout all of our programming.
   5. Family Mentoring Program - We wish to expand our current mentoring program to include family mentoring focused on academic success. We will also offer e-mentoring using technology such as Skype.
   6. Grandparents as Parents - We are partnering with this local organization that offers weekly small group parenting programs for those (e.g., grandparents, aunts, uncles) who have previously parented and find themselves parenting again. 
   7. Family Service Learning - We have begun offering innovative family service learning opportunities. When families engage in service together they are spending quality time learning about their communities and adults are acting as positive role models for their children.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Our Family Learning Program will help make LA the best place to learn in three
  critical ways:
   
   1) This program can break the cycle of poverty through its innovative approaches to intergenerational family learning. Family literacy/learning programs provide enduring benefits to individual family members as well as the family unit as a whole. 
   
   2) It fills a significant service gap. For example, our families lack access to affordable preschool and parent education classes, placing them at a great disadvantage. 
   
   3) It provides an opportunity for our families to truly reinvent themselves and develop a different kind of hope for the future. It takes a significant amount of resources to coordinate the necessary comprehensive services our families require and to offer them all at one central location. This "wrap-around" approach allows us to provide the space and innovative programming our families want and need. Our families, in turn, bring the energy, motivation, dedication and hard work. Working together, we have the ability to bring about real and sustained change for our families.
   
   We are working to give our families a "hand up" instead of a "hand out". Our ultimate goal is to build futures and offer hope. We do so by taking a different approach. Although many programs seek to involve parents in their child's learning, our program is unique in that it requires ongoing engagement from parents. Each family works together to create goals for the family as a whole. With assistance, these goals form the basis of a family asset development plan that holistically meets that family's unique needs. Parents spend a minimum of 10 hours per week working to reach the full potential of the entire family. Also, our innovative service learning and advocacy components take our program out of the "institution" and into the community and our clients' homes. Our parents gain skills/confidence and then practice applying this new knowledge in real life situations. Many of our families have never had these opportunities before. This is a powerful approach.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Our services are available to all individuals in the Harbor Area of LA. Due to
  the location of our main campus, many of the families we serve come from the
  Barton Hill/Rancho San Pedro neighborhood of San Pedro. This area is located
  in the northeast corner of San Pedro—the town’s major core of poverty level
  families. Seventy-eight percent of Toberman's families are Latino/Hispanic.
  Currently, 96% of clients are below 50% of area median income, with 58% having
  incomes of less than $15,000. Many of the families we serve reside in the
  Rancho San Pedro low-income public housing project, and every student at the
  local elementary school qualifies for participation in the Federal free lunch
  program. 
   
   The needs in our community are complex. In addition to increasingly widespread gang activity and crime, our community also suffers from elevated high school dropout rates and low educational attainment. Only 61% of students entering 9th grade at San Pedro High School in 2008 graduated in 2012. In addition, only one quarter of high school graduates enroll in college. The vast majority of our kids live in neighborhoods with significant gang activity, have poor parental supervision, perform poorly in school, and have very low incomes. Our most recent reading assessment on our newly enrolled children indicated that half are reading below grade level. In addition, a full 71% of the children we serve live in abused, neglected and/or extremely challenging situations (e.g., incarcerated parents, foster care). A number of our children live in chaotic homes and are unable to focus on learning because they are focused on survival. For many, school attendance is spotty which translates into a true lack of opportunity.
   
   Our families face persistent challenges and hardships. One of the underlying causes that link all of these problems is a lack of literacy in the home. In addition to traditional definitions, we also characterize literacy as the ability to handle information, to express ideas and opinions, to make decisions and solve problems. It involves a continuum of learning in enabling individuals to achieve their goals, develop their knowledge and potential, and participate fully in their community. We know that the power of literacy lies not only in the ability to read and write, but rather in an individual’s capacity to put those skills to work in shaping the course of his or her own life. Our program can effect tremendous lasting change for our families.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  We have formed numerous collaborative relationships to ensure we are offering
  "best in class" programming, providing those specific holistic "wrap-around"
  services our families want and need, and continuously evaluating the impact of
  our services. All of our partners/collaborators are crucial to our success and
  each has been confirmed. The National Center for Families Learning (NCFL) is
  our prime collaborator and partner. We have worked with this inspirational
  organization for the past three years; 2 years piloting our literacy project
  and this past year implementing our Toyota Family Learning program. NCFL is a
  confirmed partner for at least two more years. Another critical partner is
  Marymount University. On a weekly basis, Marymount provides us with dozens of
  tutors for our after school program and is providing us with a federally
  funded work study intern for our literacy program. Our third prime partner is
  the Search Institute (developers of the 40 Developmental Assets® framework for
  youth development). We continue to work with them as pilot site for the
  Institute's Assets Profile for Pre-Teens (DAP-P ). Other confirmed partners
  include Harbor Preschool and Bandini Elementary School Healthy Start Program
  (parent literacy), DMH/South Bay Mental Health (on-site mental health
  services), Free Arts for Abused Children (arts for parents/youth), the South
  Bay Center for Literacy (ESL, family literacy) and the San Pedro Public
  Library (on-site literacy programming).
   
   We also receive significant support from our 352 volunteers: 18 Board Members, 122 Auxiliary members (thrift store), 50 program volunteers (tutoring, enrichment/recreation), and 164 evening meal volunteers (provide a full meal for youth every day). In our after school program alone, volunteers contribute 3,005 hours each year with an estimated dollar value of $74,374. In addition, we receive tremendous support from local funders who share our commitment to the children. Some supporting foundations include Toyota/NCFL (Toyota Family Learning) Dwight Stuart, Parsons, Ahmanson, Rose Hills, CA Community Foundation, Boeing and Kaiser. Finally, we also connect to our community through regular standing meetings with law enforcement and government officials to proactively address neighborhood issues, meet regularly with local child care organizations to ensure open youth-focused dialogue occurs and have instituted several avenues to maintain open and ongoing communication with our local schools.
