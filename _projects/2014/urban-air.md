title: URBAN AIR
project_summary: "Stephen Glassman Studio first raised widespread critical acclaim in the early 1990’s creating free-form bamboo installations for devastated urban sites in the aftermath of the Rodney King Riots, Malibu Fires, and Northridge Quake. Since then, Stephen Glassman Studio has gone on to do significant large-scale projects including a 4,000 square foot sculpture plaza at the LNR Warner Center, the Fairmont Skate Park in Salt Lake City, Utah, Arkansas’ Southeast Shear (an NEA & White House Millennium Project), the Sylvia Campuan Bridge in Bali, and more. Stephen Glassman Studio has collaborated with architects such as Sasaki, Steinberg, Miller / Hull, and Arup Engineering as a creative consultant to urban master planning, as well as in the creation of commissioned art works for large-scale projects. Glassman is the recipient of numerous grants and awards including the NEA, Nathan Cummings Foundation, LA Cultural Endowment, and was a 2000 Chrysler Design Award nominee. Stephen Glassman Studio’s work has been collected and exhibited throughout Southern California, New York City, and internationally. The design and concept for Urban Air first received notice when it won the 2011 London International Creativity Award. As a successful Kickstarter project Urban Air went on to generate international dialogue about the nature of advertising and the role of art in communities, garnering support from over 1500 people internationally, with the film about it receiving over 150,000 downloads in 125 countries.  Urban Air has been written about in countries around the Globe including Japan, Greece, Egypt, India, China, Russia, Italy, Peru, Brazil, France, England, Taiwan, Italy, Poland, and by publications and/or programs including The Huffington Post, Wired (Italy), LA Times, National Geographic, Forbes, Dwell, Landscape Architecture, DAD (Peru), Good Magazine, NPR, KCET, The Discovery Channel and more. Urban Air is currently slated as a main stage presenting project for The NYC Green Festival this upcoming April. Since its publication internationally Stephen Glassman Studio has received interest and inquiries from all over the world about the possibility of Urban Air projects in other cities... and the work of the studio, including Urban Air, has been the subject of collegiate studies at Vassar College, Syracuse University, Hampshire College, and other institutions.\r\n\r\n"

Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  During the design and prep phase Urban Air will erect the pilot or prototype
  greenboard in Los Angeles — ideally in Q1 2015. Summit Media has already
  guaranteed donation of the media site for the Urban Air prototype. This pilot
  installation will serve multiple ends: 1) it will allow us to do real-world
  testing of the technologies, designs and construction techniques before
  rolling out to other target sites; 2) it will provide an engine to build
  velocity for marketing and promotion — telling the Urban Air story; and 3) it
  allows Urban Air to market its successful Kickstarter campaign, which
  generated over 21,000 blog posts and articles, 150,000 downloads of video, and
  over 600,000 social media impressions. 
   
   site considerations
   Ideally the sponsor/underwriting partner(s) will have existing relationships (or even existing contracts) for outdoor media, and would be able to offer Urban Air several location choices in each target c40 city. We assume this will be a point of negotiation with sponsor partners, but ideally the Urban Air team would be able to make the final determination as to the sites. 
   Some of the considerations driving suitability of Urban Air sites are:
   
   High traffic/visibility for maximum impact of the project.
   Viability of the existing billboard: will it require retrofitting and is it capable of being re-designed within the budget/technical parameters established for the project.
   Suitability for data monitoring goals of the project.
   Suitability for social networking/destination goals of the project.
   Visual/aesthetic considerations, such as surrounding buildings and background picture.
   
   Although much site research can be done virtually (with googleEarth/gMaps street view, existing photos provided by outdoor media companies, etc.), members of the Urban Air team will be required to make at least one site visit during this project phase (structural engineer, designer and/or project lead). This visit also will net important documentation assets, including site photographs and plans.
   climate science and installation duration
   The vision of Urban Air, and one of its key concepts, is to monitor and publicize carbon footprint reduction through the year 2020 (this is the c40 initiative target date, and also the target date of the BEACO2N project). For the costs of the strategic BEACO2N partnership to make sense, and to ensure scientific value for the project, BEACO2N sensors must be in place for at least one year — ideally two years or more.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Urban Air is a public artwork that also puts an active face on the possibility
  of urban sustainability. Urban Air will bring an urgency and vibrancy to the
  civic landscape, inspire community dialogue and action, beautify transit
  corridors, and ultimately connect people. Much like a modern city, bamboo is
  at once both vertical and horizontal. Each culm is connected to and sustained
  by the others through a vast rhizome network. Like streets, mass transit, or
  electrical grids in a modern city, everything and everyone is connected. The
  health of any individual within such a system is ultimately dependent on the
  health of the system as a whole. Urban Air will contribute to the overall
  health of Los Angeles. 
   
   Throughout history, art has been a vital sphere and critical element in the construct of communities. It has lived in the public realm in cave paintings, religious idols and shrines, piazza’s, monuments, and more. In the 20th century, with the privatization of culture, art moved more into the realm of institutions, museums, and private collections. The sphere of art however, still occupies critical social space. It enhances cities by contributing to commerce and helping to revitalize neighborhoods and communities. Today however, the presence and role of art is frequently replaced by advertising. Urban Air will also generate value and spectacle in the public realm, though with a different intent. 
   
   Urban Air reclaims the territory of advertising traditionally occupied by billboards, and as such directly intervenes, engages, and transforms it. Today advertising is consciously exploring its ability to generate new value. Social entrepreneurship, transparency, and sustainability are emerging as business’s new index of what matters. Likewise, the need to experience creativity “for no reason” - art for art’s sake - in daily, urban life, becomes more urgent. Urban Air takes on that action. With its ideal climate, Los Angeles is poised to become a world leader in sustainable urban culture. As an accessible work of art and a green, interconnected billboard, Urban Air will be a flag flown for both.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Urban Air will be a positive landmark for all immediate passersby, as well as
  a major social media hub. Climate monitoring, social media wifi broadcasting,
  and public private partnering will foster a robust local and global dialogue.
  Profound questions and solutions will actively be proposed and powerfully
  exist in the civic landscape. Not only is there the inherent values of service
  and beauty, but the value that can be created through social media
  participation and connectivity will be vast. It is the intention of Urban Air
  to partner with the Clinton Foundation's C40 climate initiative, and LA is a
  C40 city. Urban Air will become a symbol of LA's green apirations and
  policies, and be the first in the worl to launch a global program.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  The following collaborators are all confirmed and been on board 6 months to 2

   the urban air team
   Urban Air is conceived, designed, and will be produced by Stephen Glassman Studio. Urban Air has rapidly expanded from a solo artist’s vision into a work of scale and impact, and has inspired key vanguard professionals in related fields — engineers, technologists, media professionals, environmental and industry figures — all collaborating to realize not only the prototype Urban Air installation in Los Angeles, but to craft a viable, scalable system that will allow Urban Air billboard gardens to be elevated in dense urban environments around the globe. 
   The Urban Air executive team includes artist and designer Stephen Glassman, who has created socially-relevant large-scale artworks around the world, Supervising Producer Steve Reiss, an environmentalist and award winning producer who has collaborated with a long roster of Hollywood A-list talent across all media, and Aaron Slavin, a multi-faceted creative producer who specializes in grand-scale festivals — especially site-specific multi-media works with an art/science focus that impact urban civic spaces.

  Indicator: Arts & Cultural Vitality
  brief: >-
    Urban Air is a project that transforms existing billboards into living,
    suspended bamboo gardens.  Embedded with intelligent technology, Urban Air
    is at once a provocative artwork and a crack in the urban skyline meant to
    surprise, inform, suggest, and create a visual respite for a road weary
    city.  With a donated billboard over one of LA’s busiest freeways, the
    façade of the billboard will be removed and replaced with architecturally
    integrated planters. Imagine being stuck in traffic, channel surfing on the
    radio, nothing but billboards with advertising on the skyline, and up pops a
    cluster of suspended living bamboo with water misters creating a visual
    cloud forest.  As per artist Stephen Glassman, Urban Air is an opportunity
    for people to “look up, feel themselves as human, and conceive of what might
    be.”  Beginning with one billboard, Urban Air intends to take an
    infrastructure that is only meant for modern advertising and commerce and
    create something accessible, inspiring, and altogether different - art for
    art’s sake in a social, urban, and ecological context. Billboards right now
    exist mostly as visually opaque structures, like boarded up windows on the
    horizon. Urban Air transforms them into portals… Open windows that connect
    the viewers not only to the sky but also to their own sense of humanity, and
    ultimately and potentially, to other Urban Air billboards around the globe.
    Urban Air is about transforming structures often seen as urban blight into
    living metaphors. While Urban Air is primarily an artwork, each “green”
    board will also be a “hotspot” that measures and wirelessly communicates the
    comparative air quality of its internal microclimate relative to its
    surrounding area via the internet. We are reportedly exposed to up to 5,000
    advertisements alone per day. And it has been said that the average city
    dweller is exposed to as much information in one day as the average
    Victorian was in a lifetime. When advertising is replaced with art,
    something that is purely visual and intended only to be looked at and
    experienced, we all win. Urban Air becomes a global node, an open space in
    the urban skyline intended to inspire and revitalize, at once an artwork, a
    symbol of, and an instrument for a green future.

  success: "The first and most important measure of success is a prominent, fully produced and realized Urban Air billboard at a significant intersection or at a major thoroughfare in Los Angeles by the end of 2013. However, its realization alone is only the beginning of the equation. As the piece is intended to be a catalyst, the impact it generates is of equal, if not greater importance. Urban Air must inspire widespread and formidable dialogue, a matrix that can be tracked to some extent through media coverage. Likewise the amount of interest and inquiry by other cities to create like projects will indicate a measure of success. As has been done to date, we will note success in the ability of Urban Air to inspire academic curriculums, generate college classes and workshops, and stimulate other professional collaborations and artistic endeavors. An important evaluation will be the goal of shifting the edges and territories of art, building, and infrastructure in the public realm.  For example, Arup Engineering is already beginning in-house conversations to explore the possibility of public building – both art and architecture – as possible creative and beautiful solutions to a greener urban future.\r\n\r\nA technical success will be in the comparative monitoring of environmental qualities. The embedded environmental sensors will be streaming to the Urban Air website, and this data stream will be available to the public. Traffic to the website, both its quantity and quality, will be easily measured.\r\n\r\nSuccess will also mean a measurable and discernable result in the culture of advertising within the city and beyond. This could include launching a potential collaboration with an advertising company or a discernable change in the aesthetics of some ad campaigns. Questions we will ask ourselves to measure success and evaluate our project will include: Did we affect a cultural change and inspire artistic and sustainable innovation in the advertising landscape? Can Urban Air inspire and begin to generate an advertising landscape that contributes to the city and serves people? Can we begin to imagine buildings and monuments that both clean the air and beautify the skyline?  As ultimately we would like to see Urban Air become a global initiative, perhaps in partnership with the Clinton C40 Initiative – a combined effort of the 40 largest cities in the world to reduce their carbon footprint by the year 2020, to generate interest and a connection with them would be an important and significant milestone. A successful Los Angeles “proof of concept” installation will open the door to all of these possibilities.\r\n\r\n"

  description3: "Stephen Glassman Studio is a studio driven fine art practice. Based in drawing, the studio is committed to a rigorous inquiry that intuitively explores concept, form, and process. The studio is engaged in the creation of large-scale national and international public art works that include architecturally integrated sculptures, civic monuments, plazas, bridges, and transit developments.  As such Stephen Glassman regularly collaborates with architects, engineers, planners, builders and more as part of his practice. Often formidable in scale, the work created by the studio extends organically from a site and is distinct in its ability to invite, generate and celebrate community. Stephen Glassman is part of a generation of public artists that have always created work on the street - art for art’s sake in a social context.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the production arena for competitive artists relies on the luxury art market galleries and museums, public percent for art funding, academia, and/or design services. Like other art studios, Stephen Glassman is active and competitive within all of these venues and on all these fronts. To a certain extent however, the notion and initiatives behind Urban Air specifically would make what might otherwise be experienced as competition, namely the creation of more Urban Air interventions and inspired billboards, be evidence of success. \r\n\r\nGlassman comes from a history of cross disciplinary collaborations - not only collaborating regularly with architects and engineers, but also with graffiti artists, circus acrobats, martial artists, bamboo workers, scientists, dancers, performers, and artists such as Perry Farrel, Philippe Petit, Jonathan Borofsky, Paris Opera, Moscow Circus, and filmmakers such as Kevin Kerslake and Catherine Hardwicke. Stephen Glassman Studio’s work and practice is the result of a lifetime of community development, dialogue, and production, and again, while to a certain extent an increase in arts related projects would be competition in all these arenas, in a much broader context it would be evidence of success.\r\n\r\nGlassman regularly engages in dialogue with other artists about the nature and platform for art in cities. Glassman’s choice to work in the public realm (circa 1992) was a choice to develop scale and social impact in his work. With regards to Urban Air specifically and other like projects from Stephen Glassman studio, Glassman will both continue to be competitive and continue his dialogue with “the competition”.\r\n\r\n"
  vision: >-
    The success of Urban Air in 2050 would look something like this:  A driver
    in LA would see a plethora of Urban Air, and Urban Air inspired
    constructions gracing the skyline. Bamboo and other living plant life would
    be integrated with art on the edifices  of the built environment. There
    would be Urban Air billboards by an array of different artists as part of
    the Clinton C40 Initiative – a combined effort of the 40 largest cities in
    the world to reduce their carbon footprint by the year 2020. These
    “greenboards” would be catalysts for the way we think, act, educate,
    advertise, and integrate both the arts and greening of our cities. There
    would be additional Urban Air or Urban Air inspired billboards in other
    cities around the globe. Many edifices around LA, as well as elsewhere,
    would be exploring the use of art as an initiative in and of itself – “art
    for arts sake” – as well as potentially for integration in socially and
    aesthetically conscious ad campaigns.  The urban advertising landscape would
    be transformed to become another layer of serviceable urban infrastructure.
    Campaigns and companies themselves would be taking a different approach to
    the use of billboards, frequently integrating environmental sensors to
    measure air quality and otherwise concerning themselves not just with
    commerce but with providing service and both integrating and communicating
    aesthetics and sustainability. Universities and schools would regularly
    offer courses studying the use of both art and sustainable concerns in
    advertising and in platforms traditionally used for advertising. Commercial
    architectural projects would integrate Urban Air inspired billboards as part
    of their initial architectural planning and design, rather than as a post
    construction after thought. Conversations and dialogue around the way we
    experience and use art, aesthetics, sustainability, technology and commerce
    would have expanded and changed significantly in ways that major cities
    approach both the integration of arts, sustainability and economy throughout
    the world, so that he human experience of living in cities would be
    significantly improved.

In the 20th century, with the privatization of culture, art moved more into the realm of institutions, museums, and private collections. The sphere of art however, still occupies critical social space. It enhances cities by contributing to commerce and helping to revitalize neighborhoods and communities. Today however, the presence and role of art is frequently replaced by advertising. Urban Air will also generate value and spectacle in the public realm, though with a different intent.  \r\n\r\nUrban Air reclaims the territory of advertising traditionally occupied by billboards, and as such directly intervenes, engages, and transforms it. Today advertising is consciously exploring its ability to generate new value. Social entrepreneurship, transparency, and sustainability are emerging as business’s new index of what matters. Likewise, the need to experience creativity “for no reason” - art for art’s sake - in daily, urban life, becomes more urgent. Urban Air takes on that action. With its ideal climate, Los Angeles is poised to become a world leader in sustainable urban culture. As an accessible work of art and a green, interconnected billboard, Urban Air will be a flag flown for both.\r\n\r\n"

    answer: "The first and most important measure of success is a prominent, fully produced and realized Urban Air billboard at a significant intersection or at a major thoroughfare in Los Angeles by the end of 2013. However, its realization alone is only the beginning of the equation. As the piece is intended to be a catalyst, the impact it generates is of equal, if not greater importance. Urban Air must inspire widespread and formidable dialogue, a matrix that can be tracked to some extent through media coverage. Likewise the amount of interest and inquiry by other cities to create like projects will indicate a measure of success. As has been done to date, we will note success in the ability of Urban Air to inspire academic curriculums, generate college classes and workshops, and stimulate other professional collaborations and artistic endeavors. An important evaluation will be the goal of shifting the edges and territories of art, building, and infrastructure in the public realm.  For example, Arup Engineering is already beginning in-house conversations to explore the possibility of public building – both art and architecture – as possible creative and beautiful solutions to a greener urban future.\r\n\r\nA technical success will be in the comparative monitoring of environmental qualities. The embedded environmental sensors will be streaming to the Urban Air website, and this data stream will be available to the public. Traffic to the website, both its quantity and quality, will be easily measured.\r\n\r\nSuccess will also mean a measurable and discernable result in the culture of advertising within the city and beyond. This could include launching a potential collaboration with an advertising company or a discernable change in the aesthetics of some ad campaigns. Questions we will ask ourselves to measure success and evaluate our project will include: Did we affect a cultural change and inspire artistic and sustainable innovation in the advertising landscape? Can Urban Air inspire and begin to generate an advertising landscape that contributes to the city and serves people? Can we begin to imagine buildings and monuments that both clean the air and beautify the skyline?  As ultimately we would like to see Urban Air become a global initiative, perhaps in partnership with the Clinton C40 Initiative – a combined effort of the 40 largest cities in the world to reduce their carbon footprint by the year 2020, to generate interest and a connection with them would be an important and significant milestone. A successful Los Angeles “proof of concept” installation will open the door to all of these possibilities.\r\n\r\n"

    answer: "Stephen Glassman Studio first raised widespread critical acclaim in the early 1990’s creating free-form bamboo installations for devastated urban sites in the aftermath of the Rodney King Riots, Malibu Fires, and Northridge Quake. Since then, Stephen Glassman Studio has gone on to do significant large-scale projects including a 4,000 square foot sculpture plaza at the LNR Warner Center, the Fairmont Skate Park in Salt Lake City, Utah, Arkansas’ Southeast Shear (an NEA & White House Millennium Project), the Sylvia Campuan Bridge in Bali, and more. Stephen Glassman Studio has collaborated with architects such as Sasaki, Steinberg, Miller / Hull, and Arup Engineering as a creative consultant to urban master planning, as well as in the creation of commissioned art works for large-scale projects. Glassman is the recipient of numerous grants and awards including the NEA, Nathan Cummings Foundation, LA Cultural Endowment, and was a 2000 Chrysler Design Award nominee. Stephen Glassman Studio’s work has been collected and exhibited throughout Southern California, New York City, and internationally. The design and concept for Urban Air first received notice when it won the 2011 London International Creativity Award. As a successful Kickstarter project Urban Air went on to generate international dialogue about the nature of advertising and the role of art in communities, garnering support from over 1500 people internationally, with the film about it receiving over 150,000 downloads in 125 countries.  Urban Air has been written about in countries around the Globe including Japan, Greece, Egypt, India, China, Russia, Italy, Peru, Brazil, France, England, Taiwan, Italy, Poland, and by publications and/or programs including The Huffington Post, Wired (Italy), LA Times, National Geographic, Forbes, Dwell, Landscape Architecture, DAD (Peru), Good Magazine, NPR, KCET, The Discovery Channel and more. Urban Air is currently slated as a main stage presenting project for The NYC Green Festival this upcoming April. Since its publication internationally Stephen Glassman Studio has received interest and inquiries from all over the world about the possibility of Urban Air projects in other cities... and the work of the studio, including Urban Air, has been the subject of collegiate studies at Vassar College, Syracuse University, Hampshire College, and other institutions.\r\n\r\n"

    answer: "Stephen Glassman Studio is a studio driven fine art practice. Based in drawing, the studio is committed to a rigorous inquiry that intuitively explores concept, form, and process. The studio is engaged in the creation of large-scale national and international public art works that include architecturally integrated sculptures, civic monuments, plazas, bridges, and transit developments.  As such Stephen Glassman regularly collaborates with architects, engineers, planners, builders and more as part of his practice. Often formidable in scale, the work created by the studio extends organically from a site and is distinct in its ability to invite, generate and celebrate community. Stephen Glassman is part of a generation of public artists that have always created work on the street - art for art’s sake in a social context.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the production arena for competitive artists relies on the luxury art market galleries and museums, public percent for art funding, academia, and/or design services. Like other art studios, Stephen Glassman is active and competitive within all of these venues and on all these fronts. To a certain extent however, the notion and initiatives behind Urban Air specifically would make what might otherwise be experienced as competition, namely the creation of more Urban Air interventions and inspired billboards, be evidence of success. \r\n\r\nGlassman comes from a history of cross disciplinary collaborations - not only collaborating regularly with architects and engineers, but also with graffiti artists, circus acrobats, martial artists, bamboo workers, scientists, dancers, performers, and artists such as Perry Farrel, Philippe Petit, Jonathan Borofsky, Paris Opera, Moscow Circus, and filmmakers such as Kevin Kerslake and Catherine Hardwicke. Stephen Glassman Studio’s work and practice is the result of a lifetime of community development, dialogue, and production, and again, while to a certain extent an increase in arts related projects would be competition in all these arenas, in a much broader context it would be evidence of success.\r\n\r\nGlassman regularly engages in dialogue with other artists about the nature and platform for art in cities. Glassman’s choice to work in the public realm (circa 1992) was a choice to develop scale and social impact in his work. With regards to Urban Air specifically and other like projects from Stephen Glassman studio, Glassman will both continue to be competitive and continue his dialogue with “the competition”.\r\n\r\n"

      The success of Urban Air in 2050 would look something like this:  A driver
      in LA would see a plethora of Urban Air, and Urban Air inspired
      constructions gracing the skyline. Bamboo and other living plant life
      would be integrated with art on the edifices  of the built environment.
      There would be Urban Air billboards by an array of different artists as
      part of the Clinton C40 Initiative – a combined effort of the 40 largest
      cities in the world to reduce their carbon footprint by the year 2020.
      These “greenboards” would be catalysts for the way we think, act, educate,
      advertise, and integrate both the arts and greening of our cities. There
      would be additional Urban Air or Urban Air inspired billboards in other
      cities around the globe. Many edifices around LA, as well as elsewhere,
      would be exploring the use of art as an initiative in and of itself – “art
      for arts sake” – as well as potentially for integration in socially and
      aesthetically conscious ad campaigns.  The urban advertising landscape
      would be transformed to become another layer of serviceable urban
      infrastructure. Campaigns and companies themselves would be taking a
      different approach to the use of billboards, frequently integrating
      environmental sensors to measure air quality and otherwise concerning
      themselves not just with commerce but with providing service and both
      integrating and communicating aesthetics and sustainability. Universities
      and schools would regularly offer courses studying the use of both art and
      sustainable concerns in advertising and in platforms traditionally used
      for advertising. Commercial architectural projects would integrate Urban
      Air inspired billboards as part of their initial architectural planning
      and design, rather than as a post construction after thought.
      Conversations and dialogue around the way we experience and use art,
      aesthetics, sustainability, technology and commerce would have expanded
      and changed significantly in ways that major cities approach both the
      integration of arts, sustainability and economy throughout the world, so
      that he human experience of living in cities would be significantly
      improved.
