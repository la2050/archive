  During the design and prep phase Urban Air will erect the pilot or prototype
  greenboard in Los Angeles — ideally in Q1 2015. Summit Media has already
  guaranteed donation of the media site for the Urban Air prototype. This pilot
  installation will serve multiple ends: 1) it will allow us to do real-world
  testing of the technologies, designs and construction techniques before
  rolling out to other target sites; 2) it will provide an engine to build
  velocity for marketing and promotion — telling the Urban Air story; and 3) it
  allows Urban Air to market its successful Kickstarter campaign, which
  generated over 21,000 blog posts and articles, 150,000 downloads of video, and
  over 600,000 social media impressions. 
   
   site considerations
   Ideally the sponsor/underwriting partner(s) will have existing relationships (or even existing contracts) for outdoor media, and would be able to offer Urban Air several location choices in each target c40 city. We assume this will be a point of negotiation with sponsor partners, but ideally the Urban Air team would be able to make the final determination as to the sites. 
   Some of the considerations driving suitability of Urban Air sites are:
   
   High traffic/visibility for maximum impact of the project.
   Viability of the existing billboard: will it require retrofitting and is it capable of being re-designed within the budget/technical parameters established for the project.
   Suitability for data monitoring goals of the project.
   Suitability for social networking/destination goals of the project.
   Visual/aesthetic considerations, such as surrounding buildings and background picture.
   
   Although much site research can be done virtually (with googleEarth/gMaps street view, existing photos provided by outdoor media companies, etc.), members of the Urban Air team will be required to make at least one site visit during this project phase (structural engineer, designer and/or project lead). This visit also will net important documentation assets, including site photographs and plans.
   climate science and installation duration
   The vision of Urban Air, and one of its key concepts, is to monitor and publicize carbon footprint reduction through the year 2020 (this is the c40 initiative target date, and also the target date of the BEACO2N project). For the costs of the strategic BEACO2N partnership to make sense, and to ensure scientific value for the project, BEACO2N sensors must be in place for at least one year — ideally two years or more.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Urban Air is a public artwork that also puts an active face on the possibility
  of urban sustainability. Urban Air will bring an urgency and vibrancy to the
  civic landscape, inspire community dialogue and action, beautify transit
  corridors, and ultimately connect people. Much like a modern city, bamboo is
  at once both vertical and horizontal. Each culm is connected to and sustained
  by the others through a vast rhizome network. Like streets, mass transit, or
  electrical grids in a modern city, everything and everyone is connected. The
  health of any individual within such a system is ultimately dependent on the
  health of the system as a whole. Urban Air will contribute to the overall
  health of Los Angeles. 
   
   Throughout history, art has been a vital sphere and critical element in the construct of communities. It has lived in the public realm in cave paintings, religious idols and shrines, piazza’s, monuments, and more. In the 20th century, with the privatization of culture, art moved more into the realm of institutions, museums, and private collections. The sphere of art however, still occupies critical social space. It enhances cities by contributing to commerce and helping to revitalize neighborhoods and communities. Today however, the presence and role of art is frequently replaced by advertising. Urban Air will also generate value and spectacle in the public realm, though with a different intent. 
   
   Urban Air reclaims the territory of advertising traditionally occupied by billboards, and as such directly intervenes, engages, and transforms it. Today advertising is consciously exploring its ability to generate new value. Social entrepreneurship, transparency, and sustainability are emerging as business’s new index of what matters. Likewise, the need to experience creativity “for no reason” - art for art’s sake - in daily, urban life, becomes more urgent. Urban Air takes on that action. With its ideal climate, Los Angeles is poised to become a world leader in sustainable urban culture. As an accessible work of art and a green, interconnected billboard, Urban Air will be a flag flown for both.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Urban Air will be a positive landmark for all immediate passersby, as well as
  a major social media hub. Climate monitoring, social media wifi broadcasting,
  and public private partnering will foster a robust local and global dialogue.
  Profound questions and solutions will actively be proposed and powerfully
  exist in the civic landscape. Not only is there the inherent values of service
  and beauty, but the value that can be created through social media
  participation and connectivity will be vast. It is the intention of Urban Air
  to partner with the Clinton Foundation's C40 climate initiative, and LA is a
  C40 city. Urban Air will become a symbol of LA's green apirations and
  policies, and be the first in the worl to launch a global program.

  The following collaborators are all confirmed and been on board 6 months to 2
  years
   
   the urban air team
   Urban Air is conceived, designed, and will be produced by Stephen Glassman Studio. Urban Air has rapidly expanded from a solo artist’s vision into a work of scale and impact, and has inspired key vanguard professionals in related fields — engineers, technologists, media professionals, environmental and industry figures — all collaborating to realize not only the prototype Urban Air installation in Los Angeles, but to craft a viable, scalable system that will allow Urban Air billboard gardens to be elevated in dense urban environments around the globe. 
   The Urban Air executive team includes artist and designer Stephen Glassman, who has created socially-relevant large-scale artworks around the world, Supervising Producer Steve Reiss, an environmentalist and award winning producer who has collaborated with a long roster of Hollywood A-list talent across all media, and Aaron Slavin, a multi-faceted creative producer who specializes in grand-scale festivals — especially site-specific multi-media works with an art/science focus that impact urban civic spaces.
