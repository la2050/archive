  We are training Seniors to be AGEnts for Change in Los Angeles to improve the
  lives of Older Adults in our City through advocacy.
Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  SBSS will build on its successful experience in creating and conducting the
  AGEnts for Change program. The primary goal for the 2nd generation (G2) of the
  AGEnts for Change Initiative is to expand the impact of AGEnts advocacy and
  education activities by launching a revitalized recruitment, education and
  mobilization process that will engage a new cadre of lead AGEnts who will in
  turn educate key legislators, other seniors in Los Angeles, and the general
  community about issues facing the aging population. In order to achieve this
  goal, SBSS will do the following:
   (1) Organize 5 recruitment events at identified sites in SBSS service area to engage the senior community.
   (2) Identify and recruit 12 -15 seniors to be trained as lead AGEnts. 
   (3) Conduct 3 periodic meetings in which information and training will be provided to lead AGEnts to keep their skills current.
   (4) Coordinate 8 educational meetings with key legislators (federal, state, and local) on topics relevant to the senior community. 
   (5) Produce and distribute four Video on Demand (VOD Casts) Issue statements.
   (6) Conduct 6 monthly communiqués including conference calls, emails, direct mail and newsletters distributed at the Senior Centers and community sites. 
   
   The need is great and with the right support, many older adults are willing and able to speak up for themselves and for the senior community at large.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  St. Barnabas Senior Services (SBSS) initial AGEnts for Change Initiative
  achieved success in its first year of implementation. Due to the support of
  The SCAN Foundation, SBSS was able to recruit and train 32 seniors. Six
  emerged as lead advocates who actively informed key legislators, for-profit
  and non-profit organizations, and the general community about issues that are
  facing the senior population. Paramount to the success of the initiative was
  the empowerment of a diverse group of seniors who now take responsibility for
  educating themselves and others and can provide testament to their ability to
  positively impact their community.
   Over the past several months, SBSS and a few of the AGEnts have remained active in their pursuit of preserving safety net services for seniors. In particular, these AGEnts have continued to support the efforts of the Los Angeles Aging Advocacy Coalition (LAAAC) by attending meetings, participating in conference calls and educating key legislators. During these interactions, it has become even more apparent that the impact of SBSS AGEnts can be improved through an enhanced recruitment, education and mobilization process that will engage additional AGEnts for Change. 
   
   SBSS is in a strong position to initiate the enhancement of the AGEnts Initiative, not only because of its solid record of community engagement, but also as a direct result of the recent expansion of its service area to include the neighborhoods of Hollywood, Griffith Park, Los Feliz, Silver Lake, Atwater Village and Chevy Chase as served by the Hollywood Senior Multipurpose Center (HSMPC). This expansion has doubled SBSS’ geographic reach and increased the number of seniors served annually from 8,000 to nearly 18,000. This expansion has provided SBSS with the opportunity to reach an entirely new group of seniors who have the potential to become advocates for themselves and for the senior community. The diversity of this community will further strengthen the efforts of the AGEnts Initiative as SBSS is able to recruit and engage seniors who are representative of the cultural, linguistic and social richness of Los Angeles.
   Involving the growing senior population of Los Angeles in advocacy not only contributes to their well being, but helps make L.A. a great place in which to live and age with dignity. By 2050, our population of seniors will have increased dramatically and investing in sound policy and advocacy now, will contribute to a vibrant L.A. in 2050
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Our project specifically benefits all older adults living in Los Angeles and
  their families, by advocating for senior friendly public policy, programs and
  services that contribute to their independence, health and well being. Through
  a strong policy framework that supports seniors advocating for themselves,
  their voices are heard, their lives are enriched and L.A. itself becomes a
  better place to live.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  The SCAN Foundation continues to assist with funding for the AGEnts for Change
  Initiative and their advice as well as funding has been important to our
  project. In addition, the Los Angeles Ageing Advocacy Coalition is a
  significant policy partner to SBSS and the AGEnts for Change Initiative,
  bringing together over 50 organizations and individuals working together on
  policy issues impacting the lives of older adult residents of Los Angeles.
