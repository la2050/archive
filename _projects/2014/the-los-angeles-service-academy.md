LA COUNTY: LASA teaches high school students how things work in Southern California.
OTHER: >-
  LASA begins with questions. How does a city run? How does a vast metropolitan
  region like Los Angeles work? Which institutions are responsible for moving
  water, people, food, and power from points A to points Z? How are such
  institutions and agencies funded and run? Who runs them? How can neighborhoods
  be made more livable? What does an elected official do all day? What role do
  cultural institutions play in the life of greater Los Angeles? What about
  businesses and non-profits? What are the potential educational and career
  paths for young people interested in civic, civil, and public service in the
  Los Angeles Basin? We encourage high school students to ask these -- and so
  many more -- questions, and then we work together to answer them.
Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  The 2050 metric is really important to us at LASA. We embrace the long-term.
  We work with a fairly small group of participants at a time. We are about to
  welcome our third LASA class (in early August). It has thirty high school
  juniors. We have three collegiate interns and about a half dozen teachers.
  That's a small footprint in terms of making a difference. But: we will soon
  have close to a hundred LASA students, past and present, with which to build
  foundational change in greater Los Angeles. Then 130, 160, 190, and so on.
  Even thinking of thirty-per year (we expect to expand that number) gets us to
  well over 1000 LASA-ites by 2050. If, in the long-term, we can establish
  networks of knowledge, civil and civic service and awareness, and public
  obligation among our graduates, we will have accomplished our highest goals.
  In other words, there's a scenario in our head about problem solving in LA in
  2050. And the principals involved in wrestling with said problem are LASA
  graduates -- they've built knowledge over the years, they've established
  efficient networks of collegiality and collaboration, and they get down to
  solve infrastructural problems and puzzles with greater skill and vision
  because of all this.
   
   Of course there are short-term goals. Teach a broad cross section of kids about LA; draw a diverse group of young people who may come from very different circumstances or parts of LA together, allow them to discover commonalities of experience and curiosity. Put them into the landscape, teach them about going to college, show them how transit works, empower them to use libraries well help them learn to express themselves in public settings; have a lot of fun on a Saturday LASA day. 
   
   We think LASA is spot on with experiential learning objectives. We think greater Los Angeles is an astonishing learning laboratory for history, policy, landscape, culture, and urbanism, and we think no one is too young to begin to grapple with his or her place in the metropolis. We think LASA helps make LA navigable, and we think that we empower and built the confidence of the young people who join us each year.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  At the very center of the experience, we know LASA benefit four specific
  groups. First and foremost are the high school participants themselves. Those
  benefits accrue, we think, in post-LASA years, in that we make efforts to keep
  in touch, to track our graduates into next phases of their lives and budding
  careers. Second, we think the program benefits our collegiate interns. Since
  inception several years ago, these have been Occidental College students
  solely, a reflection of that college's commitment to public/civic service
  through the Urban and Environmental Policy Institute (UEPI). Neither of LASA's
  directors are affiliated with Oxy (one of us is at USC, the other at Colburn
  School of Music). These interns see their undergraduate training enhanced by
  their interaction with the city and our high schoolers. Third, we believe the
  teacher participants, some of whom have been with us since we started, benefit
  from taking their curricular interests into the city and its landscapes. They
  also benefit from collegial exchange with their colleagues from other
  institutions. Fourth, co-directors Bill Deverell and Doug Smith benefit from
  the opportunity to work with younger, non-collegiate students on this regular
  basis and get to enhance networks of collaboration throughout greater LA. 
   
   Those are focused beneficiaries. There are more, we think. Our LASA students take their experience back to their families. These families often repeat our fieldtrip experiences; we go to point A on a given Saturday and the student brings her family back there on the next Saturday. The friends of our LASA students benefit similarly, and we recruit new LASA students from these ranks.
   
   Most widely, we believe LA benefits. Not yet, perhaps. But we think the lines of friendship, knowledge, and commitment to public service and awareness cannot help but make LA both work better and become a better place to live and work. That's LASA's promise, we think, and it makes it all very exciting to us.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  LASA thrives on and can only work through partnerships. It is in fostering
  these partnerships -- and in showcasing them to the students -- that we
  further and strengthen our foundation of collaboration across the great city.
  Our key institutional partners are two institutions: the Huntington Library
  and the Los Angeles Public Library. These are our base camps; we meet here, we
  use materials from here, we explore relevant issues on top of their materials
  and outward from them into the region. But other partnerships with individuals
  and their institutions are every bit as critical. Our experts drive LASA. We
  are proud of the relationships we have built with, for example, the Los
  Angeles Times (esp. architecture critic Christopher Hawthorne and transit
  reporter Laura Nelson); Raphael Sonenshein of Cal State LA; Rob Salzman of the
  Los Angeles Police Commission; Maria Cabildo of the East LA Community
  Corporation; Robert DeGroot of the Southern California Earthquake Center;
  Laurence Frank of LA Trade Tech and former mayor Villaraigosa's office; Rich
  Llewellyan of Mayor Garcetti's office; Ken Brecher of the Library Foundation
  of Los Angeles; Bernadette Glenn of the WHH Foundation; Jeff Kightlinger and
  Marjorie Wheeler of the Metropolitan Water District; the Port of Los Angeles
  and the Los Angele Harbor Commission, esp. David Arian; Deputy LAPD Chief
  Sandy Jo MacArthur; Steven Koblik of the Huntington Library; and others. Our
  network of colleagues and collaborators is expanding, and we are proud of the
  fact that the LASA participants get to meet high-profile decision-makers and
  leaders across a broad swath of institutions, agencies, and educational
  centers in the region.
