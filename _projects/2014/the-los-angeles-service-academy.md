title: The Los Angeles Service Academy
project_summary: "<p>LASA has been active since the summer of 2012. Our inaugural class of 20 high school juniors, one high school intern, two college interns, and seven high school teachers has met in a summer intensive Los Angeles history and culture seminar at The Huntington Library, and we've met one Saturday a month since then. Each Saturday session is focused on a different \"node\" of regional infrastructure. The day usually begins with a speaker and discussion, and then the LASA group goes into the field and to various sites which fit that day's themes. Our investigation of water started with a history overview of regional water development -- with rare documents -- and we then went to the dispersal facility for Colorado River water coming into the Metropolitan Water District system. Our business investigation took us to a private aerospace manufacturing facility, in business for 57 years, in Glendale, and a tour with that company's chief technologist. We ended that day with a discussion with Idealab executives and entrepreneurs. Our law enforcement day featured a morning with Connie Rice of the Advancement Project (we all read her book on the LAPD), and an afternoon tour with LAPD leaders of the new station and the regional 911 call center; we ended the day with a tour of SWAT team equipment and vehicles.  For our investigation of regional transit and transit history, we began our day with seminars by experts from The Getty and the Automobile Club of Southern California on the history of automobiles, freeways, and railroads in the region.  Following an on-foot journey from LAPL to Union Station, we met with the lead architectural design team tasked with re-imagining Union Station in the urban fabric of downtown (a stop at the Bradbury Building completed that day).  A more recent investigation of the entertainment landscape of Los Angeles took us to AEG's Staples Center, the GRAMMY Museum, the Disney Concert Hall, and an end-of-the-day Bunker Hill discussion with the architecture critic of the Los Angeles Times.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>We believe our LASA students are getting to know the region, getting to know one another, and beginning to build lasting ties to their home and one another through LASA's commitment to fostering   engaged civic participation and civic education.  We believe that we are off to a great start.</p>"

Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  LASA begins with questions. How does a city run? How does a vast metropolitan
  region like Los Angeles work? Which institutions are responsible for moving
  water, people, food, and power from points A to points Z? How are such
  institutions and agencies funded and run? Who runs them? How can neighborhoods
  be made more livable? What does an elected official do all day? What role do
  cultural institutions play in the life of greater Los Angeles? What about
  businesses and non-profits? What are the potential educational and career
  paths for young people interested in civic, civil, and public service in the
  Los Angeles Basin? We encourage high school students to ask these -- and so
  many more -- questions, and then we work together to answer them.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  The 2050 metric is really important to us at LASA. We embrace the long-term.
  We work with a fairly small group of participants at a time. We are about to
  welcome our third LASA class (in early August). It has thirty high school
  juniors. We have three collegiate interns and about a half dozen teachers.
  That's a small footprint in terms of making a difference. But: we will soon
  have close to a hundred LASA students, past and present, with which to build
  foundational change in greater Los Angeles. Then 130, 160, 190, and so on.
  Even thinking of thirty-per year (we expect to expand that number) gets us to
  well over 1000 LASA-ites by 2050. If, in the long-term, we can establish
  networks of knowledge, civil and civic service and awareness, and public
  obligation among our graduates, we will have accomplished our highest goals.
  In other words, there's a scenario in our head about problem solving in LA in
  2050. And the principals involved in wrestling with said problem are LASA
  graduates -- they've built knowledge over the years, they've established
  efficient networks of collegiality and collaboration, and they get down to
  solve infrastructural problems and puzzles with greater skill and vision
  because of all this.
   
   Of course there are short-term goals. Teach a broad cross section of kids about LA; draw a diverse group of young people who may come from very different circumstances or parts of LA together, allow them to discover commonalities of experience and curiosity. Put them into the landscape, teach them about going to college, show them how transit works, empower them to use libraries well help them learn to express themselves in public settings; have a lot of fun on a Saturday LASA day. 
   
   We think LASA is spot on with experiential learning objectives. We think greater Los Angeles is an astonishing learning laboratory for history, policy, landscape, culture, and urbanism, and we think no one is too young to begin to grapple with his or her place in the metropolis. We think LASA helps make LA navigable, and we think that we empower and built the confidence of the young people who join us each year.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  At the very center of the experience, we know LASA benefit four specific
  groups. First and foremost are the high school participants themselves. Those
  benefits accrue, we think, in post-LASA years, in that we make efforts to keep
  in touch, to track our graduates into next phases of their lives and budding
  careers. Second, we think the program benefits our collegiate interns. Since
  inception several years ago, these have been Occidental College students
  solely, a reflection of that college's commitment to public/civic service
  through the Urban and Environmental Policy Institute (UEPI). Neither of LASA's
  directors are affiliated with Oxy (one of us is at USC, the other at Colburn
  School of Music). These interns see their undergraduate training enhanced by
  their interaction with the city and our high schoolers. Third, we believe the
  teacher participants, some of whom have been with us since we started, benefit
  from taking their curricular interests into the city and its landscapes. They
  also benefit from collegial exchange with their colleagues from other
  institutions. Fourth, co-directors Bill Deverell and Doug Smith benefit from
  the opportunity to work with younger, non-collegiate students on this regular
  basis and get to enhance networks of collaboration throughout greater LA. 
   
   Those are focused beneficiaries. There are more, we think. Our LASA students take their experience back to their families. These families often repeat our fieldtrip experiences; we go to point A on a given Saturday and the student brings her family back there on the next Saturday. The friends of our LASA students benefit similarly, and we recruit new LASA students from these ranks.
   
   Most widely, we believe LA benefits. Not yet, perhaps. But we think the lines of friendship, knowledge, and commitment to public service and awareness cannot help but make LA both work better and become a better place to live and work. That's LASA's promise, we think, and it makes it all very exciting to us.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  LASA thrives on and can only work through partnerships. It is in fostering
  these partnerships -- and in showcasing them to the students -- that we
  further and strengthen our foundation of collaboration across the great city.
  Our key institutional partners are two institutions: the Huntington Library
  and the Los Angeles Public Library. These are our base camps; we meet here, we
  use materials from here, we explore relevant issues on top of their materials
  and outward from them into the region. But other partnerships with individuals
  and their institutions are every bit as critical. Our experts drive LASA. We
  are proud of the relationships we have built with, for example, the Los
  Angeles Times (esp. architecture critic Christopher Hawthorne and transit
  reporter Laura Nelson); Raphael Sonenshein of Cal State LA; Rob Salzman of the
  Los Angeles Police Commission; Maria Cabildo of the East LA Community
  Corporation; Robert DeGroot of the Southern California Earthquake Center;
  Laurence Frank of LA Trade Tech and former mayor Villaraigosa's office; Rich
  Llewellyan of Mayor Garcetti's office; Ken Brecher of the Library Foundation
  of Los Angeles; Bernadette Glenn of the WHH Foundation; Jeff Kightlinger and
  Marjorie Wheeler of the Metropolitan Water District; the Port of Los Angeles
  and the Los Angele Harbor Commission, esp. David Arian; Deputy LAPD Chief
  Sandy Jo MacArthur; Steven Koblik of the Huntington Library; and others. Our
  network of colleagues and collaborators is expanding, and we are proud of the
  fact that the LASA participants get to meet high-profile decision-makers and
  leaders across a broad swath of institutions, agencies, and educational
  centers in the region.

  brief: "<p>The Los Angeles Service Academy (LASA) begins with questions. How does a city run? How does a vast metropolitan region like Los Angeles work? Which institutions are responsible for moving water, people, food, and power from points A to points Z? How are such agencies funded? Who runs them? How can neighborhoods be made more livable? What does an elected official do all day? What role do cultural institutions play in the life of Los Angeles? What about businesses and non-profits? What are the potential career paths for young people interested in civic, civil, and public service in the Los Angeles Basin? These are among the thousands of questions that students have about the city and region in which they live. There are a million more that they would have if they knew more about place, region, and history. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Designed as a supplement to the regular school year, LASA provides an intensive introduction to the infrastructure and institutions of greater Los Angeles for high school juniors who have expressed an interest in public, civic, and civil service. Participants gain the experience and knowledge necessary to better understand the intricacies – infrastructural, historical, political, economic, and otherwise – of the region in which they live, and build lasting bonds of friendship, camaraderie, and work experience with a diverse group of peers. Students who successfully complete the program during the junior year are placed in internships during their senior year, and will receive assistance and mentoring in the college application process. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Social connectedness is at the very heart of LASA’s mission. Our hope is that LASA will change the lives and career paths of hundreds of high school students in the region and will become an agent of change and community building across the Los Angeles basin. Throughout the year, LASA places particular emphasis on making certain that participants get to know one another personally, become familiar with one another’s region and/or neighborhood, and gain an appreciation for one another’s goals while participating in LASA (and beyond).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently in its first full year of operation, LASA brings together a diverse and select group of 20-25 students and 6-8 high school teachers from across the Los Angeles basin; 80% of the student participants are from public schools. The students begin their examination of Los Angeles during an intense four-day Summer Institute (scheduled for July 29th- August 1 in 2013). The summer program will be followed by once-a-month sessions on Saturdays from September through May. Depending on the topic on a given day, students will gather in the morning at the Huntington Library or at the Central Branch of the Los Angeles Public Library. Each session will focus on a particular theme or module and will be guided by experts on the given topic. In 2013-2014, the topics will include water, transportation, business, local and county governance, business, museums and cultural institutions, sports and entertainment, downtown, the LA River, police and criminal justice, food and housing, and the harbor complex. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Utilizing the astonishing archival resources of the Huntington Library and the Los Angeles Public Library, LASA will teach students about the historical growth of Los Angeles from the mid-nineteenth century forward. We will work from shared seminar readings (“homework” will be kept to a minimum), draw archival resources and personnel into our discussions, and build a collaborative working knowledge of Los Angeles history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our seminars will be but step one of a two-step process as our work “in the classroom” will be supplemented by fieldwork. For example, our investigation of the history of Los Angeles water resources and water engineering will start from in-depth study of regional water history, hydrology, and the many interfaces between water history and water politics. On that same afternoon, LASA will visit one or more key water facilities in order to have first-hand and practical knowledge as to contemporary water issues in the greater Los Angeles Basin. During the past year, for instance, and again with reference to water, LASA visited the Metropolitan Water District’s Weymouth Treatment Plant in Azusa and the San Gabriel Dam. Future site visits might include Hansen Dam or the LADWP’s Hyperion Wastewater Treatment Plant. In all site visits, LASA participants meet with key personnel who are in a position to contribute to our discussions and investigations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The academic and investigative part of LASA takes place during the junior year. For those students who faithfully attend and take part in the required number of monthly meetings, LASA will facilitate internships during the senior year in collaboration with Leadership LA, the non-profit arm of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, whose alumni work in agencies and institutions across the entire region.</p>"

Along the way, we will offer assistance to those students by way of collegiate counseling and mentoring internships across the basin.  Our LASA graduates will have foundational understanding of Los Angeles history and institutions as they move on in their education and into career paths.

  success: "Our metrics for success will include both simple and complex measures.  In the short term, can we show that LASA expands its service year to year?  Can we build more partnerships with more schools, more teachers, more students, and more institutions?  Can we facilitate student interest in moving on to collegiate education, and can we bring important college-success tools and strategies to the students?  We can, and will, track these issues by reference to each student and each student's post-LASA trajectory.\r\n\r\nOn a more complicated level, can we foster bonds of commonality, community, and connectedness between and among our diverse group(s) of students and teachers?  Will friendships develop across region, background, or socio-economic status which help bridge the distances and differences in Los Angeles?  Although tracking such issues or such progress will be difficult, we expect to monitor these aspects of LASA success by way of careful attention paid to student goals, student progress, and student evaluations.\r\n\r\nMuch farther out, can we say -- eventually -- that LASA has fostered bonds of connection and community which serve to make Los Angeles more efficient and more humane when LASA graduates enter the workforce in civil, civil, and other service to our region?"

    While there are a number of mid-career programs aimed at educating
    professionals about greater Los Angeles, its institutions and history, we
    have found no comparable programs which aim to serve high school students.
  vision: "<p>2050 is a long ways away.  But LASA is, in part, aimed precisely at that future.  37 years from now, can we point to a large body of LASA graduates?  More schools, more students, more teachers, more partnerships -- all serving to draw together regional ties of connection, education, and community?  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most exciting, can we look to a Los Angeles of 2050 in which LASA students have entered the realms of civil and civic service (professionally or otherwise) and can they, through the bonds established when they were much younger, find innovative ways to work together and to communicate beyond the challenges of size and metropolitan complexity?  Can LASA help pull our region together in common pursuit of the public good?</p>"

    answer: "Our metrics for success will include both simple and complex measures.  In the short term, can we show that LASA expands its service year to year?  Can we build more partnerships with more schools, more teachers, more students, and more institutions?  Can we facilitate student interest in moving on to collegiate education, and can we bring important college-success tools and strategies to the students?  We can, and will, track these issues by reference to each student and each student's post-LASA trajectory.\r\n\r\nOn a more complicated level, can we foster bonds of commonality, community, and connectedness between and among our diverse group(s) of students and teachers?  Will friendships develop across region, background, or socio-economic status which help bridge the distances and differences in Los Angeles?  Although tracking such issues or such progress will be difficult, we expect to monitor these aspects of LASA success by way of careful attention paid to student goals, student progress, and student evaluations.\r\n\r\nMuch farther out, can we say -- eventually -- that LASA has fostered bonds of connection and community which serve to make Los Angeles more efficient and more humane when LASA graduates enter the workforce in civil, civil, and other service to our region?"

    answer: "<p>LASA has been active since the summer of 2012. Our inaugural class of 20 high school juniors, one high school intern, two college interns, and seven high school teachers has met in a summer intensive Los Angeles history and culture seminar at The Huntington Library, and we've met one Saturday a month since then. Each Saturday session is focused on a different \"node\" of regional infrastructure. The day usually begins with a speaker and discussion, and then the LASA group goes into the field and to various sites which fit that day's themes. Our investigation of water started with a history overview of regional water development -- with rare documents -- and we then went to the dispersal facility for Colorado River water coming into the Metropolitan Water District system. Our business investigation took us to a private aerospace manufacturing facility, in business for 57 years, in Glendale, and a tour with that company's chief technologist. We ended that day with a discussion with Idealab executives and entrepreneurs. Our law enforcement day featured a morning with Connie Rice of the Advancement Project (we all read her book on the LAPD), and an afternoon tour with LAPD leaders of the new station and the regional 911 call center; we ended the day with a tour of SWAT team equipment and vehicles.  For our investigation of regional transit and transit history, we began our day with seminars by experts from The Getty and the Automobile Club of Southern California on the history of automobiles, freeways, and railroads in the region.  Following an on-foot journey from LAPL to Union Station, we met with the lead architectural design team tasked with re-imagining Union Station in the urban fabric of downtown (a stop at the Bradbury Building completed that day).  A more recent investigation of the entertainment landscape of Los Angeles took us to AEG's Staples Center, the GRAMMY Museum, the Disney Concert Hall, and an end-of-the-day Bunker Hill discussion with the architecture critic of the Los Angeles Times.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>We believe our LASA students are getting to know the region, getting to know one another, and beginning to build lasting ties to their home and one another through LASA's commitment to fostering   engaged civic participation and civic education.  We believe that we are off to a great start.</p>"

      While there are a number of mid-career programs aimed at educating
      professionals about greater Los Angeles, its institutions and history, we
      have found no comparable programs which aim to serve high school students.

    answer: "<p>2050 is a long ways away.  But LASA is, in part, aimed precisely at that future.  37 years from now, can we point to a large body of LASA graduates?  More schools, more students, more teachers, more partnerships -- all serving to draw together regional ties of connection, education, and community?  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most exciting, can we look to a Los Angeles of 2050 in which LASA students have entered the realms of civil and civic service (professionally or otherwise) and can they, through the bonds established when they were much younger, find innovative ways to work together and to communicate beyond the challenges of size and metropolitan complexity?  Can LASA help pull our region together in common pursuit of the public good?</p>"
