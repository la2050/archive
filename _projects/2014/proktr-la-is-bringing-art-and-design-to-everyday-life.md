Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): |-
  The project will be unrolled in 3 phases:
   
   1) Foundation - 8 weeks
   
   a. Leadership
   - Michelle Paul, founder of Proktr, will serve as chief executive. 
   - An advisory board will be formed to help ensure the efficacy of the project. The board will include representation from the established art world, local businesses and digital media experts.
   
   b. Opportunity Assessment. We will conduct research to assess:
   - Artist Engagement: Identify how to best support artists to secure their participation.
   - Venue Engagement: Identify how to best serve venue partners and help drive the goals of their business.
   - Stakeholder Engagement: Get in touch with museums, galleries and other invested bodies to identify points of collaboration.
   - Audience Engagement: Conduct research to understand how to best serve current audiences and target new ones.
   - Legal Discovery: Understand the legal assets needed to execute the project at scale.
   - Digital Audit: Find websites that execute similar functions to determine best practices for user experience.
   
   2) Development - 8 weeks
   
   a. Produce a Program Development Strategy.
   - Employ the insights from the opportunity assessment to define strategic imperatives (what program features must be included for the overall project to be successful).
   - Produce a program roadmap that outlines how to bring the program to market that includes: 
   1. What organizations to form strategic partnerships with. 
   2. How to get artists and venues on to the platform. 
   3. The curating/vetting principles that define how we match art and venues. 
   4. Editorial plan to ensure comprehensive, compelling coverage of art + design programming.
   5. How to drive broad awareness and traffic to the website (leveraging partnerships, social media, etc.)
   
   b. Digital Development
   - Employ the insights from digital audit to define the precise features of the website for a “beta” launch.
   - Create a beta site to test the functionality of the site among a small, curated community.
   - Refine the website for the public launch.
   
   3) Execution - ongoing
   
   a. Program Launch
   - Execute against the program roadmap.
   - Consistently seek feedback from the advisory board, artists, venues, and users for program refinements and enhancements.
   
   b. Digital Launch
   - Push the website live.
   - Conduct analytics to test and refine the website.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Proktr will make Los Angeles the best place to create today by increasing the
  visibility of our creative residents, increasing ease and ability of
  participating in our creative community and inspiring all Angelenos (not just
  those already participating in the art world) with art in their everyday
  lives. 
   
   In 2050 Proktr will ensure Los Angeles remains the best place to be an artist or designer and that we are known for that fact. Our reputation as a global leader in art will be solidified and our ability to attract and retain human creative capital will be second to none.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: |-
  Proktr seeks to bring value to the following groups:
   
   Artists:
   - We will increase their visibility by multiplying the places their work can be discovered. 
   - In time, we hope to facilitate the sale of art, contributing to the viability of being an artist in LA. 
   - Through our partnerships with curators, we create another avenue of exposure for their work to breakthrough to the traditional art + design institutions and patrons. 
   
   Small Businesses: 
   - We believe that placing notable, sought out art experiences within local business will make them a destination beyond their standard goods and services and they will gain good will through shared social media and word of mouth. 
   
   Museums + Galleries:
   - Proktr will serve as another channel for traditional museums and galleries to be discovered. 
   - As an aggregating, one-stop location, museums and galleries will benefit by becoming more visible among people more broadly interested in art and design; not just people specifically interested in their institution. This has particular benefit to smaller, lesser known art and design destinations. 
   - By bringing an editorial voice to art and design experiences, Proktr can serve to encourage participation. We will speak to, in a tangible / visual manner, what / why an experience is worth your time - not how it fits in the bigger picture of art criticism. 
   
   Minorities
   - There is a well-documented discrepancy between the current art going public (9% minority) and general public (34% minority). We want to lessen this discrepancy particularly as this city and our nation are projected to be ‘majority-minority’ by the year 2050. By making the best creative work more accessible, more people will have a greater opportunity to become part of the art going public. 
   .
   Overlooked Neighborhoods
   - Cultural pockets such as Downtown, Westwood, Culver City, or Mid-City are largely separate from neighborhoods where artists live and work such as Boyle Heights, Lincoln Heights, Cypress Park or Echo Park. Showcasing the work of community members in that community contributes to neighborhood vitality and strong sense of place. 
   
   Greater Los Angeles
   - The economy of our city in general can benefit from this non-traditional ‘stimulant’. 
   - Our citizens will gain surprise, delight, pride and inspiration from this program.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Sew, a strategy led creative agency based in Los Angeles has committed to
  joining the advisory board, providing 30 hours a month pro-bono business,
  marketing and digital consulting, as well as discounted digital and creative
  development. Sew has produced social impact campaigns, digital products and
  marketing strategies for brands like Gap, Ford, Verizon Wireless, AAA, 20th
  Century Fox and more. 
   
   Though there are no other confirmed partnerships, warm relationships have been developed through the current production of Protkr at museums such as MOCA, LACMA, The Hammer, SMMOA, PMCA, The Huntington, The Broad and at many galleries in the city. Through these relationships we hope to establish long term partners, advisory board members, and potential editorial contributors.
