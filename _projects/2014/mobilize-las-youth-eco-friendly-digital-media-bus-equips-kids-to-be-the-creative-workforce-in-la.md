Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  We will work with an industry partner to purchase and retrofit an RV into an
  eco-friendly digital media classroom that runs on biodiesel and has a solar
  powered generator. This will allow us to more than double the number of kids
  we serve in a year and expand our geographical reach. Our programs are well
  tested and beyond the pilot stage so having the physical resource a new, cost
  effective vehicle will shift us into high gear on our mission to use this LA
  program as a model and incubator for digital media programs across the
  country.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  A more creative LA happens when all our kids get to work on a project that is
  their own idea, one that they write, film and edit and see through to
  completion. It happens when they get positive feed back and recognition from
  an audience when their finished film is screened. It happens when kids realize
  they have something to offer. A new eco-friendly production studio-on-wheels
  that brings media arts instruction to at risk and under-resourced youth will
  help Los Angeles be the best place to create by making sure this happens in
  every corner of LA. As the second largest city and school system in the US, LA
  serves as a microcosm of the challenges faced across the country, its
  demographic changes represent the changing face of America. Hispanics and
  African Americans make up over 80% of the school age population but have the
  least access to the technology and skills required to thrive in a diverse and
  creative workforce. It’s commonplace to find in local high schools, one laptop
  cart with 20 computers per 600 students. In this city of over 268,000
  millionaires, the entertainment capital of the world, the disparity between
  neighborhoods that are 15 miles south of the Hollywood sign and the ones just
  north, is a waste of human capital we can’t afford. LA is losing good paying
  creative jobs to states like Georgia, Louisiana, New York and New Mexico. Film
  Industry professionals and their Guilds are answering the State’s call to
  diversify their membership if they want to see an increase in film incentives
  by reaching out to programs like ours who help develop the next generation of
  the creative workforce. Using our up-to-date equipment and software, industry
  mentors encourage students to express themselves through the process of making
  a film. Kids engage in a way that fosters creativity and requires critical
  thinking, collaboration, listening, time management and creative
  problem-solving skills. A 2006 Ready to Work Study found 72% of employers said
  that creativity is the number one skill they seek when hiring. Los Angeles can
  be a leader and a model for a the rest of the country by investing in all our
  kids, no matter what their zip code, to prepare them to think creatively and
  to imagine things that have yet to come into existence. Our youth are our
  greatest resource and we need to foster their talent and celebrate the
  diversity their voices bring to our media landscape if we want to sustain Los
  Angeles as the creative media capital in 2050.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Because our program challenges students to create stories around issues in
  their community, it will benefit all of Los Angeles. They’re not just making a
  fun movie, they’re making a fun movie with a message. It opens kids up to the
  world around them and helps them find their voice and discover ways to engage
  and affect change within their own communities. It also benefits foster and
  incarcerated teens like Ebony and Kamonie. Abandoned by her mother and shoved
  into foster care, Ebony hid under a hoodie. But when asked on camera what she
  wanted to be, she whispered “a poet.” The poem she wrote for her mom became
  the basis of her film, “Need You”. Ebony’s counselor said that in the month
  she’d worked on the bus, she’d finally begun to speak up in therapy. Through
  the medium of film, Ebony found her voice. 
   
   The Mobile Film Classroom doesn’t just give kids a voice, it also gives them life skills and job training. The process of making a film fosters creativity and requires critical thinking, collaboration, listening, time management and problem solving skills. In a world where video is employed more and more by businesses, giving marketable job skills to kids that often have trouble finding employment, benefits our greater economy.
   As director, our student Kamonie, collaborated with his team to write and shoot a film about growing up around gangs and making mistakes; with the message their past should not predict their future. But when got to editing, Kamonie said, “I can’t do this.” We showed him how. His team finished a day early so he had time to teach other kids how to edit. He went from “I can’t” to “let me show you how.” 
   
   Kids like Ebony and Kamonie, have gone on to re-engage in school and in their future. A twenty-twelve study by the National Endowment for the Arts, found that kids who participate in the arts are five times more likely to graduate from high school than their peers who don’t. Less dropouts and more kids that feel they have worth benefits themselves, their families and communities.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  This year we are partnering with the County of Los Angeles Public library at 4
  libraries in East Los Angeles to provide afterschool filmmaking workshops.
  We’ve worked with the County Library since 2011. Another ongoing partnership
  is with the non profit Hollywood Heart, that provides arts training to LA area
  at risk youth, including a Summer arts camp for teens impacted by HIV/AIDS.
  This August we’ll be leading our 5 documentary film workshop with them since
  2012. We’ve partnered with Green Dot Public Schools, leading two workshops at
  their Animo South LA High School campus, The City of Los Angeles Public
  Library, LA’s Best, The Geena Davis Institute for Gender in Media, LACOE
  Juvenile Court Schools at Pacific Lodge and Camp David Gonzales, Aviva Center,
  LAUSD, Malibu Boys and Girls Club.
   We have been in discussion with industry partners to help us purchase, customize and equip a new eco friendly digital media bus. We’ve had support of a leading production vehicle company as they supplied parking and maintenance support for our current vehicle since 2012. These potential partners bring expertise in designing production vehicles, state of the art video and editing equipment and software and entertainment professionals that mentor our students in the most current trends in the industry.
   What has made these collaborations work is our flexibility in programming (we customize the projects to fit the interests of that organization), our mobility to provide access to technology and a shared belief in the need to help all LA kids express their creativity as a way of strengthening communities.
