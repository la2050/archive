Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  If the LA2050 Challenge Grant were to be awarded to The Sabio Crossroads
  Creative Tech Training Program (Creative Tech) it would be implemented via a
  three phased approach: 1) intake; 2) intensive tech training; 3) case
  management & follow-up.
   The intake phase would take place the first three months of the program, where by Crossroads would the first market the Creative Tech programming to its current list of over 200 clients. They will be given information about the program and be given pre-work.
   Then an interview committee will interview individuals that have completed the pre-work and that attended one of the information sessions. Ten individuals will be selected to move on to the final phase of the intake phase, the hands-on pre-screen.
   The second phase of the program will be the intensive accelerated learning program, with the goal of creating innovative tech creators that represent the rich cultural fabric of Los Angeles. We will utilize an immersive and intensive learning environment to create a workforce that sets the standard for entry-level tech-media technologists. In addition, the training program will simultaneously serve to cure the current imbalance in the existing technology workforce, which suffers from a largely homogeneous make up. 
   This tech training can be completed in 12 weeks, where the cohort will meet from 8am until 6pm, Monday – Friday, with a seasoned, senior-level software architect acting as their trainer and mentor. The training will be project based, and centered on the delivery of a new media software product. The lead instructor has a proven track record of already running these types of intensive training program for the past 12 months, with a 100% job placement rate. This model of intensive training has also been successfully implemented in various parts of the country, such as San Francisco and New York City.
   Because the Creative Tech cohort will be constituted with individuals from communities plagued with violence, and may have been previously incarcerated, to ensure they receive the emotional and social support required to fully re-entry the workforce, and community at large, the fellows will be required to have weekly meetings with their case managers throughout the 12 weeks of tech training.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  The Sabio Crossroads Creative Tech Cohort will make Los Angeles the best place
  to create 12 months following our LA2050 Challenge Grant because it will
  produce exceptionally well trained web creators, that are also ethnically
  diverse, which match the cultural fabric of the City. Once this Creative Tech
  program is launched, lessons will be learned, the Fellows will be out in the
  workforce collaborating with various media professionals, and contributing to
  the growing knowledge base of the program, and the program will be scaled to
  serve hundreds of other diverse Fellows throughout the City. 
   Los Angeles is an exceptionally diverse community, with individuals from the entire world making this their home. The largest cultural group is Latino at 58%, followed by 42% Non-Hispanic Whites, approximately 11% Asian, and approximately 10% African American. 
   Los Angeles is also undeniably the Creative Capital of the world, with many exceptional large studios situated in Los Angeles County. In addition to the large formal media complex currently operating throughout the LA region, there is also a thriving independent film and creative arts community that is also creating opportunities for various type of entrepreneurial creators.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Three separate groups will benefit as a result of the LA2050 Grant Challenge
  Grant: 1) Six Latino and African American Creative Tech Fellows (clients of
  Crossroads), 2) Sabio, and 3) SoCalCrossroads,. 
   Six Crossroads Clients, 50% Latino and 50% African American young adults, ages 18-35, both male and female, will be selected to become Creative Tech Fellows. Each of the Fellows will receive a laptop to train months three – six, also, they will benefit from the 12 week intensive tech training, as well as the case management and the follow-on six-week professional development training offered by Sabio and Crossroads. The six Latino and African American individuals will most likely be members of the low-income community, with low-job prospects in the tech sector. Although Crossroads currently has funding resources to help their clients secure some vocational training, they do not have sufficient funding to provide technical training; therefore, but for the LA2050 Challenge Grant. Once these six individuals complete the program, they will have skills that are in high demand, not only in the creative capital of the world, but basically in any major metropolitan area. Enabling them to become transformative story-tellers and possibly tech entrepreneurs, if they so desire. Once they have the web development skills, the trajectory of their lives will be completely changed as a result of this program.
   
   Sabio is a developer training program born out of necessity, desire and hope. The necessity of bringing more women and minorities into the world of technology. A desire to see a diverse workforce that’s vibrant and innovative. And a hope to uplift the communities that suffer from the highest rates of unemployment and worst educational resources to a higher socioeconomic status through technology training.
   There is an opportunity for a better life waiting for various diverse creators in Los Angeles. An opportunity to acquire a skill set that that hiring managers and entrepreneurs are anxious to find. A chance to earn your way into a career that enjoys an unemployment rate half that of the national average. 
   Crossroads is a non-profit 501c(3) organization that was created to assist under privileged individuals who come from low-income families in violence plagued communities. Their objective is to lead them to a Healthy, Peaceful and Productive lifestyle through prevention, intervention & re-entry services.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Both Crossroads and Sabio are organizations that are deeply rooted in the
  local Los Angeles community, and have cultivated a number of key-strategic
  partnership throughout their tenure, and are eager to collaborate with other
  organizations also looking to make a positive impact on the lives of young
  adults. 
   
   For example, Crossroads was born out of a collaboration with St. Francis Medical Center, and their’ focus is on addressing youth and gang violence. The St. Francis Medial Center has been an instrumental partner since their inception, providing facilities, volunteers, and financial support throughout the years. 
   
   Similarly, Sabio is also a local Los Angeles organization that has benefited from various joint ventures with various organizations. For example, HubLA was one of their first collaborators, allowing Sabio to use space at a reduced rate, and also providing marketing capacity. Sabio has collaborated with other area nonprofits such as DIY Girls to host Learn To Code workshops, and local college alumni associations to do tech training. 
   Both organizations believe in the power of collaboration and understand that relationships and partnerships foster positive results and outcomes. That same approach and philosophy will be employed, and will be central, in the Creative Tech Cohort: 
   
   Sabio and Crossroads have developed relationships with the following organizations, and are ready to collaborate with them to bring additional capacity to the Creative Tech Cohort: 
   MasWired – a Latino online media platform features tech creators and innovators. This online platform needs web interns to help build and modify its online content. 
   Disney – has agreed to review resumes and to provide interviews to individuals with full-stack web development expertise.
   WalMart – Bentonville, AK – various opportunities are available for individuals that have full-stack web development expertise. They have reached-out and are interested in reviewing Sabio Fellow’s resumes to identify potential candidates to be interviewed.
   TechWorkers – San Ramon, CA- front-end web development opportunities
