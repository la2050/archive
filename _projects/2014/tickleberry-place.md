Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  We will fundraise the funds and become certified as B Corporation. Once we
  have the funds we can do the following:
   Obtain a lease or purchase property
   Purchase equipment
   Design the space for the needs of the families
   Marketing and awareness
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Currently, children in South LA experience many injustices related to play.
  There are only a handful of indoor play facilities in the area. The play
  facilities that do exist promote play but also promote unhealthful eating,
  such as Chuck-E-Cheese and the play gyms at McDonalds. Lack of green space,
  play space and healthy food choice options all contribute to the growing rate
  of obesity among children in LA County. Tickleberry Place will combat the
  trifold issues of lack of play space, lack of green space, and lack of healthy
  food by providing a space where children and families can eat, play, and learn
  about healthy living. 
   Our children our exposed to a large number of harsh chemicals and toxic materials. Tickleberry Place will be a play space made from environmentally friendly materials. In addition, Tickleberry Place will use products and methods to keep the play space toxic free. This is particularly important as about 1 in 11 children have asthma in Los Angeles. 
   
   Children can play in the play gym or participate in community building games facilitated by the Tickleberry team. When children are done playing,they can eat healthy organic produce grown in Tickleberry’s garden. Food will be healthful but also culturally relevant to the majority black and Latino residents in the neighborhood near Tickleberry.
   
   What will distinguish Tickleberry from other indoor play gyms is its focus on education for families. Through a partnership with educational organizations, Tickleberry will offer classes, workshops, and events for parents on topics such as gardening, healthy eating, sustainable living, and healthy child development. 
   
   Our goal is for Tickleberry Place to be a community hub for health and wellness. With a local space that caters toward fun and well being, Tickleberry Place will help make LA the best place to learn in 2050.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  This will benefit families in South and Central Los Angeles, but it is not
  limited to other neighborhoods and communities.
   
   Tickleberry Place was designed to meet the unique needs of South LA. Historically, South LA has experienced violence, lack of access to safe play spaces to children, limited access to healthy foods. This limits opportunities for children to play and for parents to connect in a public space about values such as healthy living for families. Tickleberry caters to this demographic of Black and Latino families with children ages 6 months to 10 years old. Tickleberry begins in South LA as it is the highest need region for issues of food access and play space. However, the location of Tickleberry makes it accessible to the greater Los Angeles’ Community. Tickleberry welcomes participation from families across the city. Eventually, it is the goal of the founders to expand Tickleberry into other regions of the city, so that families will not have to travel far for safe, environmentally friendly, healthful play spaces for children.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  As of right now, we don’t have any partners or collaborators on the project.
  Having a partner would be a great opportunity for collaborating on this cause
  of creating healthy and sustainable play spaces in Los Angeles. We are open to
  having partners and are looking for them.
