  The LA Fund launched the summer 2014 TIP pilot with 17 LAUSD students matched
  with 13 business partners to identify best practices and challenges to
  expansion. This pilot will directly inform the LAUSD’s planning for
  district-wide expansion of internships and Linked Learning programs as well as
  support LA Fund Board Member Mayor Garcetti’s goal of 10,000 summer jobs.
  Implementation in 2015 will focus on the following components:
   
   School and student outreach: For the pilot year, 8 LAUSD high schools were targeted. For 2015, we will target 25 high schools with Linked Learning pathways. Our goal is to support between 60 and 72 students and provide them with highly competitive paid internships and support.
   
   Integrated coaching program: The LA Fund hired a seasoned coach with deep experience in mentoring and training youth to support our pilot cohort. We will continue with and expand this model, which included training on business skills, workplace culture, on-line communication and networking strategies, professional and personal growth and goal setting, as well as ongoing one-on-one support.
   
   Business partner outreach and support: The LA Fund and its Board will again leverage relationships to recruit business partners and provide high-touch support. We will again hire a program coordinator to serve as a liaison with LAUSD and support businesses as they, in many cases, create new internship programs.
   
   Communications and documentation: We both filmed our pilot program and asked interns to document their experiences to understand the impact and challenges of the program and to create communication tools for LAUSD and LA Fund for program expansion. Video and written journals and blogs are being edited and will soon be pushed out on social media and other channels to engage the community.
   
   Planning and project management support: We will work with LAUSD to support expansion of Linked Learning programs, business partnerships, and student internships.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  In LAUSD, 80% of students come from economically disadvantaged communities and
  do not have the educational opportunities and support systems they need to
  achieve their potential. They often lack professional role models and stable
  community support systems, fail to complete high school, and face high rates
  of poverty. Furthermore, we know that competing in today's economy requires
  more than a high school degree, and real economic opportunity requires much
  more. Providing meaningful internships and support not only engages students
  in their high school studies but also helps them build the confidence they
  need to pursue college and careers.
   
   Helping schools make connections with businesses, providing students with internships, and supporting the growth of Linked Learning will be transformational for LAUSD high schools. Businesses participating during the pilot year have responded with a strong desire to continue their involvement and others have heard through word of mouth and want to join next year. Schools, teachers and parents are thrilled that their students are getting access to unique and rewarding internship opportunities. Students have raved about their work experiences, and how they have developed new relationships and learned new skills. LAUSD is primed to expand their Linked Learning pathways and need partners like the LA Fund who can help make connections with businesses and create meaningful opportunities for our students. The time is right, the partners are in place, we have experience in providing internships for students, and have the capacity to grow this work.
   
   It is our goal to build upon this momentum in the coming year and work in partnership with LAUSD and continue to support the Mayor’s summer jobs program to reach more schools and students and transform the high school experience.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: |-
  There are four constituents that benefit from an expanded TIP program:
   
   Students and their families: A summer internship is a transformative experience that has long-lasting effects on a student’s academic life and future career. Selected LAUSD students receive paid internships (at least the minimum wage per hour) at leading, high-profile businesses that are in their fields of interest. Developing partnerships that will provide students the unique skills and experiences garnered by an internship can positively impact the workforce of our city in the future (National League of Cities, 2012; Darling-Hammond and Post, 2000). This has an exponential potential to affect students, their families, and the communities they live in.
   
   High-profile, LA-based businesses: These businesses are able to onboard stellar LAUSD talent to provide meaningful internship opportunities within their community. Businesses are able to hire LAUSD talent in an easy fashion given the work the LA Fund performs in sourcing LAUSD talent and providing an integrated coaching program. Anecdotally, the businesses participating in TIP are reporting a boost in their company’s morale.
   
   The City of Los Angeles: More established links between businesses, schools, and students only serve to benefit the quality of life in Los Angeles by increasing employment and creating closer social bonds with public schools and local communities.
   
   Those who access social media: The experiences of TIP interns are being distilled in a way that is easily accessible and digestible via social media. Students and businesses from around the world can learn about the experiences of TIP interns and business partners.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Business partners during the pilot year were carefully selected based on their
  leadership and innovation in their respective industries, their excitement to
  host a TIP intern and take part in the TIP pilot program, and their
  willingness to ensure that the three factors for a successful collaboration
  would be met:
   
   1. Commitment to pay at least the minimum wage per hour for each TIP intern.
   
   2. Ensure a meaningful work experience that would challenge a TIP intern and inform his/her future career direction.
   
   3. Provide the on-the-job mentorship and training needed to ensure a positive experience. In some cases, the TIP internship is a student’s first experience in a professional setting.
   
   The TIP 2014 pilot included the following, high-profile internships:
   
   Atom Factory (entertainment)
   Bad Robot Productions (entertainment)
   Border Grill (culinary)
   Chernin Entertainment (entertainment)
   El Rey (entertainment)
   Fullscreen (entertainment)
   Illumination Entertainment (entertainment)
   Kaiser Permanente (healthcare)
   Mattel, Inc. (consumer)
   Michael S. Smith, Inc. (design)
   Salem Partners (finance)
   Suzanne Goin’s Tavern Restaurant (culinary)
   The LA Fund (nonprofit education)
   
   JJ and Katie Abrams financially supported the research and development of the TIP program and Samsung Electronics provided a cash donation and an in-kind donation of 15 Samsung Galaxy Note Tablets for interns to support the social media component of the TIP pilot.
   
   The LA Fund has received positive feedback from the above business partners regarding the work of each TIP intern and their experience in acting as a host. It is our hope to work with all business partners during summer 2015. We are also beginning conversations with new businesses now for summer of 2015 participation.
