  All of Us campaign includes a core team of student leaders who organize around
  the collective vision to bring mental health to the forefront in the Los
  Angeles community. The core team consists of the following components: 
   
   (1) PROGRAMMING Committee organizes events and workshops for the campaign.
   (2) MARKETING/MESSAGING Committee advertises and promotes the campaign and its’ events.
   (3) RESEARCH Committee will conduct studies and analyze data to ensure appropriate programs are being conducted for relevant mental health issues.
   (4) ADVOCACY/POLICY Committee will integrate the needs of various communities, including but not limited to: LGBTQ* community, the Los Angeles Unified School District, the homeless community, etc., in conversations and projects for the campaign.
   (5) COMMUNITY RELATIONS AND OUTREACH Committee serves as the liaison between community-based organizations and community leaders in Los Angeles and the campaign to revitalize Los Angeles’s commitment to mental health.
   (6) CAMPUS OUTREACH Committee coordinates with on-campus groups and organizations to engage the undergraduate student body through advocacy and service.
   
   We plan to prioritize mental health by hosting various workshops and events on our campus to engage the student body and the Los Angeles community. We will establish mental health as a priority on the agenda for the University of California system. We will host a large-scale conference later in the year to facilitate workshops and open caucus spaces for the Los Angeles community to learn about the importance of mental health and to voice their perspectives on relevant issues surrounding the topic of mental health. Curriculum will be developed by addressing the issues in a structured way to encourage a safe space and build discussion. In order to ensure the success and the longevity of this campaign, we have collaborated with various organizations on campus and plan to work with off-campus organizations to build a larger coalition and a stronger support base.This campaign will, furthermore, encompass media campaigns, visible demonstrations, and educational opportunities.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  In the present, All of Us seeks to empower UCLA students to challenge and
  redefine the way we think about health; we should not only prioritize our
  physical health, but our mental health as well. Its purpose to break down
  barriers and stigma will, in turn, while foster intellectual and personal
  growth of our students, despite the stressful nature of college. In addition,
  the campaign will provide a platform to advocate for a healthy campus where
  students feel safe to pursue acquiring assistance for all mental health
  needs. 
   
   The vision of All of Us is to create an impact on the LA community; policies and programs implemented at UCLA would change the culture around mental health in Los Angeles. The perception of seeking assistance for mental health and maintaining it is directly related to the overall success of students in their post-graduate lives. Ultimately, students are the agents of change for the future. By creating leaders who will exercise the value of prioritizing mental health, the LA community benefits.
   
   All of Us seeks to create a healthier Los Angeles community. Today, we hope to solidify a foundation for UCLA students and members of the LA community to think critically about our mental health’s relationship to our overall well-being. For tomorrow, we aspire to catalyze the shift in societal perception to ensure our community’s success.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  All of Us, a campaign founded by UCLA undergraduate students, will prioritize
  mental health in LA county by starting with the 28,000 undergraduate students
  of UCLA. Mental health is not one-size-fits-all. To benefit the largest group
  we will tailor workshops, events, and educational literature to specific
  communities: first year students, international students, student athletes,
  veterans, students who identify as part of the LGBTQIA community, and students
  who identify as part of specific cultural communities. But mental health does
  not stop when a student graduates. Our campaign will provide continuing care
  resources for postgraduate students as they move beyond the UCLA community. 
   
   Through collaboration with on-campus entities, like the Healthy Campus Initiative, we hope to advocate for the well-being or faculty, administrators, and UCLA employees. 
   
   All of Us realizes that the UCLA community is fluid and intertwined with the greater Los Angeles community. Through our Community Outreach committee we hope to extend the benefits of this campaign throughout the county, particularly to the children of the Los Angeles Unified School District.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Our main partners for this campaign are confirmed and include the USAC Office
  of the President, the Student Wellness Commission and Active Minds at UCLA. We
  will also be working closely with UCLA CAPS (Counseling And Psychological
  Services) to ensure that all of our messaging and programming is accurate and
  sensitive of the parties we hope to reach with our campaign. Furthermore, CAPS
  will train all campaign members in topics pertaining to mental health through
  QPR and Mental Health First Aid training.
   
   
   The USAC Office of the President is responsible for presiding over the Student Body Council and provides services and resources for the UCLA student body through advocacy, education and programming. This year, USAC president Devin Murphy has adopted the platform of mental health revitalization and has begun work on this mission with the creation of the All of Us mental health campaign. The Office of the President has already appointed its own committee, consisting of directors and staff members, solely for the All of Us Campaign and has started work on the campaign materials that will reach not only UCLA students, but also individuals throughout the LA community.
   
   The Student Wellness Commission at UCLA serves to address the needs of student health on campus by creating informational and interactive programs, services, and resources to ensure physical and psychological well-being along with academic success. SWC brings many years of health programming, education, and marketing experience to All of Us.
   
   Active Minds is the student voice for mental health advocacy on college campuses throughout the nation, creating a variety of events, workshops and outreach programs to spread awareness and reduce stigma surrounding mental health.
   
   Three factors critical to the success of collaboration are (1) We can efficiently create a structure to delegate tasks and get work done in the most efficient manner possible with our staff of over 100 people. (2) We have access to mental health professionals as a resource throughout the creation and execution of the campaign. (3) Student Wellness Commission has led a successful campaign, 7000 in Solidarity, to raise awareness of sexual assault on our campus. This experience is vital it programming for All of Us.
