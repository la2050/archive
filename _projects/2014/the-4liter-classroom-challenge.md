Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  The 4Liter Challenge has already come a long way, and DIGDEEP is ready to
  accelerate the project into LA County schools!
   
   In 2013, we worked with local educators to draft the 4Liters Curriculum, which has been given a foreword by Catarina de Albuquerque, the UN Special Rapporteur on the Human Right to Water and Sanitation. Then we piloted the 4Liter Challenge in two LA classrooms. 
   
   In 2014/2015, we'll work with LA County teachers to plan 4Liter Challenges in their classrooms. We'll design and mail program-funded kits to educators, and we'll visit local schools with a custom pop-up exhibit. We'll also reach out to student participants and their teachers through our social media channels and a traditional email campaign. 
   
   Finally, we'll train a dedicated staff at DIGDEEP HQ in downtown LA. They'll maintain and improve our online tool (at 4liters.org/teach), work with educators to streamline implementation, visit local and national conferences, grow partnerships, and develop new resources like lessons, videos, and infographics.
   
   Having developed and piloted the 4Liter Challenge, we're in a unique position to scale quickly!
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  We believe that by 2050 LA students should lead the nation in understanding
  the value of our freshwater and how to conserve it. 
   
   LA is the largest city in California and the epicenter of an historic drought. But LA is also a national leader in conservation, technology, media, and entertainment.
   
   By bringing the 4Liter Challenge into LA classrooms, we'll help young Angelinos stop taking water for granted. We'll make water - as a nexus of science, economics, and well-being - a focus of public and private education. We'll prepare LA to deal with future water challenges while building support for populations without reliable water access. 
   
   Together, we'll change the way Americans think about water.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The 4Liter Challenge will primarily benefit students in grades 6-12 in LA
  county schools - private, public, and charter. By changing the way students
  think about water, 4Liters will also positively affect water consumption at
  home.
   
   The 4Liter Challenge will benefit teachers, by providing a flexible, easy-to-use tool that meets new Common-Core standards.
   
   Finally, the 4Liter Challenge will benefit water-poor communities in the US and abroad. Just like a runner uses a marathon to fight breast cancer, 4Liters classrooms can choose to use their Challenge to raise funds for water access projects. Many of these funds will stay right here in the US, where DIGDEEP is the only global water non-profit working in affected communities. 
   
   Not only will 4Liters change the way LA students think about water, it will make a real impact in communities the world over.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Factors critical to all proposed collaborations include: securing funding,
  maintaining the non-political and non-religious nature of the program,
  responding effectively to teacher feedback, and sharing a common vision for
  water education and sustainability. 
   
   Educators for Excellence (confirmed) 
   E4E provides direct access to teacher-activists committed to improving LA education. Though they focus primarily on policy issues, E4E also promotes issue-area learning. We have worked together in the past.
   
   LA Unified School District (unconfirmed) 
   Collaboration with LAUSD would give us direct access to educators in over 1200 schools and a seal of approval to ease adoption. This collaboration is by no means necessary for the success of 4Liters, but we think it's a smart step. LAUSD Associate Superintendent Al Cortes and Health Education Programs Coordinator Lori Vollandt have expressed interest in the program. 
   
   Archdiocese of Los Angeles (pending, unconfirmed)
   The LA Archdiocese operates one of the largest private elementary and middle-school systems in LA County. Collaboration with the Archdiocese would give us direct access to educators and a seal of approval to ease adoption. We are in talks with their Director, Msgr. Pilato.
   
   California Department of Water Resources (unconfirmed)
   The CADWR is the agency responsible for managing and protecting California's water. They have direct links to educators, policy-makers, and funders that could benefit the program. The CADWR also has a direct interest in changing Californian water attitudes.
   
   Office of the Mayor (unconfirmed) 
   Mayor Garcetti has expressed an interest in improving the way Angelinos care for their resources. Collaboration with the Mayor's office would provide public visibility for the project and open the door to funding from LA institutions.
   
   Once a year, DIGDEEP opens the 4Liter Challenge to the public, uniting organizations like Take Part, One.org, Hurley H2O, and teams from major corporations, faith communities, and college campuses. All of these partners are confirmed, and their participation provides national exposure to new teachers.
