Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  We will implement this project in three phases. The first phase is our
  research and discovery stage. In this phase we will work with our partners to
  refine the concept and design of our app. We will also solicit feedback from
  the community. The second phase is development. Here our tech partner will
  build the app. The third phase is the release, where we will begin to roll out
  the app to the community and work with our media partners to get the word out.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  As the largest demographic and drivers of new business growth, the success of
  Latin@s is paramount to ensuring Los Angeles County is the best place to
  create today and in 2050. Despite this favorable trend there are innumerable
  obstacles deterring Latin@ advancement such as high unemployment rates among
  others. For those finding relief within the informal economy creation is an
  indispensable necessity for survival. By placing language accessible
  technological tools & resources at a finger’s touch our project will serve to
  support current entrepreneurial activity and stimulate future formal business
  ownership.
   
   As the current largest demographic in the county, and drivers of new business growth, Latin@s are poised to become tomorrow’s largest workforce and business owners. According to the 2013 census Latin@s make up 48.3% of the population in Los Angeles County. By 2050 Latin@s will surely continue to have an overwhelming presence in the county. It has also been noted that Latin@ owned businesses in Los Angeles are increasing in number at three times the national rate. 
   
   This project will digitize and thus amplify existing local Latin@ networks resulting in greater connectivity throughout Los Angeles County. Expanding these networks will facilitate and stimulate a greater volume of reciprocal exchanges and activities among its members both on and offline. Economic activity will be multiplied as access to a digital marketplace will provide greater market reach and thus increase the likelihood of increased earnings. Increased earnings for Latin@ marginal workers will serve to provide greater economic sustainability and provide a possible pathway from informal to formal business ownership.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  This project can benefit anybody but it’s particularly intended for Los
  Angeles County’s Latin@ marginal workers. In a 2005 Economic Roundtable study,
  Los Angeles County’s informal labor force has a low estimate of 322,400 to a
  high of 972,500. They are independent and self-sufficient. They are not
  necessarily tied to a particular industry but often make use of social
  networks and kinship ties for work. They are “millennials” and older folks.
  Some only speak Spanish while others are bilingual or speak only English. They
  are citizens and the undocumented. Some lack formal employment but are still
  generating income through various activities in the informal economy. These
  folks are domestic workers and day laborers. They include women setting up
  pop-up taco shops and pupuserias on San Fernando Valley sidewalks to men
  selling leather belts down central LA streets. They are seamstresses who offer
  clothing alterations from home and the countless mechanics fixing cars
  wherever they stand. They include the senoras and senores selling tamales in
  front of supermarkets; sobadoras and sobadores straightening out backs in
  shacks. This project will also benefit Latin@ artists wanting to make
  available their paintings, prints, buttons, books, CDs, videos, films, and
  other works of art for purchase. Or musicians such as mariachis and DJ’s
  looking to advertise their services, including young hip hop heads, punks, and
  bandas. Tiangius is a cause, linking and sharing creative ideas, products, new
  media, and stories.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Our development partner is Arroyo Labs, www.arroyolabs.com. They have worked
  with companies such as peet's cofee and k-swiss among others. They will be
  providing the technical leadership and expertise on the project. They will be
  implementing and maintaining the technology that drives the marketplace.
   
   In addition we will be tapping into our network of non-profit organizations across Los Angeles to help bring the apps to their respective Spanish speaking constituents such as Tia Chucha's Centro Cultural, MEND, Youth Speak Collective, and Guayaba Kitchen. Over the years Elusive Minds Productions has also developed relationships with Spanish language media outlets such as LATV Live, Mun2, and Telemundo.
