Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  DSTL Arts has been in operation for the past year and a half providing
  mentorship in the arts to a cohort of 8 creative, at-risk youth, and this
  grant will help us expand our capacity and infrastructure by establishing a
  central gallery space that will act as a hub for managing student mentorships,
  the training of new Arts-Mentor volunteers, and the offering of diverse
  arts-programming and arts workshops to the general community.
   
   Having a centralized location will allow us to add more structured, arts and entrepreneurial-skills workshops to our current Arts Mentorship Program curriculum, including the incorporation of differentiated-learning and multi-modal teaching strategies that will benefit our current program's effectiveness. Plus, by being able to coordinate a universal training program for new volunteers at a central location, we will be able to ensure a high quality experience for all our participants, Arts-Mentor volunteers and students alike, with the potential of being able to deploy Arts-Mentor volunteers into the community to provide our Arts Mentorship Program within other community centers.
   
   By simultaneously growing our partnerships with schools, teachers, and other community-based organizations in and around Central LA, East LA and Watts, we will generate a larger pool of student participants who will learn basic work-readiness skills and have the opportunity to explore the arts-sector as a career. For example, we are currently in early stages of establishing a new partnership with Youth Policy Institute's Pico-Union Community Center where we hope to bring our Arts Mentorship Program to their space, along with Arts-Mentor volunteers, in order to support their current work-readiness program's goals and outcomes of preparing youth for postsecondary education and career exploration. Additionally, with referrals we expect to receive from teachers whom we've worked with in this past year at Youth Opportunities High School in Watts and Media Arts and Entertainment Design High School in East LA, we hope to be ready to grow our student impact and provide a central location for orienting newly referred mentorship students.
   
   Lastly, with a centralized art gallery, we will be able to provide all our students, both future and current, with a venue to display their artwork, perform, and engage with future employers and arts enthusiasts.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Mentorships that are individualized & well structured provide at-risk youth
  with benefits that impact learning & social experiences dramatically. Add Arts
  Education to a genuine mentorship, and you have a recipe for incredible growth
  in young people now & for the rest of their lives.
   
   Mentorships lasting a minimum of 1 year have been proven to drastically reduce the chances of at-risk youth initiating in drug & alcohol abuse by up to 47%, not to mention reducing unhealthy & violent behaviors in at-risk youth by up to 33% (California Research Bureau).
   
   Engaging, meaningful mentorships also empower young people to have higher career & educational aspirations, resulting in better school attendance (53% less likely to skip school), higher scores on standardized tests, and higher matriculation rates into postsecondary education institutions (California Research Bureau).
   
   Arts Education programs have data that corroborate the same findings as in mentorship programs (i.e. 3 times more likely to enroll in college & earn a Bachelor's Degree, more likely to earn a higher salary over lifetime, a stronger sense of belonging & community, etc.), with the added benefits of a 25% higher likelihood of performing community service in the future, and stronger analytical & problem solving skills that relate directly to the workforce (National Endowment for the Arts).
   
   Arts Education programming wholly compliments a solid mentorship program. In providing the combined service of arts education & mentorship to at-risk youth, we are currently building immediate capacity in our students by teaching them leadership skills, problem-solving, conflict resolution, work-readiness, entrepreneurial methodology, and more. These skills will benefit our students greatly when they begin to establish their careers now & in the near future.
   
   Additionally, since our youth will be primarily working with volunteer Arts-Mentors as we expand our services, the establishing of a tighter, connected community will benefit both generations of artists. Volunteer-oriented programs bring with them a great number of benefits to a community as well, many of which echo the benefits that at-risk youth experience from mentorship & arts-education programming, such as a sense of safety and belonging, healthier lives, etc. Overall, our Arts Mentorship Program creates an environment of learning & collaboration, safety & acceptance, goal-setting & attainment, and more for all involved.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  In a macro sense, our Arts Mentorship Program benefits the entire community of
  Los Angeles by increasing the educational and career outcomes of our students,
  creating connectedness amongst volunteers, young people, and all arts
  enthusiasts, and by providing a new cultural center where people of diverse
  backgrounds can come together to collaborate and participate in the arts.
   
   However, to be more specific about our organizational impact, these are the student and volunteer enrollment target groups and goals for our Arts Mentorship Program, proposed Arts Workshops Program, and cultural events:
   
   Arts Mentorship Program Student Enrollment Criteria:
   •Ages 16–21
   •In-School (high school student) or Out-of-School (high school dropout or high school graduate not enrolled in college)
   
   Students must meet at least one of the three following "at-risk" indicators
   •Low-Income (based on family size)
   •Individualized Education Plan or 504 Plan (learning or physical disability)
   •Current or Former Foster Youth
   •A combination of other "at-risk" indicators taken into consideration
   
   Arts Mentorship Program proposed enrollment: 30 new students per year
   
   Arts Mentorship Program Volunteer (Arts-Mentors) Criteria:
   •Ages 25 and up
   •Able to prove ability to work with underage youth (background check, etc)
   •Actively working as artist or in arts-sector (visual, literary, gallery, etc.)
   
   Volunteer recruitment goal: 15 new volunteers per year
   
   Weekly Arts Workshops Program
   Meeting once weekly, each workshop will be one to three consecutive sessions in duration
   Workshops open to general public, workshop enrollment limited to 10–12 participants per series
   Ages 12 to 21 (depending on topic)
   
   Student enrollment goal: 100 students per year
   Volunteer instructor goal: 5 volunteers per year
   
   Poetry Readings, Art Shows, etc. attendance goals: 1000 attendees
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Our current collaborators are individual English teachers at both Youth
  Opportunity High School in Watts and Alliance Media Arts and Entertainment
  Design High School in East Los Angeles. They currently provide student
  referrals and curriculum advisement. Additionally, one of our board members is
  principal at New Village Charter High School, an alternative high school for
  young women.
   
   These current collaborators provide important insight and direction in the implementation of our current Arts Mentorship Program along with the referral of new Arts Mentorship Program students. However, we are exploring new partnerships that are currently in early stages of development, with our most current collaboration prospect being Youth Policy Institute's Pico-Union Community Center.
   
   In order for all our collaborations to grow and be successful, we will need funding to build out the following areas of our current program:
   1. Infrastructure for managing more student mentorships and new volunteer recruitment and training
   2. A centralized location for regular student art shows and performances
   3. Ability to hire staff that can fully dedicate time and resources for the management and implementation of all our programs and services

    DSTL Arts is a nonprofit arts mentorship organization that teaches, inspires
    and hires creative, at-risk youth ages 16–21 years old. Through
    individualized mentorships with volunteer artists, entrepreneurial-skills
    workshops, and career guidance, our youth learn to master their artistic
    craft and build work-readiness skills that will help them pursue careers
    within the creative economy or otherwise. DSTL Arts is looking to expand
    it's current programming and reach by establishing a larger pool of
    volunteer Arts-Mentors, growing our student enrollment, and  producing arts
    workshops, poetry readings and art exhibits within the LA community in order
    to grow and enrich the creative community our students and families
    currently participate in.

    Healthier life choices as relating to a reduction in drug and alcohol abuse
    and the learning of conflict resolution and problem solving skills.
  impact_metrics: "As mentioned before, Arts Education programs and long-term, individualized mentorships have proven impacts on the life choices and skills that at-risk youth demonstrate in their lives, both during and after their involvement in these programs. Since DSTL Arts combines an arts education with mentorship and work-readiness skill building, we are confident in being able to say that we will impact the metrics listed above.\r\n\r\nMentorships lasting a minimum of 1 year, as ours currently do, have been proven to drastically reduce the chances of at-risk youth initiating in drug and alcohol abuse by up to 47%, not to mention reducing unhealthy and violent behaviors in at-risk youth by up to 33% (California Research Bureau).\r\n\r\nEngaging, meaningful mentorships also empower young people to have higher career and educational aspirations, resulting in better school attendance (53% less likely to skip school),  higher scores on standardized tests, and higher matriculation rates into postsecondary education institutions (California Research Bureau).\r\n\r\nArts Education programs have data that corroborate the same findings as in mentorship programs (i.e. 3 times more likely to enroll in college and earn a Bachelor's Degree, more likely to earn a higher salary over lifetime, a stronger sense of belonging and community, etc.), with the added benefits of a 25% higher likelihood of performing community-service in the future, and stronger analytical and problem solving skills that relate directly to the workforce (National Endowment for the Arts). Plus, arts education programs \"help close the achievement gap, improves academic skills essential for reading and language development, and advances students' motivation to learn\" with the included benefit of students being less likely to dropout of school. (Americans for the Arts)\r\n\r\nSimply based on the current data and anecdotal evidence we've seen in our current students, we can confirm the data listed above by virtue that our own students exhibit higher self-worth and self-esteem, higher GPAs in both high school and college, high school graduation and career training enrollment, and a lower propensity for engaging in unhealthy or \"risky\" behavior."

  evaluate: "One of our current evaluation tools focuses on student self-assessment. We periodically ask our students to rate the following areas on a scale of 1 (low) to 5 (high):\r\n1.\tSelf-evaluate artistic practice and skill development\r\n2.\tSelf-evaluate career and educational guidance as received via our mentorship, and\r\n3.\tEvaluate the quality of the program as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe Student Self-Evaluation, as we call it, includes questions that indicate students' self-esteem and self-worth, career and educational goals, and mentor evaluation.\r\n\r\nOur second evaluation tool is a rubric that Arts-Mentors use to evaluate student progress and learning, ranging from \"Needs Improvement\" to \"Proficient Understanding and Skill\" with a total of four levels of measure, including the two previously mentioned. This rubric measures:\r\n1.\tStudent ability to demonstrate soft skills (i.e. time management, writing and communication, problem solving and professionalism, and interviewing and presentation skills)\r\n2.\tWork-readiness skill attainment (i.e. résumé writing, artist statement, interviewing skills, and portfolio completion), and\r\n3.\tArtistic skill development as proven through a portfolio of work.\r\n\r\nOur program measures and outcomes are:\r\n1.\t60% of participants will complete a portfolio of artistic works and demonstrate ability to present said works to the public\r\n2.\t60% of participants will demonstrate understanding and execution of work-readiness/soft skills (i.e. Time Management, Writing and Communication, Teamwork, Problem Solving, Professionalism, Interviewing/Presentation Skills)\r\n3.\t60% of participants will show gains in literacy as demonstrated through written Artist Statement and other Artist Portfolio collateral\r\n4.\t60% of participants will either show improvement in academic grades, begin the process of enrolling in school (secondary or post-secondary), improve their school attendance, or become employed (permanent or internship/apprenticeship; paid or unpaid)\r\n5.\t75% of participants will indicate a positive program experience, artistic growth, and improved self-esteem via self-assessment tool"
  two_lessons: "Speaking from a personal level, the idea of creating an Arts Mentorship Program, and DSTL Arts as an organization, came from my own desire to provide guidance to at-risk youth who, like me at their age, were told to focus on finding a lucrative career and to enroll in 4-year colleges without being encouraged to follow their actual dreams of working in the creative sector.\r\n\r\nToo often, in communities where the Arts are not nurtured in educational institutions and within the immediate community, young people's dreams of being artists are crushed at a very young age out of fear and lack of understanding that the Arts is an important part of our economy.\r\n\r\nAs a child, I knew that I wanted to be an artist, but because I was also the first generation to be born in the United States, I was not given guidance, much less encouraged, to explore the Arts as a career. I was simply pushed to find a stable job, whether I liked it or not, whether I felt fulfilled by that career or not, and made to believe that the American Dream was my only path toward happiness.\r\n\r\nUpon reaching adulthood and becoming the first person in my family to graduate high school and college without the benefit of a mentor, I came to realize that I could use my talents as a writer and visual artist to establish my own independent, creative business. Furthermore, after enrolling in my MFA program at CalArts, I learned that not all mentorships, especially institutionalized ones, were designed to truly benefit an individual seeking to become a working artist. Therefore, DSTL Arts became my solution for empowering creative, at-risk youth, not much different than myself as a young person.\r\n\r\nThe design of our Arts Mentorship Program is informed by my over 10 years of working in the nonprofit sector, specifically in the Youth Workforce Development sector, and the model is derived from my time as a Workforce Investment Act Youth Program Director. My experience working with at-risk youth throughout my career has shown me that all youth need to be exposed to alternative paths to careers and employment. Entrepreneurship is a skill that has been honed in me by being an independent, practicing artist, and this skill is something that I feel benefits young people now more than ever.\r\n\r\nDSTL Arts is not just about developing young artists' skills, it is about empowering young people to take their career choices seriously and to transcend the limits that they encounter."
  achievable_goal: "DSTL Arts has been operating its Arts Mentorship Program for the past year and a half, since February, 2013, and we have grown our current student enrollment from 3 original students to our current 8 students. This has happened thanks to the referrals we have received from the few educators we have established connections with in various communities in Los Angeles. Additionally, our organization has recently filed for incorporation with the State of California as a California Public Benefit Corporation, otherwise known and recognized as a nonprofit as per the IRS 501(c)3 definition. Our pro bono lawyer provided to us by the Public Counsel Community Development Program is currently aiding us through the entire incorporation process, with the goal of receiving a full 501(c)3 certification from the IRS in the upcoming 12 months.\r\n\r\nWe are in the early phases of establishing a formal partnership with Youth Policy Institute's Pico-Union Community Center where we hope to establish a satellite Arts Mentorship Program beginning as soon as August, 2014. With the funding and support of the LA2050 initiative and the Goldhirsh Foundation, we easily foresee being able to establish a central location that will house our Arts Mentorship Program for our current and future students, and our proposed Weekly Arts Workshops. A central location, once established, will also be able to host cultural events, such as monthly poetry readings, student art shows, etc., within a month or less of being open to the public.\r\n\r\nThe infrastructure we are in need of establishing to better manage and continue to grow our Arts Mentorship Program is primarily centered on the acquisition of computers and general office equipment as well as software and payroll services that will allow us to officially hire and pay our current staff and conduct background checks on future volunteers.\r\n\r\nWe have an approximate timeline of 4 months, after funding, where we project being able to find a location, perform very basic build out, and acquire our office equipment. By utilizing and growing our current donor base and social media channels, we expect to fundraise as we have up to now in order to continue to acquire office and art supplies for our students. With a portion of the work already initiated for the growth and expansion of our program, we will most likely be able to have our programs running in no more than 8 to 10 months after funding."
  major_challenges: "Our current challenges, programmatically, are a lack of space and infrastructure for growing our Arts Mentorship Program capacity. Because we do not have an office space where we can meet with our current students, we are reliant on public places such as the library and other community centers. This is not a problem when working in particular mediums of art, such as drawing and creative writing, however, when our students want to explore painting and mixed media, we often times have to become creative in how we teach them these skills. Occasionally, this has meant teaching wet media techniques in the park or in our private residence. Additionally, when teaching them work-readiness and entrepreneurial skills, not having a classroom-like environment can become distracting for our students. We often times lack a way to visually represent concepts because we do not have a whiteboard or chalkboard at our disposal.\r\n\r\nWe expect to address our lack of space by leasing a gallery and office space where we can both conduct and manage our mentorships, and where we will host our students' art shows, readings, and more. The DSTL Arts gallery will be home for various arts workshops and cultural programming as well, and it will be an avenue in which we can begin to become self-sustaining beyond the small supplies donations we are currently receiving.\r\n\r\nThe second barrier, which is infrastructure, will be addressed through building out the relationships we have begun to establish with schools, other community agencies, and our supporters through social media. We have many interested individuals seeking to volunteer and mentor our students. By being able to utilize a payroll service that can conduct background checks, we will be able to ensure our prospective volunteers are able to safely work with underage youth. Additionally, with funding, we will be able to finally pay a dedicated staff member who will be managing our programs and organization. Other infrastructure-related needs will be addressed through the purchase of computers and other office equipment, such as a printer and copy machine."
  competition: "Other similar arts mentorship programs exist in Los Angeles, such as Inner City Arts, Venice Arts, and Las Fotos Project, which all serve students in various media and in various age groups, from as young as 8 years old up to 20 years old. Venice Arts is probably the most like DSTL Arts in that Venice Arts works with small cohorts of students during their mentorship program, but none of the aforementioned organizations move beyond the teaching of basic arts skills for the sole purpose of creating art.\r\n\r\nDSTL Arts is unique in that we not only help our Arts Mentorship Program students develop their artistic skills, we also teach them how to establish creative businesses, apply to jobs, colleges, and career training programs. Plus, we promote our students' personal art as any other art gallery or creative writing publisher would. We give our students the tools to become working artists now.\r\n\r\nBy seeking established organizations, such as Skylight Books in Hollywood and Seite Books in East Los Angeles, who carry our students artwork on consignment, we are showing our students that their creative works are valued by the larger community. We give our students the first set of tools they need to give themselves an economic advantage as they pursue careers within our without the creative economy of Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nWhile we have partnered with other organizations, including Las Fotos Project, in offering one-time arts workshops, DSTL Arts is seeking to continue working in-depth with creative at-risk youth who want to explore the possibilities of a career as a working artist."
  cost: "Based on our projections, the minimal start up cost for our Arts Mentorship Program expansion and implementation of our Weekly Arts Workshops is just under $100,000 for the first year of our program's expansion. In order to continue the growth and to be self- sustaining beyond the initial $100,000 start-up fund, we will be continuing to develop our donor base, and we expect to sublet our gallery space to other community organizations and artists in order to remain open.\r\n\r\nAs part of our plan to ensure we continue to have art supplies available, we will also be running art supply donation campaigns using Blick Art Supplies' Art Room Aid service, which we have successfully utilized in the past. By having a sliding scale for admission to our Weekly Arts Workshops, we will also be able to have funds that will help cover the cost of supplies long term while maintaining our nonprofit status.\r\n\r\nPlease see our budget for a more detailed breakdown of how the $100,000 grant will be utilized if awarded to DSTL Arts."

      DSTL Arts is a nonprofit arts mentorship organization that teaches,
      inspires and hires creative, at-risk youth ages 16–21 years old. Through
      individualized mentorships with volunteer artists, entrepreneurial-skills
      workshops, and career guidance, our youth learn to master their artistic
      craft and build work-readiness skills that will help them pursue careers
      within the creative economy or otherwise. DSTL Arts is looking to expand
      it's current programming and reach by establishing a larger pool of
      volunteer Arts-Mentors, growing our student enrollment, and  producing
      arts workshops, poetry readings and art exhibits within the LA community
      in order to grow and enrich the creative community our students and
      families currently participate in.

    answer: "DSTL Arts has been in operation for the past year and a half providing mentorship in the arts to a cohort of 8 creative, at-risk youth, and this grant will help us expand our capacity and infrastructure by establishing a central gallery space that will act as a hub for managing student mentorships, the training of new Arts-Mentor volunteers, and the offering of diverse arts-programming and arts workshops to the general community.\r\n\r\nHaving a centralized location will allow us to add more structured, arts and entrepreneurial-skills workshops to our current Arts Mentorship Program curriculum, including the incorporation of differentiated-learning and multi-modal teaching strategies that will benefit our current program's effectiveness. Plus, by being able to coordinate a universal training program for new volunteers at a central location, we will be able to ensure a high quality experience for all our participants, Arts-Mentor volunteers and students alike, with the potential of being able to deploy Arts-Mentor volunteers into the community to provide our Arts Mentorship Program within other community centers.\r\n\r\nBy simultaneously growing our partnerships with schools, teachers, and other community-based organizations in and around Central LA, East LA and Watts, we will generate a larger pool of student participants who will learn basic work-readiness skills and have the opportunity to explore the arts-sector as a career. For example, we are currently in early stages of establishing a new partnership with Youth Policy Institute's Pico-Union Community Center where we hope to bring our Arts Mentorship Program to their space, along with Arts-Mentor volunteers, in order to support their current work-readiness program's goals and outcomes of preparing youth for postsecondary education and career exploration. Additionally, with referrals we expect to receive from teachers whom we've worked with in this past year at Youth Opportunities High School in Watts and Media Arts and Entertainment Design High School in East LA, we hope to be ready to grow our student impact and provide a central location for orienting newly referred mentorship students.\r\n\r\nLastly, with a centralized art gallery, we will be able to provide all our students, both future and current, with a venue to display their artwork, perform, and engage with future employers and arts enthusiasts."

    answer: "Mentorships that are individualized & well structured provide at-risk youth with benefits that impact learning & social experiences dramatically. Add Arts Education to a genuine mentorship, and you have a recipe for incredible growth in young people now & for the rest of their lives.\r\n\r\nMentorships lasting a minimum of 1 year have been proven to drastically reduce the chances of at-risk youth initiating in drug & alcohol abuse by up to 47%, not to mention reducing unhealthy & violent behaviors in at-risk youth by up to 33% (California Research Bureau).\r\n\r\nEngaging, meaningful mentorships also empower young people to have higher career & educational aspirations, resulting in better school attendance (53% less likely to skip school), higher scores on standardized tests, and higher matriculation rates into postsecondary education institutions (California Research Bureau).\r\n\r\nArts Education programs have data that corroborate the same findings as in mentorship programs (i.e. 3 times more likely to enroll in college & earn a Bachelor's Degree, more likely to earn a higher salary over lifetime, a stronger sense of belonging & community, etc.), with the added benefits of a 25% higher likelihood of performing community service in the future, and stronger analytical & problem solving skills that relate directly to the workforce (National Endowment for the Arts).\r\n\r\nArts Education programming wholly compliments a solid mentorship program. In providing the combined service of arts education & mentorship to at-risk youth, we are currently building immediate capacity in our students by teaching them leadership skills, problem-solving, conflict resolution, work-readiness, entrepreneurial methodology, and more. These skills will benefit our students greatly when they begin to establish their careers now & in the near future.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, since our youth will be primarily working with volunteer Arts-Mentors as we expand our services, the establishing of a tighter, connected community will benefit both generations of artists. Volunteer-oriented programs bring with them a great number of benefits to a community as well, many of which echo the benefits that at-risk youth experience from mentorship & arts-education programming, such as a sense of safety and belonging, healthier lives, etc. Overall, our Arts Mentorship Program creates an environment of learning & collaboration, safety & acceptance, goal-setting & attainment, and more for all involved."

    answer: "As mentioned before, Arts Education programs and long-term, individualized mentorships have proven impacts on the life choices and skills that at-risk youth demonstrate in their lives, both during and after their involvement in these programs. Since DSTL Arts combines an arts education with mentorship and work-readiness skill building, we are confident in being able to say that we will impact the metrics listed above.\r\n\r\nMentorships lasting a minimum of 1 year, as ours currently do, have been proven to drastically reduce the chances of at-risk youth initiating in drug and alcohol abuse by up to 47%, not to mention reducing unhealthy and violent behaviors in at-risk youth by up to 33% (California Research Bureau).\r\n\r\nEngaging, meaningful mentorships also empower young people to have higher career and educational aspirations, resulting in better school attendance (53% less likely to skip school),  higher scores on standardized tests, and higher matriculation rates into postsecondary education institutions (California Research Bureau).\r\n\r\nArts Education programs have data that corroborate the same findings as in mentorship programs (i.e. 3 times more likely to enroll in college and earn a Bachelor's Degree, more likely to earn a higher salary over lifetime, a stronger sense of belonging and community, etc.), with the added benefits of a 25% higher likelihood of performing community-service in the future, and stronger analytical and problem solving skills that relate directly to the workforce (National Endowment for the Arts). Plus, arts education programs \"help close the achievement gap, improves academic skills essential for reading and language development, and advances students' motivation to learn\" with the included benefit of students being less likely to dropout of school. (Americans for the Arts)\r\n\r\nSimply based on the current data and anecdotal evidence we've seen in our current students, we can confirm the data listed above by virtue that our own students exhibit higher self-worth and self-esteem, higher GPAs in both high school and college, high school graduation and career training enrollment, and a lower propensity for engaging in unhealthy or \"risky\" behavior."

    answer: "One of our current evaluation tools focuses on student self-assessment.

This rubric measures:\r\n1.\tStudent ability to demonstrate soft skills (i.e. time management, writing and communication, problem solving and professionalism, and interviewing and presentation skills)\r\n2.\tWork-readiness skill attainment (i.e. résumé writing, artist statement, interviewing skills, and portfolio completion), and\r\n3.\tArtistic skill development as proven through a portfolio of work.\r\n\r\nOur program measures and outcomes are:\r\n1.\t60% of participants will complete a portfolio of artistic works and demonstrate ability to present said works to the public\r\n2.\t60% of participants will demonstrate understanding and execution of work-readiness/soft skills (i.e. Time Management, Writing and Communication, Teamwork, Problem Solving, Professionalism, Interviewing/Presentation Skills)\r\n3.\t60% of participants will show gains in literacy as demonstrated through written Artist Statement and other Artist Portfolio collateral\r\n4.\t60% of participants will either show improvement in academic grades, begin the process of enrolling in school (secondary or post-secondary), improve their school attendance, or become employed (permanent or internship/apprenticeship; paid or unpaid)\r\n5.\t75% of participants will indicate a positive program experience, artistic growth, and improved self-esteem via self-assessment tool"
  - name: two_lessons
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Speaking from a personal level, the idea of creating an Arts Mentorship Program, and DSTL Arts as an organization, came from my own desire to provide guidance to at-risk youth who, like me at their age, were told to focus on finding a lucrative career and to enroll in 4-year colleges without being encouraged to follow their actual dreams of working in the creative sector.\r\n\r\nToo often, in communities where the Arts are not nurtured in educational institutions and within the immediate community, young people's dreams of being artists are crushed at a very young age out of fear and lack of understanding that the Arts is an important part of our economy.\r\n\r\nAs a child, I knew that I wanted to be an artist, but because I was also the first generation to be born in the United States, I was not given guidance, much less encouraged, to explore the Arts as a career. I was simply pushed to find a stable job, whether I liked it or not, whether I felt fulfilled by that career or not, and made to believe that the American Dream was my only path toward happiness.\r\n\r\nUpon reaching adulthood and becoming the first person in my family to graduate high school and college without the benefit of a mentor, I came to realize that I could use my talents as a writer and visual artist to establish my own independent, creative business. Furthermore, after enrolling in my MFA program at CalArts, I learned that not all mentorships, especially institutionalized ones, were designed to truly benefit an individual seeking to become a working artist. Therefore, DSTL Arts became my solution for empowering creative, at-risk youth, not much different than myself as a young person.\r\n\r\nThe design of our Arts Mentorship Program is informed by my over 10 years of working in the nonprofit sector, specifically in the Youth Workforce Development sector, and the model is derived from my time as a Workforce Investment Act Youth Program Director. My experience working with at-risk youth throughout my career has shown me that all youth need to be exposed to alternative paths to careers and employment. Entrepreneurship is a skill that has been honed in me by being an independent, practicing artist, and this skill is something that I feel benefits young people now more than ever.\r\n\r\nDSTL Arts is not just about developing young artists' skills, it is about empowering young people to take their career choices seriously and to transcend the limits that they encounter."
  - name: achievable_goal
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "DSTL Arts has been operating its Arts Mentorship Program for the past year and a half, since February, 2013, and we have grown our current student enrollment from 3 original students to our current 8 students. This has happened thanks to the referrals we have received from the few educators we have established connections with in various communities in Los Angeles. Additionally, our organization has recently filed for incorporation with the State of California as a California Public Benefit Corporation, otherwise known and recognized as a nonprofit as per the IRS 501(c)3 definition. Our pro bono lawyer provided to us by the Public Counsel Community Development Program is currently aiding us through the entire incorporation process, with the goal of receiving a full 501(c)3 certification from the IRS in the upcoming 12 months.\r\n\r\nWe are in the early phases of establishing a formal partnership with Youth Policy Institute's Pico-Union Community Center where we hope to establish a satellite Arts Mentorship Program beginning as soon as August, 2014. With the funding and support of the LA2050 initiative and the Goldhirsh Foundation, we easily foresee being able to establish a central location that will house our Arts Mentorship Program for our current and future students, and our proposed Weekly Arts Workshops. A central location, once established, will also be able to host cultural events, such as monthly poetry readings, student art shows, etc., within a month or less of being open to the public.\r\n\r\nThe infrastructure we are in need of establishing to better manage and continue to grow our Arts Mentorship Program is primarily centered on the acquisition of computers and general office equipment as well as software and payroll services that will allow us to officially hire and pay our current staff and conduct background checks on future volunteers.\r\n\r\nWe have an approximate timeline of 4 months, after funding, where we project being able to find a location, perform very basic build out, and acquire our office equipment. By utilizing and growing our current donor base and social media channels, we expect to fundraise as we have up to now in order to continue to acquire office and art supplies for our students. With a portion of the work already initiated for the growth and expansion of our program, we will most likely be able to have our programs running in no more than 8 to 10 months after funding."
  - name: major_challenges
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Our current challenges, programmatically, are a lack of space and infrastructure for growing our Arts Mentorship Program capacity. Because we do not have an office space where we can meet with our current students, we are reliant on public places such as the library and other community centers. This is not a problem when working in particular mediums of art, such as drawing and creative writing, however, when our students want to explore painting and mixed media, we often times have to become creative in how we teach them these skills. Occasionally, this has meant teaching wet media techniques in the park or in our private residence. Additionally, when teaching them work-readiness and entrepreneurial skills, not having a classroom-like environment can become distracting for our students. We often times lack a way to visually represent concepts because we do not have a whiteboard or chalkboard at our disposal.\r\n\r\nWe expect to address our lack of space by leasing a gallery and office space where we can both conduct and manage our mentorships, and where we will host our students' art shows, readings, and more. The DSTL Arts gallery will be home for various arts workshops and cultural programming as well, and it will be an avenue in which we can begin to become self-sustaining beyond the small supplies donations we are currently receiving.\r\n\r\nThe second barrier, which is infrastructure, will be addressed through building out the relationships we have begun to establish with schools, other community agencies, and our supporters through social media. We have many interested individuals seeking to volunteer and mentor our students. By being able to utilize a payroll service that can conduct background checks, we will be able to ensure our prospective volunteers are able to safely work with underage youth. Additionally, with funding, we will be able to finally pay a dedicated staff member who will be managing our programs and organization. Other infrastructure-related needs will be addressed through the purchase of computers and other office equipment, such as a printer and copy machine."

    answer: "Other similar arts mentorship programs exist in Los Angeles, such as Inner City Arts, Venice Arts, and Las Fotos Project, which all serve students in various media and in various age groups, from as young as 8 years old up to 20 years old. Venice Arts is probably the most like DSTL Arts in that Venice Arts works with small cohorts of students during their mentorship program, but none of the aforementioned organizations move beyond the teaching of basic arts skills for the sole purpose of creating art.\r\n\r\nDSTL Arts is unique in that we not only help our Arts Mentorship Program students develop their artistic skills, we also teach them how to establish creative businesses, apply to jobs, colleges, and career training programs. Plus, we promote our students' personal art as any other art gallery or creative writing publisher would. We give our students the tools to become working artists now.\r\n\r\nBy seeking established organizations, such as Skylight Books in Hollywood and Seite Books in East Los Angeles, who carry our students artwork on consignment, we are showing our students that their creative works are valued by the larger community. We give our students the first set of tools they need to give themselves an economic advantage as they pursue careers within our without the creative economy of Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nWhile we have partnered with other organizations, including Las Fotos Project, in offering one-time arts workshops, DSTL Arts is seeking to continue working in-depth with creative at-risk youth who want to explore the possibilities of a career as a working artist."

    answer: "Based on our projections, the minimal start up cost for our Arts Mentorship Program expansion and implementation of our Weekly Arts Workshops is just under $100,000 for the first year of our program's expansion. In order to continue the growth and to be self- sustaining beyond the initial $100,000 start-up fund, we will be continuing to develop our donor base, and we expect to sublet our gallery space to other community organizations and artists in order to remain open.\r\n\r\nAs part of our plan to ensure we continue to have art supplies available, we will also be running art supply donation campaigns using Blick Art Supplies' Art Room Aid service, which we have successfully utilized in the past. By having a sliding scale for admission to our Weekly Arts Workshops, we will also be able to have funds that will help cover the cost of supplies long term while maintaining our nonprofit status.\r\n\r\nPlease see our budget for a more detailed breakdown of how the $100,000 grant will be utilized if awarded to DSTL Arts."
