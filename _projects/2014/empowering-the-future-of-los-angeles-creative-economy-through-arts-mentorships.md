  DSTL Arts has been in operation for the past year and a half providing
  mentorship in the arts to a cohort of 8 creative, at-risk youth, and this
  grant will help us expand our capacity and infrastructure by establishing a
  central gallery space that will act as a hub for managing student mentorships,
  the training of new Arts-Mentor volunteers, and the offering of diverse
  arts-programming and arts workshops to the general community.
   
   Having a centralized location will allow us to add more structured, arts and entrepreneurial-skills workshops to our current Arts Mentorship Program curriculum, including the incorporation of differentiated-learning and multi-modal teaching strategies that will benefit our current program's effectiveness. Plus, by being able to coordinate a universal training program for new volunteers at a central location, we will be able to ensure a high quality experience for all our participants, Arts-Mentor volunteers and students alike, with the potential of being able to deploy Arts-Mentor volunteers into the community to provide our Arts Mentorship Program within other community centers.
   
   By simultaneously growing our partnerships with schools, teachers, and other community-based organizations in and around Central LA, East LA and Watts, we will generate a larger pool of student participants who will learn basic work-readiness skills and have the opportunity to explore the arts-sector as a career. For example, we are currently in early stages of establishing a new partnership with Youth Policy Institute's Pico-Union Community Center where we hope to bring our Arts Mentorship Program to their space, along with Arts-Mentor volunteers, in order to support their current work-readiness program's goals and outcomes of preparing youth for postsecondary education and career exploration. Additionally, with referrals we expect to receive from teachers whom we've worked with in this past year at Youth Opportunities High School in Watts and Media Arts and Entertainment Design High School in East LA, we hope to be ready to grow our student impact and provide a central location for orienting newly referred mentorship students.
   
   Lastly, with a centralized art gallery, we will be able to provide all our students, both future and current, with a venue to display their artwork, perform, and engage with future employers and arts enthusiasts.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Mentorships that are individualized & well structured provide at-risk youth
  with benefits that impact learning & social experiences dramatically. Add Arts
  Education to a genuine mentorship, and you have a recipe for incredible growth
  in young people now & for the rest of their lives.
   
   Mentorships lasting a minimum of 1 year have been proven to drastically reduce the chances of at-risk youth initiating in drug & alcohol abuse by up to 47%, not to mention reducing unhealthy & violent behaviors in at-risk youth by up to 33% (California Research Bureau).
   
   Engaging, meaningful mentorships also empower young people to have higher career & educational aspirations, resulting in better school attendance (53% less likely to skip school), higher scores on standardized tests, and higher matriculation rates into postsecondary education institutions (California Research Bureau).
   
   Arts Education programs have data that corroborate the same findings as in mentorship programs (i.e. 3 times more likely to enroll in college & earn a Bachelor's Degree, more likely to earn a higher salary over lifetime, a stronger sense of belonging & community, etc.), with the added benefits of a 25% higher likelihood of performing community service in the future, and stronger analytical & problem solving skills that relate directly to the workforce (National Endowment for the Arts).
   
   Arts Education programming wholly compliments a solid mentorship program. In providing the combined service of arts education & mentorship to at-risk youth, we are currently building immediate capacity in our students by teaching them leadership skills, problem-solving, conflict resolution, work-readiness, entrepreneurial methodology, and more. These skills will benefit our students greatly when they begin to establish their careers now & in the near future.
   
   Additionally, since our youth will be primarily working with volunteer Arts-Mentors as we expand our services, the establishing of a tighter, connected community will benefit both generations of artists. Volunteer-oriented programs bring with them a great number of benefits to a community as well, many of which echo the benefits that at-risk youth experience from mentorship & arts-education programming, such as a sense of safety and belonging, healthier lives, etc. Overall, our Arts Mentorship Program creates an environment of learning & collaboration, safety & acceptance, goal-setting & attainment, and more for all involved.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  In a macro sense, our Arts Mentorship Program benefits the entire community of
  Los Angeles by increasing the educational and career outcomes of our students,
  creating connectedness amongst volunteers, young people, and all arts
  enthusiasts, and by providing a new cultural center where people of diverse
  backgrounds can come together to collaborate and participate in the arts.
   
   However, to be more specific about our organizational impact, these are the student and volunteer enrollment target groups and goals for our Arts Mentorship Program, proposed Arts Workshops Program, and cultural events:

   •Ages 16–21

   •Low-Income (based on family size)
   •Individualized Education Plan or 504 Plan (learning or physical disability)
   •Current or Former Foster Youth
   •A combination of other "at-risk" indicators taken into consideration
   
   Arts Mentorship Program proposed enrollment: 30 new students per year

How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Our current collaborators are individual English teachers at both Youth
  Opportunity High School in Watts and Alliance Media Arts and Entertainment
  Design High School in East Los Angeles. They currently provide student
  referrals and curriculum advisement. Additionally, one of our board members is
  principal at New Village Charter High School, an alternative high school for
  young women.
   
   These current collaborators provide important insight and direction in the implementation of our current Arts Mentorship Program along with the referral of new Arts Mentorship Program students. However, we are exploring new partnerships that are currently in early stages of development, with our most current collaboration prospect being Youth Policy Institute's Pico-Union Community Center.
   
   In order for all our collaborations to grow and be successful, we will need funding to build out the following areas of our current program:
   1. Infrastructure for managing more student mentorships and new volunteer recruitment and training
   2. A centralized location for regular student art shows and performances
   3. Ability to hire staff that can fully dedicate time and resources for the management and implementation of all our programs and services
