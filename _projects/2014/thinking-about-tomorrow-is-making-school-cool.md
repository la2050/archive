  Our "School is Cool" initiative is designed to help our students develop a
  love of education and adopt the tools needed to thrive in and out of the
  classroom. We give students the supplies they need to build confidence. We
  reward students with incentives for perfect attendance, encouraging them to
  come to school every day. We show kids that college is an achievable dream and
  give them something to reach for. 
   
   Our programs challenge kids to be at school daily and demonstrate the importance of teamwork. This approach involves building strong school and community partnerships, early outreach to families, educating parents about the importance of regular school attendance and targeting students who are chronically absent.
Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  It’s a fact that students who attend school consistently are more successful
  in school than students who do not. That may seem obvious, but what’s less
  obvious are that the consequences of low attendance are serious for all
  children and their community. Did you know that every year, over 1 million
  students drop out of high school in the United States alone? That’s one
  student every 26 seconds, or 7,000 students a day. Students who are frequently
  absent fall behind in academics and miss important socialization concepts that
  enhance their ability to understand and follow directions and, ultimately,
  plan for the future. As students fail to graduate from high school, the number
  of educated and skilled workers in the job market also decreases, leaving
  holes in the workforce economy. In addition, state financial support for
  schools is directly linked to student attendance. When students are absent the
  school loses money.
   
   Since 2011, TaT's “School is Cool” initiative has supported high-need LAUSD schools to provide positive support and increase the percentage of students attending school in Kindergarten and Grade 9. While we believe that ALL grade levels (K-12) are vital to success, these grade levels have the lowest overall attendance rates in the District. Excessive absence in these critical transition grades has a strong correlation with lower academic achievement and graduation rates. Regular school attendance is an integral part of the learning process and the means to graduation with a good education. Children who develop good attendance habits in the early grades will be more likely to continue them throughout their school career and ultimately into their adult working life.
   Through these programs, students have become more proficient in core subjects, have shown successful transitions into middle and high school, and are more college/career ready. The communities in which we operate have also seen remarkable improvements in areas such as school truancy and high school graduation rates among others. Schools that employ a challenging curriculum and reinforce high expectations for academics, behavior, and social responsibility, are schools that give students motivation to attend. Our initiative provides the students with a sense of empowerment and a feeling of success, not only essential for academic achievement, but imperative for the growth and development of their future. That's why we believe that teaching children to value education is so important!
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Currently, students living at or below the poverty line lack access to
  sufficient school supplies, and budget cuts to our school systems leave
  schools and teachers unable to provide these at risk children with the
  necessary items. It's estimated that 16 million kids in the US will return to
  school this year without the supplies they need. The burden is being placed on
  both the students and the teachers to fulfill these needs, neither of whom
  have the resources to fill the gap.
   
   In partnership with LAUSD, Thinking about Tomorrow is directly addressing this crisis facing our community. Our “School is Cool” initiative hopes to encourage all students, grades K-12, to continue attending school consistently and to value the importance of education. Working directly with LAUSD's Title 1 schools with the most number of at-risk students will create an environment were students can focus on learning, teachers can focus on teaching, and families can focus on providing the love and support that each child needs to thrive. Our initiative provides positive support to both students and teachers by providing backpacks fully loaded with required supplies to fostered and sheltered students. By supplying these necessities, we directly influence each student’s ability to fully participate in the learning process and give them the tools they need to succeed. In addition, the backpacks also provide support for the teachers who often carry the burden of providing for their students basic educational needs rather than focusing on providing a rich and nurturing learning environment. It is proven that children without proper school supplies have lower attendance rates and are more likely to perform poorly in school, and eventually drop out.
   
   Having access to the school supplies students need to achieve well in school helps keep kids focused and learning at school. Our project's support brings vital opportunities to high risk fostered and sheltered students, providing a way for continuous education and critically needed educational stability. In doing so, we believe we can effect positive change in their own communities.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Over the years, TaT has established many community partners along the way, but
  none have been as integral to the success of our "School is Cool" initiative
  as the Los Angeles Dodgers, Keystone Press, Build-a-Bear, Wal-Mart, Kroger,
  Ralph's and Panera Bread. Together, we have built a solid foundation around
  shared values focused on improving our communities today, for tomorrow.
   
   Our partnership with the LAUSD and the APSAC (Association of Pupil Services and Attendance Counselors) allows us direct contact with every student in their respective school. This gives us an opportunity to work with every student everyday. It also gives us access to over 400 volunteers willing to do what they can to help students achieve in school.
   
   Our partnership with the LA Dodgers creates a huge opportunity for at-risk students as well as their families. Through our program, students with excellent and perfect attendance throughout the year are invited to Dodger Stadium to enjoy a day at the ballpark. Free tickets for the family, $10 vouchers to be used for (food), hats, pennants and tshirts provide the ultimate experience for our students and their families! This past year, we celebrated attendance with over 20,000 at-risk students in 28 of LAUSD's schools.
   
   Keystone Press is another highly significant partnership that provides TaT with our perfect and excellent attendance certificates given to students for consistent attendance. Keystone also provides the certificates of appreciation and all other promotional materials for TaT, including brochures and one-sheet printouts. In total, we've handed out over 50,000 certificates for attendance!
   
   Through our partnerships with Build-a-Bear, Walmart, Kroger, Ralph's and Panera Bread, our program challenges our students weekly, monthly, and annually by providing constant motivation through various in-kind and monetary donations. These businesses provide a wide variety of incentives and rewards for each eligible student. 
   
   Above all, one of the most critical factors to the success of our organization's message is the ability to reach as many members of our community as possible. It is often difficult to offset the costs of promotional advertising and we are grateful to our sponsors who provide opportunities to help cover the costs of such materials.
