  Inspired by the hymn,“Shall We Gather at the River?” FoLAR's founders united
  to influence public opinion by bringing individuals, reporters,
  decision-makers – anyone who would listen – down to the Los Angeles River. Our
  38' mobile visitor and education center, the Los Angeles River Rover,hails a
  new era of public engagement and advocacy. Interpretive and interactive
  exhibits for all ages connect the River's past and present to its possible
  future. Through programs and events, FoLAR and its partners connect
  individuals to the River and to one another to create a constituency for
  change. Docent and citizen science activities increase volunteerism. At the
  Rover ideas are exchanged and dreams are shared. A better LA is sure to
  follow.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Exchanging information is easy at the River Rover. With an internet
  connection, a high resolution projector inside and a 40” monitor on the
  outside of the Rover there are multiple ways to communicate and connect. DVDs
  and slide shows play in the background or speakers can make presentations on
  myriad topics.
   
   On the weekends the River Rover will park near natural-bottom sections at lease once a month in each of these three service areas:
   1. The San Fernando Valley from Canoga Park to Burbank,
   2. The Glendale Narrows from Griffith Park through downtown, 
   3. The lower River from Vernon to Long Beach. 
   
   Bring the River to the People: By visiting schools, festivals, neighborhood council meetings, libraries, senior centers – anywhere we can park provides the opportunity to inform and engage people of all ages, cultures connecting communities and residents to the issues that impact their neighborhoods and the River so their voices can be heard.
   
   Activities Connect People to the River and to One Another: 
   FoLAR educators and experts from our partner organizations conduct walks along the River calling attention to bird and plant life, sharing current information and engaging participants in conversations. Bicycle rides, kayaking trips, fishing lessons and tournaments, poetry readings, live music and food trucks, these are just some of the ways to connect people to the River not only as a place for recreation and celebration but also as an ecosystem in the heart of our built environment.
   
   Citizen Science and Trained Docent Opportunities
   With an increasing demand for volunteer opportunities both citizen science and docent programs provide meaningful ways for the public to engage. Assessing the River's biological health, testing water quality and conducting trash surveys provide both volunteer opportunities and useful data that can be used to influence policy decisions that affect the River's future. Trained docents provide guided tours through the Rover, answer questions and engage the public in numerous other ways. Individuals and high school students representing each of the three regions gain knowledge and experience while increasing FoLAR's capacity to foster connections.

  A Better LA Now
   How do you convince the public, politicians, city, state and federal government agencies that there is value to restoring a concrete River? In 1986 Lewis MacAdams and two friends cut a hole in the fence and started what he called a 40-year artwork to bring the River back to life. Now the once maligned River is a place for recreation, education and restoration. This year FoLAR rallied for the most ambitious plan to remove concrete, restore wetland habitat and connect communities to a natural environment while increasing flood-control capacity; Alternative 20. 
   
   First, we raised and donated $1,000,000 to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to complete an Ecosystem Feasibility Study seven years in the making; a first in the Corps' history. Next, Lewis, Mayor Eric Garcetti, and others traveled to Washington DC meeting with Senators Boxer and Feinstein, and top-ranking Army Corps and Obama Administration officials. We pressed for a town-hall at the LA River Center and mobilized politicians and community leaders; over 200 people voiced support for the most ambitious plan- Alternative 20. In a precedent-setting action, the City agreed to share costs for the plan that will remove X miles of concrete and an 11-mile stretch through the heart of our region.
   
   A Better LA in 2050
   By touring the Rover's interior, children and adults are introduced to the pre-channelized River's natural and human history in the Past Gallery where animal pelts, native plant scents, bird calls and frog croaks bring the River alive. The Present Gallery includes an aquarium where aquatic insects and fish from the River give guests a look into its waters. A counter with microscopes and a sink turns the area into a mobile laboratory. A true/false game and interpretive panels provide an overview of the River as it is today. In the Future Gallery images of future plans are projected onto a screen. A game allows visitors to place hexagonal tiles depicting bike paths, wetlands and other amenities onto a concrete channel to create the River of their dreams.The vehicle's vibrant exterior artwork provides additional opportunity to engage the public.
   
   With the River Rover FoLAR's visibility and effectiveness will grow exponentially. Programming is limitless and partnerships abundant. As William Carlos Williams noted, “A new world is a new mind.” A new River is possible. By 2050 the possible will be realized.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  FoLAR’s work benefits all; near and far, young and old, nature lovers and
  urbanites alike. Because the Los Angeles River is one of the few elements that
  cross geographical, economic and social boundaries in Los Angeles, FoLAR is in
  a unique position to CONNECT Angelenos in ways no other civic project
  can.Though our work is for everyone’s benefit habitat restoration of the River
  will first and foremost impact the hundreds of thousands of, mostly
  low-income, families and business owners who’ve have made the banks of the LA
  River their home for generations. 
   The LA River runs through some of the most densely populated, and ethnically diverse communities in the country where access to nature and open space is virtually non-existent for millions. According to the City Project there are 7.2 total acres of green space per thousand residents along the River corridor, compared to 89.8 countywide and 1,343.5 statewide.
   Communities along the River corridor are disproportionately Latino: 52% along the River, compared to 48% for the city, 47% for the county, and 37% statewide.
   And 18% of the people live in poverty, compared to 20% citywide, 16% countywide, and 14% statewide. Designed for all ages, the Rover is also equipped with an ADA wheelchair lift, allowing people of all abilities to enter, experience and exit the vehicle with ease. FoLAR's bilingual staff speak Spanish, Korean and Farsi and many of our partners advocate for other diverse cultures – Chinese, Vietnamese.
   
   FoLAR’s current school program focuses on students and their teachers in grades 3 through 6. A pilot program for high school students begins in Fall 2014.The goal is to provide opportunities for students from Kindergarten through college with curriculum and connections to the LA River. On weekends, students have the opportunity to bring their friends and family to the River to see the LA River Rover that visited their school and to explore the River together through family-friendly progams and activities.
   Neighborhood council meetings, libraries, summer day camps, places of worship; anywhere we can safely park is a place to engage people of all ages, all nationalities, all socio-economic backgrounds and all abilities. Staging near the River introduces members of park-poor communities to an oasis in their backyard; a place for recreation, respite and open expanses. Connecting Angelenos to its River has never been more feasible. FoLAR is connecting us all to a better future.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service: With a new directive to encourage and
  nurture an appreciation of wildlife conservation in new urban audiences who
  are often disconnected from nature and wildlife, the USFWS created the Urban
  Wildlife Refuge Partnership. Recognizing the ability to connect with diverse
  populations in an urban environment the River Rover was selected as one of
  eight partners. Through our connection we are building a new conservation
  constituency to engage new and different peoplein meaningful, collaborative
  ways that build sustainable, broad-based support. We've collaborated on a
  technical support grant to develop an LA River map emphasizing recreation and
  ecological diversity that will be distributed from the River Rover.
   The Los Angeles County Natural History Museum:The first grant FoLAR received was to compile a Biota for the Los Angeles River in partnership with the Natural History Museum. The majority of the data used to document the biological diversity on the LA River was gleaned from the Museum’s vast collection. With a commitment from both the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the city of Los Angeles to share costs associated with the most ambitious plan EVER PROPOSED to restore 11 miles of wetland habitat we’ve again joined forces with the Natural History Museum. Experts from the Museum on birds, fish, reptiles, amphibians and mammals are at the ready to lend their knowledge and expertise to our programs. The LA River Rover will stage numerous events in the Museum’s habitat garden and we’re working together on an exhibit and lecture series, utilizing the Museum’s vast collections, to focus on the River’s historic and possible future bio-diversity. We’re also working closely with the Museum’s mobile education staff on ways to share education materials and expertise.
   The Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority: The Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority (MRCA) has worked for decades to create and maintain small pocket parks on the Los Angeles River corridor and FoLAR has championed their efforts. With funding from the MRCA FoLAR created the first decorative gates -the Heron Gates- to declare the River open to the public. We’ve worked together to reimagine a railyard, owned by Union Pacific across the River from Union Station, as a location for restored wetlands and water retention that is included in the ecosystem restoration plan. We partner with MRCA’s trained naturalists whose knowledge, expertise and programmin
