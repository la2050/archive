Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  The CLF will hire a staff of the very best computer science instructors who
  know how to engage and help stimulate the creativity of our
  middle-to-high-school age population of “low-income, at-risk” students- and
  inspire them to learn not only coding and programming basics and more- but how
  to create their very own apps in the process! We want to enlighten our
  students to the fact that computer science is THE industry of the future- and
  that THEY- regardless of 
   socio-economic background, can help make LA into the next Silicone Valley!
   The CLF will also hire additional STEM-focused tutors, in order to further aid with the increasing interest and application in all levels of their math and science subjects, and to further inspire them to get excited about learning more about Math, Technology, Science, and make certain their GPA stays at not only an acceptable place- but at a highly competitive one.We are also calling this an “Initiative” because we also want to help remove the stigma of both intimidation and exclusion from learning about computer science- (It is NOT as hard as one thinks in today’s plugged-in world!) and that learning about it and how to do it IS cool, not geeky or difficult. Don’t bully something you know nothing about, and this is something we want to get across- just give this a chance, and see what happens!
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Today, our Coding is Cool initiative will help make LA into the best place to
  learn because our Care through College students will be studying for the
  career of the future- the field of Computer Science. This initiative will not
  only make them MORE competitive and viable in the job market when they
  graduate college, but will help make LA the place where tech companies will
  want to expand and grow and find the best, most innovative programmers in the
  country. (Because here in LA, they start learning to code and to program as
  children and young teens!)
   
   By 2050, the CLF sees LA as the second Silicone Valley, and having students coming from lower-income backgrounds being able to attain AMAZING jobs, right out of school (and earn up to three times the average salary!) This would be a highly tremendous boost to the community on ALL levels- and we are EXCITED to see it become a reality!
   
   Coding is Cool Goals are Three-Fold: 
   1. To allow the students on our Care through College Program (who are middle school to high school age, at-risk and primarily Latino youth in LA) access to actual Coding and Computer Programming Workshops- so that they may learn the fundamentals of computer science, coding and programming and building apps-culminating in creating their very own app at the end of the first year’s CIC workshop.
   
   2. The CLF will hire a staff of awesome STEM tutors to instruct our students specifically in Science and Math- to demonstrate just how fascinating these subjects truly are, to insure graduation rates and good college entry prospects, and- to further inspire and augment their interest in our new CIC workshops.
   
   3. The CLF will endeavor to inspire our students to think of a career completely outside of what they may ever have imagined- one in the fields of computer science and technology-and provide these future LA residents and taxpayers with the very means to have an impactful, meaningful, fulfilling and prosperous career.
   
   We will also be connecting and hiring the best instructors to connect with our students, and give a fresh group of instructors the opportunity to impact an entire generation of young Angelenos!
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Our Coding is Cool Initiative will greatly benefit the primarily Latino,
  “at-risk,” and very, very low-income youth we serve in the Mar Vista, Palms,
  Venice and Culver City areas of Los Angeles. They all reside in LA county. The
  Census Bureau identifies them as very, very low-income. These students are
  enrolled in LAUSD schools, and are a part of our larger Care through College
  Educational Program. A majority of these students are also a part of the CLF’s
  Vita Network, which allow their families to achieve more, and to experience a
  far better quality of life in Los Angeles through our three Program
  Platforms. 
   
   This population is so in need of Coding is Cool for some very specific reasons:
   
   -In 2012, according to CollegeBoard.com. LESS THAN 3,000 Hispanic and African-American Students took the high school AP Computer Science Exam. This is a STAGGERING, and staggeringly SAD, fact. 
   
   According to Forbes, Computer Science is the high-paid college degree. And according to NSF.gov. less than 2.4% of college students graduate with a degree in it! 9 out of 10 K-12 schools don’t even offer computer-programming classes, according to Code.org. 
   
   And then there’s this, from Time.com’s own Keith Wagstaff: “If technology is the future, however, we are doing a woeful job of preparing our kids for it. Computer science is the only one of the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) fields that has actually seen a decrease in student participation over the last 20 years, from 25% of high school students to only 19%, according to a study by the National Center for Education Statistics. Take a look at the curriculum of many classes labeled “computer science” today, and you’ll find not much has changed from the days of dial-up modems. Most cover the basics: Learning how to type and use Microsoft Word and PowerPoint. “ (itals ours) Not encouraging!
   
   But Coding is Cool can help change all of this, and change the entire trajectory of an at-risk child's young life and future career.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Our students will be primarily enrolled in LAUSD schools. This is a
  collaboration by means of our offering LAUSD students these workshops
  absolutely free-of-charge, and to supplement the few computer science classes
  they have (if any).
