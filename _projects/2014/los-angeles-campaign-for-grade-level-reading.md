  In 2013, the national Campaign for Grade-Level Reading invited FIS to serve as
  the coordinating agency of the LA GLR Campaign, targeting three challenges to
  students’ reading success that are consequential and amenable to community
  solutions: 
   - The Readiness Gap-too many children from low-income families begin school already behind
   - The Attendance Gap-too many children from low-income families miss too much school; and 
   - The Summer Slide-too many children lose ground in summer.
   
   To address these issues, FIS will implement the following core initiatives, with a goal of impacting 150,000 LA County students. With LA 2050 support, FIS will both expand parents’ access to these programs, and deepen parent involvement by providing more site-based literacy workshops. 
   1) Million Word Challenge: For 13 years, FIS has convened parents, schools, and community leaders to challenge students, Pre-K through 12th grade, to read millions of words outside of the classroom. Early learning centers are prioritized as enthusiastic participants. In 2014, over 100,000 students in 300 schools logged the books they read outside of school under the supervision of their parent or guardian. After seven-weeks, each school selects one student winner to be honored. 
   
   FIS offers parent engagement workshops at select MWC schools to inform parents about the MWC and the value of out of school time reading, distributes a bilingual (English/Spanish) Family Reading Guide to parents, and has developed materials for participating schools that include a Launch Kit and MWC Hand Book. Parents receive weekly tips to help support their child’s learning at home. Parents report that as they spend more time reading together, family bonds also strengthen. With LA 2050 support, FIS will deepen its impact in each school with additional literacy support and resources to parents.
   
   2) Passport to Success: This innovative initiative reduces summer learning loss by encouraging families with preschool and elementary students to participate in free and low-cost summer learning activities. Throughout summer, thousands of families visit museums listed in their summer learning kit and collect stamps in a family passport that students submit to their schools for prizes. With LA 2050 support, FIS will be able to provide summer learning kits to more families and foster greater community building among participating families by expanding online engagement.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  The Campaign will help make LA the best place to learn today by showing
  students and families that the entire community is an educational playground
  and learning is not just a formal, structured activity limited to a classroom.
  The initiative is not simply about increasing reading proficiency, it is also
  about creating the community conditions that support parents’ efforts to be
  actively engaged in their children’s learning. By engaging parents in
  accessible, inclusive, non-intimidating and fun out-of-school programs, FIS
  helps parents create a love of learning in their children that will last
  throughout their lives. 
   
   The Campaign meshes perfectly with LA2050’s learning goal, in particular with the “every high school student will graduate and be college and career ready” and “all parents will be engaged and empowered to direct their children’s learning” components. Programs such as the Campaign will help Los Angeles become a leader and innovator in the educational landscape, rather than a sobering statistic.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The Campaign seeks to increase the number of low-income LA County students of
  color who are reading at grade level by the end of 3rd-grade by impacting
  150,000 students. Los Angeles County is facing an educational crisis. As
  aforementioned there is a significant gap in reading proficiency between
  low-income students and their more economically advantaged peers. Up until 3rd
  grade, children are mastering the art of reading. From 3rd grade forward,
  reading is the key to learning. When students cannot read at grade-level by
  3rd grade, it has devastating consequences for the entirety of their
  education. FIS believes that focusing on communities with the largest
  concentration of students who scored in the lowest 25% on the California
  Standards Test (or new Smarter Balance tests), will yield the greatest
  improvements to overall grade-level reading in LA County. FIS has chosen to
  serve these students because we believe it is in these communities that our
  services can make a measurable difference. 
   
   Both Campaign initiatives, the Million Word Challenge and Passport to Success, invest in high need communities throughout LA County. MWC and PST increase access to resources and opportunities to engage in family literacy activities otherwise not present. These initiatives serve not only students and their families, but also their teachers and school staff. Participating schools receive parent engagement and literacy tools to help them better serve their families.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  In addition to support from the national Campaign for Grade-Level Reading
  network, FIS is fortunate to have a number of thought partners and key
  sponsors in this critical endeavor:
   
   Los Angeles County Office of Education (LACOE): LACOE has provided technical assistance and outreach support for both MWC and PTS and has worked with us for over a decade.
   
   L.A. Compact: Los Angeles leaders from the education, business, government, labor, and non-profit sectors committed to transform education outcomes from cradle to career. The Campaign is aligned with the L.A. Compact and has a representative who serves on the Campaign's Steering Committee to help produce better outcomes for the youth of L.A. from cradle to career.
   
   First 5 LA: First 5 LA is a thought partner and Campaign Steering Committee member. They lead the work group charged with identifying policy related to early learning and best practices to be employed at demonstration sites.
   
   Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD): Both the MWC and PTS serve LAUSD schools for 13 years. LAUSD has two representatives who serve on the Campaign Steering Committee.
   
   Disney Citizenship: Disney Citizenship provides in-kind support by providing volunteers and incentives for student program participants. 
   
   Target: Target has provided ongoing funding for both MWC and PTS for over 3 years, enabling these programs to reach hundreds of schools. These programs have been instrumental in carrying out Target’s vision for improved literacy levels in LA County.
   
   Collins Foundation: For the past 2 years, the Collins Foundation has funded components of our literacy work through both MWC and PTS. 
   There are three factors contributing to the success of these partnerships:
   
   Communication: The success of these collaborations relies on the partners’ abilities to communicate amongst each other and communicate with the families within LA County. FIS facilitates that communication through the Steering Committee and other mechanisms. 
   
   Reciprocity: Collaboration works when it is mutually beneficial. Our education partners clearly share the goal of improved student success, the business community benefits from a more skilled and career-ready workforce and many of our philanthropic partners are able to support a vital community effort while exposing their brand to a broad audience.
   
   Clear Expectations: Partner roles are clearly defined to maximize efficiency and establish accountability to ensure all goals are met.
