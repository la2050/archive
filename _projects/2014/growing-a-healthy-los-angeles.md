Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  The National Partnership and LACBC will begin by hiring a media expert to
  oversee the creative direction and strategy for this regional mobility
  storytelling effort. The media expert will work with a team, including a
  photographer and videographer, to travel the county collecting stories and
  user-generated content. This media expert will also serve as the curator for
  both the professionally produced and user-generated content. We aim to have
  100 professionally produced stories and hundreds of user-generated content,
  with both online and outreach event components. The stories will capture how,
  why and where everyday Angelenos travel, what they would change about
  transportation, and what they envision for the future of transportation in
  2050.
   
   This effort believes in the power of Angelenos to shape the future of our region, in the multiplicity of how we actually move across the county. We are not, in fact, the "car capital" of the world when one looks at travel pattern data and numbers of car free households. The power to change this paradigm lies in using strategies inspired by ground truthing to capture stories and experiences from hundreds of voices across the Los Angeles region.
   
   Currently, these draft questions are:
   Where do you go? With whom?
   How do you get around?
   How do you feel when traveling in Los Angeles County?
   What’s your favorite regular trip?
   What transportation options do you imagine in 2050? How do you feel about transportation options now?
   If you had a magic wand, what one change would you make to transportation in LA?
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Healthy communities require safe, equitable and accessible transportation, so
  that residents are able to access healthcare, housing, jobs, schools and other
  community destinations.
   
   The MyLA2050 report found:
   “The more we strengthen ties within families, between neighbors and across our diverse communities, the greater we can ensure that our regions provides a safe environment for all Angelenos,” and “We believe in the power of Angelenos to shape the future of our region.”
   
   This regional mobility storytelling effort seeks to get at the heart of those statements by creating space for inclusive and diverse narratives about mobility/sense of place. 
   
   This project aims to highlight how people across Los Angeles County are currently traveling and support a shared vision of not only regional success for mobility, but empathy and compassion for travel needs of all users—all ages, abilities and income levels. These stories can reframe the narrative on mobility in LA by Angelenos themselves, from their own experiences and hopes. By infusing important transportation policy conversations with real experiences from people throughout the region, particularly in traditionally underserved communities like Central, South and East LA, the Gateway Cities and San Gabriel Valley, we hope to unite diverse perspectives around common themes and galvanize support for a transportation system that improves safety and independence for all.
   
   Los Angeles County invests billions of dollars annually into its transportation network, thanks to repeated voter support of local sales tax measures that generate two-thirds of our transportation funding. Metro, the county’s transportation agency, is currently considering a countywide transportation ballot measure for 2016 that will fund a specific lists of projects to be finalized by the summer of 2015. The story we tell over the coming months about mobility will directly inform the projects funded by the measure and the narrative used to sell it to voters. If we are successful with this project, billions of dollars in the next tax measure could be available for walking and bicycling. Any future measure will literally build out Los Angeles County’s 2050 transportation system, so the policy decisions made in the next year will impact the built environment for decades to come. It is imperative that the narrative about this measure be inclusive of diverse community needs and accurately reflect the mobility solutions Angelenos desire.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  This project will benefit those whose voices, needs and experiences who are
  not being reflected in current mobility policy and investment decisions for
  Los Angeles County. These voices are students, seniors, lower income workers,
  pedestrians and bicyclists--people who have important places to go, but may
  not happen to be commuting to work.
   
   Over the past two years, the National Partnership and LACBC have been supporting the Los Angeles Active Transportation Collaborative as a way to engage stakeholders in Los Angeles County to discuss the current policy and finance landscape for active transportation in the region. From public agency staff, elected officials, school districts, community-based organizations and other partners, we have consistently heard that the current lack of supportive policy, local revenue and a regional planning and finance strategy are all barriers to greater investment in walking and bicycling, despite overwhelming need and interest in our communities. Most recently, in the summer of 2014, the Los Angeles County Active Transportation Collaborative engaged over 60 partners across the County to encourage Metro to support the development of a clear investment strategy to guide county transportation policy and investments aimed at creating a multimodal system that serves all users of our transportation system.
   
   Many transportation conversations in the Los Angeles Region currently lack measurable goals for transportation and health in Los Angeles County and therefore do not provide an understanding of how alternative investment strategies could yield different outcomes related to mode shift, increased transit ridership, land use patterns or public health. This project would directly support addressing that gap by providing a professional campaign rooted in county transportation data trends for all trips and community and individual mobility stories of needs and aspirations. Ultimately all our policy work needs to be founded on real people with real transportation needs. Our region’s transportation policy has largely lost touch with this reality.
   
   With so much attention on efforts to repair city sidewalks, revitalize the Los Angeles River, expand CicLAvia, connect neighborhoods to transit and provide students with safe routes to school, this storytelling effort can weave these individual visions into a broader narrative, leading to smarter investments that improve mobility for people of all ages and abilities.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: |-
  Safe Routes to School National Partnership (confirmed)
   Los Angeles County Bicycle Coalition (confirmed)
   HubLA (confirmed)
   Multicultural Communities for Mobility (confirmed)
   Team Friday (confirmed) 
   Advancement Project (confirmed)
   Learn Do Share LA (confirmed)
   And if successful in this funding opportunity, we intend to open this up to more partners 
   
   Three factors:
   Each partner reaches different target audiences--together we touch a diverse cross-section of Los Angeles County to ensure that everyone has a chance for their story to be told.
   
   This project and resulting partnerships will live on beyond this grant--partners agree to share content and contacts and have the newly created story library be open source for all to use.
   
   The overall tone of effort is inclusive, intentional and incisive--high-quality artistic content will unite transportation conversations with user experiences from across LA County, particularly underserved communities and populations.
