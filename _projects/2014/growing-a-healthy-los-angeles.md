Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  The National Partnership and LACBC will begin by hiring a media expert to
  oversee the creative direction and strategy for this regional mobility
  storytelling effort. The media expert will work with a team, including a
  photographer and videographer, to travel the county collecting stories and
  user-generated content. This media expert will also serve as the curator for
  both the professionally produced and user-generated content. We aim to have
  100 professionally produced stories and hundreds of user-generated content,
  with both online and outreach event components. The stories will capture how,
  why and where everyday Angelenos travel, what they would change about
  transportation, and what they envision for the future of transportation in
  2050.
   
   This effort believes in the power of Angelenos to shape the future of our region, in the multiplicity of how we actually move across the county. We are not, in fact, the "car capital" of the world when one looks at travel pattern data and numbers of car free households. The power to change this paradigm lies in using strategies inspired by ground truthing to capture stories and experiences from hundreds of voices across the Los Angeles region.
   
   Currently, these draft questions are:
   Where do you go? With whom?
   How do you get around?
   How do you feel when traveling in Los Angeles County?
   What’s your favorite regular trip?
   What transportation options do you imagine in 2050? How do you feel about transportation options now?
   If you had a magic wand, what one change would you make to transportation in LA?
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Healthy communities require safe, equitable and accessible transportation, so
  that residents are able to access healthcare, housing, jobs, schools and other
  community destinations.
   
   The MyLA2050 report found:
   “The more we strengthen ties within families, between neighbors and across our diverse communities, the greater we can ensure that our regions provides a safe environment for all Angelenos,” and “We believe in the power of Angelenos to shape the future of our region.”
   
   This regional mobility storytelling effort seeks to get at the heart of those statements by creating space for inclusive and diverse narratives about mobility/sense of place. 
   
   This project aims to highlight how people across Los Angeles County are currently traveling and support a shared vision of not only regional success for mobility, but empathy and compassion for travel needs of all users—all ages, abilities and income levels. These stories can reframe the narrative on mobility in LA by Angelenos themselves, from their own experiences and hopes. By infusing important transportation policy conversations with real experiences from people throughout the region, particularly in traditionally underserved communities like Central, South and East LA, the Gateway Cities and San Gabriel Valley, we hope to unite diverse perspectives around common themes and galvanize support for a transportation system that improves safety and independence for all.
   
   Los Angeles County invests billions of dollars annually into its transportation network, thanks to repeated voter support of local sales tax measures that generate two-thirds of our transportation funding. Metro, the county’s transportation agency, is currently considering a countywide transportation ballot measure for 2016 that will fund a specific lists of projects to be finalized by the summer of 2015. The story we tell over the coming months about mobility will directly inform the projects funded by the measure and the narrative used to sell it to voters. If we are successful with this project, billions of dollars in the next tax measure could be available for walking and bicycling. Any future measure will literally build out Los Angeles County’s 2050 transportation system, so the policy decisions made in the next year will impact the built environment for decades to come. It is imperative that the narrative about this measure be inclusive of diverse community needs and accurately reflect the mobility solutions Angelenos desire.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  This project will benefit those whose voices, needs and experiences who are
  not being reflected in current mobility policy and investment decisions for
  Los Angeles County. These voices are students, seniors, lower income workers,
  pedestrians and bicyclists--people who have important places to go, but may
  not happen to be commuting to work.
   
   Over the past two years, the National Partnership and LACBC have been supporting the Los Angeles Active Transportation Collaborative as a way to engage stakeholders in Los Angeles County to discuss the current policy and finance landscape for active transportation in the region. From public agency staff, elected officials, school districts, community-based organizations and other partners, we have consistently heard that the current lack of supportive policy, local revenue and a regional planning and finance strategy are all barriers to greater investment in walking and bicycling, despite overwhelming need and interest in our communities. Most recently, in the summer of 2014, the Los Angeles County Active Transportation Collaborative engaged over 60 partners across the County to encourage Metro to support the development of a clear investment strategy to guide county transportation policy and investments aimed at creating a multimodal system that serves all users of our transportation system.
   
   Many transportation conversations in the Los Angeles Region currently lack measurable goals for transportation and health in Los Angeles County and therefore do not provide an understanding of how alternative investment strategies could yield different outcomes related to mode shift, increased transit ridership, land use patterns or public health. This project would directly support addressing that gap by providing a professional campaign rooted in county transportation data trends for all trips and community and individual mobility stories of needs and aspirations. Ultimately all our policy work needs to be founded on real people with real transportation needs. Our region’s transportation policy has largely lost touch with this reality.
   
   With so much attention on efforts to repair city sidewalks, revitalize the Los Angeles River, expand CicLAvia, connect neighborhoods to transit and provide students with safe routes to school, this storytelling effort can weave these individual visions into a broader narrative, leading to smarter investments that improve mobility for people of all ages and abilities.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: |-
  Safe Routes to School National Partnership (confirmed)
   Los Angeles County Bicycle Coalition (confirmed)
   HubLA (confirmed)
   Multicultural Communities for Mobility (confirmed)
   Team Friday (confirmed) 
   Advancement Project (confirmed)
   Learn Do Share LA (confirmed)
   And if successful in this funding opportunity, we intend to open this up to more partners 
   
   Three factors:
   Each partner reaches different target audiences--together we touch a diverse cross-section of Los Angeles County to ensure that everyone has a chance for their story to be told.
   
   This project and resulting partnerships will live on beyond this grant--partners agree to share content and contacts and have the newly created story library be open source for all to use.
   
   The overall tone of effort is inclusive, intentional and incisive--high-quality artistic content will unite transportation conversations with user experiences from across LA County, particularly underserved communities and populations.

  describe_idea: >-
    In the next year, LA Community Garden Council will help an additional 150
    low-income families grow healthy food in their neighborhood.
  more_detail: "We envision a community garden network for Los Angeles where people of all ages live healthy, active lives in a clean environment by growing fresh food in their neighborhood. This network enables healthy lifestyles by providing access to healthy food and getting people outdoors exercising through gardening. It fosters the meeting of people from diverse cultures to share the best growing techniques in order to practice sustainable urban agriculture while growing sustainable communities.  \r\n\r\nIn the next year, LA Community Garden Council will build three new community gardens in low-income neighborhoods to ensure that at least 150 families can grow their own healthy food in their neighborhood."
  implement: "First, we will focus on community organizing.  We will partner with LA Conservation Corps to send out teams of paid youth ages 18 to 24 to canvass the neighborhood for approximately eight city blocks around the three identified community garden sites. They will knock on doors, meet the residents, distribute bilingual fliers providing information about the new community garden, and invite them to give us their contact information and attend community meetings.  We will also reach out to schools, recreation centers, religious institutions, businesses, and other local organizations to let them know about the community garden and invite them to participate in the planning process.\r\n\r\nSecond, we will hold at least two community meetings for each garden where we will listen to the local residents’ ideas about how they envision the community garden and how it will make their community healthier.  We will have a landscape architect present to sketch out the ideas and start to form the garden plans based on the community members’ needs and desires. Over the next few weeks while the architect develops the plans, we will continue to organize the community to build a volunteer leadership team of at least five people and we will work with this team to create bylaws, gardener agreements, and garden rules. \r\n\r\nThird, we will help build the community gardens. We will ensure the water is connected, put up a fence and sign, and organize community volunteer days to build the raised beds, mulch the pathways, build a communal meeting area, construct a tool shed and composting area, and help make the ideas and plans a reality!  We will bring in soil, seeds, and seedlings to make sure that the gardeners have everything they need to start growing food.\r\n\r\nFinally, we will organize classes in the community gardens.  Starting with basic gardening skills and partnering with the UCCE Master Gardeners, we will make sure that every gardener can grow basics such as tomatoes, zucchini, herbs, and beans without fear. After 6-8 weeks, when the first harvest is ready, we will help organize a garden opening celebration!  We will continue to assist the garden leadership team and will gradually expand the educational program to bring in nutritionists from local wellness centers to lead classes on healthy eating and chefs to lead classes on healthy cooking."
  impact_live: "Within the first year, the three new community gardens will provide access to healthy food and exercise for at least 150 low-income families in LA County.  Healthcare professionals are starting to recognize the need for a holistic approach to preventative care and a healthy diet and exercise are key components of this. From the existing LA Community Garden Council gardens, we have evidence that gardeners lose weight in their first year of gardening, which helps to prevent Type 2 Diabetes, cholesterol, hypertension, and heart disease. Gardening is relaxing and therapeutic and helps patients with mental illness. By getting children outdoors to garden instead of indoors in front of computer screens, we will help to create positive childhood experiences. We will encourage gardeners to walk, bike or take public transport to their community garden for their health as well as the community’s health.\r\n\r\nBuilding new community gardens creates a healthier environment for local residents. We will seek to have land leases that extend beyond 2050 and, preferably, ensure that the land is used as green space in perpetuity.  Teaching organic gardening techniques, including composting and seed collection, will ensure that the garden is sustainable and it will lower residents’ exposure to unhealthy toxins.  We will have rainwater collection systems in the garden to ensure the best water conservation methods are followed and to reduce dependence on imported water. We will plant trees around the perimeter of the garden to increase the tree canopy cover.\r\n\r\nBy focusing on low-income neighborhoods, we will help families to reduce their grocery bill by growing their own food.  Ultimately, this reduces the number of households living below the self-sufficiency standard, builds more resilient communities, and helps to reduce rates of homelessness.  \r\n\r\nWe are confident that this three-fold focus on (1) access to healthy food and active lifestyles, (2) creating a sustainable environment, and (3) addressing economic concerns in lower-income neighborhoods will help to make LA the healthiest place to live in 2050!"
  who_benefit: "Within six weeks of the completion of the new community gardens, at least 150 low-income families in LA County will directly benefit from eating the fresh produce that they are growing, based on each garden having 50 gardeners. As most avid gardeners know, a single harvest is often too much for your immediate family to consume and so you soon find yourself spreading the wealth and giving away tomatoes, zucchini, mint, and other edibles to your extended family, neighbors, school friends, and co-workers! \r\n\r\nWe are focusing on the Watts area of South LA for the new garden sites because of the immense need in this area where, according to the LA Times profile, the median household income is low at $25,161, the median age is young at 21 years (partly due to gang violence), household size is high at 4.0 people, only 2.9% of residents have a four-year college degree, and 38.9% of the households are headed by a single parent.  61.6% of the residents are Latino and 37.1% are black.\r\n\r\nThere are currently 125 community gardens open to anyone in the community in LA County (this does not include gardens with restricted access, for example at schools, hospitals, or detention centers).  Our goal is to build three new community gardens in 2015, four new gardens in 2016, five new gardens in 2017, and continue to build one additional new garden every year for the next 36 years. By 2050, there will be 863 community gardens in LA County.  If each of these serves 50 families and the average family size continues to be 4.0, more than 172,000 people will benefit from growing their own healthy food in their neighborhood!"
  partners_collaboration: "To acquire the land, we will partner with organizations including the LA Neighborhood Land Trust and the Trust for Public Land.  We have worked with these organizations in the past and they bring expertise to the process of land acquisition.\r\n\r\nFor the past 16 years, LA Community Garden Council has partnered with the LA Conservation Corps to employ youth from low-income neighborhoods to help with community organizing and construction of the community gardens.  They bring skilled labor and efficiency in numbers. \r\n\r\nWe will continue to partner with the UCCE Master Gardener program to find knowledgeable and experienced teachers to lead our gardening classes.  We plan to form new partnerships with healthcare professionals, especially nutritionists, to offer health programs in the community gardens.\r\n\r\nWhen there is surplus produce in the community gardens, we will continue to partner with Community Services Unlimited, a local organization that distributes fresh food through markets in South LA, selling produce at low prices in neighborhoods that are considered food deserts because of the lack of availability of fresh produce.\r\n\r\nThree factors that are critical to the success of these partnerships are (1) setting clear agreements and expectations in writing at the beginning of the partnership, (2) keeping channels of communication open and transparent throughout the project so that everyone is on the same page, and (3) debriefing at the end of the project so that we can determine ways to work together even better in future.

  impact_metrics: "The most immediate impact of the new community gardens will be to increase access to healthy food.  This indirectly offers access to healthcare because a healthy diet is essential as a primary preventative measure in any health plan.  The gardens will help to reduce obesity and related diseases.  We encourage gardeners to walk, bike or take public transport to the gardens, for their health as well as for environmental reasons.  Gardening is therapeutic and helps to reduce mental illness and it gets children outside and in community with people of all generations, increasing the prospect of positive childhood experiences. \r\n\r\nBy creating more green space and a sustainable, organic garden, we will reduce residents' exposure to air toxins.  The gardens will contain trees to increase the level of tree canopy cover.\r\n\r\nBy focusing on lower-income neighborhoods, we will reduce grocery bills, and consequently the number of households below the self-sufficiency standard and reduce homelessness rates.\r\n\r\nBy building rainwater collection systems, we will conserve water and reduce the percentage of  imported water.\r\n\r\nCommunity gardens help to improve health and to reduce crime in neighborhoods, leading to more resilient communities."

  evaluate: "We will consider the project to have been successful if, by September 2015 and within budget, we have:\r\n\r\n1.\tOpened three new community gardens in low-income neighborhoods\r\n2.\tOrganized an active and effective volunteer leadership team of at least 5 people for each of the community gardens\r\n3.\tHeld at least ten gardening and nutrition classes for the community gardeners\r\n"
  two_lessons: "The two lessons that informed our community garden project most were from the LA2050 Report (pages 25-26):\r\n\r\n1.\tHeart disease is one of the top four leading causes of premature death for whites, Latinos, African Americans, and Asian/Pacific Islanders. This is preventable with a healthy diet and we believe that every person has the right to grow healthy food in their neighborhood.\r\n2.\tOnly 33% of children in Los Angeles live with ¼ mile of a park. By building community gardens, we are creating more green space where children can play and learn and therefore increasing this number."
  achievable_goal: "LA Community Garden Council’s expertise is building new community gardens!  We have built 32 community gardens around LA County and assisted with the building of many more.  \r\n\r\nWe have already identified vacant city-owned land for the three proposed community gardens and we expect to be able to sign a standard lease with the city in 2-3 months once funding is secured.  We will then spend two months focusing on community organizing.  The design phase usually takes 2-4 weeks and we can build a garden, with LA Conservation Corps labor and volunteers, in 1-2 weeks.  \r\n\r\nWe are therefore confident that we can build these three new gardens and make sure that they are functioning well with strong programs within the next twelve months."
  major_challenges: "We anticipate encountering the following barriers/challenges:\r\n\r\n1.\tThere are likely to be some residents who are, at first, reluctant to have a community garden in their neighborhood.  They may fear excessive noise from the garden, a lack of privacy or have another concern.  We will listen to these neighbors during the community meetings and at other meetings as needed, hear and address their concerns, and educate them in the many benefits of having a community garden in your neighborhood.  We will be prepared to adapt our architectural plans to satisfy their concerns, as needed.\r\n\r\n2.\tWe have a waitlist for all of the 32 community gardens that we currently manage.  We expect to have a waitlist for the new community gardens soon after they open.  We will address this excess demand by working with the new volunteer leadership teams to determine clear criteria for who can lease a plot in the garden (for example, only those who live within a certain radius of the garden) and to determine the length of the gardeners’ agreement.  Many of our recently opened gardens only allow one family to have their own plot for two or three years before passing it along to a family on the waitlist.  In years when they do not have their own plot, they are still able to garden and benefit from the produce grown in the communal areas of the garden."
  competition: "EnrichLA’s core competence is constructing school gardens in a day or two and offering introductory gardening classes to children.  They do this exceptionally well and there are more than 800 school gardens in LA County.  LA Community Garden Council focuses on the 125 gardens that are open to anyone in the neighborhood and we are more than happy to let EnrichLA oversee the construction of more school gardens!  We share the common goal of having more green space in LA County where more people can grow healthy food in their neighborhood.  LA Community Garden Council differs from EnrichLA because our primary focus is on building community through gardening not on building gardens for existing communities.\r\n\r\nThe LA Neighborhood Land Trust manages several community gardens in LA County.  They do a great job at this and we consider their work to be complementary because they also share our vision to have more green space in low-income neighborhoods where more people can grow their own healthy food."
  cost: >-
    In LA Community Garden Council’s recent experience, it typically costs
    between $30,000 and $35,000 to build a sustainable new community garden. 
    The most expensive items are typically connecting the water and erecting a
    fence.  Please see the budget below for details of the breakdown of this
    estimated cost.  If the cost runs above $100,000, we will cover the
    additional cost with donations from individuals.  LA Community Garden
    Council is currently building a strong annual giving campaign with support
    from individuals who are dedicated to our mission to build strong
    communities where every person in LA County can grow healthy food in their
    neighborhood.

    answer: "We envision a community garden network for Los Angeles where people of all ages live healthy, active lives in a clean environment by growing fresh food in their neighborhood. This network enables healthy lifestyles by providing access to healthy food and getting people outdoors exercising through gardening. It fosters the meeting of people from diverse cultures to share the best growing techniques in order to practice sustainable urban agriculture while growing sustainable communities.  \r\n\r\nIn the next year, LA Community Garden Council will build three new community gardens in low-income neighborhoods to ensure that at least 150 families can grow their own healthy food in their neighborhood."

    answer: "First, we will focus on community organizing.  We will partner with LA Conservation Corps to send out teams of paid youth ages 18 to 24 to canvass the neighborhood for approximately eight city blocks around the three identified community garden sites. They will knock on doors, meet the residents, distribute bilingual fliers providing information about the new community garden, and invite them to give us their contact information and attend community meetings.  We will also reach out to schools, recreation centers, religious institutions, businesses, and other local organizations to let them know about the community garden and invite them to participate in the planning process.\r\n\r\nSecond, we will hold at least two community meetings for each garden where we will listen to the local residents’ ideas about how they envision the community garden and how it will make their community healthier.  We will have a landscape architect present to sketch out the ideas and start to form the garden plans based on the community members’ needs and desires. Over the next few weeks while the architect develops the plans, we will continue to organize the community to build a volunteer leadership team of at least five people and we will work with this team to create bylaws, gardener agreements, and garden rules. \r\n\r\nThird, we will help build the community gardens. We will ensure the water is connected, put up a fence and sign, and organize community volunteer days to build the raised beds, mulch the pathways, build a communal meeting area, construct a tool shed and composting area, and help make the ideas and plans a reality!  We will bring in soil, seeds, and seedlings to make sure that the gardeners have everything they need to start growing food.\r\n\r\nFinally, we will organize classes in the community gardens.  Starting with basic gardening skills and partnering with the UCCE Master Gardeners, we will make sure that every gardener can grow basics such as tomatoes, zucchini, herbs, and beans without fear. After 6-8 weeks, when the first harvest is ready, we will help organize a garden opening celebration!  We will continue to assist the garden leadership team and will gradually expand the educational program to bring in nutritionists from local wellness centers to lead classes on healthy eating and chefs to lead classes on healthy cooking."

    answer: "Within the first year, the three new community gardens will provide access to healthy food and exercise for at least 150 low-income families in LA County.  Healthcare professionals are starting to recognize the need for a holistic approach to preventative care and a healthy diet and exercise are key components of this. From the existing LA Community Garden Council gardens, we have evidence that gardeners lose weight in their first year of gardening, which helps to prevent Type 2 Diabetes, cholesterol, hypertension, and heart disease. Gardening is relaxing and therapeutic and helps patients with mental illness. By getting children outdoors to garden instead of indoors in front of computer screens, we will help to create positive childhood experiences. We will encourage gardeners to walk, bike or take public transport to their community garden for their health as well as the community’s health.\r\n\r\nBuilding new community gardens creates a healthier environment for local residents. We will seek to have land leases that extend beyond 2050 and, preferably, ensure that the land is used as green space in perpetuity.  Teaching organic gardening techniques, including composting and seed collection, will ensure that the garden is sustainable and it will lower residents’ exposure to unhealthy toxins.  We will have rainwater collection systems in the garden to ensure the best water conservation methods are followed and to reduce dependence on imported water. We will plant trees around the perimeter of the garden to increase the tree canopy cover.\r\n\r\nBy focusing on low-income neighborhoods, we will help families to reduce their grocery bill by growing their own food.  Ultimately, this reduces the number of households living below the self-sufficiency standard, builds more resilient communities, and helps to reduce rates of homelessness.  \r\n\r\nWe are confident that this three-fold focus on (1) access to healthy food and active lifestyles, (2) creating a sustainable environment, and (3) addressing economic concerns in lower-income neighborhoods will help to make LA the healthiest place to live in 2050!"
  - name: who_benefit
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Within six weeks of the completion of the new community gardens, at least 150 low-income families in LA County will directly benefit from eating the fresh produce that they are growing, based on each garden having 50 gardeners. As most avid gardeners know, a single harvest is often too much for your immediate family to consume and so you soon find yourself spreading the wealth and giving away tomatoes, zucchini, mint, and other edibles to your extended family, neighbors, school friends, and co-workers! \r\n\r\nWe are focusing on the Watts area of South LA for the new garden sites because of the immense need in this area where, according to the LA Times profile, the median household income is low at $25,161, the median age is young at 21 years (partly due to gang violence), household size is high at 4.0 people, only 2.9% of residents have a four-year college degree, and 38.9% of the households are headed by a single parent.  61.6% of the residents are Latino and 37.1% are black.\r\n\r\nThere are currently 125 community gardens open to anyone in the community in LA County (this does not include gardens with restricted access, for example at schools, hospitals, or detention centers).  Our goal is to build three new community gardens in 2015, four new gardens in 2016, five new gardens in 2017, and continue to build one additional new garden every year for the next 36 years. By 2050, there will be 863 community gardens in LA County.  If each of these serves 50 families and the average family size continues to be 4.0, more than 172,000 people will benefit from growing their own healthy food in their neighborhood!"

      We strongly support collaboration, please tell us a little more about your
      partnership.
    answer: "To acquire the land, we will partner with organizations including the LA Neighborhood Land Trust and the Trust for Public Land.  We have worked with these organizations in the past and they bring expertise to the process of land acquisition.\r\n\r\nFor the past 16 years, LA Community Garden Council has partnered with the LA Conservation Corps to employ youth from low-income neighborhoods to help with community organizing and construction of the community gardens.  They bring skilled labor and efficiency in numbers. \r\n\r\nWe will continue to partner with the UCCE Master Gardener program to find knowledgeable and experienced teachers to lead our gardening classes.  We plan to form new partnerships with healthcare professionals, especially nutritionists, to offer health programs in the community gardens.\r\n\r\nWhen there is surplus produce in the community gardens, we will continue to partner with Community Services Unlimited, a local organization that distributes fresh food through markets in South LA, selling produce at low prices in neighborhoods that are considered food deserts because of the lack of availability of fresh produce.\r\n\r\nThree factors that are critical to the success of these partnerships are (1) setting clear agreements and expectations in writing at the beginning of the partnership, (2) keeping channels of communication open and transparent throughout the project so that everyone is on the same page, and (3) debriefing at the end of the project so that we can determine ways to work together even better in future.

    answer: "The most immediate impact of the new community gardens will be to increase access to healthy food.  This indirectly offers access to healthcare because a healthy diet is essential as a primary preventative measure in any health plan.  The gardens will help to reduce obesity and related diseases.  We encourage gardeners to walk, bike or take public transport to the gardens, for their health as well as for environmental reasons.  Gardening is therapeutic and helps to reduce mental illness and it gets children outside and in community with people of all generations, increasing the prospect of positive childhood experiences. \r\n\r\nBy creating more green space and a sustainable, organic garden, we will reduce residents' exposure to air toxins.  The gardens will contain trees to increase the level of tree canopy cover.\r\n\r\nBy focusing on lower-income neighborhoods, we will reduce grocery bills, and consequently the number of households below the self-sufficiency standard and reduce homelessness rates.\r\n\r\nBy building rainwater collection systems, we will conserve water and reduce the percentage of  imported water.\r\n\r\nCommunity gardens help to improve health and to reduce crime in neighborhoods, leading to more resilient communities."

This is preventable with a healthy diet and we believe that every person has the right to grow healthy food in their neighborhood.\r\n2.\tOnly 33% of children in Los Angeles live with ¼ mile of a park.

    answer: "LA Community Garden Council’s expertise is building new community gardens!  We have built 32 community gardens around LA County and assisted with the building of many more.  \r\n\r\nWe have already identified vacant city-owned land for the three proposed community gardens and we expect to be able to sign a standard lease with the city in 2-3 months once funding is secured.  We will then spend two months focusing on community organizing.  The design phase usually takes 2-4 weeks and we can build a garden, with LA Conservation Corps labor and volunteers, in 1-2 weeks.  \r\n\r\nWe are therefore confident that we can build these three new gardens and make sure that they are functioning well with strong programs within the next twelve months."
  - name: major_challenges
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "We anticipate encountering the following barriers/challenges:\r\n\r\n1.\tThere are likely to be some residents who are, at first, reluctant to have a community garden in their neighborhood.  They may fear excessive noise from the garden, a lack of privacy or have another concern.  We will listen to these neighbors during the community meetings and at other meetings as needed, hear and address their concerns, and educate them in the many benefits of having a community garden in your neighborhood.  We will be prepared to adapt our architectural plans to satisfy their concerns, as needed.\r\n\r\n2.\tWe have a waitlist for all of the 32 community gardens that we currently manage.  We expect to have a waitlist for the new community gardens soon after they open.  We will address this excess demand by working with the new volunteer leadership teams to determine clear criteria for who can lease a plot in the garden (for example, only those who live within a certain radius of the garden) and to determine the length of the gardeners’ agreement.  Many of our recently opened gardens only allow one family to have their own plot for two or three years before passing it along to a family on the waitlist.  In years when they do not have their own plot, they are still able to garden and benefit from the produce grown in the communal areas of the garden."

    answer: "EnrichLA’s core competence is constructing school gardens in a day or two and offering introductory gardening classes to children.  They do this exceptionally well and there are more than 800 school gardens in LA County.  LA Community Garden Council focuses on the 125 gardens that are open to anyone in the neighborhood and we are more than happy to let EnrichLA oversee the construction of more school gardens!  We share the common goal of having more green space in LA County where more people can grow healthy food in their neighborhood.  LA Community Garden Council differs from EnrichLA because our primary focus is on building community through gardening not on building gardens for existing communities.\r\n\r\nThe LA Neighborhood Land Trust manages several community gardens in LA County.  They do a great job at this and we consider their work to be complementary because they also share our vision to have more green space in low-income neighborhoods where more people can grow their own healthy food."
  - name: cost
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      In LA Community Garden Council’s recent experience, it typically costs
      between $30,000 and $35,000 to build a sustainable new community garden. 
      The most expensive items are typically connecting the water and erecting a
      fence.  Please see the budget below for details of the breakdown of this
      estimated cost.  If the cost runs above $100,000, we will cover the
      additional cost with donations from individuals.  LA Community Garden
      Council is currently building a strong annual giving campaign with support
      from individuals who are dedicated to our mission to build strong
      communities where every person in LA County can grow healthy food in their
      neighborhood.
