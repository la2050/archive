Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  In March, 2014 TreePeople launched TreeMapLA, a website and mobile app
  enabling communities to improve the environmental health of Los Angeles. Over
  the next year we plan to Populate, Innovate, and Communicate the map to
  crowd-source a greener LA.
   
   Populate
   TreeMapLA calculates eco-benefits (carbon dioxide captured, water saved, etc.) and monetary benefits for each tree and rainwater feature mapped. The more populated the map, the greater the calculated benefits, further motivating community action to increase canopy coverage and local water supplies. Over the next year we will:
   
   ● Activate our 10,000-strong volunteer base to participate in mapping events
   ● Train volunteer leaders – TreePeople’s and those of our partners - to lead their own mapping events
   ● Provide teachers with a STEAM-based curriculum to lead their students in tree mapping activities
   ● Seek municipal agencies and non-profit organizations with tree inventories to upload
   ● Broadly invite partners who can utilize tree mapping and activate their constituents 
   
   Innovate
   Inspired by the open source ethos of the OpenTreeMap platform upon which TreeMapLA is based, we intend to find and include features that will allow TreeMapLA to be the most efficient and user-friendly tool we can build, knowing our work will benefit all OTM users. Over the next year we are planning:
   
   ● Addition of Alerts & Actions enabling stewardship to mobile app
   ● Increased social media connections
   ● Bulk data upload, to upload tree inventories from municipalities and partners
   ● Content editing functionality, to keep the map timely and relevant 
   ● A bridge between TreeMapLA and our database, Salesforce, allowing us to better communicate with TreeMapLA users, provide more specific educational and action opportunities, and facilitate ongoing stewardship, e.g. allowing us to send an email that says, “We see you planted a tree a month ago. Have you watered it?” along with specific resources. 
   
   Communicate
   With teachers: To fulfill TreeMapLA’s educational potential, TreePeople has created curriculum for teachers, and will provide professional development training to use it. We’d like to provide free field trips to teachers who get the most students involved with TreeMapLA.
   
   With the community: Through social media, additional videos, tree ID and mapping events, and engaging partners and their constituents, we will be communicating about TreeMapLA to many audiences throughout LA.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Los Angeles’ urban ecosystem is broken and our future is at risk. Angelenos
  are in need of a healthier and more climate-resilient city – one with
  sufficient tree canopy to protect our neighborhoods, and more locally-sourced
  water. We urgently need our urban environment to protect us from extreme heat
  waves, droughts and floods, and related health and economic problems happening
  now -- and forecast to intensify in our future.
   
   Trees capture, filter and store rainwater, save energy, significantly cool surrounding areas, and absorb carbon dioxide and airborne pollutants. Some areas of LA have canopy coverage at nearly 40%, while others are only in the single digits. This geographic disparity corresponds with socio-economic and chronic health issues, leaving many of our most vulnerable residents even more at risk in years to come.
   
   The City of LA currently imports nearly 90% of its water from remote and increasingly contested sources. Meanwhile, every time it rains an inch in the city, 3.8 billion gallons run into the ocean. The city “throws away” an estimated $400 million worth of rainwater every year. This pollutes our ocean, leading to beach closures, sickness, and costly fines, and damages marine life.
   
   TreeMapLA shows the community specific eco-benefits of each tree and watershed feature, and the urban watershed as a whole. Each benefit is directly, or indirectly, related to the health of our city:
   
   ● Energy conserved (reducing energy-related carbon and particulate pollution due to cooling temperatures)
   ● Stormwater filtered (adding to cleaner local water supply)
   ● Air quality improved (reducing respiratory disease)
   ● Carbon dioxide removed and stored-to-date (reducing climate change)
   ● Stormwater runoff reduced (reducing pollution and toxicity)
   ● Water conserved (increasing water supply).
   
   Too often, because the environmental issues facing people seem so overwhelming, they feel powerless and paralyzed, unable to believe they can make any meaningful change. Research and our own experience tell us that when people see the difference they make, they are motivated to do more. We know that once people begin to notice and learn about trees, they never see the city the same way again. Noticing and learning are the first steps towards valuing. Living in a way that values, promotes and protects nature even in the most urbanized areas of LA improves our health -- now and in the future.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  TreeMapLA is a shared resource for LA’s people and organizations to co-create,
  revitalize, and steward a healthy urban forest watershed. By bringing people
  together with a shared vision for growing a more sustainable LA -- and a way
  of measuring their actions -- this collaborative tool can help all residents
  improve their communities, their health, and their well-being.
   
   TreePeople is reaching out to specific audiences to take a leading role. These include:
   
   1. Teachers and students. Using our 4 decades of experience developing environmental education, TreePeople’s TreeMapLA curriculum teaches all 5 “STEAM” areas--Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics--as students analyze canopy coverage and water needs of their school, map existing trees, identify species, understand eco-benefits, and use alerts to identify trees needing care. Rainwater harvesting projects can be identified and implemented, later using water saved to care for the trees schools have planted. 
   
   2. Partner organizations and their audiences. TreePeople is actively seeking partners to use TreeMapLA to advance their own goals. We are developing a set of best practices, promotional and outreach materials, and tips and tools that other organizations can adopt and make their own. 
   
   3. Those who can restore a functioning ecosystem (all of us). With spiraling costs to fix our broken ecosystem, and diminishing financial resources to do so, government agencies alone cannot plant or care for all the trees needed to achieve an ample urban tree canopy, nor can they provide a sustainable local water supply through traditional methods. For LA to be healthy and viable in the future, all of us need to become active managers of the urban watershed and ecosystem, taking personal responsibility for the trees in our lives and our city, and the rainwater that falls on our properties.
   
   4. A movement of active tree stewards and rainwater harvesters. As TreeMapLA is further developed and collaborators join, it’s an ideal platform for building a movement -- where those who are taking action can learn from and help others, where agencies can track water, energy and pollution savings and provide incentives, where neighborhoods, schools and cities can define their portion of the urban watershed and set goals and programs to improve them.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Early conceptual and design partners include LA City Recreation & Parks, LA
  City Urban Forestry Division and City Plants (formerly Million Trees LA). All
  provided invaluable insight into the need for collaborators to 1) feel a sense
  of ownership, 2) use the map to help achieve their own strategic goals, and 3)
  find ways for TreeMapLA to fit into their current programs.
   
   Partners currently providing direction on community and user engagement include Industrial District Green, a Downtown LA group increasing the livability of Skid Row and the Arts District by planting trees, UC Riverside, and the Earthwatch Institute, which engages people worldwide in scientific research. 
   
   IDG has been instrumental in helping to beta test TreeMapLA. Since the map launched, IDG has been partnering to map all the trees and empty tree wells in their area to create a master tree plan to plant the empty wells, determine where new trees can be placed, and better provide maintenance. What’s exciting about this partnership is its replicability in creating neighborhood-level master tree plans and tackling low-canopy areas.
   
   Our newest partnership is with Earthwatch Institute, an international non-profit, UC Riverside researchers, and several local non-profits to use TreeMapLA for ground-truthing that compares actual tree data to visual data collected by NASA flights to determine water use and growth rates of different species in different locations within the LA area. The goal is to predict which trees might be more sustainable as the climate in Southern California grows hotter and drier. To participate in a Citizen Science project that could literally change the urban forestry landscape in Los Angeles is incredible, and TreePeople sees this as only the first of many such projects, partnering with local non-profits and universities to collect and share usable scientific data through TreeMapLA.
   
   In the next year we’ll form a TreeMapLA Advisory Committee, and have identified urban forestry and related organizations to invite. We hope to bring in diverse ideas and ownership to make this the most valuable tool possible for our entire region.
   
   Our most important and long-term partnership, however, is with the people of LA. Our 40 year history has been one of partnering with people from all walks of life to educate, empower and motivate them to heal our environment. TreeMapLA makes it easier for all of us to join together and share knowledge to make our city more sustainable.
