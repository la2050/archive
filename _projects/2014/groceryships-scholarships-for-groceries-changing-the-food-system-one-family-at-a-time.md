Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  In March, 2014 TreePeople launched TreeMapLA, a website and mobile app
  enabling communities to improve the environmental health of Los Angeles. Over
  the next year we plan to Populate, Innovate, and Communicate the map to
  crowd-source a greener LA.
   
   Populate
   TreeMapLA calculates eco-benefits (carbon dioxide captured, water saved, etc.) and monetary benefits for each tree and rainwater feature mapped. The more populated the map, the greater the calculated benefits, further motivating community action to increase canopy coverage and local water supplies. Over the next year we will:
   
   ● Activate our 10,000-strong volunteer base to participate in mapping events
   ● Train volunteer leaders – TreePeople’s and those of our partners - to lead their own mapping events
   ● Provide teachers with a STEAM-based curriculum to lead their students in tree mapping activities
   ● Seek municipal agencies and non-profit organizations with tree inventories to upload
   ● Broadly invite partners who can utilize tree mapping and activate their constituents 
   
   Innovate
   Inspired by the open source ethos of the OpenTreeMap platform upon which TreeMapLA is based, we intend to find and include features that will allow TreeMapLA to be the most efficient and user-friendly tool we can build, knowing our work will benefit all OTM users. Over the next year we are planning:
   
   ● Addition of Alerts & Actions enabling stewardship to mobile app
   ● Increased social media connections
   ● Bulk data upload, to upload tree inventories from municipalities and partners
   ● Content editing functionality, to keep the map timely and relevant 
   ● A bridge between TreeMapLA and our database, Salesforce, allowing us to better communicate with TreeMapLA users, provide more specific educational and action opportunities, and facilitate ongoing stewardship, e.g. allowing us to send an email that says, “We see you planted a tree a month ago. Have you watered it?” along with specific resources. 
   
   Communicate
   With teachers: To fulfill TreeMapLA’s educational potential, TreePeople has created curriculum for teachers, and will provide professional development training to use it. We’d like to provide free field trips to teachers who get the most students involved with TreeMapLA.
   
   With the community: Through social media, additional videos, tree ID and mapping events, and engaging partners and their constituents, we will be communicating about TreeMapLA to many audiences throughout LA.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Los Angeles’ urban ecosystem is broken and our future is at risk. Angelenos
  are in need of a healthier and more climate-resilient city – one with
  sufficient tree canopy to protect our neighborhoods, and more locally-sourced
  water. We urgently need our urban environment to protect us from extreme heat
  waves, droughts and floods, and related health and economic problems happening
  now -- and forecast to intensify in our future.
   
   Trees capture, filter and store rainwater, save energy, significantly cool surrounding areas, and absorb carbon dioxide and airborne pollutants. Some areas of LA have canopy coverage at nearly 40%, while others are only in the single digits. This geographic disparity corresponds with socio-economic and chronic health issues, leaving many of our most vulnerable residents even more at risk in years to come.
   
   The City of LA currently imports nearly 90% of its water from remote and increasingly contested sources. Meanwhile, every time it rains an inch in the city, 3.8 billion gallons run into the ocean. The city “throws away” an estimated $400 million worth of rainwater every year. This pollutes our ocean, leading to beach closures, sickness, and costly fines, and damages marine life.
   
   TreeMapLA shows the community specific eco-benefits of each tree and watershed feature, and the urban watershed as a whole. Each benefit is directly, or indirectly, related to the health of our city:
   
   ● Energy conserved (reducing energy-related carbon and particulate pollution due to cooling temperatures)
   ● Stormwater filtered (adding to cleaner local water supply)
   ● Air quality improved (reducing respiratory disease)
   ● Carbon dioxide removed and stored-to-date (reducing climate change)
   ● Stormwater runoff reduced (reducing pollution and toxicity)
   ● Water conserved (increasing water supply).
   
   Too often, because the environmental issues facing people seem so overwhelming, they feel powerless and paralyzed, unable to believe they can make any meaningful change. Research and our own experience tell us that when people see the difference they make, they are motivated to do more. We know that once people begin to notice and learn about trees, they never see the city the same way again. Noticing and learning are the first steps towards valuing. Living in a way that values, promotes and protects nature even in the most urbanized areas of LA improves our health -- now and in the future.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  TreeMapLA is a shared resource for LA’s people and organizations to co-create,
  revitalize, and steward a healthy urban forest watershed. By bringing people
  together with a shared vision for growing a more sustainable LA -- and a way
  of measuring their actions -- this collaborative tool can help all residents
  improve their communities, their health, and their well-being.
   
   TreePeople is reaching out to specific audiences to take a leading role. These include:
   
   1. Teachers and students. Using our 4 decades of experience developing environmental education, TreePeople’s TreeMapLA curriculum teaches all 5 “STEAM” areas--Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics--as students analyze canopy coverage and water needs of their school, map existing trees, identify species, understand eco-benefits, and use alerts to identify trees needing care. Rainwater harvesting projects can be identified and implemented, later using water saved to care for the trees schools have planted. 
   
   2. Partner organizations and their audiences. TreePeople is actively seeking partners to use TreeMapLA to advance their own goals. We are developing a set of best practices, promotional and outreach materials, and tips and tools that other organizations can adopt and make their own. 
   
   3. Those who can restore a functioning ecosystem (all of us). With spiraling costs to fix our broken ecosystem, and diminishing financial resources to do so, government agencies alone cannot plant or care for all the trees needed to achieve an ample urban tree canopy, nor can they provide a sustainable local water supply through traditional methods. For LA to be healthy and viable in the future, all of us need to become active managers of the urban watershed and ecosystem, taking personal responsibility for the trees in our lives and our city, and the rainwater that falls on our properties.
   
   4. A movement of active tree stewards and rainwater harvesters. As TreeMapLA is further developed and collaborators join, it’s an ideal platform for building a movement -- where those who are taking action can learn from and help others, where agencies can track water, energy and pollution savings and provide incentives, where neighborhoods, schools and cities can define their portion of the urban watershed and set goals and programs to improve them.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Early conceptual and design partners include LA City Recreation & Parks, LA
  City Urban Forestry Division and City Plants (formerly Million Trees LA). All
  provided invaluable insight into the need for collaborators to 1) feel a sense
  of ownership, 2) use the map to help achieve their own strategic goals, and 3)
  find ways for TreeMapLA to fit into their current programs.
   
   Partners currently providing direction on community and user engagement include Industrial District Green, a Downtown LA group increasing the livability of Skid Row and the Arts District by planting trees, UC Riverside, and the Earthwatch Institute, which engages people worldwide in scientific research. 
   
   IDG has been instrumental in helping to beta test TreeMapLA. Since the map launched, IDG has been partnering to map all the trees and empty tree wells in their area to create a master tree plan to plant the empty wells, determine where new trees can be placed, and better provide maintenance. What’s exciting about this partnership is its replicability in creating neighborhood-level master tree plans and tackling low-canopy areas.
   
   Our newest partnership is with Earthwatch Institute, an international non-profit, UC Riverside researchers, and several local non-profits to use TreeMapLA for ground-truthing that compares actual tree data to visual data collected by NASA flights to determine water use and growth rates of different species in different locations within the LA area. The goal is to predict which trees might be more sustainable as the climate in Southern California grows hotter and drier. To participate in a Citizen Science project that could literally change the urban forestry landscape in Los Angeles is incredible, and TreePeople sees this as only the first of many such projects, partnering with local non-profits and universities to collect and share usable scientific data through TreeMapLA.
   
   In the next year we’ll form a TreeMapLA Advisory Committee, and have identified urban forestry and related organizations to invite. We hope to bring in diverse ideas and ownership to make this the most valuable tool possible for our entire region.
   
   Our most important and long-term partnership, however, is with the people of LA. Our 40 year history has been one of partnering with people from all walks of life to educate, empower and motivate them to heal our environment. TreeMapLA makes it easier for all of us to join together and share knowledge to make our city more sustainable.

  more_detail: "10 families at a time go through a comprehensive six month health program that approaches obesity from three angles:\r\n\r\n- Practical Skills -- Nutrition education, healthy cooking, label reading, shopping skills. \r\n- Emotional Health -- Group support in a safe, sacred space. \r\n- Habits -- An innovative incentive program designed to teach families healthy habits for a lifetime. \r\n\r\nWe surround our families with support--Vitamix blenders, free community yoga classes, walking clubs, healthy eating DVDs like Food Inc, Forks Over Knives, Hungry For Change. \r\n\r\nDuring the program, the families receive financial support based on an incentive system designed to instill lifelong habits. \r\n\r\n"
  implement: "We build relationships with established organizations in low-income communities, who connect us with a first class of 10 families. After six months working with us to improve their health, those 10 families recruit 10 more families, and serve as mentors. The cycle continues each season, as stakeholders spread practices of healthy living throughout their networks. So, over time, we organically grow a robust oasis of wellness in food deserts, empowering communities to nurture future generations’ bodies, minds and hearts.\r\n"
  impact_live: "A lot of wonderful projects are trying to change the food system from the top down. We are doing the opposite--from the bottom up, one family at a time. \r\n\r\nRight here in LA, we have kickstarted a growing movement teaching people how to take care of their bodies in the present food system. Groceryships is offering not a technical solution, but an adaptive one, helping people achieve vibrant health despite their current circumstances. We focus on the here and now, spreading a solution that equips people with the knowledge, tools, and support to make permanent lifestyle changes.  \r\n\r\nThe wealth gap creates the health gap. At Groceryships, we know every person's health is equally important, but the world seems to disagree. So we've structured our program and organization to help close both gaps. We focus on bringing all the resources available to higher income neighborhoods to lower income families. We fund this partially by donations, but also by bringing our innovative curriculum and program structure to corporations, through our for-profit Corporate Wellness program. \r\n\r\nIn 2050, Groceryships groups will have spread across Los Angeles. The tech companies in Silicon Beach will be getting healthy through our corporate wellness program, while at the same time financing groups in Compton and Inglewood. The finance companies in Pasadena and the South Bay will be getting healthy while financing Groceryships groups in Boyle Heights. \r\n\r\nBy 2050, the seeds we planted in 2014 will have taken root and changed the landscape from a desert to a rainforest, where generations of families have adopted healthy ways of eating, moving, and communicating. The Framingham study made clear the power of social networks. Changing a single families health can have profound influence not just on future generations of that family, but on everyone they come in contact with, and who those people come in contact with.  \r\nOver the long run, a change in one family can change a community, which can change a city. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
  who_benefit: >-
    Our first two groups are in South Los Angeles and Boyle Heights, where
    childhood obesity is 30% and the rate of overweight/obesity is above 70%. We
    will focus primarily on low-income families across Los Angeles who are
    struggling with food related health issues like obesity, diabetes, heart
    disease, malnourishment, etc. 
  partners_collaboration: "Homeboy Industries has mentored us from the early stages of our program, providing advice and support in developing our concept. In October, we are launching our first class together, connecting their twenty-six years of experience, highly motivated members, and proven success with our innovative strategy. This is a mutually beneficial partnership, allowing us to transform the relationship with food for Homeboy employees, explore a different facet of the wellness emphasized by Homeboy, and introduce our curriculum to a new neighborhood.\r\n\r\nVitamix has also worked with us throughout our pilot program. The blenders they donate make it easier for families to increase fruit and vegetable consumption, so much so that kids of our families are holding “smoothie parties.” \r\n"

  impact_metrics: "Groceryships increases access to healthy food by coaching families in navigating the food system. Over the course of six months of grocery stipends, people in under-resourced areas learn where and how to find and prepare nourishing meals despite external obstacles. In tandem with our comprehensive wellness classes, obesity rates decrease as lifestyle shifts take place. Groceryships’ unique holistic approach supports emotional well-being and mental health by strengthening interpersonal relationships and providing a safe space to de-stress and process trauma. The vital bonds developed in our rooms empower members of low-income communities to harness their collective strength in response to adverse events.\r\n"

  evaluate: "Our evaluation will focus on three areas:\r\n\r\nKnowledge (survey) -- things like what is a whole food, health benefits of fruits/vegetables, identifying hidden sugars, understanding what's really in restaurant food. \r\nEmotional Health (survey) -- stress reduction, support network increase, sense of personal value. \r\nHabits (survey) -- increased consumption of fruits and vegetables, increase percentage of grocery budget spent on whole foods. \r\n\r\nIn addition, we will measure health metrics through clinic partnerships, including BMI, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, A1c, etc. "
  two_lessons: "One night my wife and I watched A Place At The Table.  It’s about hunger in America, how in the richest country in the world, millions of children don’t know where their next meal is coming from. And the poor survive on the cheapest and least healthy food, so many families are both food insecure and obese.\r\n\r\nAfter the documentary ended something clicked in my mind. I realized that the majority of the documentaries we’d ever watched, were more or less about the same thing —  a hierarchical society that values some lives more than others. \r\n\r\nSo many documentaries are about people at the top saying (without actually saying it)... “my life matters more than yours.” Heads of oil companies saying, my profit is more valuable than you having clean water.  Food company executives saying, my wealth is more important than your health. Wall Street saying my money is more important than your home. Even private prison company executives, saying my profit is more important than your freedom. And the list goes on.\r\n\r\nAnd the consequences of all these decisions, they all land in the same place. On poor families, who have freeways built through their neighborhoods, waste dumped in their backyards, and whose children attend underfunded, sometimes decrepit, schools.\r\n\r\nEverywhere you turn, the deck is stacked against poor people. And especially so when it comes to health. They are disproportionately targeted by food company advertisements, they receive zero nutrition education, and often work 2-3 jobs just to make ends meet. Who has time to cook? And even if they wanted to there are often no fresh produce markets in their neighborhoods. Instead, fast food restaurants on nearly every corner peddle cheap, highly addictive processed foods with little nutritional value.\r\n\r\nIn a thousand different ways we’ve told the poor that they are not important. The people in these communities weren’t just obese and hungry because of the toxic food culture — they were also stressed out, beaten down, and depressed from growing up in a culture that had told them from birth that they are worthless, and then sold them cheap, addictive, unhealthy food to ameliorate their psychic pain. It was—and is—a vicious cycle. \r\n\r\nFrom Father Greg Boyle I learned that the power of Homeboy isn’t the thoroughness of their job training program, or the extensiveness of their job placement network. The power is in attitude — the heart — of the place, where everyone is is respected and valued. So too Groceryships"
  achievable_goal: "On August 13, 2014, the first Groceryships group will graduate in South Central Los Angeles. Two weeks later, on August 27th, the second class in the same location will begin. This South Central group is our flagship group, and will receive much of our focus. In October of this year, we will launch a new group at Homeboy Industries, our first satellite location. These groups -- South Central and Homeboy -- are our minimum number of groups for year 2. However, we expect that by the beginning of year 3, we will have at least 5 groups up and running.\r\n\r\nStrategically, our focus in year 2 will be on refining our program model and establishing a sustainable fundraising structure. \r\n\r\nTo refine our program, we will take the following steps:\r\n\r\n•\tProgram Binder--we will create a program binder that includes the curriculum, emotional topics, recipes, journal, and program outline. These will be handed to our next groups of families on the first day of class, and over time will iteratively develop into a stand-alone book that can be sold. \r\n\r\n•\tIncentive Structure--Rather than receiving $100 gift cards, the amount will fluctuate based on completion of certain tasks. There will be a $25 floor  based purely on attendance, and each participant will have the opportunity to earn more money by, for example, demonstrating via texted photos that they ate 5 vegetables/fruits per day ($5), prepared healthy family dinners ($5), lost weight ($2.50 per pound), reviewed weekly grocery store purchases with a nutritionist ($10), and completed a daily food journal ($5). This incentive model is inspired by Family Independence Initiative, who uses a similar model to empower families to emerge from poverty. \r\n\r\n•\tImprove Data Collection & Analysis: We will complete a logic model and specify the desired outcomes of our program. We will do a health screening of each member of participant families. Additionally, we will create before, during, and after surveys to test the knowledge intake and reported behavior changes. Lastly, we will analyze our applications to discern characteristics of our applicant pool.\r\n\r\n•\tTest Different Structures: Our model includes the following variables: education, cooking demonstrations, grocery store tour, financial incentives, 25-week term, 10 family group sizes, etc. We plan to test out different variations, customized to fit potential partners.\r\n\r\n•\tSouth LA Community Film Series: We are now in talks with filmmakers Laurie David and Lori SIlverbush ..."
  major_challenges: "Funding: we are a new organization. Strategy: crowdfunding, grant applications, Corporate Wellness.\r\n\r\nStaffing: Finding health coaches who both understand nutrition, and have the heart and emotional health to create a safe space without giving \"advice\" to families is one of our biggest challenges. "
  competition: "There are about a million places teaching nutrition education and healthy cooking classes. \r\n\r\nThere are none, to our knowledge, that focus primarily on the emotional and spiritual sides of health, and consciously help families create powerful support networks. "
  cost: "$250,000. \r\n\r\nWe are a young organization, but we are good at fundraising. In a year we raised over $100,000, and we have more on the way. Our founder, Sam Polk, is a sought after speaker, and generates honorariums to Groceryships. We also have developed facility in crowdfunding, and are launching a Corporate Wellness arm to generate profits. "

    answer: "10 families at a time go through a comprehensive six month health program that approaches obesity from three angles:\r\n\r\n- Practical Skills -- Nutrition education, healthy cooking, label reading, shopping skills. \r\n- Emotional Health -- Group support in a safe, sacred space. \r\n- Habits -- An innovative incentive program designed to teach families healthy habits for a lifetime. \r\n\r\nWe surround our families with support--Vitamix blenders, free community yoga classes, walking clubs, healthy eating DVDs like Food Inc, Forks Over Knives, Hungry For Change. \r\n\r\nDuring the program, the families receive financial support based on an incentive system designed to instill lifelong habits. \r\n\r\n"

    answer: "We build relationships with established organizations in low-income communities, who connect us with a first class of 10 families. After six months working with us to improve their health, those 10 families recruit 10 more families, and serve as mentors. The cycle continues each season, as stakeholders spread practices of healthy living throughout their networks. So, over time, we organically grow a robust oasis of wellness in food deserts, empowering communities to nurture future generations’ bodies, minds and hearts.\r\n"

    answer: "A lot of wonderful projects are trying to change the food system from the top down. We are doing the opposite--from the bottom up, one family at a time. \r\n\r\nRight here in LA, we have kickstarted a growing movement teaching people how to take care of their bodies in the present food system. Groceryships is offering not a technical solution, but an adaptive one, helping people achieve vibrant health despite their current circumstances. We focus on the here and now, spreading a solution that equips people with the knowledge, tools, and support to make permanent lifestyle changes.  \r\n\r\nThe wealth gap creates the health gap. At Groceryships, we know every person's health is equally important, but the world seems to disagree. So we've structured our program and organization to help close both gaps. We focus on bringing all the resources available to higher income neighborhoods to lower income families. We fund this partially by donations, but also by bringing our innovative curriculum and program structure to corporations, through our for-profit Corporate Wellness program. \r\n\r\nIn 2050, Groceryships groups will have spread across Los Angeles. The tech companies in Silicon Beach will be getting healthy through our corporate wellness program, while at the same time financing groups in Compton and Inglewood. The finance companies in Pasadena and the South Bay will be getting healthy while financing Groceryships groups in Boyle Heights. \r\n\r\nBy 2050, the seeds we planted in 2014 will have taken root and changed the landscape from a desert to a rainforest, where generations of families have adopted healthy ways of eating, moving, and communicating. The Framingham study made clear the power of social networks. Changing a single families health can have profound influence not just on future generations of that family, but on everyone they come in contact with, and who those people come in contact with.  \r\nOver the long run, a change in one family can change a community, which can change a city. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    answer: "Homeboy Industries has mentored us from the early stages of our program, providing advice and support in developing our concept. In October, we are launching our first class together, connecting their twenty-six years of experience, highly motivated members, and proven success with our innovative strategy. This is a mutually beneficial partnership, allowing us to transform the relationship with food for Homeboy employees, explore a different facet of the wellness emphasized by Homeboy, and introduce our curriculum to a new neighborhood.\r\n\r\nVitamix has also worked with us throughout our pilot program. The blenders they donate make it easier for families to increase fruit and vegetable consumption, so much so that kids of our families are holding “smoothie parties.” \r\n"

    answer: "Groceryships increases access to healthy food by coaching families in navigating the food system. Over the course of six months of grocery stipends, people in under-resourced areas learn where and how to find and prepare nourishing meals despite external obstacles. In tandem with our comprehensive wellness classes, obesity rates decrease as lifestyle shifts take place. Groceryships’ unique holistic approach supports emotional well-being and mental health by strengthening interpersonal relationships and providing a safe space to de-stress and process trauma. The vital bonds developed in our rooms empower members of low-income communities to harness their collective strength in response to adverse events.\r\n"

    answer: "One night my wife and I watched A Place At The Table.  It’s about hunger in America, how in the richest country in the world, millions of children don’t know where their next meal is coming from. And the poor survive on the cheapest and least healthy food, so many families are both food insecure and obese.\r\n\r\nAfter the documentary ended something clicked in my mind. I realized that the majority of the documentaries we’d ever watched, were more or less about the same thing —  a hierarchical society that values some lives more than others. \r\n\r\nSo many documentaries are about people at the top saying (without actually saying it)... “my life matters more than yours.” Heads of oil companies saying, my profit is more valuable than you having clean water.  Food company executives saying, my wealth is more important than your health. Wall Street saying my money is more important than your home. Even private prison company executives, saying my profit is more important than your freedom. And the list goes on.\r\n\r\nAnd the consequences of all these decisions, they all land in the same place. On poor families, who have freeways built through their neighborhoods, waste dumped in their backyards, and whose children attend underfunded, sometimes decrepit, schools.\r\n\r\nEverywhere you turn, the deck is stacked against poor people. And especially so when it comes to health. They are disproportionately targeted by food company advertisements, they receive zero nutrition education, and often work 2-3 jobs just to make ends meet. Who has time to cook? And even if they wanted to there are often no fresh produce markets in their neighborhoods. Instead, fast food restaurants on nearly every corner peddle cheap, highly addictive processed foods with little nutritional value.\r\n\r\nIn a thousand different ways we’ve told the poor that they are not important. The people in these communities weren’t just obese and hungry because of the toxic food culture — they were also stressed out, beaten down, and depressed from growing up in a culture that had told them from birth that they are worthless, and then sold them cheap, addictive, unhealthy food to ameliorate their psychic pain. It was—and is—a vicious cycle. \r\n\r\nFrom Father Greg Boyle I learned that the power of Homeboy isn’t the thoroughness of their job training program, or the extensiveness of their job placement network. The power is in attitude — the heart — of the place, where everyone is is respected and valued. So too Groceryships"

    answer: "On August 13, 2014, the first Groceryships group will graduate in South Central Los Angeles. Two weeks later, on August 27th, the second class in the same location will begin. This South Central group is our flagship group, and will receive much of our focus. In October of this year, we will launch a new group at Homeboy Industries, our first satellite location. These groups -- South Central and Homeboy -- are our minimum number of groups for year 2. However, we expect that by the beginning of year 3, we will have at least 5 groups up and running.\r\n\r\nStrategically, our focus in year 2 will be on refining our program model and establishing a sustainable fundraising structure. \r\n\r\nTo refine our program, we will take the following steps:\r\n\r\n•\tProgram Binder--we will create a program binder that includes the curriculum, emotional topics, recipes, journal, and program outline. These will be handed to our next groups of families on the first day of class, and over time will iteratively develop into a stand-alone book that can be sold. \r\n\r\n•\tIncentive Structure--Rather than receiving $100 gift cards, the amount will fluctuate based on completion of certain tasks. There will be a $25 floor  based purely on attendance, and each participant will have the opportunity to earn more money by, for example, demonstrating via texted photos that they ate 5 vegetables/fruits per day ($5), prepared healthy family dinners ($5), lost weight ($2.50 per pound), reviewed weekly grocery store purchases with a nutritionist ($10), and completed a daily food journal ($5). This incentive model is inspired by Family Independence Initiative, who uses a similar model to empower families to emerge from poverty. \r\n\r\n•\tImprove Data Collection & Analysis: We will complete a logic model and specify the desired outcomes of our program. We will do a health screening of each member of participant families. Additionally, we will create before, during, and after surveys to test the knowledge intake and reported behavior changes. Lastly, we will analyze our applications to discern characteristics of our applicant pool.\r\n\r\n•\tTest Different Structures: Our model includes the following variables: education, cooking demonstrations, grocery store tour, financial incentives, 25-week term, 10 family group sizes, etc. We plan to test out different variations, customized to fit potential partners.\r\n\r\n•\tSouth LA Community Film Series: We are now in talks with filmmakers Laurie David and Lori SIlverbush ..."
