  The Yacht Club wants to recruit, select and develop six league ambassadors to
  launch dodgeball leagues in under-resourced neighborhoods across LA. We will
  provide start-up funds and the development to ensure leagues are sustainable
  and are actualizing The Yacht Club vision.
   
   During Stage 1 of our project, ambassadors will conduct strategic community outreach and build social trust to understand the current needs of new neighborhoods. As they begin leagues in Stage 2, ambassadors will develop programs and events aligned to current neighborhood need. Ambassadors will invest players to volunteer and lead community development efforts. Our leagues will be known for using dodgeball as a means to connect and pursue the common good.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  We will hold a planning meeting in early October to outline the scope of work
  needed to roll out Stage 1 successfully. Later, in late November, a second
  planning meeting will be held to ensure we are ready to roll out Stage 2. Our
  project coordinator, board committee (formed to focus on LA2050 efforts from
  existing Yacht Club board members) and Yacht Club founders will participate in
  each planning meeting. Planning meetings will provide the project coordinator
  with input to build out stage-specific project plans. 
   
   The Stage 1 project plan will include targets and milestones to drive our a) recruitment campaign for league ambassadors, and b) the development of resources and support. In addition to participating in monthly oversight meetings with our board committee, our project coordinator will provide weekly status updates to The Yacht Club board chair. The Stage 2 project plan will include targets and milestones to support league ambassadors with their a) community outreach, b) recruitment of players and c) community development efforts.
   
   Monthly progress check-ins will be held between league ambassadors and the project coordinator. League ambassadors will report out on targets, milestones and identify support needed. The project coordinator will share best practices and help match resources to areas of need or support identified by the league ambassador.
   
   Monthly board committee check-ins will be held between the project coordinator and board committee. The project coordinator will report out on project targets, milestones and success measures. For example, at the end of each league during Stage 2, the project coordinator will compile data from player surveys to provide a general review of each league and league ambassador. The board committee will then support the project coordinator to identify ways to maintain and improve a healthy and successful project implementation.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The Yacht Club believes civic engagement-- feelings of responsibility toward
  the common good-- is inherent in all of us. We believe Angelenos will get more
  involved when they’re provided with opportunities that not only help solve
  community issues and improve the well-being of neighborhoods, but are also
  down-right fun.
   
   Everybody wants to belong, feel like part of a group, community, or team-- it’s an essential human need. We aim to get people hooked on The Yacht Club by increasing their social well-being and connectedness through dodgeball, weekly meetups and social gatherings. Once hooked, we provide the initial opportunities for our players to become active citizens and volunteer. Over time, our players become more invested in the neighborhoods where they play and want to do more good for them… it’s our flywheel toward common good. When our players actively participate and do good for Los Angeles, they feel more invested in Los Angeles. When our players feel more invested in Los Angeles, they want to work toward greater common good. Yes, we recognize dodgeball is fun, but we’re not just a team of players; we are an army of do-gooders. We want Los Angeles to be a better city for everyone and believe that dodgeball is a great entry point for good work in service of LA.
   
   League ambassadors will be charged with creating and managing dodgeball leagues that recruit players who want to have fun and actively do good. We aren’t interested in passive civic engagement-- players who simply donate money. Instead our league ambassadors will recruit and invest players to volunteer at Kids Dodgeball because they understand our kids need safe and fun activities in their neighborhood. League ambassadors will steer players toward opportunities of civic engagement like beach cleanups or encourage and support players to coordinate movies-at-the-park (with proceeds going to rec center programming).
   
   When the quality of life raises for our players, the quality of life raise for all Angelenos. By 2050, we want to see The Yacht Club running dodgeball leagues in rec centers across Los Angeles. In 2050, we continue to play in under-resourced neighborhoods, we have players on neighborhood councils and The Yacht Club is a consistent presence at civic events across Los Angeles.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Our project will benefit the communities we are working to support and all The
  Yacht Club do-gooders. Our approach to developing programming options for rec
  centers has always been to start with kids—Yacht Grub (kids cooking), Yacht
  Plot (community gardening), Yacht Pix (kids photography) and our flagship
  program, Yacht Crew (Kids Dodgeball), have been built to provide kids with
  fun, safe and creative experiences that go beyond what they might have access
  to at school. 
   
   What we’ve found over the years is that our players’ social well-being and desire to do good increases when we provide opportunities to volunteer and serve the community. When our players come out to our LA River Cleanup or volunteer at Kids Dodgeball they feel more invested in participating in other Yacht Club events and many eventually expand our civic engagement efforts. For example, when players in our Venice league decided to coordinate a beach cleanup, players from Glassell Park and North Hollywood joined the “player-based” community effort. The event was created and coordinated by players who were inspired to do more.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: |-
  Los Angeles Department of Recreation & Parks:
   Directors and staff at the rec centers where we play are vital partners in our project. Their commitment and understanding of the positive impact The Yacht Club can have are essential to our success. We will work to identify the specific needs of each park, design programs to match these needs, and gain community investment and feedback to ensure these programs become a sustainable and consistent part of regular programming. (ie. In Glassell Park this summer, when parents found out Kids Dodgeball was not part of Summer Night Lights programming, they petitioned to incorporate it and The Yacht Club pulled 20 committed volunteers to support 8 Friday nights of Kids Dodgeball.)
   
   Community-based organization and leaders:
   Our leadership team and league ambassadors will work to identify and build strategic relationships with community-based organizations and leaders in each new neighborhood we intend to serve. 
   
   Leadership consultants:
   Our leadership team has secured committed time from consultants to design of tools and development programming for our league ambassadors. We’ll also work with our current league ambassadors and our board to leverage established best practices.
   
   WeAreGiants:
   WeAreGiants. is a civic-minded marketing and design agency based in Downtown Los Angeles. WAG. has been engaged in many projects for the City of Los Angeles: Jose Huizar’s Bringing Back Broadway initiative, CicLAvia, and the redevelopment of Pershing Square. WAG. will provide design and marketing services (branding, logos, flyers, etc.) for the league expansions.
