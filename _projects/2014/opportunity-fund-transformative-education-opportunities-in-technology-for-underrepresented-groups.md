Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  The pilot Opportunity Fund program kicked off this June in New York, with 6
  fellows receiving scholarships. Over 300 online applications were received,
  and 3 more fellows were recently selected in NY.
    
   This November, General Assembly intends to expand into cities that have a high demand and need: LA and San Francisco.
    
   Working with our group of Benefactors, we are securing scholarships for underrepresented groups in each of these new markets and will begin marketing this opportunity in middle of August to have the first group of students in our November classes.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  There is an unemployment problem in LA County, which has surpassed the
  national average since 2008. There also exists a diversity problem inside of
  this statistic, with many minorities making up a disproportionate amount of
  the unemployed.
    
   Meanwhile, if we continue on our current course of state budget cuts, education, which received the lowest rating, will remain a significant impediment to human development in LA County. These two issues are highly related and are at the core of the Opportunity Fund's mission.
    
   General Assembly delivers best in-class education in technology, business and design - essential skills needed for the 21st century economy. Not only do we provide practical experienced based learning, we are creating a globally connected group of entrepreneurs and practitioners invested in each others success.
    
   The Opportunity Fund, through General Assembly's flagship Web Development Immersive (WDI) program, is aimed at getting minorities and underrepresented groups access to this network and opportunity so they too can participate in this future.
    
   WDI is a proven job creator:
    
   -Close to 100% of all job-seeking WDI students have received full-time employment within a few months of graduating
   -We have over 2,000 hiring partners - including Twitter, Facebook, Google
   -WDI has a paid Apprenticeship Program that supplements in-class learning with on-the job experiential training and mentorship
    
   We have already started to leave a footprint in LA county: opening a campus in Spring of 2003, with 95% of job-seeking WDI graduates finding employment.
    
   By 2020, there will be 1.4 million computer specialist job openings, but universities are predicted to produce only enough qualified graduates to fill about 30% of these positions.
    
   Furthermore, over 1/3 of hiring employers reported difficulty finding suitable candidates.
    
   The Opportunity Fund can Increase the talent pool of candidates in LA right now, and specifically reward underrepresented groups with a chance to participate in a more prosperous economic future. The existing partnerships in place with tech education Non Profits will ensure Opportunity Fund fellows give back what they have learnt to their respective communities. 
   
   This volunteer work Fellows give to youth after graduation will serve to inspire the next generation and create a strong collection of talent and entrepreneurial community that can shape LA in 2050 and well beyond.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: |-
  Here are a few statistics to demonstrate the problem:
    
   -Only 24% of computer science and math employees are women
   -Women account for just 6% of CEOs at the top 100 tech companies, and 22% of engineers overall
   -Only 1 out of 10 STEM professionals are minority women
   -African Americans make up less than 3% of all scientists and engineers, Hispanics 4% and all other groups 3%
    
   The reality however is that there is a shortage of employable talent at startups and technology companies: The current rate of unemployment for technology professionals is around 4% - half the jobless rate of the US.
    
   There is clearly a misalignment of opportunity and skill set. The Opportunity Fund will benefit underrepresented groups in technology and get them into the workforce.
    
   Specifically the Benefactors are currently working with have pledged to support Women, Veterans, Blacks and Hispanics. (We allow our Benefactors the ability to determine which group they wish to target and help.)

   The collaboration between our Benefactors and Non Profits with the Opportunity Fund is essential. As part of the Opportunity Fund experience, our fellows need to be aware of and identify with the Benefactors purpose of providing the scholarship.
    
   Additionally, it requires a commitment to volunteer 100+ hours with our Non Profit partners, to learn about their mission and document and share this experience with their community.
    
   General Assembly will document and share this journey amongst its global network of entrepreneurs, alumni and community, as well as with the Benefactors, ensuring the outcomes and experiences touch everyone.
