Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Deaf West Theatre will establish a 3-5 production per year subscription
  season. Productions will be developed and performed at this location and
  occasional other venues in L.A. County, perhaps include national tours and
  Broadway (case history - "Big River" Two Tony Award Nominations) - bringing
  more awareness to Deaf West and CSUN as co-presenters and to the LACA 2050
  Grant Program. 
   
   Deaf West Theatre will conduct four 13-week educational outreach programs at culturally underserved schools (K-12) in L.A. County where both deaf and hearing students and faculty will benefit. The participating classes will be brought to Deaf West Theatre's performance space to enjoy a sho , engage in Q&A with artists and crew and tour the facilities for further inspiration. 
   
   During the Summer, Deaf West Theatre will conduct a 4-week intensive Professional Training Program for deaf and hard of hearing artists, selected from both Los Angeles County and a nation-wide talent pool. The instructors and guest speakers will be established deaf and hearing entertainment industry professionals. 
   
   Interns from nearly every degree program at such an institute will be encouraged to join us (theater, film, tv, new technology, accounting, marketing, legal, etc.) Exposing our community to every aspect of show 'business' will better their chances of attaining gainful entertainment industry employment outside the limitations of non-profit theater. 
   Conversely, every hearing student or intern who interacts with us, will have their 'eyes, ears and hearts' opened to the notion that if they are in a position some day to consider a deaf candidate for job, they would need not hesitate to hire that person. 
   
   With the increasing popularity of sign language, DWT will offer free workshops in advance of our productions, to give students on campus and general audiences the fun of learning specific signs from each stage production, thereby making their visit to the theater, even more exciting as they proudly 'catch' the signs they recognize in dialogue and/or song. 
   
   A documentary behind-the-scenes web series for our youtube channel, depicting the journey of our productions and our residency will further enlighten and benefit all. 
   
   An annual "Signing in the Streets" event will continue the tradition started at Disneyland in March, 2012, where thousands joined from across the southland in celebration of Deaf culture.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Through Deaf West Theatre's continued and expanded… 1) multi-award winning
  dramas, comedies and musicals, presented in both sign language and voice 2)
  educational outreach programs that journey to schools K-12 and back to the
  CSUN campus and 3) professional deaf and hard of hearing artists training
  program in summer months… boundaries and stereotypes will be obliterated,
  communication between deaf and hearing people will be enhanced, employment
  opportunities increased, and both deaf and hearing entrepreneurs will be
  inspired to create new innovations to further level the playing field.
   
   New technology has made the auditory world visual across many platforms. A deaf director can wear glasses that scroll voice-to-text so they are privy to whatever audio is being heard over the hearing crew's headphones. Sony has made glasses that scroll captions for deaf audiences at certain cinemas. New technologies are being invented every day, and a Deaf West Theatre residency, putting sign language artistry together with the latest technologies being created by students, together, we may discover new innovations so that both deaf and hearing audiences can benefit from and share. 
   
   Educational outreach in theater arts can be critically important for deaf and hard of hearing children in schools (K-12), their language development (both sign language and English) can depend on it, as well as building a sense of cultural identity and the self esteem required to express themselves fully in any language. Deaf West Theater was founded via a 12-year old deaf child's dream a very long time ago, sitting alone and isolated in a theater with his hearing family watching a show he could barely grasp a word of. He envisioned a theater where deaf children could experience theater in their native visual sign language as well as spoken language, to be enjoyed with both deaf and hearing families and friends. A Deaf West Theatre residency amid institutional role models that are thriving examples of diversity, inclusion and equality, will be a microcosm of what we hope the future will be for our children.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  To be deaf or hard of hearing is to be one of 22.4 million Americans often
  denied - as individuals and as a community - the enrichment offered only by
  the arts. According to the California Department of Rehabilitation, the core
  community we serve has an unemployment rate of 45% and a mean income of
  $17,549. In LA schools, 90% of deaf students in mainstream programs are
  offered little or no contact with deaf peers. 60% of deaf seniors upon
  graduation remain largely illiterate with a grade 2.8 reading level.
   
   In recent years, social networking, texting, and cochlear implants are breakthroughs that have made communication easier for deaf people. Despite these advances, younger deaf people risk not having the opportunity to participate meaningfully in Deaf culture. Previously, when enrollment in deaf-only schools was more common, participation in deaf clubs and social organizations fostered a defined culture that emerged among peers and mentors. A DWT residency would be the best of both worlds and would allow Deaf West Theater to become a vibrant point of interest in Los Angeles County.
   
   The following figures are projected based conservatively on Deaf West Theatre's production and program history between 1990 to the present:
   
   1) Mainstage Productions
   
   Audience - average 4 six-week productions per year at conservative 75% theater capacity = 9000
   
   Performers, Crew, Staff - average 50 people x 4 productions = 200
   
   2) Children's Theatre Educational Outreach Workshops
   
   30 students (K-12) x 4 schools = 120 children
   
   5 performances at Deaf West Theatre = 5 shows x 99 seats = 495 children
   
   DWT instructors and interpreters = 16
   
   3) Professional Deaf and Hard of Hearing Artists Training Program
   
   Students (age 18+) = 150 
   Instructors and Guest Speakers = 15
   
   4) Documentary Filming / Video of DWT productions & Behind The Scenes- 
   
   Crews, interns, interpreters, volunteers = 100 
   
   5) Free Sign Lanaguage Theater Workshops for Audiences before each week of production
   
   Average 30 participants x 6 wks x 4 productions = 940 
   
   6) 'Signing In The Streets' at CSUN (conservative estimate) = 1000 
   
   Total projected number of deaf, hard of hearing and hearing children and adults (directly) benefiting from this project = 12,036
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: |-
  *Cal State Northridge (CSUN): 
   Status: Active dialogue in progress
   Benefit: CSUN has a terrific theater department and the most highly regarded Deaf Studies program in the country, supported by the National Center on Deafness on its campus. 
   
   National Center on Deafness (NCOD): 
   Status: Part of the CSUN / DWT dialogue
   Benefit: NCOD is on campus at CSUN and is a resource center for everything deaf and hard of hearing related. 
   
   Center Theatre Group: 
   Status: Likely production-specific partner. 
   Benefit: CTG has co-produced three sign language musical theater productions with DWT: "Big River" (2 Tony Award nominations and a special Tony for Artistic Excellence, a national tour and command performance for the Princess of Japan), "Sleeping Beauty Wakes" and "Pippin." We would be building on prior successes.
   
   LA COUNTY SCHOOLS 
   Status: The full scope of our previously successful children's educational outreach program would be reinstated. 
   Benefit: LAUSD and other LA County school districts will help us identify where deaf youth are most at risk and in need of inclusion in the arts.
   
   *NOTE - In the event that a DWT Residency at CSUN does not come to full fruition, the following schools known to have significant deaf / hard of hearing attendees and a popular sign language interpreter program on campus are: Pierce College, Santa Monica College, Pasadena City College, El Camino College and as their student population and sign language teachers are all in DWT's long-standing circle of friends, artists, audiences and some board members as well, we will likely find a residency at one of these L.A. County higher-education learning centers as an alternative. CSULA, UCLA, USC, and CalArts are other strong possibilities. There are also other non-profit theatres throughout the county that would benefit equally from a DWT residency under their auspices, sharing space and equipment (as DWT has with The Antaeus Company). 
   
   Until a residency agreement with any organization is finalized, our budget does not assume financial obligation (cash or in-kind) from any potential partner.
