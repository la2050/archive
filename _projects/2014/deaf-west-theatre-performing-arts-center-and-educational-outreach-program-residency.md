    Deaf West Theatre draws artists and audiences from around the world. We also
    work with numerous schools in the area including Marlton School for the
    Deaf.
  more_detail: "Deaf West Theatre (DWT) is in dialogue with a number of institutes of higher learning to establish a residency.   A residency would allow DWT to expand its programming and combine our resources to build our outreach exponentially. \r\n\r\nSuch a residency would open doors for meaningful ongoing collaborations with many university departments that will further obliterate stereotypes and obstacles for deaf and hearing people to work together to create, innovate, educate, communicate and ultimately improve the quality of life, as training and experience leads to gainful employment and entrepreneurship in the entertainment industry at large. "
  implement: "Deaf West Theatre will establish a 3-5 production per year subscription season.  Productions will be developed and performed at this location and occasional other venues in L.A. County, perhaps include national tours and Broadway (case history - \"Big River\" Two Tony Award Nominations) - bringing more awareness to Deaf West and CSUN as co-presenters and to the LACA 2050 Grant Program. \r\n\r\nDeaf West Theatre will conduct four 13-week educational outreach programs at culturally underserved schools (K-12) in L.A. County where both deaf and hearing students and faculty will benefit.   The participating classes will be brought to Deaf West Theatre's performance space to enjoy a sho , engage in Q&A with artists and crew and tour the facilities for further inspiration. \r\n\r\nDuring the Summer, Deaf West Theatre will conduct a 4-week intensive Professional Training Program for deaf and hard of hearing artists, selected from both Los Angeles County and a nation-wide talent pool.  The instructors and guest speakers will be established deaf and hearing entertainment industry professionals.  \r\n\r\nInterns from nearly every degree program at such an institute will be encouraged to join us (theater, film, tv, new technology, accounting, marketing, legal, etc.) Exposing our community to every aspect of show 'business' will better their chances of attaining gainful entertainment industry employment outside the limitations of non-profit theater. \r\nConversely, every hearing student or intern who interacts with us, will have their 'eyes, ears and hearts' opened to the notion that if they are in a position some day to consider a deaf candidate for job, they would need not hesitate to hire that person.  \r\n\r\nWith the increasing popularity of sign language, DWT will offer free workshops in advance of our productions, to give students on campus and general audiences the fun of learning specific signs from each stage production, thereby making their visit to the theater, even more exciting as they proudly 'catch' the signs they recognize in dialogue and/or song.   \r\n\r\nA documentary behind-the-scenes web series for our youtube channel, depicting the journey of our productions and our residency will further enlighten and benefit all. \r\n\r\nAn annual \"Signing in the Streets\" event will continue the tradition started at Disneyland in March, 2012, where thousands joined from across the southland in celebration of Deaf culture. \r\n"
  impact_create: "Through Deaf West Theatre's continued and expanded… 1) multi-award winning dramas, comedies and musicals, presented in both sign language and voice 2) educational outreach programs that journey to schools K-12 and back to the CSUN campus and 3) professional deaf and hard of hearing artists training program in summer months… boundaries and stereotypes will be obliterated, communication between deaf and hearing people will be enhanced, employment opportunities increased, and both deaf and hearing entrepreneurs will be inspired to create new innovations to further level the playing field.\r\n\r\nNew technology has made the auditory world visual across many platforms.  A deaf director can wear glasses that scroll voice-to-text so they are privy to whatever audio is being heard over the hearing crew's headphones. Sony has made glasses that scroll captions for deaf audiences at certain cinemas.  New technologies are being invented every day, and a Deaf West Theatre residency, putting sign language artistry together with the latest technologies being created by students, together, we may discover new innovations so that both deaf and hearing audiences can benefit from and share.   \r\n\r\nEducational outreach in theater arts can be critically important for deaf and hard of hearing children in schools (K-12), their language development (both sign language and English) can depend on it, as well as building a sense of cultural identity and the self esteem required to express themselves fully in any language.  Deaf West Theater was founded via a 12-year old deaf child's dream a very long time ago, sitting alone and isolated in a theater with his hearing family watching a show he could barely grasp a word of.  He envisioned a theater where deaf children could experience theater in their native visual sign language as well as spoken language, to be enjoyed with both deaf and hearing families and friends.  A Deaf West Theatre residency amid institutional role models that are thriving examples of diversity, inclusion and equality, will be a microcosm of what we hope the future will be for our children. "
  who_benefit: "To be deaf or hard of hearing is to be one of 22.4 million Americans often denied - as individuals and as a community - the enrichment offered only by the arts.  According to the California Department of Rehabilitation, the core community we serve has an unemployment rate of 45% and a mean income of $17,549.  In LA schools, 90% of deaf students in mainstream programs are offered little or no contact with deaf peers. 60% of deaf seniors upon graduation remain largely illiterate with a grade 2.8 reading level.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, social networking, texting, and cochlear implants are breakthroughs that have made communication easier for deaf people.  Despite these advances, younger deaf people risk not having the opportunity to participate meaningfully in Deaf culture.  Previously, when enrollment in deaf-only schools was more common, participation in deaf clubs and social organizations fostered a defined culture that emerged among peers and mentors.  A DWT residency would be the best of both worlds and would allow Deaf West Theater to become a vibrant point of interest in Los Angeles County.\r\n\r\nThe following figures are projected based conservatively on Deaf West Theatre's production and program history between 1990 to the present:\r\n\r\n1) Mainstage Productions\r\n\r\nAudience - average 4 six-week productions per year at conservative 75% theater capacity = 9000\r\n\r\nPerformers, Crew, Staff - average 50 people x 4 productions  = 200\r\n\r\n2) Children's Theatre Educational Outreach Workshops\r\n\r\n30 students (K-12) x 4 schools = 120 children\r\n\r\n5 performances at Deaf West Theatre = 5 shows x 99 seats = 495 children\r\n\r\nDWT instructors and interpreters = 16\r\n\r\n3) Professional Deaf and Hard of Hearing Artists Training Program\r\n\r\nStudents (age 18+) = 150 \r\nInstructors and Guest Speakers = 15\r\n\r\n4) Documentary Filming / Video of DWT productions & Behind The Scenes-  \r\n\r\nCrews, interns, interpreters, volunteers = 100 \r\n\r\n5) Free Sign Lanaguage Theater Workshops for Audiences before each week of production\r\n\r\nAverage 30 participants x 6 wks x 4 productions =  940 \r\n\r\n6) 'Signing In The Streets' at CSUN (conservative estimate) = 1000     \r\n\r\nTotal projected number of deaf, hard of hearing and hearing children and adults (directly) benefiting from this project = 12,036\r\n"
  partners_collaboration: "*Cal State Northridge (CSUN):  \r\nStatus:  Active dialogue in progress\r\nBenefit: CSUN has a terrific theater department and the most highly regarded Deaf Studies program in the country, supported by the National Center on Deafness on its campus.  \r\n\r\nNational Center on Deafness (NCOD):  \r\nStatus:  Part of the CSUN / DWT dialogue\r\nBenefit:  NCOD is on campus at CSUN and is a resource center for everything deaf and hard of hearing related. \r\n\r\nCenter Theatre Group:  \r\nStatus:  Likely production-specific partner.  \r\nBenefit: CTG has co-produced three sign language musical theater productions with DWT: \"Big River\" (2 Tony Award nominations and a special Tony for Artistic Excellence, a national tour and command performance for the Princess of Japan), \"Sleeping Beauty Wakes\" and \"Pippin.\"   We would be building on prior successes.\r\n\r\nLA COUNTY SCHOOLS   \r\nStatus:  The full scope of our previously successful children's educational outreach program would be reinstated. \r\nBenefit:  LAUSD and other LA County school districts will help us identify where deaf youth are most at risk and in need of inclusion in the arts.\r\n\r\n*NOTE - In the event that a DWT Residency at CSUN does not come to full fruition, the following schools known to have significant deaf / hard of hearing attendees and a popular sign language interpreter program on campus are:  Pierce College, Santa Monica College, Pasadena City College, El Camino College and as their student population and sign language teachers are all in DWT's long-standing circle of friends, artists, audiences and some board members as well, we will likely find a residency at one of these L.A. County higher-education learning centers as an alternative. CSULA, UCLA, USC, and CalArts are other strong possibilities.   There are also other non-profit theatres throughout the county that would benefit equally from a DWT residency under their auspices, sharing space and equipment (as DWT has with The Antaeus Company). \r\n\r\nUntil a residency agreement with any organization is finalized, our budget does not assume financial obligation (cash or in-kind) from any potential partner.

  evaluate: "SURVEYS:\r\nAudience, artist, staff, board, student, teacher, volunteer and community surveys will provide subjective participant experiences. \r\n\r\nREVIEWS \r\nTheatre reviews will provide an objective evaluation of our work from a mainstream industry point of view. \r\n\r\nAWARDS \r\nArtistic Awards from theater organizations and publications will measure our competitive standing.  \r\n\r\nMONTHLY FINANCIAL REPORTS MONITOR:\r\nEarned Income -  Ticket sales, program book ad sales, concessions. \r\nContributed Income - Government, Foundation, Corporate, Individual Donors\r\n\r\nSOCIAL MEDIA:  \r\n\r\nFacebook is our primary platform for interacting with a world-wide deaf and hearing fan base. We have over 10,000 Likes.  \r\n\r\nWe will continue to expand our social media base on all platforms, using applications that help build targeted meaningful engagement. "
  two_lessons: "Funding for the arts and funding for disabilities and the arts, have diminished greatly over the past years and while we've been able to continue limited activities with less, we've had to reinvent ourselves and be embracing of the notion of being under the umbrella of a large institution with like-minded interests and philosophies is better than trying to maintain complete autonomy in a challenging economy.   \r\n\r\nPrevious collaborations have taught us that it is possible to \"serve two masters\" - in this case, both deaf and hearing audiences, equally.   In being part of a mainstream university community, we will have to look no further than our own campus to engage in prolific deaf and hearing collaborations.  \r\n"
  achievable_goal: >-
    We have begun preliminary talks with the Theater Department at CSUN and with
    other institutions of higher learning. Based on these conversations, we can
    gauge significant interest. This grant would kickstart the process, and we
    would be able to begin our activities almost immediately.
  major_challenges: "CHALLENGE: Our donors and funders may get the impression that their contributions are no longer necessary if we have residency at CSUN.   \r\n\r\nSOLUTION: To counter that, our own appeals will emphasize how important it is that Deaf West Theatre bring its own funding in order to be an equal and valuable partner / tenant.  \r\n\r\nCHALLENGE: In 1990, Deaf West Theatre was born under the umbrella of The Fountain Theatre in Los Angeles where it remained until 1993 when funding allowed Deaf West Theatre to rent its own facility.  At that juncture, our constituents celebrated the notion of a deaf-run organization standing on its own with complete autonomy.   \r\n\r\nSOLUTION: While this might not be entirely the case as a resident company, we are in the best position to understand the process of collaboration and problem solving as issues arise.  We are poised to meet all challenges and to contribute meaningfully to the community.  DWT will continue in-depth dialogues and enter into formal agreements supported by the leadership of any organizations or institutions."
  competition: "To the best of our knowledge, there are no other sign language theater companies in Los Angeles County that are seeking a residency at any university,  or similar companies whose history and scope of programming compete with ours.        \r\n\r\nCenter Theatre Group's 'Project D.A.T.E.' (Deaf Audience Theatre Experience) may be considered a complement to our programming. Project  D.A.T.E. provides interpreted performances as a matter of accessibility, rather than an art form.  \r\n\r\nAnother compliment to Deaf West Theatre would be Comedian Kathy Buckley's company, No Limits Theatre, which accommodates the needs of deaf and hard of hearing people who were raised orally, that is, who do not use sign language as their primary mode of communication.  \r\n"

  impact_metrics: "Employment in creative industries - Training and employment during DWT's residency at CSUN will lead to gainful employment of deaf individuals in the entertainment industry.\r\n\r\nArts establishments per capita - CSUN's new Performing Art Center fills a void for hearing audiences that previously existed in the area.  DWT's residency will likewise fill the void for deaf and hard of hearing artists and audiences.   \r\n\r\nFederal Research Grant Funding  - DWT's residency at CSUN itself could be a worthy federally funded research project, delving into specific areas of national and global interest such as the process of translating written text and music into sign language equivalent and making theater accessible and equal for all.  \r\n\r\nJobs Per Capita -- Toward the goal of accessibility,  DWT and CSUN may invent new technology for artists and audiences, thereby creating more patents, more entrepreneurs, more jobs. \r\n\r\nMinority- and women-owned firms - DWT has always been deaf-run, employing equal numbers of men and women, deaf and hearing.   Our productions are most often a rainbow of color and mixture of deaf, and hearing men and women.  \r\n\r\nGini Coefficient - The work opportunities for deaf and hard of hearing individuals will improve via this residency; training, employment and being part of a larger world-community.  \r\n\r\nMeasures of cultural and global economic influence (“soft power”) (Dream Metric)  - As combined PR efforts spread the news, momentum can reach critical mass of awareness world-wide via the internet. A DWT residency at CSUN would increase all sources of contributed funding and earned revenue streams and maximize community involvement.  If our model proves successful, non-profit arts organizations with residencies at universities could become commonplace.\r\n\r\nUnemployment rates (and opportunities) for the formerly incarcerated (Dream Metric) - Sadly, there are deaf individuals who grow up with minimal language which puts them on an unwitting path to wrong-doing or simple misunderstanding, resulting in incarceration.  On a case by case basis, there may be an opportunity at DWT at CSUN to create employment for formerly incarcerated deaf individuals."
Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Deaf West Theatre will establish a 3-5 production per year subscription
  season. Productions will be developed and performed at this location and
  occasional other venues in L.A. County, perhaps include national tours and
  Broadway (case history - "Big River" Two Tony Award Nominations) - bringing
  more awareness to Deaf West and CSUN as co-presenters and to the LACA 2050
  Grant Program. 
   
   Deaf West Theatre will conduct four 13-week educational outreach programs at culturally underserved schools (K-12) in L.A. County where both deaf and hearing students and faculty will benefit. The participating classes will be brought to Deaf West Theatre's performance space to enjoy a sho , engage in Q&A with artists and crew and tour the facilities for further inspiration. 
   
   During the Summer, Deaf West Theatre will conduct a 4-week intensive Professional Training Program for deaf and hard of hearing artists, selected from both Los Angeles County and a nation-wide talent pool. The instructors and guest speakers will be established deaf and hearing entertainment industry professionals. 
   
   Interns from nearly every degree program at such an institute will be encouraged to join us (theater, film, tv, new technology, accounting, marketing, legal, etc.) Exposing our community to every aspect of show 'business' will better their chances of attaining gainful entertainment industry employment outside the limitations of non-profit theater. 
   Conversely, every hearing student or intern who interacts with us, will have their 'eyes, ears and hearts' opened to the notion that if they are in a position some day to consider a deaf candidate for job, they would need not hesitate to hire that person. 
   
   With the increasing popularity of sign language, DWT will offer free workshops in advance of our productions, to give students on campus and general audiences the fun of learning specific signs from each stage production, thereby making their visit to the theater, even more exciting as they proudly 'catch' the signs they recognize in dialogue and/or song. 
   
   A documentary behind-the-scenes web series for our youtube channel, depicting the journey of our productions and our residency will further enlighten and benefit all. 
   
   An annual "Signing in the Streets" event will continue the tradition started at Disneyland in March, 2012, where thousands joined from across the southland in celebration of Deaf culture.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Through Deaf West Theatre's continued and expanded… 1) multi-award winning
  dramas, comedies and musicals, presented in both sign language and voice 2)
  educational outreach programs that journey to schools K-12 and back to the
  CSUN campus and 3) professional deaf and hard of hearing artists training
  program in summer months… boundaries and stereotypes will be obliterated,
  communication between deaf and hearing people will be enhanced, employment
  opportunities increased, and both deaf and hearing entrepreneurs will be
  inspired to create new innovations to further level the playing field.
   
   New technology has made the auditory world visual across many platforms. A deaf director can wear glasses that scroll voice-to-text so they are privy to whatever audio is being heard over the hearing crew's headphones. Sony has made glasses that scroll captions for deaf audiences at certain cinemas. New technologies are being invented every day, and a Deaf West Theatre residency, putting sign language artistry together with the latest technologies being created by students, together, we may discover new innovations so that both deaf and hearing audiences can benefit from and share. 
   
   Educational outreach in theater arts can be critically important for deaf and hard of hearing children in schools (K-12), their language development (both sign language and English) can depend on it, as well as building a sense of cultural identity and the self esteem required to express themselves fully in any language. Deaf West Theater was founded via a 12-year old deaf child's dream a very long time ago, sitting alone and isolated in a theater with his hearing family watching a show he could barely grasp a word of. He envisioned a theater where deaf children could experience theater in their native visual sign language as well as spoken language, to be enjoyed with both deaf and hearing families and friends. A Deaf West Theatre residency amid institutional role models that are thriving examples of diversity, inclusion and equality, will be a microcosm of what we hope the future will be for our children.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  To be deaf or hard of hearing is to be one of 22.4 million Americans often
  denied - as individuals and as a community - the enrichment offered only by
  the arts. According to the California Department of Rehabilitation, the core
  community we serve has an unemployment rate of 45% and a mean income of
  $17,549. In LA schools, 90% of deaf students in mainstream programs are
  offered little or no contact with deaf peers. 60% of deaf seniors upon
  graduation remain largely illiterate with a grade 2.8 reading level.
   
   In recent years, social networking, texting, and cochlear implants are breakthroughs that have made communication easier for deaf people. Despite these advances, younger deaf people risk not having the opportunity to participate meaningfully in Deaf culture. Previously, when enrollment in deaf-only schools was more common, participation in deaf clubs and social organizations fostered a defined culture that emerged among peers and mentors. A DWT residency would be the best of both worlds and would allow Deaf West Theater to become a vibrant point of interest in Los Angeles County.
   
   The following figures are projected based conservatively on Deaf West Theatre's production and program history between 1990 to the present:
   
   1) Mainstage Productions
   
   Audience - average 4 six-week productions per year at conservative 75% theater capacity = 9000
   
   Performers, Crew, Staff - average 50 people x 4 productions = 200
   
   2) Children's Theatre Educational Outreach Workshops
   
   30 students (K-12) x 4 schools = 120 children
   
   5 performances at Deaf West Theatre = 5 shows x 99 seats = 495 children
   
   DWT instructors and interpreters = 16
   
   3) Professional Deaf and Hard of Hearing Artists Training Program
   
   Students (age 18+) = 150 
   Instructors and Guest Speakers = 15
   
   4) Documentary Filming / Video of DWT productions & Behind The Scenes- 
   
   Crews, interns, interpreters, volunteers = 100 
   
   5) Free Sign Lanaguage Theater Workshops for Audiences before each week of production
   
   Average 30 participants x 6 wks x 4 productions = 940 
   
   6) 'Signing In The Streets' at CSUN (conservative estimate) = 1000 
   
   Total projected number of deaf, hard of hearing and hearing children and adults (directly) benefiting from this project = 12,036
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: |-
  *Cal State Northridge (CSUN): 
   Status: Active dialogue in progress
   Benefit: CSUN has a terrific theater department and the most highly regarded Deaf Studies program in the country, supported by the National Center on Deafness on its campus. 
   
   National Center on Deafness (NCOD): 
   Status: Part of the CSUN / DWT dialogue
   Benefit: NCOD is on campus at CSUN and is a resource center for everything deaf and hard of hearing related. 
   
   Center Theatre Group: 
   Status: Likely production-specific partner. 
   Benefit: CTG has co-produced three sign language musical theater productions with DWT: "Big River" (2 Tony Award nominations and a special Tony for Artistic Excellence, a national tour and command performance for the Princess of Japan), "Sleeping Beauty Wakes" and "Pippin." We would be building on prior successes.
   
   LA COUNTY SCHOOLS 
   Status: The full scope of our previously successful children's educational outreach program would be reinstated. 
   Benefit: LAUSD and other LA County school districts will help us identify where deaf youth are most at risk and in need of inclusion in the arts.
   
   *NOTE - In the event that a DWT Residency at CSUN does not come to full fruition, the following schools known to have significant deaf / hard of hearing attendees and a popular sign language interpreter program on campus are: Pierce College, Santa Monica College, Pasadena City College, El Camino College and as their student population and sign language teachers are all in DWT's long-standing circle of friends, artists, audiences and some board members as well, we will likely find a residency at one of these L.A. County higher-education learning centers as an alternative. CSULA, UCLA, USC, and CalArts are other strong possibilities. There are also other non-profit theatres throughout the county that would benefit equally from a DWT residency under their auspices, sharing space and equipment (as DWT has with The Antaeus Company). 
   
   Until a residency agreement with any organization is finalized, our budget does not assume financial obligation (cash or in-kind) from any potential partner.

    answer: "Deaf West Theatre (DWT) is in dialogue with a number of institutes of higher learning to establish a residency.   A residency would allow DWT to expand its programming and combine our resources to build our outreach exponentially. \r\n\r\nSuch a residency would open doors for meaningful ongoing collaborations with many university departments that will further obliterate stereotypes and obstacles for deaf and hearing people to work together to create, innovate, educate, communicate and ultimately improve the quality of life, as training and experience leads to gainful employment and entrepreneurship in the entertainment industry at large. "

    explanation: ''
    answer: "Deaf West Theatre will establish a 3-5 production per year subscription season.  Productions will be developed and performed at this location and occasional other venues in L.A. County, perhaps include national tours and Broadway (case history - \"Big River\" Two Tony Award Nominations) - bringing more awareness to Deaf West and CSUN as co-presenters and to the LACA 2050 Grant Program. \r\n\r\nDeaf West Theatre will conduct four 13-week educational outreach programs at culturally underserved schools (K-12) in L.A. County where both deaf and hearing students and faculty will benefit.   The participating classes will be brought to Deaf West Theatre's performance space to enjoy a sho , engage in Q&A with artists and crew and tour the facilities for further inspiration. \r\n\r\nDuring the Summer, Deaf West Theatre will conduct a 4-week intensive Professional Training Program for deaf and hard of hearing artists, selected from both Los Angeles County and a nation-wide talent pool.  The instructors and guest speakers will be established deaf and hearing entertainment industry professionals.  \r\n\r\nInterns from nearly every degree program at such an institute will be encouraged to join us (theater, film, tv, new technology, accounting, marketing, legal, etc.) Exposing our community to every aspect of show 'business' will better their chances of attaining gainful entertainment industry employment outside the limitations of non-profit theater. \r\nConversely, every hearing student or intern who interacts with us, will have their 'eyes, ears and hearts' opened to the notion that if they are in a position some day to consider a deaf candidate for job, they would need not hesitate to hire that person.  \r\n\r\nWith the increasing popularity of sign language, DWT will offer free workshops in advance of our productions, to give students on campus and general audiences the fun of learning specific signs from each stage production, thereby making their visit to the theater, even more exciting as they proudly 'catch' the signs they recognize in dialogue and/or song.   \r\n\r\nA documentary behind-the-scenes web series for our youtube channel, depicting the journey of our productions and our residency will further enlighten and benefit all. \r\n\r\nAn annual \"Signing in the Streets\" event will continue the tradition started at Disneyland in March, 2012, where thousands joined from across the southland in celebration of Deaf culture. \r\n"

    answer: "Through Deaf West Theatre's continued and expanded… 1) multi-award winning dramas, comedies and musicals, presented in both sign language and voice 2) educational outreach programs that journey to schools K-12 and back to the CSUN campus and 3) professional deaf and hard of hearing artists training program in summer months… boundaries and stereotypes will be obliterated, communication between deaf and hearing people will be enhanced, employment opportunities increased, and both deaf and hearing entrepreneurs will be inspired to create new innovations to further level the playing field.\r\n\r\nNew technology has made the auditory world visual across many platforms.  A deaf director can wear glasses that scroll voice-to-text so they are privy to whatever audio is being heard over the hearing crew's headphones. Sony has made glasses that scroll captions for deaf audiences at certain cinemas.  New technologies are being invented every day, and a Deaf West Theatre residency, putting sign language artistry together with the latest technologies being created by students, together, we may discover new innovations so that both deaf and hearing audiences can benefit from and share.   \r\n\r\nEducational outreach in theater arts can be critically important for deaf and hard of hearing children in schools (K-12), their language development (both sign language and English) can depend on it, as well as building a sense of cultural identity and the self esteem required to express themselves fully in any language.  Deaf West Theater was founded via a 12-year old deaf child's dream a very long time ago, sitting alone and isolated in a theater with his hearing family watching a show he could barely grasp a word of.  He envisioned a theater where deaf children could experience theater in their native visual sign language as well as spoken language, to be enjoyed with both deaf and hearing families and friends.  A Deaf West Theatre residency amid institutional role models that are thriving examples of diversity, inclusion and equality, will be a microcosm of what we hope the future will be for our children.

  - name: who_benefit
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "To be deaf or hard of hearing is to be one of 22.4 million Americans often denied - as individuals and as a community - the enrichment offered only by the arts.  According to the California Department of Rehabilitation, the core community we serve has an unemployment rate of 45% and a mean income of $17,549.  In LA schools, 90% of deaf students in mainstream programs are offered little or no contact with deaf peers. 60% of deaf seniors upon graduation remain largely illiterate with a grade 2.8 reading level.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, social networking, texting, and cochlear implants are breakthroughs that have made communication easier for deaf people.  Despite these advances, younger deaf people risk not having the opportunity to participate meaningfully in Deaf culture.  Previously, when enrollment in deaf-only schools was more common, participation in deaf clubs and social organizations fostered a defined culture that emerged among peers and mentors.  A DWT residency would be the best of both worlds and would allow Deaf West Theater to become a vibrant point of interest in Los Angeles County.\r\n\r\nThe following figures are projected based conservatively on Deaf West Theatre's production and program history between 1990 to the present:\r\n\r\n1) Mainstage Productions\r\n\r\nAudience - average 4 six-week productions per year at conservative 75% theater capacity = 9000\r\n\r\nPerformers, Crew, Staff - average 50 people x 4 productions  = 200\r\n\r\n2) Children's Theatre Educational Outreach Workshops\r\n\r\n30 students (K-12) x 4 schools = 120 children\r\n\r\n5 performances at Deaf West Theatre = 5 shows x 99 seats = 495 children\r\n\r\nDWT instructors and interpreters = 16\r\n\r\n3) Professional Deaf and Hard of Hearing Artists Training Program\r\n\r\nStudents (age 18+) = 150 \r\nInstructors and Guest Speakers = 15\r\n\r\n4) Documentary Filming / Video of DWT productions & Behind The Scenes-  \r\n\r\nCrews, interns, interpreters, volunteers = 100 \r\n\r\n5) Free Sign Lanaguage Theater Workshops for Audiences before each week of production\r\n\r\nAverage 30 participants x 6 wks x 4 productions =  940 \r\n\r\n6) 'Signing In The Streets' at CSUN (conservative estimate) = 1000     \r\n\r\nTotal projected number of deaf, hard of hearing and hearing children and adults (directly) benefiting from this project = 12,036\r\n"

    answer: "*Cal State Northridge (CSUN):  \r\nStatus:  Active dialogue in progress\r\nBenefit: CSUN has a terrific theater department and the most highly regarded Deaf Studies program in the country, supported by the National Center on Deafness on its campus.  \r\n\r\nNational Center on Deafness (NCOD):  \r\nStatus:  Part of the CSUN / DWT dialogue\r\nBenefit:  NCOD is on campus at CSUN and is a resource center for everything deaf and hard of hearing related. \r\n\r\nCenter Theatre Group:  \r\nStatus:  Likely production-specific partner.  \r\nBenefit: CTG has co-produced three sign language musical theater productions with DWT: \"Big River\" (2 Tony Award nominations and a special Tony for Artistic Excellence, a national tour and command performance for the Princess of Japan), \"Sleeping Beauty Wakes\" and \"Pippin.\"   We would be building on prior successes.\r\n\r\nLA COUNTY SCHOOLS   \r\nStatus:  The full scope of our previously successful children's educational outreach program would be reinstated. \r\nBenefit:  LAUSD and other LA County school districts will help us identify where deaf youth are most at risk and in need of inclusion in the arts.\r\n\r\n*NOTE - In the event that a DWT Residency at CSUN does not come to full fruition, the following schools known to have significant deaf / hard of hearing attendees and a popular sign language interpreter program on campus are:  Pierce College, Santa Monica College, Pasadena City College, El Camino College and as their student population and sign language teachers are all in DWT's long-standing circle of friends, artists, audiences and some board members as well, we will likely find a residency at one of these L.A. County higher-education learning centers as an alternative. CSULA, UCLA, USC, and CalArts are other strong possibilities.   There are also other non-profit theatres throughout the county that would benefit equally from a DWT residency under their auspices, sharing space and equipment (as DWT has with The Antaeus Company). \r\n\r\nUntil a residency agreement with any organization is finalized, our budget does not assume financial obligation (cash or in-kind) from any potential partner.

    explanation: Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.
    answer: "Employment in creative industries - Training and employment during DWT's residency at CSUN will lead to gainful employment of deaf individuals in the entertainment industry.\r\n\r\nArts establishments per capita - CSUN's new Performing Art Center fills a void for hearing audiences that previously existed in the area.  DWT's residency will likewise fill the void for deaf and hard of hearing artists and audiences.   \r\n\r\nFederal Research Grant Funding  - DWT's residency at CSUN itself could be a worthy federally funded research project, delving into specific areas of national and global interest such as the process of translating written text and music into sign language equivalent and making theater accessible and equal for all.  \r\n\r\nJobs Per Capita -- Toward the goal of accessibility,  DWT and CSUN may invent new technology for artists and audiences, thereby creating more patents, more entrepreneurs, more jobs. \r\n\r\nMinority- and women-owned firms - DWT has always been deaf-run, employing equal numbers of men and women, deaf and hearing.   Our productions are most often a rainbow of color and mixture of deaf, and hearing men and women.  \r\n\r\nGini Coefficient - The work opportunities for deaf and hard of hearing individuals will improve via this residency; training, employment and being part of a larger world-community.  \r\n\r\nMeasures of cultural and global economic influence (“soft power”) (Dream Metric)  - As combined PR efforts spread the news, momentum can reach critical mass of awareness world-wide via the internet. A DWT residency at CSUN would increase all sources of contributed funding and earned revenue streams and maximize community involvement.  If our model proves successful, non-profit arts organizations with residencies at universities could become commonplace.\r\n\r\nUnemployment rates (and opportunities) for the formerly incarcerated (Dream Metric) - Sadly, there are deaf individuals who grow up with minimal language which puts them on an unwitting path to wrong-doing or simple misunderstanding, resulting in incarceration.  On a case by case basis, there may be an opportunity at DWT at CSUN to create employment for formerly incarcerated deaf individuals."

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "CHALLENGE: Our donors and funders may get the impression that their contributions are no longer necessary if we have residency at CSUN.   \r\n\r\nSOLUTION: To counter that, our own appeals will emphasize how important it is that Deaf West Theatre bring its own funding in order to be an equal and valuable partner / tenant.  \r\n\r\nCHALLENGE: In 1990, Deaf West Theatre was born under the umbrella of The Fountain Theatre in Los Angeles where it remained until 1993 when funding allowed Deaf West Theatre to rent its own facility.  At that juncture, our constituents celebrated the notion of a deaf-run organization standing on its own with complete autonomy.   \r\n\r\nSOLUTION: While this might not be entirely the case as a resident company, we are in the best position to understand the process of collaboration and problem solving as issues arise.  We are poised to meet all challenges and to contribute meaningfully to the community.  DWT will continue in-depth dialogues and enter into formal agreements supported by the leadership of any organizations or institutions."

(Deaf Audience Theatre Experience) may be considered a complement to our programming. Project  D.A.T.E. provides interpreted performances as a matter of accessibility, rather than an art form.  \r\n\r\nAnother compliment to Deaf West Theatre would be Comedian Kathy Buckley's company, No Limits Theatre, which accommodates the needs of deaf and hard of hearing people who were raised orally, that is, who do not use sign language as their primary mode of communication.  \r\n"
