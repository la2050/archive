Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  We’re Promesa Boyle Heights, a passionate collaborative of over 60 residents,
  12 organizations, 2 schools, and dozens of businesses, non-profits, and
  institutional partners working together to strengthen educational and wellness
  opportunities- starting with our corner of Los Angeles. 
   We believe that residents- those most impacted by community conditions- must be at the forefront of shaping LA’s future. 
   Promesa launched in 2010, with a federal Promise Neighborhood planning grant. We are committed to BREAKING DOWN SILOS to create lasting change. The roadmap for our work is the Promesa BH implementation plan, which we developed after surveying 4,000+ residents and convening diverse stakeholders to develop a shared vision and the plan.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Boyle Heights residents sit on Promesa’s General Assembly, Steering
  Committees, and Solution Teams, CONNECTING with others in the collaborative to
  create a model inner-city community where pre-k education, K-college academic
  success, healthy environments, stable housing, safe public spaces, and
  economic development flourish. 
   Our first success was the community-school model at Mendez High School. By 1) creating formal partnerships between school staff, families and partner organizations; 2) launching targeted interventions for the most at-risk students, and 3) hiring an Achievement Counselor to coordinate college readiness supports, we raised the graduation rate by nearly 20% from 2010 and 2013. Last year, Mendez became the most improved traditional high school in California with a 76-point API gain and the highest cohort of students accepted to college since the school opened. Next, we will build momentum through:
   1. Development of Existing Resident Leaders. We will sustain resident leadership participation in Promesa, and also build a shared understanding of issues identified in Promesa’s implementation plan through 2-day “Leadership Academy” retreats that give the history and political context of public education, as well skills trainings in collaborative leadership, policy & legislative process, public speaking & personal storytelling for outreach & media. The goal? Equipping leaders to optimally spearhead Promesa’s work, including the wellness center campaign now underway. Building a Wellness Center at Mendez that provides students with physical & mental health services, connects them to resources, and also serves as a hub for community action is a key Promesa goal. In phase 1, resident leaders visited four existing school-based wellness centers, surveyed nearly 1,000 residents, and successfully pushed LAUSD to earmark $50 million for school wellness centers throughout the district. 
   2. Education and Engagement of 300+ New Residents. We will support existing resident leaders in disseminating academic and wellness information, linking families to Promesa health & wellness workshops and resources, and galvanizing community participation in phase 2 of the wellness center campaign, which will include coordination of education events at Hollenbeck Middle School and Mendez High School, more wellness center site visits, and meeting with district leaders and government officials to press for a Mendez Wellness Center by the 2015-2016 school year.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  We believe that the challenges facing Los Angeles are big, complex and
  dynamic. As a result, communities across the city require a wide-range of
  coordinated strategies and approaches. The Promesa Boyle Heights collective
  impact model challenges all Angelenos to build on the strengths of individuals
  and organizations and to work together to more effectively impact youth,
  families, and community change. 
   
   Over the course of more than 60 meetings, Promesa’s General Assembly of residents, youth, educators, and other community stakeholders developed comprehensive strategies aimed at turning around two target schools (Hollenbeck Middle School and Mendez Learning Center), as well as addressing social determinants of education such as housing, safety, emotional wellness, and economic development. Promesa Boyle Heights operates under the Collective Impact framework with 12 nonprofit partners and two target schools that are committed to our grassroots governance model, which emphasizes that students, residents, and teachers—those most impacted by systems and policies—must lead community change efforts at every stage.
   
   We are building a model in which we catalyze “everyday” peoples’ passions, lived-experiences, and creativity to support comprehensive solutions that build on one another’s assets. Moreover, it is a model that can be replicated by other low-income communities within Los Angeles that, though each facing their own unique issues, share a common need to raise the voices of local residents in the face of such forces as gentrification. Promesa Boyle Heights’ mission and reason for being is not simply to transform Boyle Heights. Rather, it is to “scale up” our successes so that by 2050, Los Angeles is a city in which ALL residents are empowered to work with schools, elected officials, and business leaders in order to collectively shape the future of the city.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Boyle Heights lies on the eastern edge of LA and is one of its oldest
  communities. It covers 6.5 square miles and is isolated from downtown and the
  greater LA area by the LA River and several converging freeways. Boyle Heights
  is one of LA’s most densely populated neighborhoods (95,000+) and has one of
  the highest percentages of Latino residents (94%). Two-thirds of adult
  residents do not have a high school degree, and 1 in 4 families live below the
  federal poverty line - double the County rate.
   
   But these statistics can only begin to represent our community and whom this project will benefit. Boyle Heights is also vibrant and tight-knit. Once defined by our struggling schools, gang violence, and dilapidated infrastructure, Boyle Heights is becoming a model for how residents and organizations can come together to address critical issues in their community. Over the past ten years, our community has pressed for and won important battles, including the opening of new schools, improvements to infrastructure, a place at the table with the Housing Authority of Los Angeles amidst a move to privatize local housing developments, and modest gains in graduation rates. 
   
   Yet, our community continues to face major challenges – too many students continue to fall through the cracks; job and economic growth opportunities are sparse; access to health and wellness resources is still splintered; and mounting gentrification pressures on our community means decreasing access to affordable and safe housing for the lowest income residents.
   
   Now more than ever, it is vital that the work of Promesa Boyle Heights – particularly our work to strengthen existing resident leaders and cultivate new ones – continues to grow.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  Our collaborative is based on the core believe that no one person or
  individual can do it alone. We have been operating as a collaborative since
  2010. Our initial collaboration focused on the development of a strategic plan
  for our community, including developing a shared vision, outcome goals, and
  agreed upon strategies.
   
   We are now working together to impact four agreed-upon outcomes: 
   
   1) improving graduation rates at Mendez High School, 2) building a college going culture in our community, 3) increasing access to health and wellness services, and 4) fostering leadership and civic engagement opportunities for adult residents and youth. 
   
   Our collective impact model elevates partners to continuum leadership roles. In addition to partnering with the target schools and their education reform manager Partnership for Los Angeles Schools (PLAS), 12 agencies are collaborating as Continuum Lead Partners. We also work closely with two schools: Hollenbeck Middle School and Mendez High School. All partners signed an MOU at the end of our planning period in 2011 and 125 residents signed a commitment form. The coordination of resident engagement and leadership moving forward, particularly as it relates to the Wellness Center campaign, will be led by East Los Angeles Community Corporation (ELACC), InnerCity Struggle, & Proyecto Pastoral.
