  This project will be building off of the success of the existing Nature
  Parkway. First we will re-engage the Friends of the Nature Parkway made up of
  community groups, organizations, businesses, students and residents who were
  instrumental in establishing the Nature Parkway and still are involved in
  maintaining the urban trail. The first phase of community dialogue events will
  inform the local community about how to get involved with revitalizing their
  sidewalk spaces into safe urban trails. Surveys will be collected to inform us
  the extent of current sidewalk space utilization. 
   Through a community involved assessment, the pre-selected sidewalks connecting to the existing Nature Parkway, will identify the type of beautification resources needed for each block. Whether it is planning more native plants, covering areas with decomposed granite or cleaning the current landscape, a log of needs will inform the beautification plan. The main project leaders will be responsible for acquiring all necessary permits. A partial allocation of awarded funds will be used to offer light food and refreshments to community members who are involved the process. Informational signage for the type of plants used will be designed and installed. The signs will look similar to what is seen in local city and state parks. The result will be a detailed list of the number of tools and other resources to revitalize sidewalks into complete urban trails. 
   Our ongoing contributors and LA 2050 funding will make gathering all of the resources required possible to complete the beautification phases. We will outreach to local surrounding businesses to attain the right tools to complete the Nature Parkway project. Community events that provide connections to community resources, free delicious healthy food, hydration stations and fun will create a public space for community members to unite for a common cause. These events will be open to all community residents and businesses that have a stake in this community investment. We will outreach to nearby schools, community organizations and other members using social media outlets. Groups will be made up of folks who either want to plant, remove debris, or install signage along the Nature Parkway. These volunteers will be made up of original and new Friends of the Nature Parkway. Our relationship and increased engagement will be made possible by facilitating continuous communication in a public sphere.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Historically the East San Fernando Valley experienced racial segregation and
  continuous resource disparities which negatively affected the built
  environment and health of its residents. In one of the target neighborhoods,
  Pacoima, residents experience some of the highest rates of obesity (17%) and
  asthma (20%.) Our neighborhoods are park poor (54 acres) and decades of
  unregulated business activity attributed to increased levels of toxicity.
  Specifically, this project’s safe urban trails will bring together Pacoima,
  Arleta and Mission Hills through safe walkable sidewalks. Stakeholders will
  have an aesthetic drought resistant landscaped path that is long term
  self-sustaining, uses minimal water, while restoring the user’s health and
  balancing the eco-system. Urban trail maps will help all visitors and locals
  to recognize and use the revitalized environment which helps to make them feel
  safer, healthier and better connected to the services and goods they require.
  Together we will put more eyes on the street and leave the car in the garage. 
   Community stewardship will form a sense of ownership for the project because the sidewalk will be restored by every one of us. Those who partake in the planting will be able to adopt the plant and secure its longevity. Children and adults alike will be establishing roots in our community. A powerful method to bring along change in our community is to offer opportunities for education and hands on experience. The main group of organizers will produce a revitalization plan that has minimal maintenance while mimicking natural systems to create beautiful living spaces that nourish people and celebrate nature. 
   The project will also be a place to learn how to maintain a clean and healthy environment as well as establishing a more active lifestyle. Informational signage will be installed, similar to what is seen in local city and state parks. Mile markers along the path will help the user track their distance in the hopes that they reach their fitness goals. The user will be informed on how the habitat enhances not only their well-being but also that of the native animals. Local schools will now have an accessible native plant path enabling hands on learning. Children will become health champions. Minimizing our carbon footprint by being on foot or bicycle can increase mobility, put more eyes on the street, increase community stewardship and stimulate local business activity.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The project will benefit the densely populated communities living in close
  proximity to four connected streets (Devonshire St., Canterbury Ave., Van Nuys
  Blvd., and San Fernando Rd.) , approximately a 7 mile distance. All
  stakeholders ranging from households, to educators, to business owners will
  benefit. When residents feel safe to walk in their neighborhoods instead of
  jumping into their car, residents will re-familiarize themselves with the type
  of pedestrian friendly culture they or their older relatives’ experience
  before coming to this country. 
   From an early age small children will grow up knowing walking up and down urban trails is the thing to do. This opportunity will secure them with the safety they need to grow stronger. Playing outside and discovering the animals that use the urban trail as their habitat can be a game of show and tell for parent and child. The expanded tree canopy coverage would be ideal for parents to push strollers and for seniors to increase mobility. Parents can feel secure to let their children off the stroller since the extra green foliage will act as a buffer between them and the street.
   For school children to be part of a LA2050 initiative that makes their own LA neighborhood a better place to live will make them long term community stewards for a better well-being. Walking to and from school can be their new norm. Along the trail exists three schools with approximately 3300 students cumulatively and one highly used park. The urban trails will better connect them to their school and park of choice.
   Canterbury Avenue has a very special grove, lined with nurseries and community gardens. The urban trail will create a safe path to Arleta High School, Beachy Ave. Elementary School, Canterbury Elementary and Branford Park. An opportunity exists to bring the first farmer’s market to this area. The uptick in foot traffic and increase promotion through the urban trail map will stimulate the local economy. 
   San Fernando Road stretches over 1.5 miles for residents to walk, ride, or run. The busy street is well lit and plants are starting to grow and blossom bright floral colors. It is already highly utilized because of the number of commuter bus stops. On Van Nuys Blvd. a color explosion occurred when youth driven art mural projects started to replace graffiti. Along the pathway users have accessibility to city resources through the neighborhood City Hall offices, postal office, library, health services and restaurants.

   Each of these partners share the value of revitalizing our sidewalks to increase the number of safe streets, enhance our resident’s health and improve the environment. In some form or another they all contributed resources whether they be tools, labor, expertise, promotion, labor, monetary contribution or volunteer hours to turn a blighted sidewalk into a nature parkway. Five years later they are still waiting for us to stretch the parkway into more urban trails. For this project we will have to re-ignite the conversation with all of our past partners and form new partnerships.
   The three main factors which are critical to our success are leadership, communication and teamwork. The Nature Parkway’s project manager will help make it possible to extend urban trails because of her leadership ability to pay attention to detail without undermining the biggest asset which are the partners and residents. She will help us get the right team members to the decision making table. Communication will be key, since no formal group already exists to carry on the work. Continuous communication will help keep all informed in the project’s process. Lastly teamwork is necessary to understand what is going well and what needs to be ameliorated. Volunteers including experts who donate services will be engaged by the opportunity to self-identify their role and execute the right action leading towards the main goal.
