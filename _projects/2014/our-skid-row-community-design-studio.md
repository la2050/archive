Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Our Skid Row is composed of three core programs: community-engaged research,
  participatory design workshops, and public actions.
   
   Community-engaged research will have residents actively investigate issues of the neighborhood while collecting supporting data and continuing community engagement and outreach. Instead of Skid Row residents being the subject of research, Our Skid Row plans to switch the role and have Skid Row residents pose questions, implement fieldwork to collect supporting information and draw conclusions from the process. Accessible and impactful research tools, such as graphic surveys and interpretive mapping will be tested and refined to maximize impact. Additionally, the participation station- a mobile design kiosk will be available for additional data collection, conversation, and street workshops.
   
   Participatory design workshops will create an outlet for residents and stakeholders to engage in generating design solutions to community identified issues. Our Skid Row will work with resident designers to move through an iterative process that begins to represent possible solutions. Design support will come from in-house staff, as well as our network of nationally recognized leaders in design and community-engaged planning. Additionally, continuous design workshops will hone in on developing drawing and technical design skills. Short design activities will provide low-commitment outlets for artistic and creative expression. Workshops will include model-making exercises, photography and drawing. Resident facilitators will also be trained, so that they can lead the design process as well.
   
   Public Actions will focus on events and built works in the community that celebrate the neighborhood, provide new resources, and support meaningful connections. With Our Skid Row designers, we will create public events that foster a larger dialog around the power of place and equitable community development. Additionally, small built works will be installed in the community to amplify existing assets and provide new amenities to the area. This will be an opportunity to share the successes of our Skid Row with Los Angeles and beyond. 
   
   We will celebrate Skid Row as a place of design innovation!
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Our Skid Row will provide a creative outlet for Angelenos to explore
  collective definitions of sustainable and equitable place-making. The project
  functions on multiple scales and time frames. In the 2050 time table, Our Skid
  Row lays out a roadmap for a socially and physically sustainable community
  though a comprehensive neighborhood plan and implementation strategy. For
  today, Our Skid Row residents will identify specific underutilized spaces, and
  design catalytic projects that will begin steps towards the long-term vision.
   
   Our Skid Row creates a platform for Skid Row residents, small business owners, and other committed stakeholders, to be involved in the creative design process and actively shape their environment. The goal is to bring design out of the ivory tower and put design decisions and direction in the hands of the end user, so that communities can create the most impact and generate greater diversity in the conversation of community development.
   
   Additionally, tools and processes will be closely documented and shared on our website, so that we can foster additional innovations in participatory design and encourage other communities to positively impact their built environment.
   
   Our Skid Row will develop local creative jobs to Skid Row residents, opportunities for young designers to hold positions in public interest design, and volunteers from across the city to engage in improving Los Angeles. Additionally, the project supports the community to think critically about their built condition and analytically develop skills that can positively change their community.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Multiple publics will benefit from Our Skid Row, including Skid Row residents,
  downtown stakeholders, and Los Angeles County. The residents, both the housed
  and unhoused population, will have the opportunity to voice their visions and
  generate design solutions for their own neighborhood. This is an opportunity
  to increase a sense of ownership and civic involvement in their community.
  Additionally, community-driven improvements to the neighborhood will begin
  building bridges to the rapidly developing downtown area, creating shared
  resources and amenities, and opportunities for interaction between residents,
  business owners, and visitors, creating a more cohesive region. Lastly, Los
  Angeles County will benefit from focused efforts to equitably develop the
  lowest income and most under-resourced area of the region.
   
   Specifically, existing organizations and residents in Skid Row will have access to affordable and pro-bono design resources that did not exist before. By creating a design outlet in the area, residents will have additional activities to contribute to. We will work together to design, build, and install small-scale design interventions in the public realm. The design and development process will also create many opportunities for volunteerism and community-engagement.
   
   At first, building small scale projects can support new programs and offer new amenities that are lacking in the area. This can lead to larger infrastructural developments, attract private impact investments, and may offer local job opportunities along with physical improvements.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Our Skid Row will be a community resource that all neighborhood organizations
  and residents have access to. We will also leverage our design network to
  enhance design support resources and build upon existing collaborations and
  partnerships with organizations in the community. Three critical factors are
  outreach, accessibility, and continuity. To ensure welcomed participation of
  all residents and organizations in the area, street and organizational
  outreach will be implemented for all programming. Activities will be
  accessible and will not limit participation due to lack of technical
  abilities. Lastly, programming will be continuous to nurture cumulative
  growth, involvement and leadership development.
