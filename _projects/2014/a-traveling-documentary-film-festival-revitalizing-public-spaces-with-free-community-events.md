    Ambulante USA is a nonprofit based in Los Angeles that focuses on supporting
    and promoting documentary film as a tool for social and cultural
    transformation. One of the principal programs, Ambulante California, is an
    annual film festival tour that travels to areas with limited access to film
    in an effort to diversify and democratize documentary culture. Its aim is to
    reach a broader audience by screening films in a wide array of alternative
    venues and offering its programming for free. In partnership with community
    organizations, the goal is to create unique exhibition spaces and make
    accessible stories that reflect LA communities’ diverse heritage and enhance
    cross-cultural appreciation of other viewpoints. 
  implement: "For Ambulante USA and its director, Christine Davila, the process of identifying, meeting and nurturing alliances with local organizations is a fundamental and never-ending process. The organization’s traveling platform and grassroots personal outreach finds a wealth of humanistic and social service organizations compassionately serving its base. Ambulante  California aims to be a cultural aggregator of this network by promoting the work of each partner and in turn strengthening the collective interdisciplinary efforts to meet their goals.  This speaks to the community base aspect.\r\n\r\nBy design, Ambulante California is a participatory platform that grows to meet the increasing level of public engagement and response to it.  At each screening Ambulante USA invites local businesses, artisans and artists to be part of the program. We develop and activate our audiences to creatively involve their community, and influence the type of festival event they want to experience. For instance, through Ambulante California ’s website the public has the opportunity to vote on where they would like to see a screening event take place.  The general public is invited to submit their short films to the festival programmers to consider selecting as part of the program.  Audience members are surveyed to ask what kind of films they would like to see programmed.  This speaks to the audience driven aspect, interactive and feeding the model to fine tune it to adapt it best to serve the communities needs and wants.\r\n\r\nIn order to distill the complexities and provide a deeper context for discussing films’ themes and issues, Ambulante California invites experts in correlated fields to moderate conversation with the filmmaker and audience.  Ambulante USA believes in enriching the cultural activity and missions of other nonprofits. Collaboration with private and public organizations is at the core of Ambulante’s model. This serves to provide a contextualized space to engage in dialogue and inform a critical society.\r\n\r\nAmbulante California also stimulates the revitalization of urban public spaces to foster neighborhood community.  By inhabiting our public spaces as town halls to discuss necessary topics or to discover a variety of viewpoints, it indicates to local government the need to invest and sustain clean, secure recreational parks and plazas.\r\n"
  impact_connect: "Ambulante USA in the California context seeks to integrate its participatory platform with the diverse ecosystem of sub-cultures found within the sprawling and decentralized population to foster artistic expression and connect communities.\r\n\r\nToday, there is strong desire to link the fragmented in Greater Area of Los Angeles. There is no other traveling film festival in Los Angeles that reaches out directly to low income communities and the general public in an effort to bring a relevant curation of non-fiction film programming for free. Since the nature of the festival is to be constantly in motion, the vast potential to reach diverse, multicultural and fragmented audiences is particularly potent.  Another unique aspect of Ambulante California is that it is by nature inclusive. Ambulante’s amorphous virtue and open-sourced development consistently forges mutually beneficial collaborations with local, private and public organizations. \r\n\r\nAlthough a number of film festivals in Los Angeles offer outdoor free community screenings as part of the overall program, this is the main component of Ambulante USA and Ambulante California. \r\n\r\nAmbulante California offers an entertaining, stimulating, thought-provoking and educational movie-going alternative to the limited choices found in commercial outlets, especially for working class families and low to moderate income communities in Los Angeles.  \r\n\r\nThe festival tour may take place once a year, but the nonprofit’s plans include a year round program of monthly screenings on a smaller scale with local community and institutes. The intention is to create a movement in Los Angeles of “Ambulantes” or residents who can share using the power of documentary cinema, who can discover new public spaces by attending screenings in safe and makeshift public spaces, and who are transformed by the dialogue generated in their own communities.\r\n"
  who_benefit: "While the City and County of Los Angeles has a vibrant social and fine art scene, the reality is there is a high density of decentralized populations in the greater metropolitan area that is often overlooked: residents who do not have the resources to access a variety of culture and art exchange either because of the price of admission or exclusive settings. Ambulante USA addresses this extreme disparity in accessibility by going directly into these communities to offer interactive documentary events for free, with the consciousness of transforming the cultural exchange to each new geographical and social context.  \r\n\r\nRather than serving one specific demographic, the model attracts and brings a cross section of the public together to share an experience, resulting in a resonant and unparalleled connection among the fragmented sprawl in California. The organization will venture to areas traditionally marginalized, like the Skid Row area, and concentrated Spanish language speaking neighborhoods.  Ambulante USA’s goal is to integrate all residents, especially those systematically left out of the conversations that documentary film provokes and reflects.  \r\n\r\nBeyond the projected audience of the 10,000 people we expect to reach, the most consequential impact is the diversity and multi-tier of class, gender, age and race the attendance figure represents.  In addition to the audiences, the approximately 100 volunteers recruited, sourced from each community Ambulante California visits, will undergo production training and orientation of the themes and subjects of each documentary.  An essential aspect is building morale, motivation and empowering the volunteers as ambassadors of the festival.  In that respect we will offer volunteer screenings of the films in advance of the festival so they may adequately and passionately speak about the merits of the program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is more than a film festival and meets the CONNECT, LIVE and PLAY LA2050 Metrics. The nature of traveling to the communities where the films are being screened to new audiences opens up the possibility of re-defining the use of their public spaces and offers to the residents of LA the unique opportunity to create safer neighborhoods through the use of documentary screening.

  two_lessons: >-
    How very important it is to make events inclusive for audiences from
    different generations, socioeconomic backgrounds and walks of life and also
    to take direct feedback from them through brief video interviews after
    screening in order to collect visually and measure the impact of the
    Ambulante California’s mobile cinema experience.  Also to have confidence in
    delegating more responsibility to volunteers and we expand Ambulante USA
    since it has been a proven that this is the best way to operate in a fluid
    and progressive manner.
  achievable_goal: "Over the past 10 years Ambulante in Mexico has garnered extensive experience in the production of film festivals in a variety of geographical and social contexts.  In an attempt to actively reach out to new audiences Ambulante has managed to engage a wide variety of partners in the organization of the festival (multiplexes, film industry organizations, institutions, human rights organizations, grassroots organizations, universities, cultural centers, among others).  The audience in Mexico has grown by over 700% in just 8 years, and the festival has managed to establish a reputable trajectory, backed by previous festival guests, multiple invitations to film festivals around the world, and awards, including the WOLA Human Rights Award in 2011 for promoting documentaries as a tool for change.\r\n\r\nAlthough Ambulante has already held showcases in 34 cities across 16 countries, the nature of each of these events has varied considerably, depending largely on local partners’ interests, target audiences, and available support.  Ambulante California is therefore designed as a sustainable independent model that can be implemented across a variety of geographical and social contexts, target new and diverse audiences, and abide to the objectives of Ambulante.\r\n"

Ideally we would like to have a diverse pool of funding sources so that the organization can implement their \r\n\r\nAn other challenge is the documentary genre, tends to be known as a boring educational tool.  The curatorial rigor of the program will over time prove to audiences that documentary is in fact the most exciting cinema.  "
  competition: >-
    Although a number of film festivals offer outdoor free community screenings
    as part of the overall program, this is the main component of Ambulante. 
    The festival tour may take place once a year but the nonprofit’s plans a
    year round program of monthly screenings, on a smaller scale, with local
    community and institutes.  It is non competitive.  Ambulante has a unique
    working model in which it vigorously trains and encourages each site to run
    with a level of creative autonomy.  While the programs fall under the
    umbrella structure of Ambulante Global, the survival of each program is not
    fully burdened by the top, but rather it has a horizontal structure.  This
    allows independence and determination for the programs to continue.  If for
    any reason the umbrella organization is not available, other entities may
    continue the work of reaching out to their residents and pooling local
    resources so that the programming could sustain itself even if at a smaller
    scale.  The size of Ambulante is impressive. However the scope, even at a
    reduced version, is the most significant and unique.
  cost: "The 2014-2015 Ambulante USA Budget is $563,467. This amount includes Personnel and Non-Personnel Cost. Ambulante USA has planned a strategic fundraising campaign that is based of securing funding from a diverse pool of funding sources.  To raise the 2014-2015 budget we are soliciting funds from private foundations, individual donors, corporate institutions and also government sources. At this time we are submitting requests to the Annenberg Foundation, we have already established relationships with the Ford Foundation, the California Community Foundation and the California Endowment. At the end of the year we will also be submitting a request to the James Irvine Foundation. Within the next two weeks we will also be submitting a proposal to the City and County of Los Angeles through the Department of Cultural Affairs and the LA County Arts Commission. For a prospective list of funding sources and amounts please see list below.\r\n\r\nThe announcement of the LA2050 winners will be announced right at the time that Ambulante USA is celebrating its first edition of Ambulante California in LA.

Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  While the City and County of Los Angeles has a vibrant social and fine art
  scene, the reality is there is a high density of decentralized populations in
  the greater metropolitan area that is often overlooked: residents who do not
  have the resources to access a variety of culture and art exchange either
  because of the price of admission or exclusive settings. Ambulante USA
  addresses this extreme disparity in accessibility by going directly into these
  communities to offer interactive documentary events for free, with the
  consciousness of transforming the cultural exchange to each new geographical
  and social context. 
   
   Rather than serving one specific demographic, the model attracts and brings a cross section of the public together to share an experience, resulting in a resonant and unparalleled connection among the fragmented sprawl in California. The organization will venture to areas traditionally marginalized, like the Skid Row area, and concentrated Spanish language speaking neighborhoods. Ambulante USA’s goal is to integrate all residents, especially those systematically left out of the conversations that documentary film provokes and reflects. 
   
   Beyond the projected audience of the 10,000 people we expect to reach, the most consequential impact is the diversity and multi-tier of class, gender, age and race the attendance figure represents. In addition to the audiences, the approximately 100 volunteers recruited, sourced from each community Ambulante California visits, will undergo production training and orientation of the themes and subjects of each documentary. An essential aspect is building morale, motivation and empowering the volunteers as ambassadors of the festival. In that respect we will offer volunteer screenings of the films in advance of the festival so they may adequately and passionately speak about the merits of the program.
