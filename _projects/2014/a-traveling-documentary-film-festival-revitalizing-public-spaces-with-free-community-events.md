What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Ambulante USA is a nonprofit based in Los Angeles that focuses on supporting
  and promoting documentary film as a tool for social and cultural
  transformation. One of the principal programs, Ambulante California, is an
  annual film festival tour that travels to areas with limited access to film in
  an effort to diversify and democratize documentary culture. Its aim is to
  reach a broader audience by screening films in a wide array of alternative
  venues and offering its programming for free. In partnership with community
  organizations, the goal is to create unique exhibition spaces and make
  accessible stories that reflect LA communities’ diverse heritage and enhance
  cross-cultural appreciation of other viewpoints.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  For Ambulante USA and its director, Christine Davila, the process of
  identifying, meeting and nurturing alliances with local organizations is a
  fundamental and never-ending process. The organization’s traveling platform
  and grassroots personal outreach finds a wealth of humanistic and social
  service organizations compassionately serving its base. Ambulante California
  aims to be a cultural aggregator of this network by promoting the work of each
  partner and in turn strengthening the collective interdisciplinary efforts to
  meet their goals. This speaks to the community base aspect.
   
   By design, Ambulante California is a participatory platform that grows to meet the increasing level of public engagement and response to it. At each screening Ambulante USA invites local businesses, artisans and artists to be part of the program. We develop and activate our audiences to creatively involve their community, and influence the type of festival event they want to experience. For instance, through Ambulante California ’s website the public has the opportunity to vote on where they would like to see a screening event take place. The general public is invited to submit their short films to the festival programmers to consider selecting as part of the program. Audience members are surveyed to ask what kind of films they would like to see programmed. This speaks to the audience driven aspect, interactive and feeding the model to fine tune it to adapt it best to serve the communities needs and wants.
   
   In order to distill the complexities and provide a deeper context for discussing films’ themes and issues, Ambulante California invites experts in correlated fields to moderate conversation with the filmmaker and audience. Ambulante USA believes in enriching the cultural activity and missions of other nonprofits. Collaboration with private and public organizations is at the core of Ambulante’s model. This serves to provide a contextualized space to engage in dialogue and inform a critical society.
   
   Ambulante California also stimulates the revitalization of urban public spaces to foster neighborhood community. By inhabiting our public spaces as town halls to discuss necessary topics or to discover a variety of viewpoints, it indicates to local government the need to invest and sustain clean, secure recreational parks and plazas.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Ambulante USA in the California context seeks to integrate its participatory
  platform with the diverse ecosystem of sub-cultures found within the sprawling
  and decentralized population to foster artistic expression and connect
  communities.
   
   Today, there is strong desire to link the fragmented in Greater Area of Los Angeles. There is no other traveling film festival in Los Angeles that reaches out directly to low income communities and the general public in an effort to bring a relevant curation of non-fiction film programming for free. Since the nature of the festival is to be constantly in motion, the vast potential to reach diverse, multicultural and fragmented audiences is particularly potent. Another unique aspect of Ambulante California is that it is by nature inclusive. Ambulante’s amorphous virtue and open-sourced development consistently forges mutually beneficial collaborations with local, private and public organizations. 
   
   Although a number of film festivals in Los Angeles offer outdoor free community screenings as part of the overall program, this is the main component of Ambulante USA and Ambulante California. 
   
   Ambulante California offers an entertaining, stimulating, thought-provoking and educational movie-going alternative to the limited choices found in commercial outlets, especially for working class families and low to moderate income communities in Los Angeles. 
   
   The festival tour may take place once a year, but the nonprofit’s plans include a year round program of monthly screenings on a smaller scale with local community and institutes. The intention is to create a movement in Los Angeles of “Ambulantes” or residents who can share using the power of documentary cinema, who can discover new public spaces by attending screenings in safe and makeshift public spaces, and who are transformed by the dialogue generated in their own communities.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  While the City and County of Los Angeles has a vibrant social and fine art
  scene, the reality is there is a high density of decentralized populations in
  the greater metropolitan area that is often overlooked: residents who do not
  have the resources to access a variety of culture and art exchange either
  because of the price of admission or exclusive settings. Ambulante USA
  addresses this extreme disparity in accessibility by going directly into these
  communities to offer interactive documentary events for free, with the
  consciousness of transforming the cultural exchange to each new geographical
  and social context. 
   
   Rather than serving one specific demographic, the model attracts and brings a cross section of the public together to share an experience, resulting in a resonant and unparalleled connection among the fragmented sprawl in California. The organization will venture to areas traditionally marginalized, like the Skid Row area, and concentrated Spanish language speaking neighborhoods. Ambulante USA’s goal is to integrate all residents, especially those systematically left out of the conversations that documentary film provokes and reflects. 
   
   Beyond the projected audience of the 10,000 people we expect to reach, the most consequential impact is the diversity and multi-tier of class, gender, age and race the attendance figure represents. In addition to the audiences, the approximately 100 volunteers recruited, sourced from each community Ambulante California visits, will undergo production training and orientation of the themes and subjects of each documentary. An essential aspect is building morale, motivation and empowering the volunteers as ambassadors of the festival. In that respect we will offer volunteer screenings of the films in advance of the festival so they may adequately and passionately speak about the merits of the program.

   The participation of each site we visit includes not just audience engagement but volunteers from each area. Our volunteers are trained and given a level of independence, confidence and boosts of morale. We attract young go-getters and older film lovers as volunteers. Our films are family driven but are also emotional which can really affect adults. 
   
   Ambulante California does not impose any ideas or restrictions on the communities it enters, creating a safe space for people of all races, genders, sexual orientations, and socioeconomic backgrounds to participate in important dialogues.
