Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Over the course of the coming year, we will build on the established
  foundation to bring additional partners into the collaborative. While our
  overall goal is to create a Department of Youth Development in the County of
  LA, there are several short- and medium- term goals that will help move the
  long term campaign forward while also achieving immediate change. 
   
   We will conduct community asset mapping with young people, to identify existing community resources, and prioritize one or two parks or recreational spaces in the community to reclaim as youth-centered spaces. Activities may include holding events, raising awareness in the community, litter removal, and advocating for funding for specific local improvements.
   
   Additionally, we will work with young people to create a strong case for support of the campaign that includes youth language and imagery. We will then educate local communities about the goals of the campaign in an effort to increase community engagement and buy-in. Further, we will create 3-5 video and/or performance projects that help capture the stories of young people in at-risk communities in order to re-shape the narrative around young people. These pieces could be shared online, through social media, and in a performance at a park. Our goal is to increase community's sense of their own safety, and to re-frame how young people are seen. By engaging with community members to tell the story of young people's experiences we hope to dispel misconceptions around actual safety and increase inter-generational connection among community members. 
   
   Additional efforts may include developing joint use agreements with schools, parks and rec centers to maximize the use of existing spaces as effective and engaging community spaces. Further activities may include collaboration building and advocacy training, creating a Peacebuilders Round Table to ensure ongoing communication and knowledge sharing, to coordinate truce building, rumor control and inter-neighborhood relationship building among intervention workers and service providers in order to prevent street-based violence throughout the county. Additional goals include establishing training in partnership with a local college or Cal State to provide nonprofit management and leadership curriculum to youth, leveraging opportunities for co-located services in community spaces, and bringing in technical assistance to support the long-term sustainability of the youth spaces and centers.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  LA for Youth will help Los Angeles re-imagine its relationship to its young
  people. Instead of being afraid of our youth, this campaign will support a
  structural shift that emphasizes investing in children as a way to improve a
  community's sense of safety, increase local use of park and public spaces, and
  empower young people themselves to see themselves as valued members of their
  communities.
   
   This effort is not about starting from scratch, it's about re-purposing what we have, and re-framing our priorities. By engaging youth themselves in this effort, we are not only pushing for systems change, we are concretely developing the leadership of some of our most at-risk young people. We are re-framing their vision of themselves from "always in trouble" to someone who makes a positive contribution to their community. By training young people as leaders and providing a path to long-term success by connecting them to other youth leaders, community colleges, and even their local middle and high schools, we will be increasing the safety of their communities, and increasing their access to safe public spaces. Additionally, this effort will be particularly attentive to young people returning from incarceration. These young men and women are often the most at-risk for committing new crimes. LA for Youth would include efforts to reconnect these young people to their communities, provide support groups and ensure funding for positive activities as part of an effective strategy to make LA a better place for all youth to play.
   
   By seeking a structural shift in how Los Angeles invests its money, this campaign will result in long-term change that will resonate for decades to come. LA for Youth asks Los Angeles to invest in youth development not just for today, but to create a cycle of hope for generations.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The project will benefit the young people in Los Angeles County, as well as
  their families, and the communities where they live. By shifting the County's
  relationship to its youth, by promoting youth investment, LA residents will
  benefit from healthier, stronger young people who are more engaged in school,
  more physically active, and more involved with civic institutions. Young
  people facing a lifetime of repeat incarceration (at significant cost) will be
  redirected to more positive activities, including long-term employment and
  meaningful careers. 
   
   Because LA for Youth is focused on improving conditions and support for our most at-risk and under-served young people, the primary beneficiaries will be low-income communities, and neighborhoods with high rates of youth suspension, and little access to safe public spaces. The areas of Boyle Heights and South Los Angeles will be primary areas of focus. Additionally, we anticipate that young people ages 12-24 will be the primary population this effort will engage.
   
   As a whole, this effort will lead to stronger families and communities, and a better Los Angeles for everyone - not just now, but also in the future, as these young people grow into future leaders of Los Angeles.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  We are tremendously excited by the complementary skills and strengths of our
  partners. We believe this presents a uniquely powerful combination that will
  be able to move what's a pretty substantial effort. The core organizing
  collaboration is between the Youth Justice Coalition (YJC) and the Violence
  Prevention Coalition (VPC). Youth Justice Coalition did the original research
  and laid the foundation for this effort. YJC engages and empowers young people
  to be community organizers and advocates. This project will help leverage
  their existing work with at-risk youth. Their partnership ensures that youth
  voices remain at the center of the effort -- a key factor in the success of
  this collaboration. The Violence Prevention Coalition brings in a broad and
  diverse membership base, and serves as a non-service-providing neutral body to
  convene, facilitate, and shepherd this effort (our second and third key
  factors for the collaboration's success).
   
   We will bring in already-committed allies in the Boyle Heights Building Healthy Communities Hub, including their Youth Engagement and Community Engagement Committees. This represents six core partner organizations, as well as several supporting organizations. These partners are already working with technical advisers through the Advancement Project (whom we hope to bring on as an official partner) on deconstructing the City budget, and engaging City leadership in support of the effort. We have begun conversations about engaging the South Los Angeles Building Healthy Communities partners in this effort as well, which would bring an additional dozen organizations into the coalition. All partners will help ensure community and youth voices are leading the effort for change. Additionally, the project will be a vehicle to grow local capacity around civic engagement and advocacy implementation, to ensure the long term sustainability and community ownership of the effort. 
   
   It is important to note that engaging these additional coalitions would represent longstanding partnerships, and organizations with a history of working together for systems change.
