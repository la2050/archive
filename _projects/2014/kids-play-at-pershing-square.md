Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  This project is shovel-ready and we have secured matching funds. All planning,
  design, equipment/safety surface selection, and engineering has been
  completed. Once funding is secured, the project will be fully completed in 6-9
  months.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  The PAB wants to establish a place for kids to be outdoors, dream, play and
  learn to work with others. So whether kids are playing on the playground
  swings at recess, or having friends over to swing on their own swing sets,
  it's more than playtime; it's a time to grow. A playground is a wonderful
  place for children to release stress. Swinging, jumping, climbing and running
  are good for children both physically and emotionally. Taking time away from
  structured activity is an important part of keeping a child well-rounded and
  healthy. A playground is not just a playground. It's a place for kids to
  dream, relax and learn to work with others. By nurturing our children in this
  way, we help create a healthier community.
   
   Downtown Los Angeles has a changing demographic with 50,000 new residents and a growing number of children. The City and the residents are joining together to create new schools to accomodate the growing population of families moving to or being created in Downtown.
   
   If we were able to transport to the realization of our vision of Pershing Square in 2050, we would find a reestablishment of the “Living Room” of Downtown Los Angeles. In the mid 1800's, the park was the center of family life and provided the local residents with a social gathering place of shaded walks and topical foliage, a community retreat. In the next decades as the city expanded, and its population center relocated, Pershing Square worked to establish a representation of its growth, and supported the incorporation of structural modifications designed to attract visitors to our growing city. After several reincarnations executed by creative work by the Department, and with strong support from the business community, it was resolved to reestablish the original dream to make Pershing Square once again the jewel of the downtown core, and offer the best of space to local residents, venue visitors, and tourists.
   Pershing Square's South and Southwest kiosks will be children’s play areas serving the residential families in Downtown, South and East LA for decades to come. This common area for children and their parents will provide a friendly oasis for family fun.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The Kids Play at Pershing Square Project will not benefit only benefit
  families with children in Downtown Los Angeles and the adjacent communites but
  all families who visit Downtown well as visitors to Pershing Square.
   
   Annually, Downtown has 500,000+ weekday employees and more than 10 million annual non-local visitors. Pershing Square offers many programs to draw these locals, workers and tourists to the Park. Some of the programming includes:
   
   THE SUMMER CONCERT SERIES
   Pershing Square hostsvenue hosts a free summer concert series for six weeks with entertainment four days a week, featuring a variety of music with local, national and international artists. The program runs July through August, Thursday through Sunday. The Summer Concert Series draws between 3,000-7,000 people per week.
   
   FRIDAY NIGHT FLICKS
   Each spring, summer and fall over 25 free movies are shown at Pershing Square every Friday night from May through October. Patrons are encouraged to pack a picnic, bring a blanket or lawn chair and watch movies in Pershing Square Park. 
   
   FARMERS MARKET 
   The Farmers Market includes over 50 booths offering a variety of fresh, local produce and food offerings every Wednesday from 7:00am to 2:00pm. Specialty items such as jewelry and clothing are also available for purchase. The market allows the community another opportunity to meet friends and neighbors at Pershing Square. It also extends a welcome atmosphere to our farming community in other parts of Los Angeles.
   
   FREE MOBILE YOUTH AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMMING AN SUMMER CAMP
   Pershing Square Mobile Youth Team takes programming to underserved youth at pocket parks throughout the City. Recreation and Parks staff works out of City vans stuffed with games, toys, arts & crafts and sports equipment and coordinates fun after school leisure activities and providing homework help. This spring, Mobile Youth will be hosting it annual Extravaganza Spring Egg Hunt at Pershing Square. The event will host free arts and crafts, inflatables, age appropriate egg hunts.

Youth events at Pershing Square number close to 1000 per event.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  The City of Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks are a confirmed
  partner and have committed matching funds for the Kids Play at Pershing Square
  project. 
   The Department brings the logistical expertise and authority necessary to implement this project; the PAB is the link to the Downtown community, being comprised of Downtown leaders.
   The PAB has worked closely with the Department since its inception 9 years ago. The three factors that are critical to the success of our proposal collaboration include:
   1. Steadfast committment from the Department of Recreation & Parks for this Project - the PAB was chartered by the Department, so we are integrally linked
   2. Open Communication between Department and PAB
   3. Community support and engagement

  Indicator: ' Environmental Quality'
  brief: "The Pershing Square Park Advisory Board (PAB) is seeking funding for the design, planning and installation of a playground in Pershing Square Park in Downtown Los Angeles. Pershing Square is a City of Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks outdoor concert and event center which serves the community as a recreation center.\r\nWith the addition of a playground at Pershing Square the community can continue to meet the growing needs of its youngest residents. Playgrounds provide crucial and vital opportunities for children to play. There is substantial research showing the clear link between play and brain development, motor-skills, and social capabilities. All learning—emotional, social, motor and cognitive—is accelerated, facilitated, and fueled by the pleasure of play. Playgrounds that promote different types of play are vital for a child’s cognitive, emotional, physical, and social development.\r\n\r\nPlaygrounds provide a safe environment designed specifically to foster and enhance the opportunities for a child to play alone, with a caregiver, or with other children. Given the importance of play in the development of a child, any space which gives a child free reign to do just that should be seen a crucial component in a child’s life and in the continued growth and development of one’s community.\r\n\r\nQuite simply, the addition of a playground to Pershing Square will improve the quality of life for the downtown community.\r\n"

  success: >-
    We measure all of our programs by quality, not by quantity. It’s not how
    large of an audience or how much of an end result that is important, not how
    many people are affected, but rather the quality of the effect. We are
    successful by insuring a safe, comfortable, positive experience for our
    community. We are successful when our neighbors’ children interact with each
    other and invite their families and friends to join.
