  Dream A World Education founder, Grammy Award-Winner Bunny Hull brings a team
  of professional artists to your school. Through this six-week multi-arts
  residency, children learn music, dance, theatre and visual arts and discover
  the gifts that live within them. They learn the values of friendship,
  kindness, imagination and gratitude, as well as history, geography and social
  studies as they relate to each arts workshop. The residency includes a parent
  workshop, professional development, curriculum materials, a live performance,
  and culminates with a children’s presentation. Each week a performer/teaching
  artist from the initial performance brings a new art form to your school.
  Music curriculum kicks it off with the creation of an original class song with
  each class. Each class receives a recorded version of their song.
   
   The Secrets of the Heart’s curriculum guide for K-2 links the arts experience to academic achievement and critical thinking skills in Language Arts, Listening/Speaking, History, Social Studies and the development of interpersonal skills. This program reveals the arts to children as it relates to culture and tradition, gives them a little geography and history and teaches them, through self-expression, how to have greater respect for themselves and each other.
   
   This program is created to VAPA and Common Core Standards.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Research indicates that more than 80% of the children in Los Angeles schools
  are Title One – below the poverty line. The high school drop out rate in 2008
  was reported at 62%.
   
   Every choice a child makes is based on how they perceive themselves and the world around them. It impacts their attitudes, the relationships they forge, and the way they interact with their families and figures of authority.
   
   There’s a good reason why Dream A World Education focuses attention on children K-2. Early lessons have a lasting impact on a child. It is said that all the milestones relating to a child’s development happen before a child turns six. Their brain is like a sponge and a memory bank for all that enters their senses. Along with coordination, poise and stamina, patterns are formed, skills developed and the understanding of concepts and vocabulary are learned. This is the age when children learn the difference between right and wrong. It’s a time when social relationships are developed as they interact with each other and new adults as they are introduced into a school setting.
   
   It is our aim to reach children in these most formative years. It’s true that the healthy evolution of a child depends on more than just their school experiences. They need a solid support system at home. Some children may or may not have that support, but we believe one unforgettable experience can change a life. It is our intention to provide that experience for every child we meet.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: |-
  1. We Identify The Need
   
   We target schools that have not only a need, but a real desire for arts programming, especially those schools which are underserved. It’s important to us to work closely with principals and teachers to create a warm environment that inspires an exchange of learning and an atmosphere of cooperation.
   
   2. We Know Who We Serve
   
   Particular attention is paid to the population we are serving, their cultural background and to the educational, emotional or special needs of the children. Whether our program lasts for one day or six weeks, our goal is to recognize the individuality of each child.
   
   3. We Consult With Educators
   
   We are constantly meeting with exceptional elementary educators to determine what children need, what works with existing curriculum and to explore new ways to improve our programming. We have a lot to learn from each other. In addition, there is an emphasis on consulting with other arts organizations to share and compare ideas in order to achieve the most effective lesson plans and highest level of excellence for our teaching artists.
   
   4. We Know Where We’re Going
   
   It is the intention of Dream A World® to base our educational work in the Los Angeles area, and to then expand that outreach by targeting and identifying areas in the national and global community where our programs can be beneficial. Our future plans include developing educational programming for parents.
