Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  NewFilmmakers Los Angeles is requesting funds to aid us in expanding our core
  programming—NFMLA’s Monthly Screening Series, and On Location: the Los Angeles
  Video Project—and in doing so help us to greater promote cultural exchange by
  using film to ignite critical dialogue, promote global understanding and
  create film jobs and events in the Los Angeles area.
   
   Currently, NewFilmmakers LA manages to accomplish everything it does with a staff of only five—four of whom are part-time employees or on retainer, and only one of whom is full-time. The additional support provided by an expansion grant will allow us more resources, manpower and energy to continue the steady path of growth that NFMLA has maintained throughout the years. In expanding On Location, the NFMLA Monthly Screening Series and the rest of our core programming, we can provide important cultural and career opportunities to a wider net of communities in Los Angeles.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Since its inception, NewFilmmakers Los Angeles has dedicated itself towards
  making Los Angeles the best possible place to create films and experience film
  culture. NFMLA's core programs were designed to promote cultural exchange in
  LA by exposing the powerful, young talent behind important local and global
  cinema to a hungry audience—and vice versa.
   
   Our other core program aside from the Monthly Screening Series, On Location: The Los Angeles Video Project is about to celebrate its fourth anniversary as the first community outreach multimedia program that celebrates LA by enlisting its remarkable pool of filmmakers to make films about the city. On Location was largely founded as a means of helping to fight the current massive production exodus in California. The program serves LA not only by providing an outlet for its filmmakers to share their insider perspectives of this diverse cosmopolitan environment, but also by creating production opportunities for local residents on these shoots, and yielding a vibrant crop of short films that maintain and further Hollywood’s status as the world’s filmmaking capital.
   
   The Monthly Screening Series also achieves these goals by reserving half of each program for local films and offering a large discount to submitting local filmmakers if their movie was filmed in the area. NFMLA further encourages local film production by co-planning the California Locations Conference with the California Film Commission, presenting a Filming in LA Panel with FilmLA and LAPPG, and hosting the PGA’s Weekend Shorts Filmmaking Program.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Over twenty local films are made through the On Location program each year and
  premier to an audience of 500. Our other screenings serve 25,000+ patrons
  annually in the greater Los Angeles area, and we additionally reach 55,920
  subscribers on our email list and 9,555 via Facebook and other social media.
  Inexpensive ticket pricing ($5 for a single program) allows us to serve a vast
  array of socioeconomic groups, and our culturally rich programming draws a
  racially diverse audience, with 41% of our constituents Caucasian, 15% Black,
  18% Latino, 8% Asian, 3% Middle Eastern and 13% other.
   
   With the funds for outreach that a grant of this magnitude can provide, the amount of Angelinos we can benefit is potentially limitless.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  NFMLA has a longstanding history of collaborating with other organizations to
  achieve our shared goal of advancing LA arts and culture. Such collaborations
  include co-presentations of: two yearly panels with Women in Film, one yearly
  panel with AFCI Locations Show, the LA Student Media Film Festival with Paul
  Krekorian, the 57th Assembly District Student Digital Media Competition with
  Ian Calderon, an LA Harbor International Film Festival shorts showcase, four
  short film Summer Poolside Screening Series events at the Standard, and
  respective separate feature film screenings with the Indian Film Festival of
  Los Angeles, LA EigaFest, AFI Film Fest, and LA Film Festival. Other partners
  include: the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences, Film Independent, We
  Make Movies, FilmBreak, Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, Free Arts for Abused
  Children, the National Hispanic Media Convention, Japan Film Society, and the
  Consulates of Finland, Hungary and New Zealand. Most recently, we collaborated
  with NUVOtv to debut three stunning Latino-driven film programs before
  presenting them to an audience of millions on NUVOtv’s Nu Point of View
  program—a magnificent opportunity for any up-and-coming independent filmmaker.
   
   Between so many global partnerships and the fact that we bring and showcase international filmmakers to the city on a monthly basis, NewFilmmakers has made promoting a diverse, international presence in LA a top priority. It is for these reasons that the Hollywood Arts Council is honoring us with a Cinema Arts Award this year to celebrate outstanding contributions of merit to Hollywood and its arts.

  evaluate: "The best way to measure success for an organization like ours is by looking at how well we're able to serve the people our organization is dedicated to. As such, three simple metrics will allow us to measure our successes in growing our core programming.\r\n\r\nThe first is how well we're able to serve our audience. The most obvious way to measure success here is by numbers--if we can consistently grow our audience, then it means that expose more Angelinos to arts and cultural content. With support of this magnitude, I believe it could be possible for us to double the amount of people we serve.\r\n\r\nHowever, it's not only important for us to merely increase quantity of patrons we serve, but also the quality of what we're serving to them. To best serve our audience, it's imperative that we show an even greater selection of international films so that we can expose them to more global culture and to better assess and meet their needs in terms of types of content to engage with.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to our second metric: communities supported. This year, NewFilmmakers Los Angeles set two goals: to better support the Latino Film community of LA and the female-identified filmmakers of LA. We're proud to say that we have already met the first by partnering with NUVOtv to regularly provide three excellent Latino film programs and distribute them on global television and that we are well on our way to accomplishing the second by partnering with Women in Film.\r\n\r\nWith more funding, we could better support even more minority film communities: the Black film community, the Indigenous Peoples' film community, the Asian film community, the GLBTQ film community, etc. As such, the second metric by which we would measure success will be in amount of additional events, workshops, and outreach that we are able to provide for audiences and filmmakers of these communities.\r\n\r\nThe final--and perhaps most obvious--way that we can measure success as we grow as an organization is in terms of opportunities for our filmmakers. How many opportunities are we able to provide to our filmmakers? Can we provide better opportunities for them? Can we get more people to see their films? How can we better highlight their accomplishments? Can we plan more workshops to help filmmakers build their skillsets? If we can better serve our filmmakers by further improving in these areas, then we will have accomplished our third goal."
  two_lessons: "The two major lessons that informed our project is the importance of audience and press/publicity for a filmmaker.\r\n\r\nRegarding audience, the NFMLA Monthly Screening Series was created to help provide exposure for the kind of insightful new voices in independent cinema that weren’t being well served by other outlets. These films would often premiere at prestigious festivals, but struggle to gain an audience there due to being  programmed simultaneously to larger studio films with big marketing budgets and name talent. Our monthly screening series circumvents this by avoiding concurrent programming, and inexpensive all-night tickets means that the bigger films we screen instead help the smaller films by drawing more of an audience to a larger event with films of all sizes.\r\n\r\nAfter each month’s screening, filmmakers are given the opportunity to participate in Stage 5: On-Camera Filmmaker Interviews.  Stage 5 showcases their films through MovieMaker magazine and a vast online distribution network so that viewers around the world can access their interviews on new episodes each month and gain valuable insight and education into the creative process of filmmaking."
  achievable_goal: "Implementing our project within the next twelve months is absolutely an achievable goal because we're already doing it--just on a smaller scale than we'd like to be.\r\n\r\nIn the seven years since its formation, The NewFilmmakers Los Angeles Monthly Screening Series viewership and budget has consistently increased by nearly 30 percent annually.  NFMLA has screened over 750 films from 43 countries, highlighting local and international films that have won awards at Sundance, the Oscars, the Student Oscars, and been picked up for distribution by companies like Focus Features, PBS, Showtime, MTV, and more.\r\n\r\nUnlike many nonprofits, we've consistently adapted very well to major growth spurts and have built ourselves to never become entirely reliant on any single source of funding."
  major_challenges: "One major barrier that we always face in trying to screen films that come from directors and writers from a diverse array of backgrounds is the unfortunate fact that most minority groups are drastically underrepresented in the film industry right now. As such, the vast majority of submissions that we receive are from heterosexual, white, cisgendered male filmmakers. Even though we've made a huge priority of providing more opportunities and representation for minority filmmakers (via our partnerships and by making a habit of consistently showing a much larger portion of films from minority directors than any other festival our size), we would love to receive more film submissions from minority directors.\r\n\r\nFortunately, this grant would allow us to do more targeted outreach in these communities, provide workshops for them, and grant more low-income film submission fee waivers and yearly memberships to the Monthly Screening Series. We plan to keep doing everything in our power in this arena until the pool of filmmakers in LA is as diverse as the populace at large.\r\n\r\nAnother challenge comes in the form of travel. Screening international films is a huge priority of ours, and we pride ourselves as having shown movies from over 43 countries all over the globe. However, this can be very difficult for us in terms of attendance. Because of travel costs, only about half of our international directors are currently able to travel to our monthly screening events and rarely other cast or crewmembers. We've courted airline sponsors to assist with this but nothing has panned out yet. This is a big problem because it limits the amount of intercultural exchange we're able to provide both our audience and filmmakers. However, with a grant of this magnitude, we would be able to set aside $10,000 as a fund to fly low-income filmmakers out to our events."
  competition: >-
    There's no organization in Los Angeles or elsewhere that is exactly like us,
    but the closest comparisons are Film Independent and We Make Movies. Both of
    these organizations are similar to us in terms of their mission to support
    independent filmmakers, but they do so in a different vein. Film Independent
    hosts irregular screenings, but only for members and the films they play are
    nearly always films that already have major distribution or are "classic"
    movies. We Make Movies does events and makes shorts for online viral
    display, but does not usually host screenings--neither organization has a
    monthly screening series. The work that we do is absolutely complimentary to
    that of these organizations and not at all competitive, since we serve
    filmmakers of different levels in different ways. We've even worked with
    both organizations to co-present films and events on a number of occasions
    and are proud to say that these collaborations have been fruitful on both
    sides--and most of all for the communities we're serving.
  cost: "$100,000 will go a long way towards allowing us to greater serve the citizens of Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nIn terms of additional operating costs, NFMLA has been able to maintain a consistent stream of support for our current program's yearly expenses ($175,150) through generous contributions from our constituents, filmmakers, sponsors and many civic organizations throughout Los Angeles, such as the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce and FilmLA. Through the funding we have received from these sources we have been able to successfully maintain our program while steadily growing.  Revenue specifically includes: public and private grants, event ticket sales, film submission fees, yearly membership purchases, donations, and corporate sponsorship from such sources as: SAG-AFTRA, Wells Fargo, Revelry Event Design, FilmLA, Mole Richardson Company, LA Weekly, and Sony Pictures Entertainment."
  budget: "NewFilmmakers Los Angeles specifically requests $100,000 from LA2020 to: cover the initial $25,000 salary of two new full-time staff members to do outreach to all underserved populations and communities of Los Angeles, use $15,000 of these funds to provide workshops and other educational programming to these populations, supplement filmmaker outreach costs of $10,000, expand On Location with $10,000, establish a $10,000 fund to fly low-income international filmmakers to our events so as to greater promote cultural exchange, as well as a $5,000 fund to allow submission fee waivers for low-income filmmakers and ticket waivers to low-income audience members.\r\n\r\nOur accountant, a 3rd party C.P.A., is responsible for all of our bookkeeping, which is also thoroughly examined by our Executive Director, Larry Laboe, and Board Treasurer, Steven J.  Wolfe, as an ethical failsafe. We keep very thorough records of our finances and pride ourselves on fiscal transparency.  Please feel free to call us anytime at your convenience with any budgetary questions you may have about NewFilmmakers Los Angeles; we welcome questions or visits from auditors."

Our other screenings serve 25,000+ patrons annually in the greater Los Angeles area, and we additionally reach 55,920 subscribers on our email list and 9,555 via Facebook and other social media. Inexpensive ticket pricing ($5 for a single program) allows us to serve a vast array of socioeconomic groups, and our culturally rich programming draws a racially diverse audience, with 41% of our constituents Caucasian, 15% Black, 18% Latino, 8% Asian, 3% Middle Eastern and 13% other.\r\n\r\nWith the funds for outreach that a grant of this magnitude can provide, the amount of Angelinos we can benefit is potentially limitless."

      We strongly support collaboration, please tell us a little more about your
      partnership.
    answer: "NFMLA has a longstanding history of collaborating with other organizations to achieve our shared goal of advancing LA arts and culture. Such collaborations include co-presentations of: two yearly panels with Women in Film, one yearly panel with AFCI Locations Show, the LA Student Media Film Festival with Paul Krekorian, the 57th Assembly District Student Digital Media Competition with Ian Calderon, an LA Harbor International Film Festival shorts showcase, four short film Summer Poolside Screening Series events at the Standard, and respective separate feature film screenings with the Indian Film Festival of Los Angeles, LA EigaFest, AFI Film Fest, and LA Film Festival.  Other partners include: the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences, Film Independent, We Make Movies, FilmBreak, Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, Free Arts for Abused Children, the National Hispanic Media Convention, Japan Film Society, and the Consulates of Finland, Hungary and New Zealand.  Most recently, we collaborated with NUVOtv to debut three stunning Latino-driven film programs before presenting them to an audience of millions on NUVOtv’s Nu Point of View program—a magnificent opportunity for any up-and-coming independent filmmaker.\r\n\r\nBetween so many global partnerships and the fact that we bring and showcase international filmmakers to the city on a monthly basis, NewFilmmakers has made promoting a diverse, international presence in LA a top priority.  It is for these reasons that the Hollywood Arts Council is honoring us with a Cinema Arts Award this year to celebrate outstanding contributions of merit to Hollywood and its arts."

    answer: "The best way to measure success for an organization like ours is by looking at how well we're able to serve the people our organization is dedicated to. As such, three simple metrics will allow us to measure our successes in growing our core programming.\r\n\r\nThe first is how well we're able to serve our audience. The most obvious way to measure success here is by numbers--if we can consistently grow our audience, then it means that expose more Angelinos to arts and cultural content. With support of this magnitude, I believe it could be possible for us to double the amount of people we serve.\r\n\r\nHowever, it's not only important for us to merely increase quantity of patrons we serve, but also the quality of what we're serving to them. To best serve our audience, it's imperative that we show an even greater selection of international films so that we can expose them to more global culture and to better assess and meet their needs in terms of types of content to engage with.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to our second metric: communities supported. This year, NewFilmmakers Los Angeles set two goals: to better support the Latino Film community of LA and the female-identified filmmakers of LA. We're proud to say that we have already met the first by partnering with NUVOtv to regularly provide three excellent Latino film programs and distribute them on global television and that we are well on our way to accomplishing the second by partnering with Women in Film.\r\n\r\nWith more funding, we could better support even more minority film communities: the Black film community, the Indigenous Peoples' film community, the Asian film community, the GLBTQ film community, etc. As such, the second metric by which we would measure success will be in amount of additional events, workshops, and outreach that we are able to provide for audiences and filmmakers of these communities.\r\n\r\nThe final--and perhaps most obvious--way that we can measure success as we grow as an organization is in terms of opportunities for our filmmakers. How many opportunities are we able to provide to our filmmakers? Can we provide better opportunities for them? Can we get more people to see their films? How can we better highlight their accomplishments? Can we plan more workshops to help filmmakers build their skillsets? If we can better serve our filmmakers by further improving in these areas, then we will have accomplished our third goal."
  - name: two_lessons
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "The two major lessons that informed our project is the importance of audience and press/publicity for a filmmaker.\r\n\r\nRegarding audience, the NFMLA Monthly Screening Series was created to help provide exposure for the kind of insightful new voices in independent cinema that weren’t being well served by other outlets. These films would often premiere at prestigious festivals, but struggle to gain an audience there due to being  programmed simultaneously to larger studio films with big marketing budgets and name talent. Our monthly screening series circumvents this by avoiding concurrent programming, and inexpensive all-night tickets means that the bigger films we screen instead help the smaller films by drawing more of an audience to a larger event with films of all sizes.\r\n\r\nAfter each month’s screening, filmmakers are given the opportunity to participate in Stage 5: On-Camera Filmmaker Interviews.  Stage 5 showcases their films through MovieMaker magazine and a vast online distribution network so that viewers around the world can access their interviews on new episodes each month and gain valuable insight and education into the creative process of filmmaking."
  - name: achievable_goal
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Implementing our project within the next twelve months is absolutely an achievable goal because we're already doing it--just on a smaller scale than we'd like to be.\r\n\r\nIn the seven years since its formation, The NewFilmmakers Los Angeles Monthly Screening Series viewership and budget has consistently increased by nearly 30 percent annually.  NFMLA has screened over 750 films from 43 countries, highlighting local and international films that have won awards at Sundance, the Oscars, the Student Oscars, and been picked up for distribution by companies like Focus Features, PBS, Showtime, MTV, and more.\r\n\r\nUnlike many nonprofits, we've consistently adapted very well to major growth spurts and have built ourselves to never become entirely reliant on any single source of funding."
  - name: major_challenges
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "One major barrier that we always face in trying to screen films that come from directors and writers from a diverse array of backgrounds is the unfortunate fact that most minority groups are drastically underrepresented in the film industry right now. As such, the vast majority of submissions that we receive are from heterosexual, white, cisgendered male filmmakers. Even though we've made a huge priority of providing more opportunities and representation for minority filmmakers (via our partnerships and by making a habit of consistently showing a much larger portion of films from minority directors than any other festival our size), we would love to receive more film submissions from minority directors.\r\n\r\nFortunately, this grant would allow us to do more targeted outreach in these communities, provide workshops for them, and grant more low-income film submission fee waivers and yearly memberships to the Monthly Screening Series. We plan to keep doing everything in our power in this arena until the pool of filmmakers in LA is as diverse as the populace at large.\r\n\r\nAnother challenge comes in the form of travel. Screening international films is a huge priority of ours, and we pride ourselves as having shown movies from over 43 countries all over the globe. However, this can be very difficult for us in terms of attendance. Because of travel costs, only about half of our international directors are currently able to travel to our monthly screening events and rarely other cast or crewmembers. We've courted airline sponsors to assist with this but nothing has panned out yet. This is a big problem because it limits the amount of intercultural exchange we're able to provide both our audience and filmmakers. However, with a grant of this magnitude, we would be able to set aside $10,000 as a fund to fly low-income filmmakers out to our events."
  - name: competition
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: >-
      There's no organization in Los Angeles or elsewhere that is exactly like
      us, but the closest comparisons are Film Independent and We Make Movies.
      Both of these organizations are similar to us in terms of their mission to
      support independent filmmakers, but they do so in a different vein. Film
      Independent hosts irregular screenings, but only for members and the films
      they play are nearly always films that already have major distribution or
      are "classic" movies. We Make Movies does events and makes shorts for
      online viral display, but does not usually host screenings--neither
      organization has a monthly screening series. The work that we do is
      absolutely complimentary to that of these organizations and not at all
      competitive, since we serve filmmakers of different levels in different
      ways. We've even worked with both organizations to co-present films and
      events on a number of occasions and are proud to say that these
      collaborations have been fruitful on both sides--and most of all for the
      communities we're serving.

    answer: "$100,000 will go a long way towards allowing us to greater serve the citizens of Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nIn terms of additional operating costs, NFMLA has been able to maintain a consistent stream of support for our current program's yearly expenses ($175,150) through generous contributions from our constituents, filmmakers, sponsors and many civic organizations throughout Los Angeles, such as the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce and FilmLA. Through the funding we have received from these sources we have been able to successfully maintain our program while steadily growing.  Revenue specifically includes: public and private grants, event ticket sales, film submission fees, yearly membership purchases, donations, and corporate sponsorship from such sources as: SAG-AFTRA, Wells Fargo, Revelry Event Design, FilmLA, Mole Richardson Company, LA Weekly, and Sony Pictures Entertainment."
