Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  NewFilmmakers Los Angeles is requesting funds to aid us in expanding our core
  programming—NFMLA’s Monthly Screening Series, and On Location: the Los Angeles
  Video Project—and in doing so help us to greater promote cultural exchange by
  using film to ignite critical dialogue, promote global understanding and
  create film jobs and events in the Los Angeles area.
   
   Currently, NewFilmmakers LA manages to accomplish everything it does with a staff of only five—four of whom are part-time employees or on retainer, and only one of whom is full-time. The additional support provided by an expansion grant will allow us more resources, manpower and energy to continue the steady path of growth that NFMLA has maintained throughout the years. In expanding On Location, the NFMLA Monthly Screening Series and the rest of our core programming, we can provide important cultural and career opportunities to a wider net of communities in Los Angeles.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Since its inception, NewFilmmakers Los Angeles has dedicated itself towards
  making Los Angeles the best possible place to create films and experience film
  culture. NFMLA's core programs were designed to promote cultural exchange in
  LA by exposing the powerful, young talent behind important local and global
  cinema to a hungry audience—and vice versa.
   
   Our other core program aside from the Monthly Screening Series, On Location: The Los Angeles Video Project is about to celebrate its fourth anniversary as the first community outreach multimedia program that celebrates LA by enlisting its remarkable pool of filmmakers to make films about the city. On Location was largely founded as a means of helping to fight the current massive production exodus in California. The program serves LA not only by providing an outlet for its filmmakers to share their insider perspectives of this diverse cosmopolitan environment, but also by creating production opportunities for local residents on these shoots, and yielding a vibrant crop of short films that maintain and further Hollywood’s status as the world’s filmmaking capital.
   
   The Monthly Screening Series also achieves these goals by reserving half of each program for local films and offering a large discount to submitting local filmmakers if their movie was filmed in the area. NFMLA further encourages local film production by co-planning the California Locations Conference with the California Film Commission, presenting a Filming in LA Panel with FilmLA and LAPPG, and hosting the PGA’s Weekend Shorts Filmmaking Program.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Over twenty local films are made through the On Location program each year and
  premier to an audience of 500. Our other screenings serve 25,000+ patrons
  annually in the greater Los Angeles area, and we additionally reach 55,920
  subscribers on our email list and 9,555 via Facebook and other social media.
  Inexpensive ticket pricing ($5 for a single program) allows us to serve a vast
  array of socioeconomic groups, and our culturally rich programming draws a
  racially diverse audience, with 41% of our constituents Caucasian, 15% Black,
  18% Latino, 8% Asian, 3% Middle Eastern and 13% other.
   
   With the funds for outreach that a grant of this magnitude can provide, the amount of Angelinos we can benefit is potentially limitless.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  NFMLA has a longstanding history of collaborating with other organizations to
  achieve our shared goal of advancing LA arts and culture. Such collaborations
  include co-presentations of: two yearly panels with Women in Film, one yearly
  panel with AFCI Locations Show, the LA Student Media Film Festival with Paul
  Krekorian, the 57th Assembly District Student Digital Media Competition with
  Ian Calderon, an LA Harbor International Film Festival shorts showcase, four
  short film Summer Poolside Screening Series events at the Standard, and
  respective separate feature film screenings with the Indian Film Festival of
  Los Angeles, LA EigaFest, AFI Film Fest, and LA Film Festival. Other partners
  include: the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences, Film Independent, We
  Make Movies, FilmBreak, Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, Free Arts for Abused
  Children, the National Hispanic Media Convention, Japan Film Society, and the
  Consulates of Finland, Hungary and New Zealand. Most recently, we collaborated
  with NUVOtv to debut three stunning Latino-driven film programs before
  presenting them to an audience of millions on NUVOtv’s Nu Point of View
  program—a magnificent opportunity for any up-and-coming independent filmmaker.
   
   Between so many global partnerships and the fact that we bring and showcase international filmmakers to the city on a monthly basis, NewFilmmakers has made promoting a diverse, international presence in LA a top priority. It is for these reasons that the Hollywood Arts Council is honoring us with a Cinema Arts Award this year to celebrate outstanding contributions of merit to Hollywood and its arts.
