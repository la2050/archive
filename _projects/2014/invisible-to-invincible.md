  Sustainable Little Tokyo has a clear implementation plan with the support of
  the two-year national Target Cities pilot program to explore this brand new
  concept. We have built a coalition of local stakeholders and organizations,
  national resource partners, and public sector agencies. With capacity led by
  the Little Tokyo Community Council and our partners, we are recruiting
  volunteers to participate in research, arts and cultural activities, and civic
  engagement.
   
   Our innovative community-driven vision for Little Tokyo has gained national attention. Little Tokyo accepted an invitation to take part in the Clinton Global Initiatives-backed Target Cities pilot program – a two-year program of EcoDistricts, a national non-profit based in Portland Oregon that works to “amplify and accelerate district-scale community regeneration and create replicable models for next-generation urban revitalization” (EcoDistricts).
   
   As a grassroots, community-driven project, LTCC has created a Task Force, open to public participation, and a smaller Steering Committee working group. This structure provides a venue for community input and engagement to help shape the Cultural EcoDistrict concept, goals, and activities. Three work areas - Real Estate and Built Environment, Educational Initiatives and Community Engagement, and Arts and Culture – are defining tangible projects and outcomes for this two year initial workplan.
   
   These projects include pilot demonstration projects of cutting edge green infrastructure such as district stormwater retention and infiltration, district heating and cooling, "living machine" graywater filtration, landscaping, and a mini-solar electric grid. We are looking at enhanced green space, energy efficient buildings, and increasing walkability with complete and green streets. We are also engaging businesses and residents to implement water and energy efficiency measures, strengthening their bottom lines and household disposable incomes.
   
   We also seek to shift the behavior of the community in a way that resonates with community values. The Japanese concept of 'mottainai', which roughly translates out to ‘what a waste to shame’ or ‘too precious to waste’ is already a common cultural value in the community. We are taking the idea of 'mottainai' and using it to connect and engage the community to the work of Sustainable Little Tokyo, and exploring related arts and cultural programming.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Sustainable Little Tokyo is not just about creating a cultural ecodistrict in
  Little Tokyo, but also developing a framework for sustainability that can be
  replicated by other communities, neighborhoods, and cities. Through our
  groundbreaking approach that combines green infrastructure and initiatives
  with community organizing, arts and cultural productions, just and equitable
  economic development, we offer a model for other neighborhoods seeking long
  term economic, social, and environmental sustainability.
   
   As concerns over climate change continue to mount, global cities like Los Angeles must innovate policy, financing, infrastructure, and collaborative governance that reduces our carbon footprint and dependence on imported water and energy. We can also simultaneously improve public health outcomes, strengthen our local economies, and celebrate our rich cultural diversity. However, this future will take a tremendous amount of work, collaboration across many sectors, and leverage dwindling public resources with private capital investment. 
   
   We believe the Los Angeles of 2050 will have become a greener, healthier region one neighborhood at a time. We are just the first in what can be a network of interconnected neighborhood laboratories to discover new solutions, inspire future generations, and connect to our neighbors and our histories. 
   
   Neighborhoods along the Los Angeles River, along emerging transit corridors, and all throughout the region are struggling with questions and fears of gentrification and displacement. Without clear demonstrations and equitable public policy, Los Angeles just might tip back in the reverse direction of increasing greenhouse gas emissions, vehicle miles travelled, rising rents, and lost opportunities.
   
   At the neighborhood scale, the right approach can start to achieve the multiple benefits we are aiming for. Through district-scaled infrastructure, we can achieve water and energy efficiencies of 30-50% better than baseline. Businesses can join together with marketing and visibility as going green, saving money and attracting new customers. Residents and community members can come together and engage one another to share ideas about healthy living, saving resources, and improving their quality of life. Through the Little Tokyo Cultural Ecodistrict, we hope to demonstrate that we can accelerate the process of achieving the Los Angeles of 2050.

  Like Little Tokyo itself, Sustainable Little Tokyo is both specific and broad,
  with overlapping layers. While there are direct benefits for those that live
  and work here, Sustainable Little Tokyo also serves the broader community and
  Los Angeles.
   
   At its most immediate, Sustainable Little Tokyo benefits Little Tokyo stakeholders – businesses, residents, nonprofits, tourists, and other community members. In building this Cultural Ecodistrict - with tangible environmental sustainability targets while retaining our historic and cultural context - we are working towards a future that preserves our sense of community, culture, and neighborhood while placing us squarely in the future of innovative environmental developments. By making our neighborhood greener, we make the lives of our residents, businesses, workers, and visitors healthier and vibrant. By preserving our cultural and historic roots, while focusing on the economic health of our community and in particular, small family-owned businesses, we maintain our distinct community identity.
   
   Because Little Tokyo holds a significant role and space in the larger Japanese American and Asian American communities, these broader communities will also benefit. Recognizing that Little Tokyo is more of a symbolic home than a residential home to most of the Japanese American community, there nonetheless remains a sense of urgency to maintain the community for future generations. Indeed, Sustainable Little Tokyo it is rooted in long-held cultural and community values passed down from generation to generation. We have integrated fundamental community values like 'Mottainai' (what a shame to waste), 'Kodomono tameni; (for future generations), and 'Banbutsu' (interconnectedness) into a contemporary environmental context.
   
   Sustainable Little Tokyo and the concept of a cultural ecodistrict is also something that benefits the entire city, region, and even the nation. Our groundbreaking and pioneering work can serve as a model to other neighborhoods, the city, and all across the country. Already public agencies have seen how Little Tokyo can serve as a place to pilot innovative projects that can be replicated across the region. Because the conditions of gentrification, development, and transportation planning in Little Tokyo are issues that are mirrored in marginalized communities across the greater Los Angeles region, we hope to create a model of sustainability in all the ways for communities to use for themselves.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  The Little Tokyo Community Council is working with exceptional partners and
  collaborators. This project began with a small core of partner organizations
  developing a sustainability plan for Little Tokyo. It has grown to a
  cross-sectoral collaboration encompassing local community organizations and
  national resource partners.
    
   While many member organizations of the Little Tokyo Community Council are actively participating in this initiative, organizations providing committed key leadership include the Japanese American Cultural and Community Center, Kizuna, and Great Leap. These organizations provide deep cultural roots, a large and growing base of support throughout Los Angeles County, and staff and volunteer capacity.
    
   From the community development field, we are working with confirmed partners such as LTSC Community Development Corporation, Enterprise Community Partners, NeighborWorks America, the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, and the Low Income Investment Fund. These partners bring sophisticated understanding of real estate development and finance, equity and affordability, and capacity building. 
    
   From the environmental sector, our confirmed partners include Ecodistricts, the Natural Resources Defense Council, Global Green USA. These partners bring expertise around climate change, sustainability planning, and green technology.
