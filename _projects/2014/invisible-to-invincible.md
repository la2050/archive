    The youth we serve commonly share their feelings of invisibility, isolation,
    and insignificance and generally don’t have a positive vision for themselves
    or their future. In spite of this, they express a desire to use their
    experiences to create social change and improve their communities. The
    Invisible to Invincible campaign utilizes positive youth development,
    leadership activities, and internships to create change. By providing an
    opportunity for youth to engage in, and lead, this campaign, Jovenes is
    creating an innovative and effective model for engagement with homeless
    youth that taps into their resiliency and capacity for personal growth,
    permanent change, and invincibility.
  implement: "There are three main objectives for the Invisible to Invincible Campaign: 1) Political/Community change regarding the four challenges identified in our research & policy report, 2) increasing awareness & support for homeless youth within our community and neighbors, and 3) personal transformation for program participants. As Jovenes continues to expand our housing capacity, we also seek to identify and address policies and systems that push youth into homelessness or which contribute to the challenges they face as they seek to move their lives forward. \r\n\r\nOur youth recently made a documentary entitled “From Invisible to Invincible” which tells powerful stories of how they became homeless and highlights their resilience. The Invisible to Invincible Campaign will utilize this film, along with our research and policy report, to educate our community and empower our youth to create change. Currently, Jovenes is offering three types of internships within this campaign:\r\n\r\n1.\tInvisible to Invincible Interns: raise awareness of youth homelessness in our Los Angeles, and advocate for potential solutions. In addition, interns will work with Jovenes staff to develop and coordinate new tools and activities to assist our clients and youth in our community overcome their personal cycles of homelessness and access the necessary resources for a better future. These interns also lead presentations and screenings of the Jovenes documentary. \r\n2.\tPeer Healthcare Ambassadors: Obtaining health coverage is a priority for homeless youth, but navigating the healthcare system presents a constant challenge. Through partnerships with agencies that specialize in healthcare enrollment, Jovenes is able to create internship opportunities where our youth become trained in healthcare promotion and conduct youth focused outreach and education activities to help other youth receive the care they need. \r\n3.\tSocial Media Ambassadors: Create content through blogs, Facebook, and Twitter to create awareness for the Invisible to Invincible Campaign and the challenges faced by homeless youth. "
  impact_live: "This project has a chance to change the way LA sees and understands youth homelessness, and the ways homeless youth view themselves. By creating powerful content utilizing research, program-based data, and storytelling and utilizing the reach of social media, creative presentations, and strong partnerships, the #Invisible2Invincible campaign has the potential to help prioritize homeless youth as a population which needs every opportunity to succeed.   \r\nThe young men housed at Jovenes come from a very diverse set of backgrounds and have many reasons why they are experiencing homelessness. We see youth who have recently immigrated to the US, youth recently released from jail, youth who have been institutionalized through the foster care system, LGBTQ youth who have been pushed out of their homes, youth with mental disabilities, youth leaving gangs, and a variety of ethnicities \r\nDespite their differences, the youth (especially those who choose to participate in the #Invisible2Invincible Campaign) learn to see through what typically sets them apart and understand how to come together. Through Jovenes, youth learn that homelessness is just an experience that they are going through- it doesn’t define them or limit their dreams. This lesson exemplified in how youth begin to support one another, provide encouragement, and celebrate each other’s successes. Each of the youth has experienced times when they have been put down or made to feel invisible. By working together to tap into their inherent resiliency and strengths, they begin to feel Invincible and learn how to overcome their challenges in a positive and productive way.\r\nIn addition to changing the narrative and raising awareness for homeless youth, this campaign can also make LA a healthier place to live today and in 2050 by advocating for increased permanent housing and ensuring at-risk and homeless youth have access to healthcare. Through Jovenes’ growing Continuum of Care, which is expanding to over 70 units of housing (including short-term shelter, permanent supportive housing, affordable housing, and subsidized rental units), we will be able to showcase the various ways our city can end youth homelessness through public/private partnerships. By creating youth-friendly healthcare outreach materials & presentations, this campaign can make the process for youth to enroll in healthcare a less daunting and more accessible opportunity. "
  who_benefit: "On any given night, there are over 5,000 youth experiencing homelessness on the streets of Los Angeles. In the public schools surrounding Jovenes, we have learned that there are over 1,000 students who face housing instability. Although the youth we serve come from diverse backgrounds, common barriers to a stable future are found throughout our target population. The findings in our Research and Policy Report, titled From the Fringes - Understanding Homelessness Transition Age Youth in Inner City Los Angeles. This report identified four main challenges faced by homeless youth, which we are addressing through the campaign: \r\n1.\tBarriers to safe, supportive, and affordable housing\r\n2.\tChallenges accessing basic benefits and health services\r\n3.\tBarriers to educational, professional, and economic development \r\n4.\tOvercoming trauma and emotional illiteracy.\r\n\r\nThe membership base for the campaign primarily comes from the young men Jovenes serves in our shelter programs and youth who have exited homelessness and moved into permanent housing. When working with homeless youth, we see that providing small stipends recognizes the immediate needs of our youth and values the commitment they make to this project. In addition, Jovenes will continue to work with partners and volunteers to create storytelling projects featuring the youth we serve in order to highlight their stories, raise awareness, and improve our youth’s sense and vision of themselves through art.\r\n\r\nThrough this campaign, Jovenes seeks to provide internships and leadership development activities to approximately 20 youth each year. All youth are between the ages of 18-25, are currently or have recently experienced homelessness, and are predominantly Latino and African-American. We seek to have a broad impact through this campaign that could potentially benefit the thousands of youth who experience homelessness in Los Angeles each year."
  partners_collaboration: "In March 2014, the Invisible to Invincible Campaign began operating out of the brand new Wellness Center at the LAC+USC General Hospital, where we are able to engage in close partnership and youth development practices with the fifteen other organizations that are co-located at this facility. Basing these internships and activities out of the Wellness Center provides youth with valuable work experience in a professional setting. \r\nEngaging with partners will be key to the success of the Invisible to Invincible Campaign. Partnerships are critical to advance our policy/systems change agenda, create additional opportunities for youth, and create storytelling projects. The following are key confirmed organizations and partners whom Jovenes is collaborating with to move this project forward:\r\n1.\tWellness Center organizations\r\n2.\tBuilding Healthy Communities- Boyle Heights (includes over 40 Boyle Heights based non-profits)\r\n3.\tCorporation for Supportive Housing\r\n4.\tDepartment of Mental Health/Housing Institute\r\n5.\tThe Los Angeles Coalition to End Youth Homelessness\r\n6.\tBoyle Heights Coalition for a Safe and Drug-Free Community\r\n7.\tArt Center College of Design\r\n8.\tAdvancing Justice LA\r\n9.\tBoyle Heights Technology Youth Center/Youth Opportunity Movement\r\n10.\tBrothers, Sons, Selves Collaborative for Boys & Young Men of Color"

  evaluate: "This program will be evaluated by the number of internship opportunities Jovenes is able to create, the number of youth Jovenes is able to connect to leadership and storytelling activities, and our ability to affect policy and systems change. A major challenge is operating this campaign is its uniqueness; it is very rare for homeless youth to be engaged in this manner. As youth are participating in these internships, they are still working on a personal level to overcome the challenges associated with homelessness.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Jovenes will utilize the data we collect through our housing programs to contribute to the conversations and knowledge about best practices for helping youth permanently exit homelessness. Over the last three years, Jovenes has tripled our capacity by creating permanent housing. We’re using a mix of public funding, private financing, effective partnerships, and innovative program design to offer youth multiple forms of permanent housing that are flexible enough to meet their needs and various challenges. \r\n\r\nLearning from our data is critically important to improving our services. As the organization continues to grow, we are seeking to ensure that the data and information we collect from our youth can be used to better understand the unique challenges faced by our population, and institute best practices to quickly move them into permanent housing.  Unfortunately, data about the overall effectiveness of housing programs for homeless youth in LA is not widely available. That’s why Jovenes is partnering with organizations like the Corporation for Supportive Housing and the LA Coalition to End Youth Homelessness to develop better sets of data and metrics so we can have a better measurement for evaluation across the city, and organize a more comprehensive Homeless Youth Point-In-Time count in January 2015 which will produce more accurate data.. We seek to be a major contributor in the development of metrics and evaluation tools that will help our community continue to improve services for homeless youth. "
  two_lessons: "1)\tPermanent Housing is the only way to end homelessness. For the first 20 years that Jovenes has been around, we were only able to offer short-term shelter programs to our youth. It’s unrealistic to expect homeless youth who have gone through so many traumas to turn their lives around in 90 days, or even 8 months. It didn’t provide our youth with enough time and support to recover, increase their self-confidence, build trusting relationships, visualize their goals, and put in place a plan of action. We also learned from emerging best practices and were noticing the shift in federal policies that are really emphasizing permanent housing over shelter services. It was our moment to make strategic decisions that would provide our agency with the best opportunity to grow, and provide our youth with the best opportunities to succeed.\r\n2)\tIt takes more than housing to help youth successfully end their personal cycles of homelessness. Bringing our youth into this campaign not only allows Jovenes to put a face on the issues surrounding youth homelessness, but is also a powerful tool to empower our youth to live successful and independent lives. We encourage our youth to think of themselves as leaders and our process is geared to bring out their voice, increase their confidence & connectedness, and become independent. To develop leadership, Jovenes creates opportunities for engagement through paid internships. A critical challenge and need for our youth is to gain work experience and develop financial independence."
  achievable_goal: "The Invisible to Invincible Campaign is an on-going project that started in March 2014. Support from LA 2050 will supercharge this initiative and take our public awareness efforts to the next level. Jovenes seeks to continually hire and train interns to participate in this campaign and staff the Wellness Center office. Goals for the campaign are to hold screenings of the documentary From Invisible to Invincible at least twice per month, as well as organize events and forums on topics that are related to this campaign (such as a healthcare forum targeting at-risk youth to help and encourage them to obtain healthcare).  \r\n•\tMarch 2014- Open Wellness Center Office\r\n•\tApril 2014- Hire 1st round of interns\r\n•\tMay-September 2014- Hold community meetings and presentations \r\n•\tOctober 2014- TAY Healthcare Convening \r\n•\tNovember  2014- Hire 2nd round of Interns\r\n•\tNovember 2014- August 2015 continue campaign/internship activities, hold community meetings and presentations.\r\n"
  major_challenges: "1) Ensuring consistent participation from youth Interns: \r\nHomeless youth face constant instability. They are in a position where they must look out for their futures by focusing on employment and income development. As a result, taking on an internship oftentimes presents a conflict with their other priorities, such as searching for full-time jobs, applying for benefits which they are eligible for, receiving counseling, and overcoming the trauma of homelessness. By providing stipends to youth interns, we are able to develop a manageable works schedule, provide a financial incentive, and support youth in their pathway of personal growth. \r\n\r\n2)\tChallenging the stereotypes:\r\nThere is little widespread knowledge about homeless youth in LA, but there are common stereotypes that this population chooses to be homeless, is lazy, and that they do not make positive contributions to our society. This campaign can directly confront those stereotypes and misconceptions by showcasing the resilience of this population, highlighting their personal growth, creating understanding of their challenges, and displaying how they contribute through employment, volunteerism, and empowerment. In addition, ending youth homelessness is a public benefit that reduces costs associated with incarceration, healthcare, and emergency services. "
  competition: >-
    There are many organizations that do great work serving homeless youth in
    LA, but Jovenes is quickly becoming a regional hub for homeless TAY in Boyle
    Heights/East LA. Over the last three years, the number of youth we serve has
    grown and the population has diversified; our shifting demographics are
    showing less unaccompanied immigrant youth and more youth from Los Angeles
    County, more African-American youth, and more youth with mental
    disabilities.
  cost: >-
    This campaign will cost $250,000 over the next year. We are covering the
    additional costs by leveraging this application with secured grants from The
    California Endowment and the Dwight Stewart Youth Fund.

  Sustainable Little Tokyo has a clear implementation plan with the support of
  the two-year national Target Cities pilot program to explore this brand new
  concept. We have built a coalition of local stakeholders and organizations,
  national resource partners, and public sector agencies. With capacity led by
  the Little Tokyo Community Council and our partners, we are recruiting
  volunteers to participate in research, arts and cultural activities, and civic
  engagement.
   
   Our innovative community-driven vision for Little Tokyo has gained national attention. Little Tokyo accepted an invitation to take part in the Clinton Global Initiatives-backed Target Cities pilot program – a two-year program of EcoDistricts, a national non-profit based in Portland Oregon that works to “amplify and accelerate district-scale community regeneration and create replicable models for next-generation urban revitalization” (EcoDistricts).
   
   As a grassroots, community-driven project, LTCC has created a Task Force, open to public participation, and a smaller Steering Committee working group. This structure provides a venue for community input and engagement to help shape the Cultural EcoDistrict concept, goals, and activities. Three work areas - Real Estate and Built Environment, Educational Initiatives and Community Engagement, and Arts and Culture – are defining tangible projects and outcomes for this two year initial workplan.
   
   These projects include pilot demonstration projects of cutting edge green infrastructure such as district stormwater retention and infiltration, district heating and cooling, "living machine" graywater filtration, landscaping, and a mini-solar electric grid. We are looking at enhanced green space, energy efficient buildings, and increasing walkability with complete and green streets. We are also engaging businesses and residents to implement water and energy efficiency measures, strengthening their bottom lines and household disposable incomes.
   
   We also seek to shift the behavior of the community in a way that resonates with community values. The Japanese concept of 'mottainai', which roughly translates out to ‘what a waste to shame’ or ‘too precious to waste’ is already a common cultural value in the community. We are taking the idea of 'mottainai' and using it to connect and engage the community to the work of Sustainable Little Tokyo, and exploring related arts and cultural programming.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Sustainable Little Tokyo is not just about creating a cultural ecodistrict in
  Little Tokyo, but also developing a framework for sustainability that can be
  replicated by other communities, neighborhoods, and cities. Through our
  groundbreaking approach that combines green infrastructure and initiatives
  with community organizing, arts and cultural productions, just and equitable
  economic development, we offer a model for other neighborhoods seeking long
  term economic, social, and environmental sustainability.
   
   As concerns over climate change continue to mount, global cities like Los Angeles must innovate policy, financing, infrastructure, and collaborative governance that reduces our carbon footprint and dependence on imported water and energy. We can also simultaneously improve public health outcomes, strengthen our local economies, and celebrate our rich cultural diversity. However, this future will take a tremendous amount of work, collaboration across many sectors, and leverage dwindling public resources with private capital investment. 
   
   We believe the Los Angeles of 2050 will have become a greener, healthier region one neighborhood at a time. We are just the first in what can be a network of interconnected neighborhood laboratories to discover new solutions, inspire future generations, and connect to our neighbors and our histories. 
   
   Neighborhoods along the Los Angeles River, along emerging transit corridors, and all throughout the region are struggling with questions and fears of gentrification and displacement. Without clear demonstrations and equitable public policy, Los Angeles just might tip back in the reverse direction of increasing greenhouse gas emissions, vehicle miles travelled, rising rents, and lost opportunities.
   
   At the neighborhood scale, the right approach can start to achieve the multiple benefits we are aiming for. Through district-scaled infrastructure, we can achieve water and energy efficiencies of 30-50% better than baseline. Businesses can join together with marketing and visibility as going green, saving money and attracting new customers. Residents and community members can come together and engage one another to share ideas about healthy living, saving resources, and improving their quality of life. Through the Little Tokyo Cultural Ecodistrict, we hope to demonstrate that we can accelerate the process of achieving the Los Angeles of 2050.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Like Little Tokyo itself, Sustainable Little Tokyo is both specific and broad,
  with overlapping layers. While there are direct benefits for those that live
  and work here, Sustainable Little Tokyo also serves the broader community and
  Los Angeles.
   
   At its most immediate, Sustainable Little Tokyo benefits Little Tokyo stakeholders – businesses, residents, nonprofits, tourists, and other community members. In building this Cultural Ecodistrict - with tangible environmental sustainability targets while retaining our historic and cultural context - we are working towards a future that preserves our sense of community, culture, and neighborhood while placing us squarely in the future of innovative environmental developments. By making our neighborhood greener, we make the lives of our residents, businesses, workers, and visitors healthier and vibrant. By preserving our cultural and historic roots, while focusing on the economic health of our community and in particular, small family-owned businesses, we maintain our distinct community identity.
   
   Because Little Tokyo holds a significant role and space in the larger Japanese American and Asian American communities, these broader communities will also benefit. Recognizing that Little Tokyo is more of a symbolic home than a residential home to most of the Japanese American community, there nonetheless remains a sense of urgency to maintain the community for future generations. Indeed, Sustainable Little Tokyo it is rooted in long-held cultural and community values passed down from generation to generation. We have integrated fundamental community values like 'Mottainai' (what a shame to waste), 'Kodomono tameni; (for future generations), and 'Banbutsu' (interconnectedness) into a contemporary environmental context.
   
   Sustainable Little Tokyo and the concept of a cultural ecodistrict is also something that benefits the entire city, region, and even the nation. Our groundbreaking and pioneering work can serve as a model to other neighborhoods, the city, and all across the country. Already public agencies have seen how Little Tokyo can serve as a place to pilot innovative projects that can be replicated across the region. Because the conditions of gentrification, development, and transportation planning in Little Tokyo are issues that are mirrored in marginalized communities across the greater Los Angeles region, we hope to create a model of sustainability in all the ways for communities to use for themselves.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  The Little Tokyo Community Council is working with exceptional partners and
  collaborators. This project began with a small core of partner organizations
  developing a sustainability plan for Little Tokyo. It has grown to a
  cross-sectoral collaboration encompassing local community organizations and
  national resource partners.
    
   While many member organizations of the Little Tokyo Community Council are actively participating in this initiative, organizations providing committed key leadership include the Japanese American Cultural and Community Center, Kizuna, and Great Leap. These organizations provide deep cultural roots, a large and growing base of support throughout Los Angeles County, and staff and volunteer capacity.
    
   From the community development field, we are working with confirmed partners such as LTSC Community Development Corporation, Enterprise Community Partners, NeighborWorks America, the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, and the Low Income Investment Fund. These partners bring sophisticated understanding of real estate development and finance, equity and affordability, and capacity building. 
    
   From the environmental sector, our confirmed partners include Ecodistricts, the Natural Resources Defense Council, Global Green USA. These partners bring expertise around climate change, sustainability planning, and green technology.
