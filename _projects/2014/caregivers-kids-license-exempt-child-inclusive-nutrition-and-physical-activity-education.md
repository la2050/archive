  more_detail: "Our effort will address an acknowledged challenge for an already active and effective project in Los Angeles County which has set out to reduce obesity in child care settings by focusing on a specific demographic, the license-exempt caregiver, whose needs are distinct from the caregiver who perceives her/himself as a professional in child care community. \r\n\r\nT&L Foundation for Child Care Information's goal is to boost participation in the health education of license-exempt child care providers by reaching 500 license-exempt caregivers (approximately 1,000 children) with a unique hands on and child inclusive educational and resource giving experience."
  implement: "This authentic learning experience for license-exempt caregivers will address health and wellness topics such as Breastfeeding, Food and Drink, Physical Activity, Screen time and Valuable Community Resources.  \r\n\r\nThe learning experience will:\r\n• not use a powerpoint to teach the curriculum • utilize a format similar to a “mommy and me” class enabling the caregiver to bring the children to the class • perceived as a fun activity instead of a professional development course or training • have hands on elements making it easier for the caregiver to implement with the children at home • designed for the median education obtained by the caregiver • designed to address multi-cultural barriers to a healthy culture • be in a time-frame that is feasible for this demographic • address the varying ages of children that will attend the class with caregiver, and • be in a setting that is easy to access. \r\n\r\nAccording to the First 5 LA report “Families, Friends and Neighbors” there are approximately “590,000 children under age 12 [that] receive care in license exempt settings throughout L.A. County.”  After speaking with representatives from the Choose Health LA Child Care project, we learned this is a key demographic the project is trying to engage and has found that license-exempt participation is a challenge.  \r\n\r\nThe challenge is not because these providers “can’t be found.”  The challenge is messaging and offering an opportunity to learn about nutrition and physical activity in a format that appeals to the license-exempt child care provider.  \r\n\r\nProject Phases:\r\n\r\nPhases: 1) establishing working partnerships with LA County Child Care Resource and Referral agencies and local businesses to assist with outreach, 2) Recruiting - RFP for curriculum, seek coaching volunteers and RFP for Train theTrainer, and secure meeting spaces 3) begin creation and distribution of materials via email/sms, snail mail and local businesses, 4) establish class schedule and open registration, 5) securing supplemental materials for classes, 6) creating pre/post evaluations, 7) give 2 \"test\" classes to invited community members and license-exempt caregivers and assess the feedback - change things if necessary, 8) start classes, 9) ongoing evaluation process."
  impact_live: "Addressing the childhood obesity epidemic, a disease which fuels other chronic conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease, is an essential element to a healthy LA.  By addressing the health culture of children, we effectively address the health culture of our future, in 2050, as the children positively impacted by the education of the caregivers in 2014, take with them the healthy habits established for their lifetime.\r\n\r\nOur project addresses the LA2050 obesity metric by educating license-exempt caregivers who, if they take home, one element of the training and use it, will be creating a healthier present and future for themselves, their families and the children of LA’s future.\r\nAnother metric addressed is lack of access to parkland for Los Angles County children which then compounds the problem of access to physical activity.  Our project will provide physical activity ideas and alternatives to parkland so as another LA2050 grantee works on furnishing LA County with more parks for outside recreation and physical activity, children can get moving now.  Children understanding how to get physical in all types of spaces will be better off in their future as LA2050 residents as well.\r\n\r\nOur project will effectively reduce childhood obesity through education of child caregivers who don’t typically get information and training materials or adhere to regulations, even the minimal ones that licensing requires.\r\n"
  who_benefit: "This project will benefit:\r\n\r\nLicense-exempt caregivers by providing them with an educational environment that works for them.  They will not only learn about providing a healthy culture for the children in their care but will understand why and how to do it, motivating them to carry out at least one new thing learned in one category at home.\r\n\r\nChildren by educating their caregivers about breastfeeding, food and drinks, physical activity and screen time who are not typically exposed to informational material or in educational experiences tailored to their needs.  Children who are cared for by the providers who attend this authentic training will have a better chance of establishing healthy habits to reduce childhood obesity than those who are in the care of license exempt caregivers who have not had the opportunity to participate in the educational experience.\r\n\r\nAlso, as caregivers bring their children to the “mommy and me” formatted class, the older children will have an opportunity to learn and ask questions which then gives them an opportunity to be an active participant in the health culture of their caregivers environment as well as take it home with them to share with parents.\r\n\r\nParents, as caregivers extend the education opportunity to them.  Providers will be encouraged to engage parents in what they learned as they distribute ready-made information from the class as well as simple discussion with the parents about good nutrition, physical activity and the importance of limited screen time.\r\n"
  partners_collaboration: "We do not have confirmation but these are the organizations with which we hope to engage as collaborators.\r\n\r\nChild Care Resource and Referral Agencies\r\n\r\nWe hope to collaborate with the partners of Choose Health LA Child Care.  Choose Health LA Child Care is a program funded by First 5 LA and administered through the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. The Child Care Alliance is coordinating the Choose Health LA Child Care Project due to their long standing relationship with child care providers across the County and expertise in the child care field.  We have had conversations about collaboration but could not determine a scope of work that could be committed to prior to submission of the proposal.\r\n\r\nIn addition to Child Care Alliance of Los Angeles, we would hope to collaborate all LA County Child Care Resource and Referral Agencies as they, too, have relationships with the child care field.  The agencies are: Child Care Resource and Referral, Children’s Home Society of California, Connections for Children, Crystal Stairs, Mexican American Opportunity Foundation, Options, Pathways and Pomona Unified School District.\r\n\r\nPotentially partnering with these R&R organizations would bring with them:\r\n•\tThe connections to the license-exempt providers receiving child          care subsidies.\r\n•\tExpertise regarding the license-exempt child care provider culture\r\n•\tNetwork of potential volunteers to execute elements of the project\r\n•\tAccess to bilingual materials \r\n•\tKnowledge of what does or does not work with the license-exempt child care providers after implementation of current curriculum\r\n\r\n3 factors critical to success of potential collaboration\r\n•\tOutreach to license-exempt child care providers\r\n•\tAssistance in establishing a network of volunteers\r\n•\tConsulting regarding the creation of new curriculum\r\n\r\nWe also intend to reach out to Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) Sponsors for reaching out to license-exempt providers on their programs or seeking out volunteer coaches.\r\n"

  two_lessons: "1)\tThe Growing, Learning Care Project of California, in 2007, shared several lessons learned for supporting license-exempt child care providers.  Along with challenges they also share successful outreach and training strategies which include: \r\na.\tFor outreach: Personal connections, word of mouth,  and community partners to name a few\r\nb.\tFor Training strategies: Play days in the park, playgroups, in-home training and workshops in community settings\r\nc.\tCharacteristics of trainings: simple, informal, interactive, hands on, child focused and linguistically diverse\r\nFrom: (Effective Ways to Reach and Support Family, Friend and Neighbor Care Providers: Lessons Learned from California’s Statewide Initiative, Patty Siegel & Ana M. Fernandez Leon, Webinar, November 29, 2007) http://action.nwlc.org/site/DocServer/FFN_Webinar_112907.pdf?docID=341\r\n\r\n2)\tLearning from the experience, feedback and evaluations from the Choose Health LA Child Care project.  There is not a lack of knowhow regarding reach as far as “finding” license-exempt providers, however, there is a noticeable gap in participation in the trainings between professional child care providers and license-exempt providers.  Many times the license-exempt child care providers who see themselves as professionals will take trainings such as this one and it is plausible that the 162 license-exempt providers that have taken the training are those that see themselves as professionals, also informing the need for a more informal experience in order to engage additional license-exempt participants.\r\n\r\n3)\tThe report “Families, Friends & Neighbors: Understanding the Needs of FFN Child Care Providers in L.A. County” provides insight into this group.  Our project addresses 5 of 6 recommended ways to support the license-exempt caregiver:\r\na.\tOffer Resources in Spanish\r\nb.\tProvide resources and education for providers bout licensure process\r\nc.\tOffer classes and activities in evenings\r\nd.\tLink providers to community resources\r\ne.\tProvide classes in the topics where there is greatest interest in which health and nutrition is included in the list.  Link to the report http://www.first5la.org/files/FFNReport_r4_0.pdf\r\n"
  achievable_goal: "1)    We have a network of organizations and people throughout the child care industry to help us reach the individuals we need to reach, whether it be experts in the industry to do trainings or accessing the license-exempt providers\r\n2)    Already know the information and topics for the customized training, therefore able to focus on a different structure to complement the audience and information being provided \r\n3)    Access to many different materials for use as supplemental materials for learning experiences\r\n4)   We are a small and nimble organization \r\n"
  major_challenges: "1)\tFinding the right person to create the curriculum and effectively creating it to “speak to” the audience it is intended for.  We plan to address this challenge by proactively using existing networks of industry professionals to create the curriculum as well as reaching out to ‘mommy and me’ teachers to get a good perspective of how to facilitate a class in that format.  Also, engage a handful of license-exempt providers that will be willing to work with us as we create the curriculum.\r\n2)\tFinding coach volunteers and creating buy-in that this is the best format for the license-exempt demographic and encouraging them to learn and get comfortable with the new format.  Hire a consultant for “train the trainer” to establish confidence and excitement with the coaches. We will also provide additional compensation to the top 3 coaches who train the most license-exempt providers as well as additional compensation for those who get the most follow up evaluations returned (encouraging follow up between coach and provider).\r\n3)\tGetting follow up evaluations and information from the attendees to gauge whether or not they implemented anything they learned.  Provide a material incentive – gift card or something else of monetary value to those that fill out and return their evaluations.\r\n4)     Getting the license-exempt providers to the trainings.  Working with Child Care Resource and Referral Agencies to assist in outreach, choosing settings in which caregivers can easily attend and consistent, specified messaging leading up to the classes."
  competition: "There are several programs in LA County focusing child obesity – nutrition and physical activity, at home and in the child care settings.  Choose Health LA – Child Care is the project that reaches the same population with similar information. However, their trainings are not specific to license-exempt caregivers.\r\n\r\nThat project also has several sister projects  Choose Health LA – Kids, Choose Health LA – Moms etc.  They address healthy environments but not in the license-exempt child care space.\r\n\r\nThere is the federal program National Education for Obesity Prevention – which is funding projects at the federal level in many counties, including LA County.  \r\nAnother program is through Nemours and the Center for Disease Control (CDC) called the Early Childhood Education Learning Collaborative but this focuses on a cohort of child care centers.\r\nThe audience we are addressing and the way in which we are addressing them, messaging only to them and creating a curriculum format that is just for them, sets us apart from other health and wellness initiatives in the county.  \r\n\r\nWhile other programs might mention the license-exempt provider is a target of their educational materials – it is most likely swept up in the entire child care curriculum and goals, just as our partner had to do because of priorities and lack of funds.\r\n"

  Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?:
    - LA County
  Does your project impact Los Angeles County?: 'No'
  How will your project impact the LA2050 “Live” metrics?:
    - Access to healthy food
    - Obesity rates
    - Health Culture in Child Care and Early Education
  impact_metrics: "Access to Healthy Food, Obesity Rates, Other: improving the culture of health overall for children in license-exempt child care.\r\nAccess to healthy food:  providing education and materials to license-exempt caregivers can improve the access to healthy food by the children in their care.  The project will also impact access to healthy food by providing information to the license-exempt community about the Child and Adult Care Food Program (“Food Program”) which partially reimburses child care providers for feeding the children healthy foods.  All children are eligible for this program which also addresses the food insecure child population.\r\n\r\nObesity rates: by educating license-exempt child care providers we have the potential to impact a portion of the 23% of children that are obese in LA County which would also positively impact the LA of 2050 as these children become the adults with healthy habits, effectively decreasing the 19% of adults that are obese as well as addressing the health concerns that correlate with obesity – heart disease and diabetes.\r\n\r\nHealth culture and early education: while the goal of the curriculum is to decrease obesity in child care settings, the training and the topics addressed also create a healthy learning environment overall, establishing a better setting for the children to be ready to learn as the opportunities present themselves.\r\n"
Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Three key resources underpin the economic, social, and environmental
  well-being of the LA region: the energy that powers our economy, the water
  that supports life and activity, and the weather and physical landscapes that
  shape our lifestyles and culture. All three are essential to our quality of
  life and are deeply intertwined with climate change and the immense challenges
  and opportunities it represents. The world must get on a path to renewable
  energy to avert the most extreme consequences of climate change. Even if the
  transition to renewables occurs immediately, significant climate change is
  inevitable, and water scarcity may be its most important consequence. 
   
   Resilient communities will need to simultaneously mitigate and adapt. LA can lead the way. By becoming self-sufficient and sustainable in energy and water in harmony with the region's ecosystems and cultural identity, we will ensure our own access to these critical resources as well as a healthier and more prosperous future. Our example will drive similar transformations in urban areas across the globe and create worldwide demand for local expertise and products. 
   
   The Hotter LA Project unites dozens of UCLA’s most prominent scientists and scholars with key public and private stakeholders around a common goal: full sustainability in the LA region by 2050. By 2019, we will produce a plan detailing the new technologies and efficiencies required to obtain all energy and water from local and renewable sources in a way that’s economical, socially equitable, and supportive of the LA region’s unique biodiversity. We will map out the required actions to modernize energy, water, and transportation systems; enhance the built and natural environment; define new policy and legal frameworks; and heighten social responsibility, thereby transforming the urban fabric and mitigating the effects of climate change.
   
   In the 1-year grant period, we will focus on the following objectives:
   a) Creating a working outline of the 2019 Plan and a project management timeline
   b) Increasing the number and depth of partnerships with critical stakeholder groups
   c) Raising public awareness of and support for the effort
   
   In summary, we are committed to making all parts of the city resilient in alignment with the LA2050 goals.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Raising awareness about the Hotter LA Project, gathering support, and
  developing the infrastructure for this intense and complex collaboration TODAY
  lays the crucial foundation for the success of this project and a healthier,
  greener Los Angeles. We will realize benefits from these transformations long
  before 2050.
   
   Here’s how achieving the Hotter LA 2050 objectives makes LA the healthiest place to live in 2050:
   
   -The transition to renewable energy and a carbon-free transportation infrastructure will eliminate the public health burden associated with fossil fuel--taking us off the list of US cities with the worst air quality. 
   
   -Transformed urban spaces and cleaner oceans offer greater opportunities to be active in natural outdoor spaces where our unique biodiversity can be celebrated.
   
   -The creation of substantial bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure will provide active commuting options that improve health and quality of life—reducing the number of vehicles on the road as we currently have more than any other urban area in the world.
   
   The compound effect of these changes will result in the LA region becoming healthier, eliminating current environmental injustices so that all communities have minimal environmental health risks. We will see a notable reduction in asthma attacks, heart attacks, and premature death.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  By 2050, it is estimated that 70% of the world’s population will live in
  cities and face the same urban environmental concerns currently present in the
  LA region: limited resources, smog, water waste, traffic congestion, increased
  heat and rising sea levels.
   
   The Hotter LA Project is designed to achieve maximum societal impact. Even before we reach the 2050 goals, the steps made in approach of 100% sustainability will have positive benefits for all citizens and communities in the entire LA region. Millions of people will have cleaner air, safe, sustainable energy and water, and improved quality of life. We expect this effort to become a model for how other megacities might achieve sustainability through goal setting and cross-sector collaboration. Lessons learned here will be shared with communities across the state, nation, and globe.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Robust partnerships with a wide variety of stakeholders are critical to the
  success of the project and to the eventual implementation of the 2019 Plan.
  Key stakeholder groups include: 
   
   Local, State, and Federal Government: LA City and County leaders and even the White House administration are aware of this project and have confirmed broad support for our goals. Members of the Hotter LA team have active research and consulting engagements with the City of Los Angeles, County of Los Angeles, and federal agencies. Critical Success Factor: We must expand relationships with all government stakeholder groups, become fluent with their complex structures, and find ways to connect beyond existing relationships to ensure that the right people are engaged, improve the feasibility of the 2050 plan, and obtain buy-in from groups that will have significant responsibility with implementation.
   
   Industry: The expansion of industry partnerships is a priority for this Project. Through early engagement of industry, we gain a greater understanding of needs and aligned interests as related to the goals of the project. Critical Success Factor: While a number of relationships currently exist, we must develop more extensive relationships with industry and foster more entity-level engagement.
   
   Philanthropy: Hotter LA represents our most ambitious fundraising effort to date. We believe that there is great opportunity to engage supporters of the university in new ways. Critical Success Factor: We must capture the imagination and commitment of individuals passionate about meeting the goals of the project.
   
   UCLA Campus and Other Universities: With full support from the UCLA Chancellor and the 140 faculty members involved, UCLA is deeply committed to this effort. Critical Success Factor: We will extend our reach outside of UCLA to include academic partners who can stimulate innovation and fill gaps.
   
   Public: We will shift our public communications from broadcasts to dialogues. With increased interaction, we hope that LA citizens will learn about the proposed project, draw inspiration from it, and get involved. Critical Success Factor: An engaged and supportive Los Angeles community is essential. 
   
   With our partners, we will create a shared vision of the future, communicate openly and directly about opportunities and challenges, increase access to all types of resources (monetary, intellectual, data, etc.), and make progress on our collective commitment to the 2050 goals.
