Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Three key resources underpin the economic, social, and environmental
  well-being of the LA region: the energy that powers our economy, the water
  that supports life and activity, and the weather and physical landscapes that
  shape our lifestyles and culture. All three are essential to our quality of
  life and are deeply intertwined with climate change and the immense challenges
  and opportunities it represents. The world must get on a path to renewable
  energy to avert the most extreme consequences of climate change. Even if the
  transition to renewables occurs immediately, significant climate change is
  inevitable, and water scarcity may be its most important consequence. 
   
   Resilient communities will need to simultaneously mitigate and adapt. LA can lead the way. By becoming self-sufficient and sustainable in energy and water in harmony with the region's ecosystems and cultural identity, we will ensure our own access to these critical resources as well as a healthier and more prosperous future. Our example will drive similar transformations in urban areas across the globe and create worldwide demand for local expertise and products. 
   
   The Hotter LA Project unites dozens of UCLA’s most prominent scientists and scholars with key public and private stakeholders around a common goal: full sustainability in the LA region by 2050. By 2019, we will produce a plan detailing the new technologies and efficiencies required to obtain all energy and water from local and renewable sources in a way that’s economical, socially equitable, and supportive of the LA region’s unique biodiversity. We will map out the required actions to modernize energy, water, and transportation systems; enhance the built and natural environment; define new policy and legal frameworks; and heighten social responsibility, thereby transforming the urban fabric and mitigating the effects of climate change.
   
   In the 1-year grant period, we will focus on the following objectives:
   a) Creating a working outline of the 2019 Plan and a project management timeline
   b) Increasing the number and depth of partnerships with critical stakeholder groups
   c) Raising public awareness of and support for the effort
   
   In summary, we are committed to making all parts of the city resilient in alignment with the LA2050 goals.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Raising awareness about the Hotter LA Project, gathering support, and
  developing the infrastructure for this intense and complex collaboration TODAY
  lays the crucial foundation for the success of this project and a healthier,
  greener Los Angeles. We will realize benefits from these transformations long
  before 2050.
   
   Here’s how achieving the Hotter LA 2050 objectives makes LA the healthiest place to live in 2050:
   
   -The transition to renewable energy and a carbon-free transportation infrastructure will eliminate the public health burden associated with fossil fuel--taking us off the list of US cities with the worst air quality. 
   
   -Transformed urban spaces and cleaner oceans offer greater opportunities to be active in natural outdoor spaces where our unique biodiversity can be celebrated.
   
   -The creation of substantial bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure will provide active commuting options that improve health and quality of life—reducing the number of vehicles on the road as we currently have more than any other urban area in the world.
   
   The compound effect of these changes will result in the LA region becoming healthier, eliminating current environmental injustices so that all communities have minimal environmental health risks. We will see a notable reduction in asthma attacks, heart attacks, and premature death.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  By 2050, it is estimated that 70% of the world’s population will live in
  cities and face the same urban environmental concerns currently present in the
  LA region: limited resources, smog, water waste, traffic congestion, increased
  heat and rising sea levels.
   
   The Hotter LA Project is designed to achieve maximum societal impact. Even before we reach the 2050 goals, the steps made in approach of 100% sustainability will have positive benefits for all citizens and communities in the entire LA region. Millions of people will have cleaner air, safe, sustainable energy and water, and improved quality of life. We expect this effort to become a model for how other megacities might achieve sustainability through goal setting and cross-sector collaboration. Lessons learned here will be shared with communities across the state, nation, and globe.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Robust partnerships with a wide variety of stakeholders are critical to the
  success of the project and to the eventual implementation of the 2019 Plan.
  Key stakeholder groups include: 
   
   Local, State, and Federal Government: LA City and County leaders and even the White House administration are aware of this project and have confirmed broad support for our goals. Members of the Hotter LA team have active research and consulting engagements with the City of Los Angeles, County of Los Angeles, and federal agencies. Critical Success Factor: We must expand relationships with all government stakeholder groups, become fluent with their complex structures, and find ways to connect beyond existing relationships to ensure that the right people are engaged, improve the feasibility of the 2050 plan, and obtain buy-in from groups that will have significant responsibility with implementation.
   
   Industry: The expansion of industry partnerships is a priority for this Project. Through early engagement of industry, we gain a greater understanding of needs and aligned interests as related to the goals of the project. Critical Success Factor: While a number of relationships currently exist, we must develop more extensive relationships with industry and foster more entity-level engagement.
   
   Philanthropy: Hotter LA represents our most ambitious fundraising effort to date. We believe that there is great opportunity to engage supporters of the university in new ways. Critical Success Factor: We must capture the imagination and commitment of individuals passionate about meeting the goals of the project.
   
   UCLA Campus and Other Universities: With full support from the UCLA Chancellor and the 140 faculty members involved, UCLA is deeply committed to this effort. Critical Success Factor: We will extend our reach outside of UCLA to include academic partners who can stimulate innovation and fill gaps.
   
   Public: We will shift our public communications from broadcasts to dialogues. With increased interaction, we hope that LA citizens will learn about the proposed project, draw inspiration from it, and get involved. Critical Success Factor: An engaged and supportive Los Angeles community is essential. 
   
   With our partners, we will create a shared vision of the future, communicate openly and directly about opportunities and challenges, increase access to all types of resources (monetary, intellectual, data, etc.), and make progress on our collective commitment to the 2050 goals.
