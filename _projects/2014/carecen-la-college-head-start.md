Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  For the past two years, CARECEN has been building momentum to continue
  expanding the College Head Start (CHS) Program, not only to those graduating
  seniors from within the Belmont Zone of Choice, but to creatively build a
  program that will be fully integrated within a local high school as a
  requirement for high school graduation. Since its inception in late 2012,
  CARECEN has provided over 50 students and their families with College Head
  Start Program services, with 100% of participants accepted to four-year
  institutions including: Harvard University; University of California, Santa
  Cruz; California State University, Los Angeles, other community and vocational
  schools.
   
   Nevertheless, as we continue to grow the College Head Start Program, it is our belief that in order for CARECEN to make a significant impact in the lives of Latino students, we must have the opportunity to fully integrate our program at a local high school, amongst graduating students (12th grade) and even younger (9th through 11th grade students) in an effort to increase high school graduation, college eligibility and enrollment, and increase college graduation rates for Latino students. 
   
   One way to implement this idea is working with a local high school, sharing CARECEN's College Head Start Program vision where college readiness and graduation are the standard! CARECEN has been approached by Civitas School of Leadership, a local high school located in Central Los Angeles, designed as a small school community, Civitas pursues high quality student learning through data-driven instruction, project-based learning, interdisciplinary curriculum, and vertical planning. With many of Civitas students approaching CARECEN to participate in their after-school tutoring and college counseling, school officials initiated talks with CARECEN regarding the creation and development of year long curriculum and classes to be offered at Civitas benefitting their students.
   
   In order to fully implement CARECEN's College Head Start Program, we (CARECEN) need to hire a program assistant to support current students enrolled in the program in order for the program coordinator to fully develop a school-year curriculum addressing graduating high school students needs as they transition out of high school, how to finance their education and their detachment from their family as they pursue higher learning. CARECEN will speak with Civitas' Principal, Parent Council and School Board to pursue funding.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  CARECEN strongly believes that in order for our community to flourish we must
  first look toward our students, whose ongoing struggle to complete their high
  school education has been a task left unattended. Our College Head Start
  Program enriches students’ lives by encouraging them to become active
  participants in their communities, while also striving for academic enrichment
  and a successful transition toward college-life. By helping students reach
  their high school graduation goals, encouraging their path toward higher
  education, the City of Los Angeles will benefit from an elite class of
  hard-working and intellectual Latino students. 
   
   Having bright students incorporate their lives within the City of Los Angeles, local communities (many of which those same students grew up in) will return to their roots in pursuit of changing the community makeup make academic enrichment and college readiness the standard! For each student who successfully completes our College Head Start Program, they will not only become an asset to our community but will become our future community leaders.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  CARECEN's College Head Start Program will benefit students and families
  residing in Central Los Angeles, specifically within the communities of
  Westlake/Pico-Union. Students, specifically those attending Civitas School of
  Leadership, are recruited from within a five to ten mile radius of CARECEN's
  Community Center located in Central Los Angeles community of Pico-Union. 
   
   Program participants are composed of 12th grade high school students; both high and low academically performing; first generation students attending college; students/families with limited financial resources, English as a Second Language (ESL) and English Language Learner (ELL) students, and undocumented AB540 students. The College Head Start Program will serve local City of Los Angeles students, ranging in age from 16 – 18 years old, with an ethnic breakdown including: 98% Latino, 2% Mixed Ethnicity.
   
   Many students coming to CARECEN seeking academic enrichment services have been labeled by community standards as underserved and at-risk due to a lack of college advisors at schools, and suffering through significant state budget deficits with continuous educational cutbacks. It is worth nothing that neighboring high schools among the Belmont Zone of Choice where Civitas is located, are among some of Los Angeles Unified School District's most underperforming schools, with a graduation rate of 34%. CARECEN’s College Head Start Program will prove that is core curriculum and student-led services provide significant academic support and individualized attention, addressing the unmet educational needs of disadvantaged, under-served, and at-risk students; filling the gaps that exists in local schools.
   
   We believe that academic success goes hand-in-hand with leadership development for students and parents, therefore, College Head Start’s goals are to create a sustainable high school impact program, geared to support graduating students among Civitas School of Leadership and many other among the Belmont Zone of Choice by: (1) monitoring students academic progress, (2) ensuring students access to academic support, (3) helping students earn a high school diploma, and (4) preparing students to attend a: university, community college, vocational and/or trade school.
   
   Real change and benefits derive from communities who are well-informed, have the necessary tools to advocate for quality education, and who collaborate with key institutions such as schools and community organizations.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Throughout its 31 year history, CARECEN has produced many successful
  partnerships and collaborations with local community based organizations,
  regional and out-of-state partners, sister organizations, schools districts
  and private and public agencies. The College Head Start Program collaborates
  and partners with local schools in order to request transcripts, grades,
  school involvement, and most importantly, to streamline the process of test
  scores (SAT or ACT) and credit completion as a requirement for college
  admission. 
   
   As the program continues to expand and funding is secured, CARECEN will partner with Civitas School of Leadership in the Westlake/Pico-Union community. As previously noted, Civitas is designed as a small school and part of the Los Angeles Smalls Schools Center, Civitas School of Leadership pursues high quality student learning through a variety of means, including data-driven instruction, project-based learning, interdisciplinary curriculum, and vertical planning. 
   
   A strong partnership with Civitas School of Leadership will enable CARECEN to integrate the College Head Start Program as a graduation requirement benefiting more than 600 graduating high school seniors each academic year. CARECEN has worked with Civitas School of Leadership for many years providing academic enrichment and parent education workshops at school campus and CARECEN's Community Center. Our successful and ongoing partnership throughout the years with Civitas has created a trusting relationship with CARECEN and the strength of our programs have demonstrated our effectiveness to aid students in reaching their highest academic potential. 
   
   Most notably, the three critical factors to the success of our partnership with Civitas School of Leadership are: 
   1. Creating a culture where academic enrichment and college readiness are the standard. 
   2. Partnering with local colleges, universities and other community-based organizations to create a network of collaborative partners willing to help students create a transition plan toward college-life. 
   3. Working together (CARECEN and Civitas) influencing a lasting change in the Westlake/Pico-Union community by raising awareness for higher academic standards and college readiness.
