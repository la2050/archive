  Funding Program
   The first action will be to invest a portion of the funds dedicated to creating further investment by government and foundations charged with advancing healthy communities measures by pragmatic and measurable means. 
   
   Scientific & Engineering Community
   We will engage with colleagues from public and private industry to develop a government briefing document. Experts will confirm the variables: numbers of cars travelling to work each day, number of miles on average for LA County, the results that could come from some local hiring percentage of the workforce. Experts will work with us to define reasonable parameters to Los Angeles and its best case for reducing emissions. The concept here is to provide insight to leaders on the type of carbon capture that is achievable, to begin creating the stage for action.
   
   Public Outreach
   Short-form video, social media and community meetings – all multilingual – will brief, educate and engage the public regarding the benefits from employer, resident and commuter perspectives. Outreach will be designed to attract start-ups and entrepreneurs, who will be part of the system making those stronger connections to employees.
   
   Government Action
   Once briefed, city officials will be asked to discuss possible employer incentives working with council leaders responsible for sustainable communities’ planning and economic development. After local hiring program briefings are established, employers will be invited to participate in the menu of incentives available on a city, county and state level. 
   
   Technology Experts
   In the first year, technology, social media, HR experts, IT engineers will be invited to begin developing the framework to create stronger connections between employers in search of local talent and residents in search of the jobs suitable to their experience at all levels. In addition, the applications that are currently available to help employers measure the emissions savings they achieve through local hiring will be assessed. 
   
   Pilot Program
   Working with data experts, we’ll identify Los Angeles’ existing emissions standing and define the potential reduction of emissions and/or improvement to air quality resulting from an initial pilot program of employees hired within a certain radius of local employers.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  With each local hire, employers will help reduce miles travelled across Los
  Angeles’ freeways. In Los Angeles, the average 1 way trip to work is 14.3
  miles. With each mile less than 14 there is a measurable reduction in
  emissions. Over time, these reductions will challenge the staggering economic
  costs of pollution in the state which have been cited to be “10 billion
  annually" (Based on RAND report) The combined health and economic costs are
  explained below through an in-depth study by the RAND Corporation, which also
  stated:
   
   “The analysts identified substantial health and cost benefits from cleaner air. Nearly 30,000 hospital admissions and ER visits could have been avoided over the two-year period, with resulting savings of about $193 million. Because public insurers such as Medicare and Medi-Cal paid most of the pollution-related health care bill, they have a lot to gain from cleaner air. But employers and private insurers also have sizable financial interest in reducing air pollution. The number of adverse health events that clean air would have prevented, and the resulting savings, varied across the state, depending on the local level of pollution.” 
   
   We are starting with the worst metropolitan rankings on air quality in the nation with a tremendous health care and human cost for Californians. Local hiring can be tagged as a “preventative” health measure, improving daily life for residents with a plan that thwarts emission release. Our Local Hire initiative, once applied, will provide a new principle of urban hiring that results in shorter commutes, cleaner air, and more time for residents to improve their quality of life. 
   
   Los Angeles will be one of the first in the nation to develop a sustainable model that includes a behavioral shift that addresses traffic congestion and meets environmental, economic public policy objectives, thus creating a new path for LA's future.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Our program aims to benefit everyone. The public (children and adults at-risk
  by air pollutants). Local Businesses. The Environment.
   Non-Profits with A Healthy Communities' Agenda and the Government. 
   
   If you have asthma and heart disease affected by allergens and irritants living in Los Angeles, travelling through the city can be stressful and dangerous. Many lower-income residents live close to major thoroughfares and freeways where particulates and other emissions are significantly higher. They are often less able to monitor pollution-related medical problems and maintain good health due to lack of adequate health care. 
   
   Many cities across the nation, grappling with traffic impacts and attempting to define sustainable measures to deliver a measure of health in urban environments, may assess, adjust and revise the model to meet their own objectives. 
   
   According to NASA’s recent shared findings from satellite derived studies regarding NO 2 (fossil fuel emissions) show that “Even though larger cities are typically more energy efficient with lower per capita emissions, more people still translates to more pollution. For LA County’s almost 10 million residents, the concept that we can provide a method to prevent emissions from adding to existing levels of pollution should warrant support for implementing a model. http://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/nasa-scientists-relate-urban-population-to-air-pollution/#.U9V8_o1dXIo.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: |-
  Fixing Angelenos Stuck in Traffic – FAST.org (Confirmed)
   
   FAST/California Community Foundation - will act as the fiscal manager and assist with: technical data analysis, strategic implementation planning working with the business community. FAST has extensive experience in transit planning and analysis and works in cooperation with the business community as a stakeholder. FAST is currently working on enhancing Los Angeles alternatives to cars through bike share and other measures. As the average miles lessen in Los Angeles from 14, options for alternatives become viable. 
   
   City Government | County | State (In Briefings)
   As a former city council deputy, land use planner and legislative aide, my job will be to discuss the proposal with city council members vested in economic and environmental matters and develop an incentive based program that will reward employers for the contribution to the local economy. Incentives could range from awards of recognition for leadership to financial savings. The first step is to examine what’s possible in a post-recession climate. The critical aspect to developing local hiring is to ensure that actions taken support a normal course of business rather than to attempt to control business through regulation. 
   
   TMS Transportation Demand Services (Proposed Consultant)
   I worked with TMS, a specialist in transportation management in 2009 to discuss the concept of local hiring as a transportation demand management measure and to identify a means of calculating savings in vehicle miles travelled across the city. TMS is an advisor to business and government nationally on adaptive measures and transit alternatives that solve congestion. A portion of the budget will be retained for their counsel in synthesizing the technical data and adding insight to discussions with leaders in the state on the adoption as a sustainable communities action consistent with clean air mandates. 
   
   Three factors critical to success:
   - Articulating the formula that defines savings to emissions with expert agreement from city, county and state government and the scientific/environmental community.
   - Engaging business as partners 
   - Creating a long-term funding and implementation platform.
