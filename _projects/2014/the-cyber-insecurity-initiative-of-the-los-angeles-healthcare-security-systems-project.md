  Funding Program
   The first action will be to invest a portion of the funds dedicated to creating further investment by government and foundations charged with advancing healthy communities measures by pragmatic and measurable means. 
   
   Scientific & Engineering Community
   We will engage with colleagues from public and private industry to develop a government briefing document. Experts will confirm the variables: numbers of cars travelling to work each day, number of miles on average for LA County, the results that could come from some local hiring percentage of the workforce. Experts will work with us to define reasonable parameters to Los Angeles and its best case for reducing emissions. The concept here is to provide insight to leaders on the type of carbon capture that is achievable, to begin creating the stage for action.
   
   Public Outreach
   Short-form video, social media and community meetings – all multilingual – will brief, educate and engage the public regarding the benefits from employer, resident and commuter perspectives. Outreach will be designed to attract start-ups and entrepreneurs, who will be part of the system making those stronger connections to employees.
   
   Government Action
   Once briefed, city officials will be asked to discuss possible employer incentives working with council leaders responsible for sustainable communities’ planning and economic development. After local hiring program briefings are established, employers will be invited to participate in the menu of incentives available on a city, county and state level. 
   
   Technology Experts
   In the first year, technology, social media, HR experts, IT engineers will be invited to begin developing the framework to create stronger connections between employers in search of local talent and residents in search of the jobs suitable to their experience at all levels. In addition, the applications that are currently available to help employers measure the emissions savings they achieve through local hiring will be assessed. 
   
   Pilot Program
   Working with data experts, we’ll identify Los Angeles’ existing emissions standing and define the potential reduction of emissions and/or improvement to air quality resulting from an initial pilot program of employees hired within a certain radius of local employers.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  With each local hire, employers will help reduce miles travelled across Los
  Angeles’ freeways. In Los Angeles, the average 1 way trip to work is 14.3
  miles. With each mile less than 14 there is a measurable reduction in
  emissions. Over time, these reductions will challenge the staggering economic
  costs of pollution in the state which have been cited to be “10 billion
  annually" (Based on RAND report) The combined health and economic costs are
  explained below through an in-depth study by the RAND Corporation, which also
  stated:
   
   “The analysts identified substantial health and cost benefits from cleaner air. Nearly 30,000 hospital admissions and ER visits could have been avoided over the two-year period, with resulting savings of about $193 million. Because public insurers such as Medicare and Medi-Cal paid most of the pollution-related health care bill, they have a lot to gain from cleaner air. But employers and private insurers also have sizable financial interest in reducing air pollution. The number of adverse health events that clean air would have prevented, and the resulting savings, varied across the state, depending on the local level of pollution.” 
   
   We are starting with the worst metropolitan rankings on air quality in the nation with a tremendous health care and human cost for Californians. Local hiring can be tagged as a “preventative” health measure, improving daily life for residents with a plan that thwarts emission release. Our Local Hire initiative, once applied, will provide a new principle of urban hiring that results in shorter commutes, cleaner air, and more time for residents to improve their quality of life. 
   
   Los Angeles will be one of the first in the nation to develop a sustainable model that includes a behavioral shift that addresses traffic congestion and meets environmental, economic public policy objectives, thus creating a new path for LA's future.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Our program aims to benefit everyone. The public (children and adults at-risk
  by air pollutants). Local Businesses. The Environment.
   Non-Profits with A Healthy Communities' Agenda and the Government. 
   
   If you have asthma and heart disease affected by allergens and irritants living in Los Angeles, travelling through the city can be stressful and dangerous. Many lower-income residents live close to major thoroughfares and freeways where particulates and other emissions are significantly higher. They are often less able to monitor pollution-related medical problems and maintain good health due to lack of adequate health care. 
   
   Many cities across the nation, grappling with traffic impacts and attempting to define sustainable measures to deliver a measure of health in urban environments, may assess, adjust and revise the model to meet their own objectives. 
   
   According to NASA’s recent shared findings from satellite derived studies regarding NO 2 (fossil fuel emissions) show that “Even though larger cities are typically more energy efficient with lower per capita emissions, more people still translates to more pollution. For LA County’s almost 10 million residents, the concept that we can provide a method to prevent emissions from adding to existing levels of pollution should warrant support for implementing a model. http://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/nasa-scientists-relate-urban-population-to-air-pollution/#.U9V8_o1dXIo.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: |-
  Fixing Angelenos Stuck in Traffic – FAST.org (Confirmed)
   
   FAST/California Community Foundation - will act as the fiscal manager and assist with: technical data analysis, strategic implementation planning working with the business community. FAST has extensive experience in transit planning and analysis and works in cooperation with the business community as a stakeholder. FAST is currently working on enhancing Los Angeles alternatives to cars through bike share and other measures. As the average miles lessen in Los Angeles from 14, options for alternatives become viable. 
   
   City Government | County | State (In Briefings)
   As a former city council deputy, land use planner and legislative aide, my job will be to discuss the proposal with city council members vested in economic and environmental matters and develop an incentive based program that will reward employers for the contribution to the local economy. Incentives could range from awards of recognition for leadership to financial savings. The first step is to examine what’s possible in a post-recession climate. The critical aspect to developing local hiring is to ensure that actions taken support a normal course of business rather than to attempt to control business through regulation. 
   
   TMS Transportation Demand Services (Proposed Consultant)
   I worked with TMS, a specialist in transportation management in 2009 to discuss the concept of local hiring as a transportation demand management measure and to identify a means of calculating savings in vehicle miles travelled across the city. TMS is an advisor to business and government nationally on adaptive measures and transit alternatives that solve congestion. A portion of the budget will be retained for their counsel in synthesizing the technical data and adding insight to discussions with leaders in the state on the adoption as a sustainable communities action consistent with clean air mandates. 
   
   Three factors critical to success:
   - Articulating the formula that defines savings to emissions with expert agreement from city, county and state government and the scientific/environmental community.
   - Engaging business as partners 
   - Creating a long-term funding and implementation platform.

    Nearly all LA County’ hospitals have moved to electronic health records
    (EHR) in compliance with Federal regulations.  We have identified a mismatch
    regarding perceived versus actual vulnerabilities to these medical records.
    According to cybersecurity experts, electronic systems are much more
    vulnerable than we realize, which places LA County residents at great risk. 
    The next “Cyber Pearl Harbor” may be just around the corner. Our initiative
    will conduct a thorough vulnerability assessment of digital healthcare
    information in LA’s hospitals. The differences between cyber threat
    perceptions and actual vulnerabilities will be collected and analyzed to
    improve the security of LA County’s EHRs, thus making our population
    healthier and safer.
  implement: >-
    The Cyber Insecurity Initiative has four main phases: planning, assessment,
    analysis, and recommendations. The planning phase will consist of securing
    appropriate permissions from LA County’s 122 licensed hospitals for
    participation, designing questionnaires and interview guides to conduct the
    vulnerability assessments, and coordinating the logistics to carry out the
    plan. There may be reluctance to have participants do an Internet survey, so
    we will do both a person-to-person as well as a text survey (using text to
    database technology we developed). All information will be confidential and
    not attributed to any one hospital. Only combined data will be shown in any
    report. The assessment phase involves scheduling and conducting interviews
    with five groups that have input. Special emphasis will be placed on
    achieving a balance of each hospital’s EHR buyers, users, emergency
    managers, administrators, and compliance officers. The questionnaires and
    interviews will provide the foundation of the vulnerability assessment,
    complemented by subject matter expert evaluations. The analysis phase
    requires thorough statistical analysis of all data. One key goal is to
    compare and evaluate vulnerability perceptions (as documented in the
    questionnaires and interviews) with actual vulnerabilities (as documented by
    cybersecurity professionals working with us as well as the literature). The
    recommendations phase begins with preparing reports and presentation
    materials, culminating with the presentation of findings with
    recommendations to improve cybersecurity to the entire hospital community. 
    Specific collaborators for the initiative’s findings and recommendations are
    the Hospital Association of Southern California, the Hospital Corporation of
    America (pending), the UCLA Center for Public Health and Disasters, the LA
    County EMS Agency, Red-E Consulting, and the California Hospital
    Association. 
  impact_live: "The residents and visitors of LA County deserve and expect a safe, reliable healthcare system that protects their personal health information and provides unimpeded information to the appropriate provider in a timely manner. We are still at the dawn of a rapidly evolving technological age in healthcare. As our use of healthcare technology and cyberspace expands, so do the cybersecurity threats. The Cyber Insecurity Initiative will proactively address these concerns now, guiding our use of new technology in a safe and responsible manner. By 2050, healthcare will be totally dependent on technology and cyberspace, and the decisions we make now will allow LA to take full advantage of benefits offered by reliable, digitized healthcare while proactively minimizing the risks to the private health information of every individual who uses LA County’s hospitals. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, in a world that is shrinking due to technology, the Cyber Insecurity Initiative will keep Los Angeles at the forefront of healthcare in an increasingly globalized world. LA is a truly global city. As of 2013, there were 3.5 million foreign-born residents in LA County, and there are 135 different languages spoken here.  An estimated 1 in 10 residents is undocumented, and we have millions of international visitors every year. LAX is the sixth busiest airport in the world. For the health of our residents and visitors, our economic prosperity requires a world class healthcare system that maximizes the safe and responsible use of EHRs \r\n\r\nAdditionally, disasters and public health emergencies (such as biological terrorism and pandemic diseases) must be considered. If used to its potential, our healthcare system can use EHRs to mitigate the effects of a disaster and speed the public health emergency response and recovery. In fact, the effective use of EHRs even has the potential to mitigate a pandemic disease in its tracks. This can only be achieved, however, if the system is safe and secure. \r\n\r\nFinally, the routine and safe use of EHRs will drastically improve the daily lives of all LA County residents and visitors. Healthcare can be provided faster, more effectively, more efficiently, and cheaper thanks to the benefits of digitized healthcare. The Cyber Insecurity Initiative will ensure that we do so in a way that minimizes or negates the potential risks to digitized healthcare as we approach 2050. Residents will feel safer knowing that their medical privacy is secure and the system is working well."
  who_benefit: "The Los Angeles County healthcare system is an essential public service available to all residents and visitors. Whether or not a specific individual is using that system at any given point in time, everyone in LA can benefit from that public good. While our thoughts go first to the ill or injured who currently require hospital care, everyone in LA knows that the emergency medical services, emergency rooms, and world class healthcare in general are available to them and their families, if needed. Whether directly or indirectly, all of us benefit from our healthcare system. A well functioning healthcare system is essential to a vibrant, resilient community that can continue to thrive. In the new century, a comprehensive, long-term approach to healthcare cybersecurity is essential to the reliability and public trust of the healthcare system.\r\n\r\nThe cyber security concerns include security breaches, data loss, data for ransom, data corruption Internet breakdown, electrical breakdown, and other hazards that will negatively impact our population’s health in an environment where we are rapidly becoming more and more dependent on digitized healthcare records. Whether caused by a terrorist, a hacker, an accident, or a disaster, the residents and visitors of LA can be assured that their healthcare information is safer thanks to the Cyber Insecurity Initiative. \r\n\r\nThe following examples illustrate the extent of modern security breaches. As healthcare becomes increasingly dependent on digital records, the impact of these breaches will rise. According to a report by a cyber security firm called Redspin, there was a 97% increase in health record breaches from 2010-2011. Ponemon found that these breaches cost the hacked organization approximately $240 per record. In 2011, TRICARE lost their EHR back-up tapes, affecting almost 5 million patients. In 2010, the North Bronx Healthcare Network had 1.7 million EHRs stolen by a hacker. In 2009, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Tennessee had a hard drive with over one million EHRs stolen. These are among many examples of the mounting risks associated with the transition to EHRs. The costs associated with EHR security breaches are tremendous, and the potential impact on the public’s faith in healthcare providers is even greater.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the methodology we use can be adapted to other infrastructure, such as public health, public safety (police and fire), emergency management, transportation, electrical grid, public works, etc. "

  impact_metrics: "Our healthcare is undergoing a rapid transition. New laws are changing the way we provide care, healthcare costs are still out of control, providers are changing how they interact with patients, public health is underfunded, hospital profit margins are reduced, and all medical records are being digitized. This “perfect storm” helps put the importance of proper cyber safeguards in a broader context. \r\n\r\nHealthcare is a critical “public good” that benefits all residents and visitors to LA directly or indirectly. The reality is that a safe and reliable healthcare system is assumed and expected. We take it as a “given”, without specificity or insight regarding how complex it really is.  On occasion, the news media highlights various concerns for the public, such as when the Los Angeles Fire Department was faulted for its slower-than-reported EMS response times in 2013. \r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, public knowledge of the benefits from the Cyber Insecurity Initiative should increase the percentage of residents who receive coordinated healthcare access in LA. They will be assured that the healthcare system is proactively and responsibly addressing cybersecurity as the use of digitized healthcare expands and evolves. \r\n\r\nThe reality, though, is that many residents and visitors will be less aware of how the metrics of the Cyber Insecurity Initiative are actually achieved. First, we seek to better align cyber threat perceptions of administrators, providers, etc. with the actual cyber risks. Second, we will make recommendations to close gaps and improve upon security. Because the data has not yet been collected or analyzed, these recommendations and the metrics derived from them cannot yet be concretely defined. This is why a grant from LA2050 is so essential.\r\n\r\nIn a general sense, the recommendations and metrics center on anticipated cybersecurity and reliability domains since breaches have already occurred, hospitals have been fined, and records have been corrupted. These domains include the frequency and extent of security breaches and/or data loss, the speed and reliability of data retrieval and transfer, the usage rates and reliability of EHRs, and so on. In many cases, the general public will not be aware of these metrics even though they are critical to the health and wellbeing of the population. They can be aggregated under the categories of “public trust in the safety and reliability of the healthcare system” and “public trust in the safety and reliability of EHRs.\""

  evaluate: "Metric 1 (process): Participation of healthcare technology buyers, users, managers, administrators, and compliance officers in the Cyber Insecurity Initiative. To be most effective, we will require the buy-in and support of these individuals to properly assess cybersecurity concerns. The support of both top-level administrators and hospital/healthcare associations will help with this endeavor, and we have already gained some support from them for the initiative. We will certainly be successful with even moderate participation from healthcare technology buyers, users, disaster managers, administrators, and compliance officers, but we seek to maximize their participation.\r\n\r\nMetric 2 (outcome): Gap between perceived cyber threats to the healthcare system (by healthcare administrators, providers, etc.) and actual threats. This measure will be initially assessed through questionnaires and interviews with a wide range of healthcare technology buyers, users, disaster managers, administrators, and compliance officers. The Cyber Insecurity Initiative will then analyze the results and provide recommendations to address the gaps between perceived and actual threats. \r\n\r\nMetric 3 (outcome): Public trust in the safety, accessibility, and reliability of the healthcare system is dependent on technology and cyberspace. This public trust is essential. Public concerns with the healthcare system, such as with the fire departments and emergency medical services response times, are fundamental to the trust in the healthcare system. The EMS system in LA County has already started using EHRs from the moment of first contact with patients (before they even get transported to the hospital). The Cyber Insecurity Initiative can provide recommendations to assess and improve the public’s trust in the emergency medical services system. This can also eventually be extended to other parts of the county’s infrastructure."
  two_lessons: "Lesson 1: In our experience many healthcare technology buyers, users, disaster managers, administrators, and compliance officers are either unaware of or do not fully appreciate the cybersecurity risks to healthcare data.  This lesson is based on consultation with cybersecurity professionals, the literature, and anecdotal information regarding the perceptions of healthcare professionals. This lesson, as well as the desire to have a resilient, robust system in place, is what prompted the need for the Cyber Insecurity Initiative. The extent and scope of the mismatch between cybersecurity and healthcare professionals will be determined and analyzed. Furthermore, many healthcare professionals are reluctant to participate in this type of research because it shines a light on a sensitive issue that they do not fully understand nor want to make public. In other words, they may not want to share their concerns. This is why buy-in and active support from top-level administrators and healthcare/hospital associations is critical.\r\n\r\nLesson 2: Black Swan (low probability, high impact) types of disasters are not part of our daily routine. Thus, many cyber concerns are handled outside the knowledge of the general public. The public’s trust in the healthcare system includes a basic assumption that cybersecurity issues are appropriately addressed. The public is not aware that many healthcare technology buyers, users, disaster managers, administrators, and compliance officers lack a full multidisciplinary appreciation of the cybersecurity risks to their personal health information. Were such knowledge to become widely publicized, then the public’s trust of the healthcare system would be diminished. That’s why it’s so important for the Cyber Insecurity Initiative to be funded. With funding we can proactively address these cybersecurity concerns now, before vulnerabilities can be exploited or new risks can develop. If a current or emerging vulnerability of cybersecurity was exploited without a program like the Cyber Insecurity Initiative to address it, the public trust in the healthcare system would be diminished or even violated."
  achievable_goal: "Within 12 months of receiving funding, the Cyber Insecurity Initiative will have completed most of the first two phases of its plan, and the third phase will be underway. The planning phase consists of securing appropriate permissions from hospitals and healthcare professionals for participation. We have already begun this process by approaching top-level administrators and healthcare/hospital associations for buy-in. The planning phase also includes designing questionnaires and interview guides; the formative work for this activity is already complete. \r\n\r\nThe assessment phase involves scheduling and conducting interviews with EHR technology buyers, users, disaster managers, administrators, and compliance officers. This is where the majority of the labor will be.  The principal goal is data collection.\r\n\r\nThe analysis phase consists of thorough statistical analysis of the data for the purpose of developing recommendations. We anticipate beginning this phase within one year of receiving funding. The final phase, recommendations, will be completed in the second year of the Cyber Insecurity Initiative. "
  major_challenges: "Challenge 1: Some healthcare technology buyers, users, disaster managers, administrators, and compliance officers may be reluctant to participate. In many cases, these individuals are generally aware of such cybersecurity concerns (or perceptions), but do not want the issue examined in detail by an outsider to the hospital or hospital organization. They may not want attention placed on their institution’s weaknesses. \r\n\r\nStrategy 1: Gain buy-in and active support from top-level administrators and healthcare/hospital associations. Help them understand how it is in their organizations’ best interests to proactively study and address these problems. Have them require or encourage their subordinates to participate.  Assure them that all information is confidential and no data will be attributed to any individual, hospital or hospital group. We will give them the opportunity to do either a person-to-person survey or a text-based survey on their cell phones. \r\n\r\n\r\nChallenge 2: Scheduling and logistics. The Cyber Insecurity Initiative will require a substantial number of interviews with healthcare technology buyers, users, disaster managers, administrators, and compliance officers. These are busy professionals with limited time for participating in an endeavor like this. Our organization has excellent project managers, but they will be engaged full time with coordinating the schedules of both the healthcare professionals and the interviewers to accomplish our objective. This phase will take six to eight months to complete. \r\n\r\nStrategy 2: This challenge will be mitigated in a few different ways.  First, the Cyber Insecurity Initiative will ensure that top-level administrators and healthcare/hospital associations require appropriate employees to participate. Second, we will establish the population of potential interviews before starting, and then ensure that our completed interviews are representative of that population. Third, we will develop a text message based questionnaire to ensure that we can collect some data from healthcare professionals who are unable to provide interviews. Since an Internet survey may be troubling to some, we will make available a texting technology we developed that can record and catalog responses in the event that a face-to-face interview is not possible or desirable. This technology has been tested in Vietnam for disease surveillance as well as with the LA County Department of Health Services for assessing waiting room time."
  competition: >-
    To our knowledge, there are no other organizations conducting healthcare
    cybersecurity work like this. It is highly possible that for-profit
    cybersecurity organizations and the military might be doing related
    assessments and interventions in-house, but if so, their work is private and
    proprietary or classified. While other sectors, especially in the military,
    are being addressed, no organizations are currently seeking to address this
    issue holistically across the healthcare sector. We need a framework for
    best practices, and this has to come from the private sector.
  cost: >-
    The total anticipated cost of the initiative is approximately $250,000 over
    three years. This figure includes an assumption that our data collection
    will have very robust participation from prospective respondents. COMMET
    will aggressively seek funding from other sources to fund the initiative
    beyond the first year. However, the first-year funding provided by LA2050 is
    essential to get the project started. Also, as an alternative, the data
    collected during the first year with LA2050 funding can still be extremely
    valuable even if it the number of respondents is lower than desired. In
    other words, the project would still be a success if follow-on funding were
    not secured. The estimate of $250,000 is based on our ideal endstate, but we
    can still achieve a very worthwhile goal with one year of funding.

      Nearly all LA County’ hospitals have moved to electronic health records
      (EHR) in compliance with Federal regulations.  We have identified a
      mismatch regarding perceived versus actual vulnerabilities to these
      medical records. According to cybersecurity experts, electronic systems
      are much more vulnerable than we realize, which places LA County residents
      at great risk.  The next “Cyber Pearl Harbor” may be just around the
      corner. Our initiative will conduct a thorough vulnerability assessment of
      digital healthcare information in LA’s hospitals. The differences between
      cyber threat perceptions and actual vulnerabilities will be collected and
      analyzed to improve the security of LA County’s EHRs, thus making our
      population healthier and safer.

      The Cyber Insecurity Initiative has four main phases: planning,
      assessment, analysis, and recommendations. The planning phase will consist
      of securing appropriate permissions from LA County’s 122 licensed
      hospitals for participation, designing questionnaires and interview guides
      to conduct the vulnerability assessments, and coordinating the logistics
      to carry out the plan. There may be reluctance to have participants do an
      Internet survey, so we will do both a person-to-person as well as a text
      survey (using text to database technology we developed). All information
      will be confidential and not attributed to any one hospital. Only combined
      data will be shown in any report. The assessment phase involves scheduling
      and conducting interviews with five groups that have input. Special
      emphasis will be placed on achieving a balance of each hospital’s EHR
      buyers, users, emergency managers, administrators, and compliance
      officers. The questionnaires and interviews will provide the foundation of
      the vulnerability assessment, complemented by subject matter expert
      evaluations. The analysis phase requires thorough statistical analysis of
      all data. One key goal is to compare and evaluate vulnerability
      perceptions (as documented in the questionnaires and interviews) with
      actual vulnerabilities (as documented by cybersecurity professionals
      working with us as well as the literature). The recommendations phase
      begins with preparing reports and presentation materials, culminating with
      the presentation of findings with recommendations to improve cybersecurity
      to the entire hospital community.  Specific collaborators for the
      initiative’s findings and recommendations are the Hospital Association of
      Southern California, the Hospital Corporation of America (pending), the
      UCLA Center for Public Health and Disasters, the LA County EMS Agency,
      Red-E Consulting, and the California Hospital Association.

    answer: "The residents and visitors of LA County deserve and expect a safe, reliable healthcare system that protects their personal health information and provides unimpeded information to the appropriate provider in a timely manner. We are still at the dawn of a rapidly evolving technological age in healthcare. As our use of healthcare technology and cyberspace expands, so do the cybersecurity threats. The Cyber Insecurity Initiative will proactively address these concerns now, guiding our use of new technology in a safe and responsible manner. By 2050, healthcare will be totally dependent on technology and cyberspace, and the decisions we make now will allow LA to take full advantage of benefits offered by reliable, digitized healthcare while proactively minimizing the risks to the private health information of every individual who uses LA County’s hospitals. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, in a world that is shrinking due to technology, the Cyber Insecurity Initiative will keep Los Angeles at the forefront of healthcare in an increasingly globalized world. LA is a truly global city. As of 2013, there were 3.5 million foreign-born residents in LA County, and there are 135 different languages spoken here.  An estimated 1 in 10 residents is undocumented, and we have millions of international visitors every year. LAX is the sixth busiest airport in the world. For the health of our residents and visitors, our economic prosperity requires a world class healthcare system that maximizes the safe and responsible use of EHRs \r\n\r\nAdditionally, disasters and public health emergencies (such as biological terrorism and pandemic diseases) must be considered. If used to its potential, our healthcare system can use EHRs to mitigate the effects of a disaster and speed the public health emergency response and recovery. In fact, the effective use of EHRs even has the potential to mitigate a pandemic disease in its tracks. This can only be achieved, however, if the system is safe and secure. \r\n\r\nFinally, the routine and safe use of EHRs will drastically improve the daily lives of all LA County residents and visitors. Healthcare can be provided faster, more effectively, more efficiently, and cheaper thanks to the benefits of digitized healthcare. The Cyber Insecurity Initiative will ensure that we do so in a way that minimizes or negates the potential risks to digitized healthcare as we approach 2050. Residents will feel safer knowing that their medical privacy is secure and the system is working well."
  - name: who_benefit
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "The Los Angeles County healthcare system is an essential public service available to all residents and visitors. Whether or not a specific individual is using that system at any given point in time, everyone in LA can benefit from that public good. While our thoughts go first to the ill or injured who currently require hospital care, everyone in LA knows that the emergency medical services, emergency rooms, and world class healthcare in general are available to them and their families, if needed. Whether directly or indirectly, all of us benefit from our healthcare system. A well functioning healthcare system is essential to a vibrant, resilient community that can continue to thrive. In the new century, a comprehensive, long-term approach to healthcare cybersecurity is essential to the reliability and public trust of the healthcare system.\r\n\r\nThe cyber security concerns include security breaches, data loss, data for ransom, data corruption Internet breakdown, electrical breakdown, and other hazards that will negatively impact our population’s health in an environment where we are rapidly becoming more and more dependent on digitized healthcare records. Whether caused by a terrorist, a hacker, an accident, or a disaster, the residents and visitors of LA can be assured that their healthcare information is safer thanks to the Cyber Insecurity Initiative. \r\n\r\nThe following examples illustrate the extent of modern security breaches. As healthcare becomes increasingly dependent on digital records, the impact of these breaches will rise. According to a report by a cyber security firm called Redspin, there was a 97% increase in health record breaches from 2010-2011. Ponemon found that these breaches cost the hacked organization approximately $240 per record. In 2011, TRICARE lost their EHR back-up tapes, affecting almost 5 million patients. In 2010, the North Bronx Healthcare Network had 1.7 million EHRs stolen by a hacker. In 2009, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Tennessee had a hard drive with over one million EHRs stolen. These are among many examples of the mounting risks associated with the transition to EHRs. The costs associated with EHR security breaches are tremendous, and the potential impact on the public’s faith in healthcare providers is even greater.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the methodology we use can be adapted to other infrastructure, such as public health, public safety (police and fire), emergency management, transportation, electrical grid, public works, etc. "

    explanation: Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.
    answer: "Our healthcare is undergoing a rapid transition. New laws are changing the way we provide care, healthcare costs are still out of control, providers are changing how they interact with patients, public health is underfunded, hospital profit margins are reduced, and all medical records are being digitized. This “perfect storm” helps put the importance of proper cyber safeguards in a broader context. \r\n\r\nHealthcare is a critical “public good” that benefits all residents and visitors to LA directly or indirectly. The reality is that a safe and reliable healthcare system is assumed and expected. We take it as a “given”, without specificity or insight regarding how complex it really is.  On occasion, the news media highlights various concerns for the public, such as when the Los Angeles Fire Department was faulted for its slower-than-reported EMS response times in 2013. \r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, public knowledge of the benefits from the Cyber Insecurity Initiative should increase the percentage of residents who receive coordinated healthcare access in LA. They will be assured that the healthcare system is proactively and responsibly addressing cybersecurity as the use of digitized healthcare expands and evolves. \r\n\r\nThe reality, though, is that many residents and visitors will be less aware of how the metrics of the Cyber Insecurity Initiative are actually achieved. First, we seek to better align cyber threat perceptions of administrators, providers, etc. with the actual cyber risks. Second, we will make recommendations to close gaps and improve upon security. Because the data has not yet been collected or analyzed, these recommendations and the metrics derived from them cannot yet be concretely defined. This is why a grant from LA2050 is so essential.\r\n\r\nIn a general sense, the recommendations and metrics center on anticipated cybersecurity and reliability domains since breaches have already occurred, hospitals have been fined, and records have been corrupted. These domains include the frequency and extent of security breaches and/or data loss, the speed and reliability of data retrieval and transfer, the usage rates and reliability of EHRs, and so on. In many cases, the general public will not be aware of these metrics even though they are critical to the health and wellbeing of the population. They can be aggregated under the categories of “public trust in the safety and reliability of the healthcare system” and “public trust in the safety and reliability of EHRs.\""

    answer: "Metric 1 (process): Participation of healthcare technology buyers, users, managers, administrators, and compliance officers in the Cyber Insecurity Initiative. To be most effective, we will require the buy-in and support of these individuals to properly assess cybersecurity concerns. The support of both top-level administrators and hospital/healthcare associations will help with this endeavor, and we have already gained some support from them for the initiative. We will certainly be successful with even moderate participation from healthcare technology buyers, users, disaster managers, administrators, and compliance officers, but we seek to maximize their participation.\r\n\r\nMetric 2 (outcome): Gap between perceived cyber threats to the healthcare system (by healthcare administrators, providers, etc.) and actual threats. This measure will be initially assessed through questionnaires and interviews with a wide range of healthcare technology buyers, users, disaster managers, administrators, and compliance officers. The Cyber Insecurity Initiative will then analyze the results and provide recommendations to address the gaps between perceived and actual threats. \r\n\r\nMetric 3 (outcome): Public trust in the safety, accessibility, and reliability of the healthcare system is dependent on technology and cyberspace. This public trust is essential. Public concerns with the healthcare system, such as with the fire departments and emergency medical services response times, are fundamental to the trust in the healthcare system. The EMS system in LA County has already started using EHRs from the moment of first contact with patients (before they even get transported to the hospital). The Cyber Insecurity Initiative can provide recommendations to assess and improve the public’s trust in the emergency medical services system. This can also eventually be extended to other parts of the county’s infrastructure."
  - name: two_lessons
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Lesson 1: In our experience many healthcare technology buyers, users, disaster managers, administrators, and compliance officers are either unaware of or do not fully appreciate the cybersecurity risks to healthcare data.  This lesson is based on consultation with cybersecurity professionals, the literature, and anecdotal information regarding the perceptions of healthcare professionals. This lesson, as well as the desire to have a resilient, robust system in place, is what prompted the need for the Cyber Insecurity Initiative. The extent and scope of the mismatch between cybersecurity and healthcare professionals will be determined and analyzed. Furthermore, many healthcare professionals are reluctant to participate in this type of research because it shines a light on a sensitive issue that they do not fully understand nor want to make public. In other words, they may not want to share their concerns. This is why buy-in and active support from top-level administrators and healthcare/hospital associations is critical.\r\n\r\nLesson 2: Black Swan (low probability, high impact) types of disasters are not part of our daily routine. Thus, many cyber concerns are handled outside the knowledge of the general public. The public’s trust in the healthcare system includes a basic assumption that cybersecurity issues are appropriately addressed. The public is not aware that many healthcare technology buyers, users, disaster managers, administrators, and compliance officers lack a full multidisciplinary appreciation of the cybersecurity risks to their personal health information. Were such knowledge to become widely publicized, then the public’s trust of the healthcare system would be diminished. That’s why it’s so important for the Cyber Insecurity Initiative to be funded. With funding we can proactively address these cybersecurity concerns now, before vulnerabilities can be exploited or new risks can develop. If a current or emerging vulnerability of cybersecurity was exploited without a program like the Cyber Insecurity Initiative to address it, the public trust in the healthcare system would be diminished or even violated."

    answer: "Within 12 months of receiving funding, the Cyber Insecurity Initiative will have completed most of the first two phases of its plan, and the third phase will be underway. The planning phase consists of securing appropriate permissions from hospitals and healthcare professionals for participation. We have already begun this process by approaching top-level administrators and healthcare/hospital associations for buy-in. The planning phase also includes designing questionnaires and interview guides; the formative work for this activity is already complete. \r\n\r\nThe assessment phase involves scheduling and conducting interviews with EHR technology buyers, users, disaster managers, administrators, and compliance officers. This is where the majority of the labor will be.  The principal goal is data collection.\r\n\r\nThe analysis phase consists of thorough statistical analysis of the data for the purpose of developing recommendations. We anticipate beginning this phase within one year of receiving funding. The final phase, recommendations, will be completed in the second year of the Cyber Insecurity Initiative. "
  - name: major_challenges
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Challenge 1: Some healthcare technology buyers, users, disaster managers, administrators, and compliance officers may be reluctant to participate. In many cases, these individuals are generally aware of such cybersecurity concerns (or perceptions), but do not want the issue examined in detail by an outsider to the hospital or hospital organization. They may not want attention placed on their institution’s weaknesses. \r\n\r\nStrategy 1: Gain buy-in and active support from top-level administrators and healthcare/hospital associations. Help them understand how it is in their organizations’ best interests to proactively study and address these problems. Have them require or encourage their subordinates to participate.  Assure them that all information is confidential and no data will be attributed to any individual, hospital or hospital group. We will give them the opportunity to do either a person-to-person survey or a text-based survey on their cell phones. \r\n\r\n\r\nChallenge 2: Scheduling and logistics. The Cyber Insecurity Initiative will require a substantial number of interviews with healthcare technology buyers, users, disaster managers, administrators, and compliance officers. These are busy professionals with limited time for participating in an endeavor like this. Our organization has excellent project managers, but they will be engaged full time with coordinating the schedules of both the healthcare professionals and the interviewers to accomplish our objective. This phase will take six to eight months to complete. \r\n\r\nStrategy 2: This challenge will be mitigated in a few different ways.  First, the Cyber Insecurity Initiative will ensure that top-level administrators and healthcare/hospital associations require appropriate employees to participate. Second, we will establish the population of potential interviews before starting, and then ensure that our completed interviews are representative of that population. Third, we will develop a text message based questionnaire to ensure that we can collect some data from healthcare professionals who are unable to provide interviews. Since an Internet survey may be troubling to some, we will make available a texting technology we developed that can record and catalog responses in the event that a face-to-face interview is not possible or desirable. This technology has been tested in Vietnam for disease surveillance as well as with the LA County Department of Health Services for assessing waiting room time."

      To our knowledge, there are no other organizations conducting healthcare
      cybersecurity work like this. It is highly possible that for-profit

      assessments and interventions in-house, but if so, their work is private
      and proprietary or classified. While other sectors, especially in the
      military, are being addressed, no organizations are currently seeking to

      The total anticipated cost of the initiative is approximately $250,000
      over three years. This figure includes an assumption that our data
      collection will have very robust participation from prospective
      respondents. COMMET will aggressively seek funding from other sources to
      fund the initiative beyond the first year. However, the first-year funding
      provided by LA2050 is essential to get the project started. Also, as an
      alternative, the data collected during the first year with LA2050 funding
      can still be extremely valuable even if it the number of respondents is
      lower than desired. In other words, the project would still be a success
      if follow-on funding were not secured. The estimate of $250,000 is based
      on our ideal endstate, but we can still achieve a very worthwhile goal
      with one year of funding.
