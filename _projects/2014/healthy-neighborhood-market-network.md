Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  The Los Angeles Food Policy Council builds the capacity of small "mom n’ pop"
  store owners in ‘food desert’ communities to thrive as good food businesses
  and civic leaders! Through our Healthy Neighborhood Market Network, we connect
  LA’s multi-ethnic, multi-lingual neighborhood market owners to food industry
  experts, government reps and community advocates who share skills, resources
  and mentorship. Our cross-discipline trainings combine business development,
  civic leadership and health and nutrition fields.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Our goal is to train 100 neighborhood markets and entrepreneurs across Los
  Angeles County within 12 months as good food business leaders. By reaching
  this number of businesses, we aim to support new leadership in the movement to
  ensure all communities have access to Good Food!
   
   As we do every year, we will offer three major trainings for neighborhood markets and food entrepreneurs, one conducted in Korean, one in Spanish and a large multi-lingual gathering called “Healthy Foods, Healthy Businesses.” This year, we are excited to unveil our complete multi-discipline curriculum which is specifically designed for neighborhood retailers and entrepreneurs serving low-income communities in Los Angeles. The seminars help businesses achieve “triple-bottom” line impacts, helping them grow their business, sell a healthier product and better serve the community. 
   
   The curriculum is taught by the LA Food Policy Council’s diverse network of industry, government and non-profit professionals who bring decades of experience in food retail, wholesale, distribution, public health and community development. Topics covered include marketing, merchandising, store design, procurement and vendor relationships, profitability of fresh food, financing, store upgrades, health, nutrition and community partnerships. Participants walk out with an action plan for their new healthy business and tons of new contacts to help them along the way. 
   
   Seminars are held in South Los Angeles, Boyle Heights or Mid-City, where there is a high concentration of neighborhood markets and the greatest need for more healthy food options. This year, we are excited to hold our first-ever “train the trainers” event for healthy neighborhood market owners who are ready to share what they have learned with their peers. We believe in the leadership and experiential know-how of small business owners and have seen that peer-to-peer learning makes a huge impact. 
   
   How do we reach neighborhood market owners and food entrepreneurs? To date, we have touched over 400 small food businesses in “food desert” neighborhoods by putting our boots on the ground and reaching out. Every year, our multi-lingual (Korean and Spanish speaking) staff spend countless hours walking the block and visiting store owners across LA to learn about their business needs and connect them to resources. We also circulate newsletters and radio advertisements and partner directly with business associations. We’re ready to grow the Network!
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Growing Good Food businesses where they’re needed most! Did you know that
  almost 90% of grocery retail stores in South LA and Boyle Heights are small
  neighborhood markets? Did you also know that millions of dollars leave these
  neighborhoods every year in grocery sales made elsewhere? Imagine if ALL
  neighborhood markets offered wholesome grocery foods? Our strategy is to
  invest in existing businesses to help them expand healthy food options and
  keep money in the neighborhood! Within 1 year, at least half of our storeowner
  participants (50 stores!) will carry fruits and vegetables. That translates to
  about 100,000 residents with new and improved access to healthy food right in
  their neighborhoods.
   
   Creating community at the neighborhood market. Mom n’ pop markets already act as community hubs in many neighborhoods, where locals share tips and friendly chisme while picking up their daily goods. How can we take that kind of neighborhood connectivity to the next level? Our project facilitates partnerships between markets and their local neighborhood institutions like schools, clinics, libraries, churches and neighborhood councils to unite together as “Good Food Neighbors.” That means they’ve pledged to spread the word about the good eats now available at their local corner store. The store becomes the site of healthy cooking demos, smoothie sampling and health consultations. Working together, market owners and their neighbors create a safe, clean, community-serving space. It’s a “win-win!”
   
   Lifting up the leadership of neighborhood markets for Good Food. We believe that in order to create a Good Food system in LA, we need to invest in the leadership of those who have been historically disenfranchised. Neighborhood markets in LA are mostly Korean, Latino or African-American family-run businesses. Many are immigrants or first-generation, with limited formal education. We’ve found that they have a TON of great ideas about improving their communities. Through public speaking, media and peer teaching, the Healthy Neighborhood Market Network is a forum for store owners to participate in civic and policy discussions on what can create economically just, vibrant and healthy communities.
   
   In LA 2050, we see diverse neighborhood market owners CONNECTED to fellow food businesses, neighborhood leaders, government reps and each other in mutually beneficial ways that improve the health of communities through good food, local business and increased civic participation.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  • Low-income food entrepreneurs. Healthy Neighborhood Market Network
  participants leave our trainings with a business plan to integrate new healthy
  food products successfully. With new Network connections and LAFPC staff by
  their side, storeowners will have support to implement their dreams. We expect
  many store owners to see an increase in customers, sales and community
  support. These neighborhood markets gain access to Good Food resources from
  marketing and merchandising to leadership skills building and community
  outreach. Many will pursue new partnerships and capital investments that will
  benefit their businesses.
   
   • Residents in neighborhoods with limited healthy food choices. Residents benefit from expanded choices for places to buy fresh fruits, vegetables and other wholesome food products. By making the “healthy choice the easy choice,” residents’ prospects for improved diet and health go up. This is especially great for young people, the elderly and transit-dependent, who rely more on nearby-by neighborhood markets for food. Hopefully, over time, this will lead to a decrease in diet-related health challenges like diabetes and obesity, which impact low-income communities of color disproportionately. 
   Also, new connections between store owners and community can generate mutual growth opportunities. In one case, a team of high school students partnered with their local merchant to survey youth on their interest in healthy food, create marketing materials, and plan a block party for the “grand re-opening” of the store as a healthy market. In turn, the store owner acted as a mentor and hosted two students as interns.
   
   • The neighborhoods. When retail businesses invest in their stores, the whole neighborhood benefits. Revitalized food retail improves commercial corridors, creates destinations and strengthens neighborhood identity. As neighborhood markets become active community hubs for sharing health resources, this also means safer, more walkable and connected neighborhoods. It’s a way to invest in low-income neighborhoods while mitigating displacement, since local businesses are more likely to employ and spend their money locally. We target the trainings and services to store owners in historically disinvested neighborhoods with limited healthy food options. Most Healthy Neighborhood Market Network storeowners hail from South Los Angeles, Boyle Heights, East Los Angeles, Mid-City and Koreatown, East Hollywood and Northeast San Fernando Valley.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  The heart of the Healthy Neighborhood Market Network is collaboration! The
  whole idea to bring business and leadership education to neighborhood food
  businesses came from partners in the LA Food Policy Council Working Group on
  Healthy Food Retail & Food Equity, which includes friends from non-profits
  like Community Health Councils, PolicyLink, Community Coalition, Business
  Resource Group, and API Obesity Prevention Alliance. We have also benefited
  immensely by collaborating with industry pros who have dedicated their time
  and skills to support mom n’ pop stores. Here are some of the individuals who
  have shared their talents for this project as trainers and content experts:
  Michael Powell (brand strategist, Shook Kelley), David Kaufman (Manager,
  Unified Grocers), Bryan Libit (architect), Barnaby Montgomery (CEO, Yummy.com
  Markets), Sharon Evans (CEO, Business Resource Group), Daniel Tellalian
  (Principal, Emerging Markets inc/CA FreshWorks Fund), Jill Overdorf (Executive
  Chef, Cooseman Shipping International), Rudy Espinoza (Executive Director,
  Leadership for urban Renewal Network (LURN)), Jeff Biddle and Ashley Gibbons
  (Whole Foods Market), Michelle O’Grady (Team Friday), Sirena Pellarollo (Viva
  la Vida Holistic Health), Helena Jubany and Robert Chavez (Founder and General
  Manager, Fresco Community Market.) We also always partner with a variety of
  community development finance organizations and local government agencies who
  provide direct services for small stores, including Pacific Asian Consortium
  in Employment (PACE), Vermont Slauson Community Development Corporation,
  Valley Economic Development Corporation, Kiva Zip and the wonderful staff at
  the LA County Department of Public Health. We have worked with all of these
  awesome individuals and organizations over the past 3 years, and they will
  continue to be valued and essential partners in the success of the Healthy
  Neighborhood Market Network. 
   
   Three factors that are critical to our collaborations: (1) Passion for food equity: the idea that all communities deserve access to fresh, affordable food (2) A shared belief that we need to reach across silos in order to make long-lasting change. We need diverse talents, expertise and perspectives to get the kind of food system change we all hope for, and (3) The demonstrated success of the “collective impact” model: all our powers combined will ensure equitable opportunities for education and well-being in the future.
