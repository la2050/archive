    LA Agri-Corps is a leadership pipeline that builds community capacity to
    transform neighborhood food environments and regional food systems by
    preparing urban youth to serve as co-creators and stewards of sustainable
    urban farms, public orchards, and community gardens. We envision Un Jardin
    Para Todos, a garden for everyone in every community, from pots on
    windowsills to rooftop gardens, and micro-farms synergistically acting
    together to increase availability and accessibility of fresh organic produce
    in low-income underserved communities. 10 Agri-Corps interns will develop
    core competencies in agro-ecology while receiving extensive training in
    community organizing to build a base of 100 Youth HEALers (Health Education
    & Action Leaders).
  implement: "1) Agri-Corps Internships:  Agri-Corps interns complete Proyecto Jardin's urban farm apprentice program, an 8-month project-based learning experience presented in two phases corresponding to cool and warm crop-growing seasons. Phase 1 begins in Fall 2014, with an emphasis on cool season crops and their nutritional and healing benefits. We will use our signature GoodFood Changemaker curriculum, and adaptation of curriculum developed by UC Santa Cruz Center for Agroecology & Sustainable Food Systems, supplemented by consultation with local immigrant farmers who posses deep wisdom and extensive experience in traditional sustainable agriculture. PJ's GoodFood Changemaker curriculum consists of three learning modules: (1) Agro-ecology, (2) Food Systems Literacy, and (3) Community organizing, followed by a 40 hour practicum in community organizing. Together, these learning units synergistically  guide participants to attain core competencies in organic food production, understanding root causes of food system issues, and organizing effectively for policy/systems change. Upon completion of Phase 1, Agri-Corp Interns will continue to Phase 2 in Spring 2015, to apply learned farming skills while expanding knowledge about growing warm season crops and their nutritional/health benefits.   \r\n2) Community Organizing for Outreach & Base-building: In spring 2015, AgriCorps interns will begin recruiting new garden volunteers and presenting workshops, cooking demos, and garden tours at The Wellness Center. Each AgriCorps member will be responsible for building a base of 10 supporters/volunteers who understand community food justice issues in context of larger food system challenges. This cadre of food system leaders, will be recognized as Youth Health Education & Action Leaders (HEALers), and will strengthen organizational capacity to reach and retain youth participants in garden activities and enhance community efforts to transform Boyle Heightsâ€™ food environment through policy and systems change.\r\n3) Community Organizing for Education/Awareness: Our 10 AgriCorps Interns and 100 Youth HEALers will be based at the newly designed Community Wellness Center located at the Historic LA County Hospital, splitting their time between our on-site demonstration urban farm and Proyecto Jardin's original training garden at White Memorial Medical Center. They will be trained to use our G.L.A.M. community engagement tools: Greet, Listen, Assess, Motivate, to inspire & mobilize support. "
  impact_live: "LA Agri-Corps helps make LA the healthiest place to live today because it:\r\n1) Strengthens community capacity to create neighborhood food environments that are culturally revenant, healthy, and linked to improving community economic development and the built environments.\r\n2) We plan to promote sustainable agriculture by encourage cultivation of edible crops that are drought tolerant and/or native to dry, desert climates, such as teary beans, watermelon, peppers, okra, eggplant.\r\n"
  who_benefit: "1) Youth who need jobs, work development skills.\r\n2) Underserved low-income communities that lack access to fresh, organic, quality produce and experience the economic, health, and social impacts of grocery store red lining. \r\n"

    LA Conservation Corps focuses on greening and initial construction. THey
    have been a good supportive partner to Proyecto Jardin, and we will continue
    to collaborate with LACC. However, PJ is more intentionally focused in the
    agriculture aspect of youth development and this will actually complement
    and strengthen the efforts of LACC.

  impact_metrics: "Access to healthy food: AgriCorps interns work with community organizations, schools, and local residents to increase capacity to maintain productive food growing gardens year round. Interns engage with Proyecto Jardin to reactivate and expand the organization's Community Supported Agriculture program, a food distribution strategy that also operates as a social enterprise venture to support the gardens sustainability goals while increasing access to fresh produce. \r\n\r\nTree Canopy & Air Quality: We will add 22 new fruit trees to at The Wellness Center.\r\n\r\nHealth outcomes are improved when people engage in gardening to grow food because they increase consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables, thereby deducting obesity and related chronic disease such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and asthma. Additionally, gardening improves well being by reducing stress, anxiety, and depression. \r\n\r\nThe number of households living below the self-sufficiency standard will be reduced because youth will receive financial compensation for their work as interns. Stipends they receive contribute to the family's household income.\r\n\r\nCommunities are ultimately more resilient when economic development opportunities are linked to health and social benefit programs, such as urban agriculture."
Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Project partners will engage residents and advocates in a campaign to adopt
  Vision Zero (V0) policies in the City of Los Angeles and at least two other
  jurisdictions in Los Angeles County with high rates of fatalities from vehicle
  collisions and/or political leadership on road safety. The campaign will
  combine outreach, collaborations, media and advocacy to educate the public and
  policy makers about the need for and benefits of V0. Project partners will
  kick off the campaign with a 'shoe in' event at Los Angeles City Hall
  displaying 100 pairs of shoes representing the approximately 100 pedestrians
  killed each year in the City by vehicle drivers. The campaign will involve the
  public in developing and advocating for V0 through monthly workshops and walks
  in communities throughout the City of LA and at least two other cities. 
   
   Workshops will be creative exercises led by James Rojas in which community residents use model-building through a V0 lens to envision how their local streets can become safe healthy routes and places. Los Angeles Walks will lead walks in these same communities to allow residents to identify conditions that contribute to unsafe streets as well as changes they want to see on their roads and sidewalks. 
   
   Feedback from workshops and walks will help project partners develop a V0 platform to guide advocacy. Participants in these workshops/ walks will be organized to advocate for safer streets and adoption of V0 policies. Streetsblog Los Angeles will provide media coverage of V0 campaign activities and road safety issues to generate additional interest in the issue. To strengthen the campaign, partners will also link with other advocacy and community organizations, Neighborhood Councils and environmental groups to collaborate on a V0 platform. 
   
   After engaging and mobilizing residents and partners, the project will arrange meetings with policy makers responsible for street safety such as municipal Departments of Transportation, Police Departments, and City Council persons to advocate for introduction and adoption of Vision Zero principles as legislation and/ or packages of administrative actions. We will assist in making contact with the city staff and leaders using our connections, but the most compelling testimony will come from friends and families of victims of vehicle collisions and community members who face dangerous streets on a daily basis. The project will help community residents become the voice of Vision Zero.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Vision Zero will make LA the healthiest place to live by drawing attention to
  road safety concerns, by saving lives and preventing injuries, and by
  unlocking the health benefits of increased walking, cycling and social
  interactions. Our goal is to empower communities and residents to become the
  voice for Vision Zero to make traffic safety a higher priority for the city.
   
   Road safety is a critical public health challenge facing Los Angeles. Unsafe driving kills and injures tens of thousands of residents. It further harms public health by discouraging residents from walking and cycling. Motor vehicle crashes are the third leading case of preventable death in Los Angeles County for all age groups. In the City of Los Angeles alone, 31,012 people per year -including 2790 pedestrians and 1771 bicyclists - are killed or severely injured in vehicular-related collisions. These deaths and injuries have a ripple effect beyond their immediate tragedies by creating an often-accurate perception that our streets are designed to speed cars along rather than to create good routes and places for people. 
   
   Dangers from vehicles therefore discourage active transportation, reducing the extensive health benefits or walking and cycling. Vision Zero for Los Angeles will help make Los Angeles the healthiest place to live today by increasing awareness of the need for safer streets and accelerating transformation of road design and regulation. By 2050, Vision Zero will have been achieved, saving tens of thousands of lives and preventing hundreds of thousands of severe injuries. 
   
   Free from the fear of getting killed or injured by vehicles, more residents will walk and bike for transportation and recreation, leading to improved fitness, physical and mental health, a reduction in diseases related to overweight and physical activity, a reduction in exposure to air pollution, and greater levels of social interaction.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Vision Zero will benefit all residents since vehicle crashes and unsafe
  streets harm people from all corners of Los Angeles County, from all walks of
  life and drivers, passengers, cyclists and pedestrians. Some groups will see
  especially high benefits from safer roads. These include children and young
  adults since vehicle crashes are the leading overall cause of death for Los
  Angeles County children ages 5 to 14 and the second overall cause of death for
  residents 15-44. 
   
   Residents who regularly walk and bike will also see tremendous benefits. Pedestrians account for a third of traffic fatalities in Los Angeles City, almost triple the national average, and three percent of those killed by vehicles are cyclists, nearly double the national average. Pedestrians and cyclists will be able to travel with fewer worries and enjoy the benefits of the types of changes brought by Vision Zero: better designed streets, slower vehicle speeds, and better enforcement. 
   
   Low income residents who are more likely to not own a car and to live in places with busy roads and higher rates of deaths and injuries to pedestrians and cyclists, will also see disproportionate benefits from Vision Zero. Women and the elderly, who currently are less likely to bicycle because of the discomfort of riding in fast and dangerous traffic, can be expected to bicycle at greater rates when Vision Zero is implemented.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Vision Zero Los Angeles is a confirmed collaboration between Streetsblog Los
  Angeles, Los Angeles Walks, and Place It. The project will also partner with
  and provide stipends to ten community organizations (to be chosen later) on
  workshops, walks, and mobilizing members to advocate for Vision Zero. We will
  partner with Neighborhood Councils, bicycle and pedestrian advocacy
  organizations, bicycle co-ops and other community partners serving low income
  communities such as Pacoima Beautiful or Building Healthy Communities in Boyle
  Heights, South L.A. and Long Beach. The three main partners have worked
  together before and bring complementary strengths to a campaign for Vision
  Zero. 
   
   Streetsblog Los Angeles reaches thousands of readers with award-winning journalism on street issues in the Los Angeles region with a strong focus on safety for pedestrians and cyclists, including in-depth coverage of South Los Angeles, Boyle Heights, Long Beach and Santa Monica. 
   
   Los Angeles Walks is a pedestrian advocacy organization working to make walking safe, convenient and fun for all Angelinos. LA Walks has experience advocating for policy change and engaging residents through local walks to evaluate the walkability of the streets in various neighborhoods and to experience the history, culture and architecture of the area. 
   
   Place It founder James Rojas has led hundreds of creative planning workshops to allow community residents to envision how their built environment and streets can change for the better. These three organizations have formally and informally collaborated in the past as individuals leaders and/or as organizations. 
   
   Factors that are critical to the success of the proposed collaboration include: (1) the ability of community members to learn about road safety and opportunities to help shape and advocate for Vision Zero; (2) the capacity of the project to inspire participants in workshops and walks to advocate for safer streets; and (3) the ability of advocacy to influence decision makers to adopt Vision Zero policies. We believe that the Vision Zero Los Angeles team can provide synergy through community-based journalism and outreach, community-engaged advocacy and community-led visioning for safer streets in order to achieve project goals.
