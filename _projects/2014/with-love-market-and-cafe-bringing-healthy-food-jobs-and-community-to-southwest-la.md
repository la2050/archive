"
  implement: >-
    We have already secured a leased space for the market, cafe, and our offices
    to be located, have a staff team who are finishing the market and cafe's
    product assortment via confirmations from local farmers/producers, and
    distributors. We also have a team of graphic and architect designers
    finishing the store and cafe's interior and exterior design. We continue to
    establish and further connections with other community groups/organizations,
    and are strategically outreaching to the community to fill various
    employment roles. 
  impact_create: >-
    The goal of With Love Market and Cafe is to create a successful and
    empowering model for addressing the Southwest LA's need for food access and
    employment opportunities in the urban context. Our vision is that if we are
    able to replicate this business model throughout greater Los Angeles, there
    should be a significant impact on the amount of support given to local
    producers and infrastructure for increasing food access across LA county. 
  who_benefit: >-
    The project is currently seeking to serve the roughly 100,000 residents
    within the 5 square mile radius surrounding the location of the market and
    cafe. Of this population, 55% of residents are latino, 20% are African
    American, 15% are Asian, and the rest are white or other. Our main focus is
    to serve the families that live in the area. Within the past 3 years, this 5
    square radius area has lost 3 or its 6 full-service grocery stores, making
    it harder for families and residents to access groceries on a regular
    basis.

  evaluate: "1.) The local rate of diabetes: - Diabetes is 3.8 times the average rate of diabetes in the greater LA area, and so concentrating on providing healthier options for this community is an area we are seeking to monitor alongside our non-profit partners.\r\n\r\n 2.) Decreasing government assistance:  During our surveying of the community, 1/5 of residents were on government assistance for food, with an average of $225 per month. Our current initial goal is to have 50% of our hired staff be from the surrounding neighborhood and community, with that percentage increasing to 75% by the end of the market's first year in business. \r\n\r\n3.) Community Needs: Our free weekly community classes and events will serve to provide residents with a sense of pride, community, and betterment for their families in the way of health and personal/relational skill-building. We are looking to keep track of all members, volunteer, staff and otherwise, who engage in our programs and seek to be further involved. We plan on keeping track of our volunteer, outreach and participant base to see how networking and sense of community increases in the surrounding area. "
  two_lessons: "1.) Learning about the connection between diabetes and poor eating to performance in schools. We want to focus on prevention rather than intervention in this area, which has contributed to our overall vision of affordable healthy food products for purchase in combination with free regular classes for nutrition education, tutoring etc. \r\n \r\n2.) We have learned from various forms of international aid that certain structures do not work to rebuild an economy, but rather keep them in a state of poverty. However, strategies of support such as the microloan market has proven to transform economies. Being aware of this, we want to be a group that is empowering rather than just giving aid, so that the South LA economy can itself be transformed by the many capable residents who live here. "
  achievable_goal: >-
    Between now and our opening day, we are waiting to receive approval  from
    the bank for  funding, which should happen in next 2 months.  We have our
    lease in space, and are waiting on city approvals for construction and to
    build it out. We have the staff and structure in place for opening day, and
    currently we are on track to open within the next 3-6 months. We also have a
    great deal of community support!
  major_challenges: "1. Funding: we have the location, staff, food sources, and local interest already and have started our renovation processes for the space. The challenge is finding funding for the remaining portion of our startup costs. We have already raised $100,000 through our crowdfunding campaign and are actively seeking grants and loans to cover the remainder.\r\n\r\n2. Local food culture: because of food injustice, local residents are inured to the effects of poor eating habits on their health. Many of these eating habits are now ingrained into their behavior, especially since fast food often costs less than fresh groceries. We are responding to this by tapping into the deep desires of household heads to see their families live healthy fulfilling lives. Our initial interactions with locals has shown us that the problem lies not with interest (studies show that low-income residents are just as likely to purchase local and organic, provided it is affordable) but with availability. \r\n"
  competition: >-
    There are a number of other groups in Southwest LA that have the goal of
    bringing healthy food to the neighborhood. We consider ourselves to be
    working towards the same goal, and therefore not to be in competition with
    them. A number of these groups are ones that we have consulted with in some
    capacity, including Community Health Coalitions, LA Green Grounds, Community
    Services Unlimited, FAME, local farmers markets, and numerous others. The
    uniqueness of our project is that we are a for-profit market aiming to sell
    healthy food to residents at affordable prices on a regular schedule. Many
    of groups do not have the economy of scale or infrastructure to provide the
    services we want to offer in a reliable manner.
  cost: >-
    To be able to start the business, we are looking for about $650,000. We have
    successfully crowdfunding over $110,000 of that amount and are looking to
    secure a loan for $400,000, leaving a gap that needs to be filled by
    investors and grants.
  budget: "- 40,000 dollars to renovate the space behind the building for outdoor seating in the cafe\r\n- 20,000 will be for furniture, plants, and awning, etc.\r\n- 20,000 will be for construction and remodel of the store\r\n- 20,000 to buy a refrigerated truck for local pick up and drop off\r\n- 10,000 will be for refencing and setting up the back storage area\r\n- 30,000 to hire staff for the local delivery and organization, 1 person to oversee delivery"
