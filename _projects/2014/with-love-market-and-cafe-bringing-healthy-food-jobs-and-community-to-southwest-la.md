Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  We have already secured a leased space for the market, cafe, and our offices
  to be located, have a staff team who are finishing the market and cafe's
  product assortment via confirmations from local farmers/producers, and
  distributors. We also have a team of graphic and architect designers finishing
  the store and cafe's interior and exterior design. We continue to establish
  and further connections with other community groups/organizations, and are
  strategically outreaching to the community to fill various employment roles.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  The goal of With Love Market and Cafe is to create a successful and empowering
  model for addressing the Southwest LA's need for food access and employment
  opportunities in the urban context. Our vision is that if we are able to
  replicate this business model throughout greater Los Angeles, there should be
  a significant impact on the amount of support given to local producers and
  infrastructure for increasing food access across LA county.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The project is currently seeking to serve the roughly 100,000 residents within
  the 5 square mile radius surrounding the location of the market and cafe. Of
  this population, 55% of residents are latino, 20% are African American, 15%
  are Asian, and the rest are white or other. Our main focus is to serve the
  families that live in the area. Within the past 3 years, this 5 square radius
  area has lost 3 or its 6 full-service grocery stores, making it harder for
  families and residents to access groceries on a regular basis.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: |-
