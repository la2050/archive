Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  We have already secured a leased space for the market, cafe, and our offices
  to be located, have a staff team who are finishing the market and cafe's
  product assortment via confirmations from local farmers/producers, and
  distributors. We also have a team of graphic and architect designers finishing
  the store and cafe's interior and exterior design. We continue to establish
  and further connections with other community groups/organizations, and are
  strategically outreaching to the community to fill various employment roles.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  The goal of With Love Market and Cafe is to create a successful and empowering
  model for addressing the Southwest LA's need for food access and employment
  opportunities in the urban context. Our vision is that if we are able to
  replicate this business model throughout greater Los Angeles, there should be
  a significant impact on the amount of support given to local producers and
  infrastructure for increasing food access across LA county.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The project is currently seeking to serve the roughly 100,000 residents within
  the 5 square mile radius surrounding the location of the market and cafe. Of
  this population, 55% of residents are latino, 20% are African American, 15%
  are Asian, and the rest are white or other. Our main focus is to serve the
  families that live in the area. Within the past 3 years, this 5 square radius
  area has lost 3 or its 6 full-service grocery stores, making it harder for
  families and residents to access groceries on a regular basis.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: |-
  Two major confirmed collaborators are LA Kitchen and Homeboy Industries:
   
   Our factors for success with LA Kitchen include:
   - Co-purchasing and sourcing our local produce together
   - Hiring chefs that LA Kitchen trains through their programs for our market and cafe's prepared food assortment.
    - Hiring people from LA Kitchen to do food prep for the Market and Cafe
   
   Our factors for success with Homeboy Industries includes:
   - Hiring individuals that Homeboy trains through their programs
   - Sourcing some products from Homeboy
   - Use Homeboy as a resource for employing members coming out of their programs

  two_lessons: "1.) Learning about the connection between diabetes and poor eating to performance in schools. We want to focus on prevention rather than intervention in this area, which has contributed to our overall vision of affordable healthy food products for purchase in combination with free regular classes for nutrition education, tutoring etc. \r\n \r\n2.) We have learned from various forms of international aid that certain structures do not work to rebuild an economy, but rather keep them in a state of poverty. However, strategies of support such as the microloan market has proven to transform economies. Being aware of this, we want to be a group that is empowering rather than just giving aid, so that the South LA economy can itself be transformed by the many capable residents who live here. "
  achievable_goal: >-
    Between now and our opening day, we are waiting to receive approval  from
    the bank for  funding, which should happen in next 2 months.  We have our
    lease in space, and are waiting on city approvals for construction and to
    build it out. We have the staff and structure in place for opening day, and
    currently we are on track to open within the next 3-6 months. We also have a
    great deal of community support!
  major_challenges: "1. Funding: we have the location, staff, food sources, and local interest already and have started our renovation processes for the space. The challenge is finding funding for the remaining portion of our startup costs. We have already raised $100,000 through our crowdfunding campaign and are actively seeking grants and loans to cover the remainder.\r\n\r\n2. Local food culture: because of food injustice, local residents are inured to the effects of poor eating habits on their health. Many of these eating habits are now ingrained into their behavior, especially since fast food often costs less than fresh groceries. We are responding to this by tapping into the deep desires of household heads to see their families live healthy fulfilling lives. Our initial interactions with locals has shown us that the problem lies not with interest (studies show that low-income residents are just as likely to purchase local and organic, provided it is affordable) but with availability. \r\n"
  competition: >-
    There are a number of other groups in Southwest LA that have the goal of
    bringing healthy food to the neighborhood. We consider ourselves to be
    working towards the same goal, and therefore not to be in competition with
    them. A number of these groups are ones that we have consulted with in some
    capacity, including Community Health Coalitions, LA Green Grounds, Community
    Services Unlimited, FAME, local farmers markets, and numerous others. The
    uniqueness of our project is that we are a for-profit market aiming to sell
    healthy food to residents at affordable prices on a regular schedule. Many
    of groups do not have the economy of scale or infrastructure to provide the
    services we want to offer in a reliable manner.
  cost: >-
    To be able to start the business, we are looking for about $650,000. We have
    successfully crowdfunding over $110,000 of that amount and are looking to
    secure a loan for $400,000, leaving a gap that needs to be filled by
    investors and grants.
  budget: "- 40,000 dollars to renovate the space behind the building for outdoor seating in the cafe\r\n- 20,000 will be for furniture, plants, and awning, etc.\r\n- 20,000 will be for construction and remodel of the store\r\n- 20,000 to buy a refrigerated truck for local pick up and drop off\r\n- 10,000 will be for refencing and setting up the back storage area\r\n- 30,000 to hire staff for the local delivery and organization, 1 person to oversee delivery"

We plan on keeping track of our volunteer, outreach and participant base to see how networking and sense of community increases in the surrounding area. "

    answer: "1.) Learning about the connection between diabetes and poor eating to performance in schools. We want to focus on prevention rather than intervention in this area, which has contributed to our overall vision of affordable healthy food products for purchase in combination with free regular classes for nutrition education, tutoring etc. \r\n \r\n2.) We have learned from various forms of international aid that certain structures do not work to rebuild an economy, but rather keep them in a state of poverty. However, strategies of support such as the microloan market has proven to transform economies. Being aware of this, we want to be a group that is empowering rather than just giving aid, so that the South LA economy can itself be transformed by the many capable residents who live here. "

      Between now and our opening day, we are waiting to receive approval  from
      the bank for  funding, which should happen in next 2 months.  We have our
      lease in space, and are waiting on city approvals for construction and to
      build it out. We have the staff and structure in place for opening day,
      and currently we are on track to open within the next 3-6 months. We also
      have a great deal of community support!

    answer: "1. Funding: we have the location, staff, food sources, and local interest already and have started our renovation processes for the space. The challenge is finding funding for the remaining portion of our startup costs. We have already raised $100,000 through our crowdfunding campaign and are actively seeking grants and loans to cover the remainder.\r\n\r\n2. Local food culture: because of food injustice, local residents are inured to the effects of poor eating habits on their health. Many of these eating habits are now ingrained into their behavior, especially since fast food often costs less than fresh groceries. We are responding to this by tapping into the deep desires of household heads to see their families live healthy fulfilling lives. Our initial interactions with locals has shown us that the problem lies not with interest (studies show that low-income residents are just as likely to purchase local and organic, provided it is affordable) but with availability. \r\n"

      There are a number of other groups in Southwest LA that have the goal of
      bringing healthy food to the neighborhood. We consider ourselves to be
      working towards the same goal, and therefore not to be in competition with
      them. A number of these groups are ones that we have consulted with in
      some capacity, including Community Health Coalitions, LA Green Grounds,
      Community Services Unlimited, FAME, local farmers markets, and numerous
      others. The uniqueness of our project is that we are a for-profit market
      aiming to sell healthy food to residents at affordable prices on a regular
      schedule. Many of groups do not have the economy of scale or
      infrastructure to provide the services we want to offer in a reliable
      manner.
