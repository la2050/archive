  With Strivers.LA, students are prompted to share their exam calendars with
  people who can support their academic success (employers, parents, romantic
  partners, or roommates). Strivers.LA gives students time management tools and
  involves their social networks and employers in their education. 
   
   New Economy Campaigns and the Strivers.LA team have already built a working beta version of the Strivers.LA application, which is the first step to creating the kind of comprehensive application students need. We'd like to reach more students in order to get the needed feedback to improve the application. 
   
   Funds from the 2014 LA2050 grant would be used to support:
   ● Developing a revised version of the application in early 2015 based on student feedback from testing during summer and fall 2014.
   ● Planning and developing new components of the application to facilitate participation, increase automation, and expand scalability.
   ● Developing a method for gamifying student participation, creating class vs. class and school vs. school metrics.
   ● Recruiting students to use the app (incentives) and funding community manager support (staff time)
   ● Supporting the Los Angeles City College Foundation in providing incentives and outreach to current LACC students.
   ● Partnership outreach to local businesses to seek ongoing sponsorship and marketing incentives to students.
   ● Planning and implementing a comprehensive evaluation strategy.
   
   We will recruit students to use the Strivers.LA app through:
   ● Online outreach via Facebook, twitter, and Instagram, using a content-driven strategy to engage students with fun and useful content about school success (and dealing with exams).
   ● In-person outreach through Los Angeles City College Foundation, student organizations, and nonprofits.
   ● Recruitment incentives for students to reach out to their peers and refer them to Strivers.LA. 
   
   We aim to create a culture of focus on exams, planning ahead for studying, and increasing student engagement generally on community college campuses in LA, improving education outcomes and increasing graduation rates.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Currently, California is one of the toughest places to be a community college
  student in the country. Our college completion rates are far below the
  national average, and our students arrive from high school without good study
  habits; they often require remedial classes before they can begin
  college-level work. Strivers.LA can help students today improve their study
  habits and increase their likelihood of completing a degree or certificate.
  Young people (as well as older students) who are balancing part- or full-time
  work with studies and family obligations understandably have a tough time.
   
   Securing a college degree is central to a student having an increased standard of living throughout his or her life. Some studies show a lifetime differential of more than $1M between those completing a four-year degree and those who do not. Increased graduation rates result in better outcomes for the community overall. 
   
   Over the long term, Strivers.LA will help to create a culture of academic success and responsibility within our community college system and in the LA region overall, by recognizing the students who are working hard to succeed, as well as the employers and educators who are supporting them. We’ll give local businesses a way to recognize and reward students who are making an extra effort (and potentially find future employees through our network someday). We’ll give local leaders a way to see which businesses and campuses are stepping up to support students. 
   
   We’ll celebrate all of LA’s Strivers as they learn and succeed.
   
   In 2050, if our initiative is successful, our community college system will have educated tens of thousands of better-prepared, employed and employable students, ready to work in growth industries that will power the LA economy for the subsequent 50 years; healthcare, technology, hospitality and tourism. We’ll demonstrate success by increasing the percentage of students who successfully complete college; we’ll improve profitability for businesses by reducing personnel and retraining costs, encouraging increased hiring and local investment. Most importantly, we’ll have created deep relationships between our community college system and local employers, developing a collaboration that understands that supporting student workers will result in an improved economic environment for the entire community.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Our Strivers.LA app is designed for low-income, working community college
  students, but any high school or college student can benefit from its
  reminders to study, prompts to share their academic calendar with friends,
  family, and employers, and motivational study messages. Our app will benefit
  anyone who is seeking to better their life and employment prospects through
  education – it can be used freely by anyone who signs up to participate.
   
   Nationally, 74% of students worked during the academic year, and 15 % are working full-time. Juggling work and school schedules leads to skipped classes, inadequate sleep, and even no-show exams. Research shows that every extra hour a student works above 10 hours/week lowers GPA by a measurable amount. Sixty percent of community college students work more than 20 hours per week and 25% work more than 35 hours per week. Among 18 countries tracked by the OECD, the United States finished last (46 percent) for the percentage of students who completed college once they started it. In California, fewer than 28% of students who begin a two-year college program complete a degree within six years; for those studying part time, this percentage falls to less than 12%, in both cases significantly below the national average. Los Angeles must improve its college completion rates in order to reach its economic potential. 
   
   Through our partnership with Los Angeles City College Foundation, we’ll be focusing our work on engaging LACC students. LACC's student population is among the most diverse in the nation. Of the College’s more than 18,000 students, 54% are immigrants to the United States and 45% are first-generation college students. Current LACC students are low-income, with 70% receiving a Board of Governors waiver for tuition and 53% receiving some form of financial aid. A number of students are even homeless and hungry. Through our partnership with LACCF, we will be able to engage directly with this population, helping to bolster the employment that most students use to support their educational goals and improving their likelihood of completing an associate’s degree or transferring to a four-year school.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  STRIVERS.LA is being incubated by New Economy Campaigns, a digital strategy
  consultancy that has created national and global programs to leverage
  technology for social impact. Creating accessible ways to engage with causes
  that matter is the cornerstone of New Economy Campaigns’ work. The New Economy
  Strivers team includes a digital strategist, a designer/ developer, a project
  manager, an educator whose experiences teaching inspired the project, and a
  community manager. Collectively, we bring more than 75 years of experience to
  building Strivers. Our team is made up of "strivers" and we believe in
  educational access for all. 
   
   Strivers.LA is partnering with Los Angeles City College Foundation for implementation of our app and outreach to students. LACCF is a 501(c)(3) corporation established in 1968 to increase the educational opportunities for students of LACC. The Foundation creates and promotes new initiatives to meet unfunded programmatic needs of the school community. LACCF will ensure access to LACC students during product development, pilot, and implementation phases, as well as assist with program evaluation.
   
   Los Angeles City College serves approximately 18,000 students annually, and they have one of the most diverse, and most economically challenged student bodies in California. LACCF is confirmed as a partner and participated in the development of this application, and will receive a portion of the grant funds if we are successful, in order to support on-campus outreach. LACCF provides us with direct, on-campus access to students, and will act as a liaison with the College overall and with the broader Los Angeles Community College District.
   
   If our partnership with LACCF is successful, we hope to expand this partnership throughout the Los Angeles Community College District, which serves more than 250,000 students annually.
   
   New Economy Campaigns has consulted for LACCF on digital outreach and engagement strategies, and we have developed a strong working relationship. 
   
   The three elements essential for the success of this partnership are:
   ● Reciprocal benefit for each partner; Strivers.LA will have access to a student population that’s perfect for our application, and LACCF will have access to a digital tool that will help its students succeed.
   ● Common goals: wanting to help struggling students succeed and complete a degree or certificate program, or successfully transfer to a four-year institution.
   ● Clear expectations and communication.
