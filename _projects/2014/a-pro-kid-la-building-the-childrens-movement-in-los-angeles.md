Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Too many of LA’s 2.3 million children lack access to the necessary
  supports—such as high-quality early learning programs, rigorous K-12
  academics, and access to critical health care services -- that they need to be
  able to reach their full potential. For example, a third of LA’s kids lack
  access to preschool opportunities, less than 50 percent of 3rd graders score
  proficiently on English language arts standardized tests, and nearly 1 in 6
  dropout of high school.
   
   If all of the LA based education, business, parent, civil rights, community, and faith- and ethnic-based groups that care about children were connected, not only would LA’s children’s outcomes dramatically improve, but LA would be the national model for children’s advocacy.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Changing government policies is the fastest and most efficient way to scale
  effective programs and ensure the resources needed to provide all children
  with the necessary supports. What stands in the way of these necessary policy
  actions is the lack of connection. While there are countless organizations,
  businesses, and individuals in LA that care deeply about improving outcomes
  for youth, most of them tend to operate in siloes, by issue and/or sector. If
  a significant number of these entities were connected, the power of a unified
  voice would have an exponential effect and secure powerful policy change for
  kids. 
   
   The Children’s Movement resulted from years of strategic planning, prompted by the question, “Almost everyone cares about kids, so why do kids fare so poorly in the policy making process?” The answer is that the broad-based diverse public support for children’s well-being has been too diffuse to have the impact it should on policymaking priorities. Consequently, better organized interest groups with much less public will behind them have been able to divert policymakers’ attention away from fixing the issues undermining children’s successful development. 
   
   As the state’s only umbrella research, policy development, and advocacy children’s organization focused on the full range of issues affecting children’s health, education and safety, Children Now is uniquely positioned to connect the many diverse organizations and people that are Pro-Kid to one another and enable their collective action. 
   
   The Children’s Movement is a game-changing approach. Traditional and non-traditional allies will, for the first time, be coordinated in their actions and unified in their message so children are the top priority. Currently, the Movement represents a grassroots network of nearly 1,000 (and counting) business, education, parent, civil rights, faith-, community-, ethnic-based and other organizations, as well as thousands of individuals that can be effectively mobilized to represent children’s interests across a variety of important policy issues. Upon joining the Movement, members are provided timely research information, policy updates, easy-to-use tools, and advocacy opportunities they need to learn about key kids’ issues and participate in collective action campaigns to influence change on the local and state level.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  LA is the vital center of the Movement. Children Now opened an office in
  downtown LA last year and brought on full-time staff to start scaling our
  model throughout LA. We are also building this innovative model in other
  communities throughout the State, but given LA’s size and diversity, it is
  imperative that the Movement is scaled here. LA is the ideal place to be the
  most connected for children’s advocacy, because if the Movement is scaled
  here, there is no excuse for not scaling it throughout California, and, then,
  given California’s size and diversity, throughout the country.
   
   And employing the Movement to make LA the best place to connect around kids is not rhetoric and not just a sound plan. We have successfully implemented it – now we need to scale it. We already have more than 200 L.A.-based Movement members, and they already played a major role in historic school equity reform and investments in early education. By scaling the Movement in L.A., with support from LA 2050 – bringing the number of LA movement members to over a thousand and connecting all of them- we will have the strong base of diverse, concentrated support that will surpass the power of any other interest group and produce the significant policy changes needed to ensure every child has the opportunity to reach their full potential.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  The Children’s Movement targets the wide array of health, education, and child
  welfare policy issues that affect children. As such, this project will benefit
  all children in Los Angeles, and especially the high percentages of children
  who are low-income (over 50%), English learners, and of color, as these
  children often face a disproportionate number of barriers to attaining the
  necessary quality education and health supports. Without these supports, these
  children are at risk for not being prepared for work, college and life.
   
   Policy change allows for scaling so every child has access to the necessary supports. As noted, the Children’s Movement has already helped secure policy change that is improving the lives of LA’s children. The Local Control Funding Formula, an early success story of the Movement, provides additional resources for the nearly 400,000 English language learners, over one million students living in poverty, and over 9,000 foster youth in LA. The Movement also played a critical role in ensuring this year’s state budget agreement provides over $65 million to LA children for quality early learning opportunities.
   
   At scale, The Movement will help ensure that all children have access to quality early and K-12 education, but will also help ensure major policy change in other critical areas, such as home visiting, developmental screenings, oral health and summer and after school.
   
   While improving outcomes for kids is the primary goal of scaling the Movement, this project will also benefit the countless LA organizations, businesses, and individuals that care deeply about kids but are often frustrated by the slow rate – if any – change to improve their quality of life. These stakeholders often lack the capacity and resources to effectively participate in the policymaking process. And even when they do, they are disconnected from others, so their voice is often marginalized. The Movement will benefit all of these Pro-Kid supporters by providing them with easy, opt-in opportunities, tools, and resources to meaningfully engage in civic processes, and by bringing them together to amplify their voice. 
   
   And -- as the future of children impacts the future of the community as a whole --we see all of L.A. benefiting from this project.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  Collaboration and connecting partners is the core of the Movement. What
  differentiates the Movement other models is that we are not just building
  coalitions among the advocacy groups that are already active on individual
  children’s issues, but we are (1) breaking down the siloes among those
  existing coalitions to generate broad support for each issue, and (2)
  expanding children’s advocacy to be inclusive of populations and groups that
  are rarely invited to be part of this conversation – such as individual
  businesses, community groups and faith-based congregations.
   
   Our 200+ cohort of current LA Movement members demonstrate this diversity, and also show how powerful the Movement can be at scale. Current members range from major organizations such as 211 LA, YMCA Metro LA, KIPP LA, the LA Chamber of Commerce, LAUP and Paros Los Ninos to organizations such as Vision to Learn, Junior League of Los Angeles, Los Angeles United Methodist Urban Foundation, LA Best Babies Network, Girls Club of Los Angeles, Coalition for Human Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, Los Angeles African American Women Political Action Committee, Acacia Blue Asset Management, National Council of Jewish Women of Los Angeles, Un Mundo de Amigos Preschool, Women’s Lawyers Association of Los Angeles, Foster Care Counts, Los Angeles Public Library, Gift of Life Resource Center, InnerCity Struggle, Trinity Baptist Children’s Center, Venice Family Clinic, Westwood Neighborhood Council, Pacific Asian Consortium in Employment, Compton Youth Activities League, League, BOOST Collaborative, Westside Kinship Support Services, Oak Grove Center, Hacienda La Puente USD, United Friends of the Children, CASA of LA, LA School Report, Asian Youth Center, and many others (please see www.childrennow.org/join for complete list of 900+ current members). 
   
   Each of these members brings added benefit to the project. This project is all about connecting the diverse support that already exists for kids in LA. Every new member that joins helps further the goal of making LA the most connected place for kids in the country.
