Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  The implementation strategy involves a year-round semester-based curriculum
  program, made fiscally sustainable by generating revenue by selling produce
  through local food vendors including farmers markets, schools, and
  restaurants. 
   The LATTC Urban Farming Project will build and retrofit four sites that will include the District 9 Central Avenue Field Office rooftop, LATTC campus “Magnolia” Farm at ground level, and a mezzanine level LATTC “Terrance” Farm. In addition, students will also build four experimental yet functional art constructs to grow food, selected based on feasibility from twelve digitized, virtual art constructs. The art constructs to grow food incorporate both hydroponics and soil-based planters: vertical walls, movable green towers, raised beds, and a green house. The goal is to challenge the students’ creativity, while simultaneously creating something functional and unique.
   Plan of Action-
   -Expand training and outreach to the community
   -Provide direct community support by providing project templates 
   -Engage local drivers and forces by integrating their resources, i.e. Plan for Healthy LA, Green Streets LA, Food Policy Council, etc.
   -Advance the urban farming design build field by providing virtualization and templates ready to use
   -Introduce and integrate to existing practices at LATTC
   -Support a new interdisciplinary LATTC ASO Club for Sustainability
   -Explore the possibility and implementation to design and build innovative solutions for community's to grow food on their own
   -Analyze interdisciplinary capabilities and relationships between multiple departments and disciplines to grow local food using innovative design strategies for food productivity, products, tools, green house shelters and energy/water calculations. 
   -Use high-end tools to virtualize, simulate, verify and locally manufacture design build solutions; digital fabrication, geospatial tools, enterprise solutions, social media and others.
   -Develop a business model to implement urban farming and education with quantifiable outcomes.
   -Develop and implement multiple design templates drawings to build prototype
   -Develop and implement an online platform for collaboration, hybrid learning and frictionless participation by all stakeholders
   -Show return of investment for low water, high productivity and small space for multiple design solutions and techniques; aquaponics, hydroponics, vertical walls, etc.
   -Build prototypes on sites physically and digitally
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  LATTC Urban Farming program will design, build and teach innovative Urban
  Farming applications in colleges, homes, communities, businesses, and
  restaurants. This program will explore the interdepartmental potential and
  capabilities of the college to better serve our communities. This program will
  use digital, parametric virtualization for visualization, strategic planning,
  communication and green solutions for the use of water, sun, air and soil. The
  program will work close with local drivers, stakeholders and forces in the
  city to facilitate scalable and duplicable solutions in the local and global
  ‘green economy’. This program will explore local manufacturing by using
  digital fabrication and biomimicry design. As the program grows, the design
  and build templates will be available for the community via iTUNES University,
  YouTube and interfaces. This new classroom material will be user friendly and
  easily implemented locally and in other parts of the world. LATTC Urban
  Farming projects will show return on investment with high productivity, small
  spaces, low water usage and a community that thrives. It will support lesson
  plans for existing courses in Architecture, Drafting, Sustainable Landscaping,
  Plumbing, Photovoltaics, Manufacturing, Culinary Courses and others. It will
  also ultimately seek transferability status to programs like UCLA, USC,
  CalPoly, and others.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Many urban areas in Central and South Los Angeles do not have sufficient
  access to groceries stores, yet are overrun with fast food eateries and
  convenience/liquor stores. Their choices of diet are limited and it is
  difficult, costly, and time consuming to obtain wholesome fruits and
  vegetables. There is a growing plague of obesity and diabetes in America and
  other countries that have adopted the habit of relying on the dominance of
  pre-prepared foods. Overworked mothers often do not have the choice of feeding
  their families plant, fruit, enzyme and mineral rich, traditional meals. Half
  the nutrition in vegetables is lost within a day of being picked. Urban
  agriculture would provide these families with choices, develop a deeper
  understanding of health, and offer the joy of a living and growing
  relationship to our source of nutrition, in these concrete landscape
  environments. Additionally, the potential for personal and public savings on
  healthcare, a community that encourages better decisions through hands on
  lessons in cultivating life, and the possibility of entrepreneurial endeavors
  would only serve to benefit us all. 
   Los Angeles is a 21st century mega-city with over 4 million citizens (10 million in LA County), the food shed of which extends 200 miles. Astonishingly enough, rooftops amount to 20% of the land mass occupying exposed space in Los Angeles. Many of these spaces are functionally dormant, and serve as heat islands in a city burdened with enough environmental challenges as it is. Additionally, there are ten thousand vacant parcels that benefit no one except absentee landlords or developers not from the community. All these spaces are primed for agricultural activation, and upcoming legislative packages are finally beginning to incentivize the involvement of micro-enterprise to do so.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: |-
  Confirmed Partners/Collaborators-
   
   Councilmember Curren Price, 9th District
   Councilmember Price has been very supportive of this endeavor by giving us the roof of his field office headquarters to grow food on, and by consistently championing equitable urban ag policy.
   
   Los Angeles Open Acres
   The LA Open Acres project is launching soon, and a relationship is in place whereby Trade Tech lends its built-environment infrastructure support to increase the capacity and breadth of upcoming parcel activations.
