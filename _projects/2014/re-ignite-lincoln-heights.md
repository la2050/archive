Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Lincoln Heights has a rich history of activism and civic engagement. LEAD will
  re-ignite Lincoln Heights. LEAD will develop a Community Needs Assessment to
  better understand priorities and social needs of Angelenos in Lincoln Heights.
  The results of the assessment will give the community, elected officials, and
  the local neighborhood council quantitative and qualitative data of community
  priorities, needs, and the social issues where most services and resources are
  needed. This is the first step in bringing more attention to Lincoln Heights
  and helping Angelenos shed light on what they really care about. We then will
  empower the community to become more civically active through voting and
  participation in their local neighborhood council.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  By reaching out to local organizations, churches, neighborhood councils, and
  community centers, we will survey a minimum of 300 people. Through our
  existing program LEAD YouthBuild, a leadership development program that
  empowers youth ages 18-24 to finish their high school diplomas and connect
  them to meaningful careers and post-secondary education, we will incorporate
  community outreach and organizing into our curriculums and give them
  service-learning experiences that will include surveying people in the
  community. This project will serve many purposes that include: gathering of
  important community data, leadership opportunities for young people through
  hands-on organizational and community outreach experience, and it will shed a
  positive light on young people who would otherwise be seen as disengaged and
  at-risk. In partnership with UCLA's Urban Planning Department, the surveys
  will be analyzed and data will be compiled together to serve as documented
  research describing community needs and the gaps between current conditions
  and desired conditions. The results will then be presented to the community
  through educational forums where dialogues will be facilitated about civic
  responsibility and engagement in order to address community needs. LEAD will
  then launch a voter registration campaign that will register a minimum of 200
  people to vote. We will then host a series of workshops and educational forums
  with the goal of empowering people to become active voters and active
  participants in local neighborhood council meetings and city council meetings.
  This is the first step in trying to impact community change is by defining
  community needs and creating leadership opportunities that will ignite
  dialogues with those that have the power to make the changes happen. But civic
  participation does not stop there. LEAD will facilitate and organize working
  groups between Angelenos of Lincoln Heights, local elected officials, and the
  local neighborhood council to find common grounds and create strategies and
  plans that would address community needs. The goal would also be to identify
  services and resources that currently exist in the community and identify gaps
  where services and resources are needed.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  When politics and voting is brought up in the community, we commonly hear
  things like “My vote does not matter,” “One person can’t make a difference,”
  and “Politicians don’t care about me and what I think about.” Part of the
  sentiment may derive from the community feeling not fully represented when
  decision are being made about their community. When you begin to ask people
  what they personally care about and what solutions they would propose, many
  times you receive genuine and innovative responses. What if we can restore a
  voice to the community of Lincoln Heights? What if we can gather enough people
  together and create dialogues where people begin to discover that they are not
  alone in wanting community change? What if we can build bridges between
  elected officials and the neighborhood council and changes begin to happen?
  Small changes and small victories can lead to big changes and big victories.
  The community will feel represented. This project will begin to pull out
  information from the community and make that information carry value. By
  creating dialogues between community members, the neighborhood council, and
  elected officials, commonalities can be discovered or produced and evidence of
  changes happening will ignite the community to want to stay connected and stay
  active.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  This project will benefit the community of Lincoln Heights which has a
  population of about 31,500 people. The community is predominantly
  Hispanic/Latino with the next largest group of people is Chinese/Asian. The
  unemployment level is 12.7% and 36% of the population there is living at or
  below the poverty level. The high school dropout rate in Lincoln Heights is
  33%. This project will aim to impact the following groups of people: 
   Young people ages 18 – 24: In addition to the services offered by LEAD YouthBuild, the organizational skills they will develop and community outreach training and experience they will obtain through this project will serve as work experience and leadership experience benefiting them in future employment and/or college enrollment. 
   People ages 25 – 40: This population will be targeted for the community needs assessment, educational forums, and dialogues that will be facilitated. 
   People ages 40 – 75: This population will also be targeted for the community needs assessment, educational forums, and dialogues that will be facilitated. 
   Each of these groups of people have needs and priorities that may be different from other age ranges. For real and long lasting connectedness to happen, all sides need to be heard and all sides need to be part of the dialogues that will take place with local elected officials and the neighborhood council.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: |-
  The following is a list potential partners and collaborations: 
   Lincoln Heights Neighborhood Council is the body representing the community we currently serve. We will gain support for our LEAD YouthBuild and invite them to become thought partners in the implementation of this project. Our goal is to build a good relationship with the neighborhood council, share their goals with the community and build a bridge for more community participation to happen. 
   L.A. WORKS is a non-profit organization that manages a volunteer action center out of Lincoln Heights. Their goal is to empower Angelenos to address pressing social issues through volunteerism and community collaborations. In partnership, we can create a community volunteer project where people would conduct the community needs assessment surveys. 
   Metro North WorkSource Center serves the area of Northeast Los Angeles. Their facility will be a great place for surveying people. They have on average 30-50 visitors per day. 
   YouthBuild Charter School of California currently serves as our educational partner for LEAD YouthBuild. We will work with them to incorporate a service-learning piece into our educational curriculum that would allow students to gain experience and training in community outreach. 
   UCLA is an existing partner of LEAD YouthBuild and will be helping us build a “College Career Center” for the community. Because of our existing relationship, we are able to reach out to the Urban Planning Department and partner with them in order to compile and analyzing the data generated by the community needs assessment surveys. 
   YouthBuild USA is a national organization comprised of 200+ youth development programs whose mission is to unleash the intelligence and positive energy of low-income youth to rebuild their communities and their lives. We are an affiliate of YouthBuild USA and are able to access and leverage pass-through grants that enhance our educational services, case management services, and leadership development. 
   We will also reach out to local churches and ask for support in getting the needs assessment surveys filled out by their members.
