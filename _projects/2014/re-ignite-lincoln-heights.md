    Lincoln Heights has a rich history of activism and civic engagement. LEAD
    will re-ignite Lincoln Heights.  LEAD will develop a Community Needs
    Assessment to better understand priorities and social needs of Angelenos in
    Lincoln Heights. The results of the assessment will give the community,
    elected officials, and the local neighborhood council quantitative and
    qualitative data of community priorities, needs, and the social issues where
    most services and resources are needed. This is the first step in bringing
    more attention to Lincoln Heights and helping Angelenos shed light on what
    they really care about. We then will empower the community to become more
    civically active through voting and participation in their local
    neighborhood council. 
  implement: >-
    By reaching out to local organizations, churches, neighborhood councils, and
    community centers, we will survey a minimum of 300 people. Through our
    existing program LEAD YouthBuild, a leadership development program that
    empowers youth ages 18-24 to finish their high school diplomas and connect
    them to meaningful careers and post-secondary education, we will incorporate
    community outreach and organizing into our curriculums and give them
    service-learning experiences that will include surveying people in the
    community. This project will serve many purposes that include: gathering of
    important community data, leadership opportunities for young people through
    hands-on organizational and community outreach experience, and it will shed
    a positive light on young people who would otherwise be seen as disengaged
    and at-risk. In partnership with UCLA's Urban Planning Department, the
    surveys will be analyzed and data will be compiled together to serve as
    documented research describing community needs and the gaps between current
    conditions and desired conditions. The results will then be presented to the
    community through educational forums where dialogues will be facilitated
    about civic responsibility and engagement in order to address community
    needs. LEAD will then launch a voter registration campaign that will
    register a minimum of 200 people to vote. We will then host a series of
    workshops and educational forums with the goal of empowering people to
    become active voters and active participants in local neighborhood council
    meetings and city council meetings. This is the first step in trying to
    impact community change is by defining community needs and creating
    leadership opportunities that will ignite dialogues with those that have the
    power to make the changes happen. But civic participation does not stop
    there. LEAD will facilitate and organize working groups between Angelenos of
    Lincoln Heights, local elected officials, and the local neighborhood council
    to find common grounds and create strategies and plans that would address
    community needs. The goal would also be to identify services and resources
    that currently exist in the community and identify gaps where services and
    resources are needed.  
  impact_connect: >-
    When politics and voting is brought up in the community, we commonly hear
    things like “My vote does not matter,” “One person can’t make a difference,”
    and “Politicians don’t care about me and what I think about.” Part of the
    sentiment may derive from the community feeling not fully represented when
    decision are being made about their community. When you begin to ask people
    what they personally care about and what solutions they would propose, many
    times you receive genuine and innovative responses. What if we can restore a
    voice to the community of Lincoln Heights? What if we can gather enough
    people together and create dialogues where people begin to discover that
    they are not alone in wanting community change? What if we can build bridges
    between elected officials and the neighborhood council and changes begin to
    happen? Small changes and small victories can lead to big changes and big
    victories. The community will feel represented. This project will begin to
    pull out information from the community and make that information carry
    value. By creating dialogues between community members, the neighborhood
    council, and elected officials, commonalities can be discovered or produced
    and evidence of changes happening will ignite the community to want to stay
    connected and stay active.  
  who_benefit: "This project will benefit the community of Lincoln Heights which has a population of about 31,500 people. The community is predominantly Hispanic/Latino with the next largest group of people is Chinese/Asian. The unemployment level is 12.7% and 36% of the population there is living at or below the poverty level. The high school dropout rate in Lincoln Heights is 33%. This project will aim to impact the following groups of people: \r\nYoung people ages 18 – 24: In addition to the services offered by LEAD YouthBuild, the organizational skills they will develop and community outreach training and experience they will obtain through this project will serve as work experience and leadership experience benefiting them in future employment and/or college enrollment. \r\nPeople ages 25 – 40: This population will be targeted for the community needs assessment, educational forums, and dialogues that will be facilitated. \r\nPeople ages 40 – 75: This population will also be targeted for the community needs assessment, educational forums, and dialogues that will be facilitated. \r\nEach of these groups of people have needs and priorities that may be different from other age ranges. For real and long lasting connectedness to happen, all sides need to be heard and all sides need to be part of the dialogues that will take place with local elected officials and the neighborhood council.  \r\n "
  collaboration: "The following is a list potential partners and collaborations: \r\nLincoln Heights Neighborhood Council is the body representing the community we currently serve. We will gain support for our LEAD YouthBuild and invite them to become thought partners in the implementation of this project. Our goal is to build a good relationship with the neighborhood council, share their goals with the community and build a bridge for more community participation to happen. \r\nL.A. WORKS is a non-profit organization that manages a volunteer action center out of Lincoln Heights. Their goal is to empower Angelenos to address pressing social issues through volunteerism and community collaborations. In partnership, we can create a community volunteer project where people would conduct the community needs assessment surveys. \r\nMetro North WorkSource Center serves the area of Northeast Los Angeles. Their facility will be a great place for surveying people. They have on average 30-50 visitors per day. \r\nYouthBuild Charter School of California currently serves as our educational partner for LEAD YouthBuild. We will work with them to incorporate a service-learning piece into our educational curriculum that would allow students to gain experience and training in community outreach. \r\nUCLA is an existing partner of LEAD YouthBuild and will be helping us build a “College Career Center” for the community. Because of our existing relationship, we are able to reach out to the Urban Planning Department and partner with them in order to compile and analyzing the data generated by the community needs assessment surveys. \r\nYouthBuild USA is a national organization comprised of 200+ youth development programs whose mission is to unleash the intelligence and positive energy of low-income youth to rebuild their communities and their lives. We are an affiliate of YouthBuild USA and are able to access and leverage pass-through grants that enhance our educational services, case management services, and leadership development.   \r\nWe will also reach out to local churches and ask for support in getting the needs assessment surveys filled out by their members. \r\n "

  evaluate: "In 12 months, we will activate 100 people in the community of Lincoln Heights in volunteerism and service who would otherwise not do it on their own. This will include surveying people in the community, participating in educational forums, participating in local neighborhood council meetings and city council meetings. Our ultimate goal is to inspire our community members to one day become neighborhood council members themselves.\r\nIn 12 months we will register a minimum of 200 people to vote of which 80% will be of Hispanic/Latino backgrounds. This will not just increase the number of registered voters but raise the number amongst a demographic that historically votes at low rates. \r\nIn 12 months, we will empower 25 community members to join local neighborhood council committees and/or run for a neighborhood council seat. \r\nIn 12 months, we will increase our Facebook likes to 1000.\r\nIn 12 months, we will increase our twitter followers by 100% (from 68 to 136). \r\n "
  two_lessons: >-
    During the 2013 mayoral election in Los Angeles, 222,300 people (12.4% of
    registered voters) voted in Eric Garcetti, the lowest voting numbers for
    newly elected mayors since the 1930’s. Only 5%-6% percent of the total
    population made the decision for the entire city. California’s population is
    about 38 million. Latinos represent about 32% of the California’s adult
    population but only 16% of them are likely to vote. Non-Hispanic Whites make
    up 46% of California’s adult population and 66% of them are more likely to
    vote. These two lessons/issues inform us Hispanics/Latinos in California are
    less likely to vote than that of Non-Hispanic Whites. By raising the
    Hispanic/Latino voting by just a few percentages, we can impact local and
    statewide elections. In the last Los Angeles mayoral election, a small
    increase in voting percentages could have easily changed the election
    outcome. What this information is also telling us is that full
    representation of all people in California is not being reflected in our
    electoral processes. Our political system is in need of individuals and
    communities to become more civically active in order for more of the
    population being represented when decisions are being made and when election
    are being decided.   
  achievable_goal: >-
    LEAD has built a great reputation locally and nationally and we have been
    able to build partnership with several individuals and organization. Our
    goal of putting forth a community needs assessment, followed by a voter
    registration campaign and dialogues between elected officials, the
    neighborhood council, and community members are goals that we have the
    capacity and knowledge to execute. Two members of our Board of Directors are
    connected to their local neighborhood councils: Hector Huezo is the Chair of
    the Neighborhood Council Alliance of River Communities and is a Neighborhood
    Council Budget Advocate; Albert Ramirez is a member of the Wilmington
    Neighborhood Council. In addition, another Board Member, Frank Alvarez, is a
    Senior Organizer with Los Alliance for a New Economy (LAANE), with more than
    10 years’ experience in community organizing, capacity building, and
    advocacy. They will help us put together a plan for working with Lincoln
    Neighborhood Council and help us navigate through local politics. They have
    years of experience in engaging community members in local politics and will
    be assets to us in this project. Because of our LEAD YouthBuild Program, we
    have ongoing programs which we can tap into and use for the benefit of this
    project. We will be able to leverage multiple streams of funding in
    conjunction with funding from LA2050. We have built a solid foundation of
    individual donors and supporters that we can easily tap into for support in
    this project. We are strategically located in the center of Lincoln Heights
    and our site is easily accessible to the community.  
  major_challenges: "One of the barriers we will face is getting the community to become open about sharing their feelings and viewpoints about social issues and what they care about. Within family settings, the workplace, and school, discussing social issues can be tricky and sometimes controversial especially when you encounter people who are really passionate about a particular subject. We will have to develop relationships with community members and leaders and utilize great communication strategies. Partnering up with existing organization and institutions like churches and schools can help us with initiating conversations and we can begin to build trust with community members. \r\nThe second barrier we will face is skepticism. As mentioned before, many people in Lincoln Heights do not have the best opinions about politics and the way local issues are being addressed. As we explain to people the changes that can come about through volunteerism, voting, and involvement in local politics, people will need to see small accomplishments in order to continue to stay engaged and motivated. We will facilitate the process of dialogues between the community, local elected officials, and the local neighborhood councils in order to show that community that they can be heard if the community continues to be active and connected. Our goal for the first 12 months will be to help the community find solutions for small scale issues and then continue to work with them to tackle bigger community problems. We want to make it visual for the community to see. Based on the information we get back from our surveys, we can show the community what areas of importance can be accomplished sooner and what issues will need continuous community participation in order to affect change. We need to do a lot of positive reinforcement to the people we will work with and the community at large. Posting flyers with positive messages and successes stories will be part of that strategy. \r\n "
  competition: "Southeast Asian Community Alliance (SEACA) is a non-profit that works to build an empowered community through leadership development, education, and advocacy, and community organizing. One of their focus areas is building youth leadership in the community of Northeast Los Angeles. \r\nLegacy LA is a community based non-profit organization whose mission is to make positive interventions in the lives of young people by offering alternatives to gangs and violence. The also build the capacity of young people to help them reach their full potential and equip them with the tools to transform their lives. \r\nYouthBuild Boyle Heights’ mission is to cultivate collaborative learning communities in which every student has the right to an authentic education and plays a meaningful role in creating positive social change. \r\nThese three organization have different aspects that can be complementary to what LEAD is trying to do. LEAD is unique in that we are building bridges between different age groups in the community that do not normally communicate or work together. We are going to incorporate this project into our educational curriculum and give young people service-learning opportunities that will translate into leadership development and job training skills. We can use this vehicle to spark the interest in young people to see the service sector as a place for potential careers. We are also in a unique position in that we have existing relationship with local elected officials, neighborhood councils, and community leaders and we can use this to better inform this project and influence the community in a positive way. Our approach to connecting Angelenos is to invite people from different walks of lives and different perspectives to the table when discussing community needs and solutions. Our use of social media in building supporters and igniting dialogues will set us apart from other organizations. \r\n "
  cost: >-
    We believe that this project is doable within the $100,000 limit. Our goal
    is tangible enough to make a dramatic impact in Lincoln Heights and it is
    within our capacity to accomplish. Our YouthBuild Program allows us to
    access young people of Lincoln Heights and they will help us capture the
    information and data we need to begin and understand the community’s needs
    better. We also have a pool of 15-20 YouthBuild Alumni from different parts
    of the county that would be able to help us in our voter registration
    campaign and many of them have verbally committed. We have two grant writers
    who are volunteering their time to research grants and write proposals to
    support our work which will include this project. To support this project,
    we have already applied to a grant from YouthBuild USA’s LEAP Initiative
    that will support our goal in developing a community needs assessment and
    engaging the community in a voter registration campaign.

  impact_metrics: "Rates of volunteerism: LEAD YouthBuild will incorporate of this project into our educational curriculum, and we will empower young people to volunteer in the community of Lincoln Heights. At minimum, 65 young people will volunteer and survey the community. At the same time gain leadership skills and job skills. We will invite community members to volunteer and instill in them the idea that service is the first steps they can take in making community change. One way they can serve their community is by attending local neighborhood council meetings and voicing their opinions. \r\nVoting rates by race: In 2001, 33.5% of registered casted a ballot. 17.9% of all registered voters’ casted ballots in the 2009 elections. During the 2013 Los Angeles Elections, 16% of all registered voters casted a ballot. It is evident that the number of active voters In Los Angeles has been dropping dramatically. In addition to registering new voters, we will reach out to registered voters that do not vote and find out why. We will identify areas of opportunity where elected officials and neighborhood councils can help address these issues. Lincoln Heights has a population of 31,410 of which 70% is Hispanic/Latino and 25% is Chinese/Asian. Our campaign will focus on these two groups.  \r\nParticipation in the local neighborhood council: Many people do not know what neighborhood councils are or do. We will create informational packets for community members to get to know the local neighborhood council, their committees, and their meeting schedules. We will include simple ways on how to participate and get involved. Our goal is to increase the attendance of community members at the local neighborhood council meetings. \r\nGovernment responsiveness to community needs: Dialogues will make it possible for the community to become aware of services and resources that currently exists in the community and elected officials and the neighborhood council can become aware of needs.\r\nTotal number of social media friends: LEAD’s Facebook fan page as 300 likes.. Our twitter account currently has 68 followers. We have created a buzz due to initiating dialogues about social issues like education, leadership development, and workforce development. We use “Twitter Parties” which is the collective use of a “hashtag” within a specified time with the goal of raising awareness. We will introduce this concept to the community of Lincoln heights and Northeast Los Angeles."
Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Lincoln Heights has a rich history of activism and civic engagement. LEAD will
  re-ignite Lincoln Heights. LEAD will develop a Community Needs Assessment to
  better understand priorities and social needs of Angelenos in Lincoln Heights.
  The results of the assessment will give the community, elected officials, and
  the local neighborhood council quantitative and qualitative data of community
  priorities, needs, and the social issues where most services and resources are
  needed. This is the first step in bringing more attention to Lincoln Heights
  and helping Angelenos shed light on what they really care about. We then will
  empower the community to become more civically active through voting and
  participation in their local neighborhood council.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  By reaching out to local organizations, churches, neighborhood councils, and
  community centers, we will survey a minimum of 300 people. Through our
  existing program LEAD YouthBuild, a leadership development program that
  empowers youth ages 18-24 to finish their high school diplomas and connect
  them to meaningful careers and post-secondary education, we will incorporate
  community outreach and organizing into our curriculums and give them
  service-learning experiences that will include surveying people in the
  community. This project will serve many purposes that include: gathering of
  important community data, leadership opportunities for young people through
  hands-on organizational and community outreach experience, and it will shed a
  positive light on young people who would otherwise be seen as disengaged and
  at-risk. In partnership with UCLA's Urban Planning Department, the surveys
  will be analyzed and data will be compiled together to serve as documented
  research describing community needs and the gaps between current conditions
  and desired conditions. The results will then be presented to the community
  through educational forums where dialogues will be facilitated about civic
  responsibility and engagement in order to address community needs. LEAD will
  then launch a voter registration campaign that will register a minimum of 200
  people to vote. We will then host a series of workshops and educational forums
  with the goal of empowering people to become active voters and active
  participants in local neighborhood council meetings and city council meetings.
  This is the first step in trying to impact community change is by defining
  community needs and creating leadership opportunities that will ignite
  dialogues with those that have the power to make the changes happen. But civic
  participation does not stop there. LEAD will facilitate and organize working
  groups between Angelenos of Lincoln Heights, local elected officials, and the
  local neighborhood council to find common grounds and create strategies and
  plans that would address community needs. The goal would also be to identify
  services and resources that currently exist in the community and identify gaps
  where services and resources are needed.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  When politics and voting is brought up in the community, we commonly hear
  things like “My vote does not matter,” “One person can’t make a difference,”
  and “Politicians don’t care about me and what I think about.” Part of the
  sentiment may derive from the community feeling not fully represented when
  decision are being made about their community. When you begin to ask people
  what they personally care about and what solutions they would propose, many
  times you receive genuine and innovative responses. What if we can restore a
  voice to the community of Lincoln Heights? What if we can gather enough people
  together and create dialogues where people begin to discover that they are not
  alone in wanting community change? What if we can build bridges between
  elected officials and the neighborhood council and changes begin to happen?
  Small changes and small victories can lead to big changes and big victories.
  The community will feel represented. This project will begin to pull out
  information from the community and make that information carry value. By
  creating dialogues between community members, the neighborhood council, and
  elected officials, commonalities can be discovered or produced and evidence of
  changes happening will ignite the community to want to stay connected and stay
  active.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  This project will benefit the community of Lincoln Heights which has a
  population of about 31,500 people. The community is predominantly
  Hispanic/Latino with the next largest group of people is Chinese/Asian. The
  unemployment level is 12.7% and 36% of the population there is living at or
  below the poverty level. The high school dropout rate in Lincoln Heights is
  33%. This project will aim to impact the following groups of people: 
   Young people ages 18 – 24: In addition to the services offered by LEAD YouthBuild, the organizational skills they will develop and community outreach training and experience they will obtain through this project will serve as work experience and leadership experience benefiting them in future employment and/or college enrollment. 
   People ages 25 – 40: This population will be targeted for the community needs assessment, educational forums, and dialogues that will be facilitated. 
   People ages 40 – 75: This population will also be targeted for the community needs assessment, educational forums, and dialogues that will be facilitated. 
   Each of these groups of people have needs and priorities that may be different from other age ranges. For real and long lasting connectedness to happen, all sides need to be heard and all sides need to be part of the dialogues that will take place with local elected officials and the neighborhood council.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: |-
  The following is a list potential partners and collaborations: 
   Lincoln Heights Neighborhood Council is the body representing the community we currently serve. We will gain support for our LEAD YouthBuild and invite them to become thought partners in the implementation of this project. Our goal is to build a good relationship with the neighborhood council, share their goals with the community and build a bridge for more community participation to happen. 
   L.A. WORKS is a non-profit organization that manages a volunteer action center out of Lincoln Heights. Their goal is to empower Angelenos to address pressing social issues through volunteerism and community collaborations.
