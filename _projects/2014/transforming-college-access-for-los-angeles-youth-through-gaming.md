  FutureBound’s mission is to create a suite of fun, inspiring, and educational
  games that will increase the number of youth preparing for, applying to, and
  finding success in college. FutureBound’s games are a research-based and
  highly innovative effort to ensure postsecondary educational opportunities for
  all students, particularly those from low-income households. Since 2009,
  FutureBound (formerly known as Collegeology) has been working with students
  and educators in its quest to design useful, effective, and fun games about
  college. To date, FutureBound has created three games: FutureBound, Mission:
  Admission, and Graduate Strike Force.
   
   FutureBound has tested these games with over 3000 diverse students to ascertain their impact. Our research has shown that these games increase students’ confidence or “self-efficacy” of their ability to attend college and take steps towards reaching a desired career. 
   
   Based on this initial success, FutureBound will expand on this work and provide its games on a significantly larger scale throughout LA. To accomplish this, we will leverage our partnerships to cost-effectively expand our reach and maximize the number of students we serve. A key part of this strategy will include working with school districts, libraries, after school programs, and college access networks to take advantage of the existing relationships these entities have with students and educators. To support these organizations, a portion of FutureBound’s grant budget will be allocated to training staff at these organizations in best practices for implementing the games. FutureBound will also provide web-based training and support resources for these individuals. 
   
   FutureBound will complement these efforts through a variety of activities, including significant use of social media and other marketing tools. To provide sufficient staffing for our efforts (training, web/content development), FutureBound will take advantage of its relationship with USC to recruit highly skilled personnel –graduate students and recent post-grads.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Over the past 25 years, Los Angeles (along with the rest of California) has
  fallen in US rankings and now lags behind many other areas in the production
  of college graduates. Based on forecasts by the National Center for Higher
  Education Management Systems (NCHEM), it is projected that 41% of jobs in 2025
  in California will require a college degree. Absent any significant
  improvements, NCHEM projects that only 37 percent of workers in California
  will have a college degree in 2025. The gap between the demands of the local
  economy and the supply of college-educated workers represents a serious
  impediment to an economically successful future for LA. 
   
   Despite government and institutional efforts to improve college access over many decades, fewer than 40% of LAUSD high school graduates currently attend some form of post-secondary education.
   
   To address these challenges, FutureBound has developed an innovative and engaging suite of educational video games that have significantly increased the number of youth—including under-served students—preparing for, applying to, and finding success in US colleges. The games have been proven to develop the skills needed to master the college readiness and entry process and to succeed in college and beyond. Game play extends developmentally sound practices of learning through play into the adolescent landscape like no other medium. Teens love games, especially technology-mediated games. Ultimately, games provide a fun space for gaining social capital related to college-going and career choice that cannot easily be replicated in conventional learning environments. All games are supported through wrap-around curricular activities and materials for teachers, counselors, and program advisors.
   
   With the LA2050 goal that every Los Angeles high school student will graduate and be ready for college and career, FutureBound is well positioned to support this goal. Through the use of FutureBound’s games, educators and practitioners will have the opportunity to cultivate college and financial aid application strategies that increase access to college by providing information about postsecondary and financial aid options. Additionally, our games will help cultivate college application and college choice strategies and will nurture critical thinking and decision-making skills related to college.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) encompasses 130 middle and 149
  high schools serving 112,749 and 138,778 students, respectively. LAUSD charter
  schools serve an additional 95,207 students. FutureBound’s goal is to extend
  game-based college access tools to all students in LAUSD’s middle and high
  schools. As a secondary population, we will also target other school districts
  in the LA region such as Inglewood and Culver City. 
   
   FutureBound’s games will benefit middle school and high school students in LA by delivering crucial college guidance, teaching college preparation strategies, and increasing their confidence in their own ability to go to college. The games will have a particular impact on underserved populations and first-generation college-goers who currently have little access to college guidance and preparation. Helping these students get to college creates a beneficial cycle within their communities. When first-generation college students matriculate, they create a culture of college-going where there wasn't one before. They serve as role models to their families and larger social networks, modeling positive behaviors and outcomes—especially for younger students in the community.
   
   Additionally, FutureBound’s games will help over-worked guidance counselors, teachers, and parents by providing them with a set of tools to reach the students in their lives. College can be a difficult subject to broach with students who are anxious about their future. By reaching out through play, teachers, counselors, and mentors can communicate about this subject in a more relaxed way that facilitates a more productive discussion.
   
   Finally, this project also serves the many and varied colleges in the Los Angeles area, who will benefit from a larger and more diverse applicant pool if more of Los Angeles’ underserved youth are able to navigate the complexities of the college application process and make informed choices about how and where to apply.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  We believe the most effective approach to engaging students and achieving the
  goals described above involves connecting with youth across multiple learning
  environments, including schools, college preparation and community-based
  organizations, and libraries. The primary goal associated with these
  collaborations will be to leverage their direct experience with and access to
  students and educators. An additional goal of these partnerships will be to
  leverage the recognition and public awareness associated with their
  organizations and services, as well as to create new positive associations for
  the combined offerings.
   
   The three factors that will be critical to the success of our partnerships include: (1) ability to enhance distribution and expand access to LA schools and students; (2) partner resources and capabilities to help provide some of the training to local schools; and (3) a strong track record among partners of working with LA youth in the area of college access. 
   
   FutureBound has existing relationships and has worked with the following organizations: Los Angeles Unified School District; Southern California College Access Network; USC Pullias Center for Higher Education; and USC Game Innovation Lab. Potential partners include: Inglewood Unified School District; Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District; Culver City Unified School District; TRIO & Upward Bound Program participants; Los Angeles Boys & Girls Club; LA's BEST After School Enrichment Program; and MESA Programs.
