Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  With our radiation data we changed the established method of reporting data as
  huge averages to giving pinpoint data down to a specific GPS location, giving
  people the very granular data they needed and were unable to get anywhere
  else. We're hoping to do the same thing for air quality and other
  environmental data so right now Angelenos can get very vague data - air in LA
  is OK today, air in LA is bad today - etc. Our sensors and network will change
  that and tell people exactly what is different street to street, moment to
  moment. Imagine being able to plan a run or bike ride specifically down
  streets with better air quality at the least polluted times of the day.
  Imagine being able to pinpoint pollution sources and make changes to correct
  these problems at the source.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Individuals who are interested in their environment, researchers who need
  concrete data for their work, and policy/government who currently have limited
  data with which to make decisions.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: For Los Angeles we won't need any partners to deploy this.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: ''
