Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  We have a prototype network up and running in Fukushima Japan now, want to
  launch full network in Los Angeles.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Started in response to the Fukushima meltdown in 2011 - In 3 years Safecast
  has built the most trusted citizen monitoring network for radiation data in
  the world, with the largest open data set ever. Our network of mobile sensors
  is tried and tested, and we're now building out a static realtime network and
  adding other environmental data to that - air quality, weather, etc. We have a
  prototype network up and running now, but would love to deploy a full network
  in Los Angeles as the first US initiative.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  With our radiation data we changed the established method of reporting data as
  huge averages to giving pinpoint data down to a specific GPS location, giving
  people the very granular data they needed and were unable to get anywhere
  else. We're hoping to do the same thing for air quality and other
  environmental data so right now Angelenos can get very vague data - air in LA
  is OK today, air in LA is bad today - etc. Our sensors and network will change
  that and tell people exactly what is different street to street, moment to
  moment. Imagine being able to plan a run or bike ride specifically down
  streets with better air quality at the least polluted times of the day.
  Imagine being able to pinpoint pollution sources and make changes to correct
  these problems at the source.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Individuals who are interested in their environment, researchers who need
  concrete data for their work, and policy/government who currently have limited
  data with which to make decisions.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: For Los Angeles we won't need any partners to deploy this.
