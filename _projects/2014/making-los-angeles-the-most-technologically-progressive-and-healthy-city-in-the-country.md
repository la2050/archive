Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Climate Cents is in the process of launching. We are in the beta-phase now,
  creating a website and testing the user-experience of it with a group of
  beta-users, while also experimenting with organizational partnerships and
  data-collection. During the beta phase, the test group will be donating to the
  Kelp Restoration Project at The Bay Foundation. Since nearly 40% of the CO2 in
  our atmosphere is absorbed by our oceans, kelp forests have been identified as
  effective carbon sinks that can sequester carbon and mitigate the effects of
  climate change. Climate Cents has already formed a relationship with the Bay
  Foundation for this purpose. As users follow the project they have funded, we
  will track how they experience the interactive process. 
   
   Once the beta phase ends in September, we will take what we have learned and refine the concept and execution. We will hire a digital designer to create a full-fledged, robust website by December. We will also sign partnership agreements with three additional environmental groups, including TreePeople, LAANE’s Repower LA (a partnership with LADWP’s Utility Pre-Craft Trainee (UPCT) program), and Harbor Community Benefit Foundation. We will refine data and photo-gathering procedures, and iron out organizational kinks. In preparation for a January 2015 public launch, we will hire a marketing team and work with them to garner significant publicity. We also plan to hold a series of Climate Cents parties across LA in January, February, and March 2014 to build support and secure a large number of initial sign-ups. Through 2015, we will be conducting extensive outreach to neighborhood councils, religious institutions, schools, housing associations, environmental symposiums and events, and other community-based groups to gain new supporters. 
   
   Climate Cents will allow individuals to broadcast their carbon reduction notifications to their friends and networks. Through the power of social media, we will constantly demonstrate that we are not powerless in our fight against climate change, and that something can be done. This positive feedback feature is crucial to Climate Cents. Many of the strategies to combat climate change do not engage people on a personal level. We will encourage residents to take pride and invest in their city, while also cleaning our air and bringing people together for a common cause.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  The most measurable pay-off from Climate Cents, both now and in 2050, is
  increased funding for tree planting, urban farms, ocean revitalization, and
  energy efficiency projects that will make LA a healthier, more pleasant, and
  more connected place to live. These will contribute to a city in which people
  don’t face environmental health hazards, where they can breathe clean air,
  drink clean water, relax and exercise among ample greenery and in the oceans,
  and eat good local food. 
   
   But the truth is that no single project can make LA the healthiest place to live — it will take a collective effort. So Climate Cents works to improve L.A.’s environment and to counter climate change in ways that complement existing efforts. We amplify funding for effective local environmental initiatives and helps them to more carefully measure, track, and broadcast their outcomes.
   
   LA has long been a city seemingly separate and definitely unequal, especially on matters of health, environment, and livability. What makes Climate Cents unique is to catalyze a city-wide collaboration to tackle the problems we ultimately all share. We will drive funding from more affluent areas toward remedies for some of the city’s worst environmental hotspots. Residents from across LA will be able to invest in tree-planting and energy efficiency projects in their own neighborhoods. The result is a renewed sense of civic pride and purpose.
   
   No place, especially LA, will be able to remain even as healthy and livable as they are today without tackling climate change. Rapid climate change has already begun to harm ecosystems globally. It’s contributing to rising sea levels, intensifying droughts, and rapidly melting snowpacks across California. In LA, rising temperatures will lead to “adverse effects on human health, including increases in heat stress, respiratory diseases, and infectious diseases.” (C-Change.LA.)
   
   It’s important to take on this challenge locally. So many of the efforts to fight climate change are distant from people’s ordinary lives and will start working only over the long-term. Before policy reforms and technological transformation become a reality, we need to make incremental efforts that get regular people engaged. While there are programs that fight climate change, there’s no comprehensive organization that groups these efforts, develops a central hub to fund them and to track progress in reducing carbon emissions. That’s the special role Climate Cents will play.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Climate Cents will help people and neighborhoods all over Los Angeles, with
  specific benefits in low-income and disadvantaged communities that have
  suffered the worst effects of environmental injustice. LA’s environmental
  problems are severe. Our area has some of the worst air quality in the nation,
  which results from a combination of industrial production and automobile
  exhaust, especially from the port/trucking sector. And the brunt of pollution
  falls disproportionately on low-income neighborhoods, in predominantly Latino
  and Black communities. Since these communities are three times more likely to
  live close to hazardous facilities, their exposure to air toxins is fifty
  percent greater than other Angelenos.
   
   We aim to concentrate our partnerships and environmental projects will be concentrated in low-income neighborhoods. Planting trees across South LA, the Eastside, and the Northeast Valley will be vital to making those places healthier and more livable. The removal of particulate matter and toxins from the air is vital. Urban gardens can help provide quality food. And increasing the percentage of tree canopy cover can make the city more beautiful and more walkable, leading to fitter, more resilient communities, with more opportunities to reduce the mental and physical stresses of urban living. 
   
   The project will benefit those in other neighborhoods because pollution doesn’t stop the boundaries of zip codes. Trees in South LA help clean the air of toxins, particulate matter, and carbon that would soon spread elsewhere. Kelp forests in the Santa Monica Bay clean the water that circulates among all the region’s beaches. Energy efficiency upgrades reduce costs and free up capacity for everyone on the network. 
   
   The city as whole will benefit from Climate Cents too. Mitigating climate change is important on its own and by galvanizing the city’s population into cross-neighborhood collaboration, we will create a sense of civic purpose and pride. Residents from across LA will be investing in one another and their shared future. And Climate Cents members will gain personally too, as they gain a sense of agency and connection, seeing the benefits their projects all around the city they live in, creating a virtuous cycle of publicity, excitement, and greater investment.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  We have confirmed a partnership with the Bay Foundation to fund their Kelp
  Restoration Project as part of our beta-test. We are in talks with three more
  groups, listed below, for the January 2015 launch of Climate Cents. There’s a
  standard relationship between Climate Cents and its partners. We provide
  funding for the partners to amplify the impact of their environmental projects
  and in return, the partners facilitate CC’s calculation of carbon reduction
  per dollar invested and the visual documentation of the project’s impact.
   
   1. The Bay Foundation will expand its work of restoring kelp forests in waters off of LA. Reversing the 75% decline in these forests over the past century will help our local ecosystems, clean the water, and sequester a significant amount of carbon from the ocean, which absorbs nearly 30-40% of the atmosphere’s carbon dioxide.
   
   2. TreePeople will expand its work of planting tens of thousands of trees across LA, sequestering many tons of carbon and creating better environment for Angelenos. 
   
   3. LAANE’s Repower LA program, in partnership with LADWP’s Utility Pre-Craft Trainee (UPCT) program, will expand its work, which offers free home energy-efficiency retrofits and trains low-income Angelenos in electrical work. 
   
   4. Harbor Community Benefit Foundation will expand its tree planting initiatives to counter abysmal air quality for communities near the Port of LA.
   
   We are exploring partnerships with other groups for the future: Urban Food Gardens, the National Forest Foundation, Tree Musketeers, and Northeast Trees.
   
   The success of our collaborations will depend on a trusting relationship and clear expectations about each party’s responsibilities and deliverables. We are creating a standard memorandum of understanding, which will minimize the risk of miscommunication and divergent expectations. For Climate Cents, we must have guarantees that our funding contributions will flow directly and completely to the pre-set projects, and not be diverted to other programs or administrative costs. We must also regularly receive updated information about the results of the funding, with specific metrics such as trees planted and pounds of carbon reduced. We will also need to access to the partner’s project sites so we can document them with photo and videos. In return, partners should have a clear expectation of how roughly much funding they can expect from Climate Cents and on what basis and conceivable schedule it will be provided.
