Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Climate Cents is in the process of launching. We are in the beta-phase now,
  creating a website and testing the user-experience of it with a group of
  beta-users, while also experimenting with organizational partnerships and
  data-collection. During the beta phase, the test group will be donating to the
  Kelp Restoration Project at The Bay Foundation. Since nearly 40% of the CO2 in
  our atmosphere is absorbed by our oceans, kelp forests have been identified as
  effective carbon sinks that can sequester carbon and mitigate the effects of
  climate change. Climate Cents has already formed a relationship with the Bay
  Foundation for this purpose. As users follow the project they have funded, we
  will track how they experience the interactive process. 
   
   Once the beta phase ends in September, we will take what we have learned and refine the concept and execution. We will hire a digital designer to create a full-fledged, robust website by December. We will also sign partnership agreements with three additional environmental groups, including TreePeople, LAANE’s Repower LA (a partnership with LADWP’s Utility Pre-Craft Trainee (UPCT) program), and Harbor Community Benefit Foundation. We will refine data and photo-gathering procedures, and iron out organizational kinks. In preparation for a January 2015 public launch, we will hire a marketing team and work with them to garner significant publicity. We also plan to hold a series of Climate Cents parties across LA in January, February, and March 2014 to build support and secure a large number of initial sign-ups. Through 2015, we will be conducting extensive outreach to neighborhood councils, religious institutions, schools, housing associations, environmental symposiums and events, and other community-based groups to gain new supporters. 
   
   Climate Cents will allow individuals to broadcast their carbon reduction notifications to their friends and networks. Through the power of social media, we will constantly demonstrate that we are not powerless in our fight against climate change, and that something can be done. This positive feedback feature is crucial to Climate Cents. Many of the strategies to combat climate change do not engage people on a personal level. We will encourage residents to take pride and invest in their city, while also cleaning our air and bringing people together for a common cause.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  The most measurable pay-off from Climate Cents, both now and in 2050, is
  increased funding for tree planting, urban farms, ocean revitalization, and
  energy efficiency projects that will make LA a healthier, more pleasant, and
  more connected place to live. These will contribute to a city in which people
  don’t face environmental health hazards, where they can breathe clean air,
  drink clean water, relax and exercise among ample greenery and in the oceans,
  and eat good local food. 
   
   But the truth is that no single project can make LA the healthiest place to live — it will take a collective effort. So Climate Cents works to improve L.A.’s environment and to counter climate change in ways that complement existing efforts. We amplify funding for effective local environmental initiatives and helps them to more carefully measure, track, and broadcast their outcomes.
   
   LA has long been a city seemingly separate and definitely unequal, especially on matters of health, environment, and livability. What makes Climate Cents unique is to catalyze a city-wide collaboration to tackle the problems we ultimately all share. We will drive funding from more affluent areas toward remedies for some of the city’s worst environmental hotspots. Residents from across LA will be able to invest in tree-planting and energy efficiency projects in their own neighborhoods. The result is a renewed sense of civic pride and purpose.
   
   No place, especially LA, will be able to remain even as healthy and livable as they are today without tackling climate change. Rapid climate change has already begun to harm ecosystems globally. It’s contributing to rising sea levels, intensifying droughts, and rapidly melting snowpacks across California. In LA, rising temperatures will lead to “adverse effects on human health, including increases in heat stress, respiratory diseases, and infectious diseases.” (C-Change.LA.)
   
   It’s important to take on this challenge locally. So many of the efforts to fight climate change are distant from people’s ordinary lives and will start working only over the long-term. Before policy reforms and technological transformation become a reality, we need to make incremental efforts that get regular people engaged. While there are programs that fight climate change, there’s no comprehensive organization that groups these efforts, develops a central hub to fund them and to track progress in reducing carbon emissions. That’s the special role Climate Cents will play.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Climate Cents will help people and neighborhoods all over Los Angeles, with
  specific benefits in low-income and disadvantaged communities that have
  suffered the worst effects of environmental injustice. LA’s environmental
  problems are severe. Our area has some of the worst air quality in the nation,
  which results from a combination of industrial production and automobile
  exhaust, especially from the port/trucking sector. And the brunt of pollution
  falls disproportionately on low-income neighborhoods, in predominantly Latino
  and Black communities. Since these communities are three times more likely to
  live close to hazardous facilities, their exposure to air toxins is fifty
  percent greater than other Angelenos.
   
   We aim to concentrate our partnerships and environmental projects will be concentrated in low-income neighborhoods. Planting trees across South LA, the Eastside, and the Northeast Valley will be vital to making those places healthier and more livable. The removal of particulate matter and toxins from the air is vital. Urban gardens can help provide quality food. And increasing the percentage of tree canopy cover can make the city more beautiful and more walkable, leading to fitter, more resilient communities, with more opportunities to reduce the mental and physical stresses of urban living. 
   
   The project will benefit those in other neighborhoods because pollution doesn’t stop the boundaries of zip codes. Trees in South LA help clean the air of toxins, particulate matter, and carbon that would soon spread elsewhere. Kelp forests in the Santa Monica Bay clean the water that circulates among all the region’s beaches. Energy efficiency upgrades reduce costs and free up capacity for everyone on the network. 
   
   The city as whole will benefit from Climate Cents too. Mitigating climate change is important on its own and by galvanizing the city’s population into cross-neighborhood collaboration, we will create a sense of civic purpose and pride. Residents from across LA will be investing in one another and their shared future. And Climate Cents members will gain personally too, as they gain a sense of agency and connection, seeing the benefits their projects all around the city they live in, creating a virtuous cycle of publicity, excitement, and greater investment.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  We have confirmed a partnership with the Bay Foundation to fund their Kelp
  Restoration Project as part of our beta-test. We are in talks with three more
  groups, listed below, for the January 2015 launch of Climate Cents. There’s a
  standard relationship between Climate Cents and its partners. We provide
  funding for the partners to amplify the impact of their environmental projects
  and in return, the partners facilitate CC’s calculation of carbon reduction
  per dollar invested and the visual documentation of the project’s impact.
   
   1. The Bay Foundation will expand its work of restoring kelp forests in waters off of LA. Reversing the 75% decline in these forests over the past century will help our local ecosystems, clean the water, and sequester a significant amount of carbon from the ocean, which absorbs nearly 30-40% of the atmosphere’s carbon dioxide.
   
   2. TreePeople will expand its work of planting tens of thousands of trees across LA, sequestering many tons of carbon and creating better environment for Angelenos. 
   
   3. LAANE’s Repower LA program, in partnership with LADWP’s Utility Pre-Craft Trainee (UPCT) program, will expand its work, which offers free home energy-efficiency retrofits and trains low-income Angelenos in electrical work. 
   
   4. Harbor Community Benefit Foundation will expand its tree planting initiatives to counter abysmal air quality for communities near the Port of LA.
   
   We are exploring partnerships with other groups for the future: Urban Food Gardens, the National Forest Foundation, Tree Musketeers, and Northeast Trees.
   
   The success of our collaborations will depend on a trusting relationship and clear expectations about each party’s responsibilities and deliverables. We are creating a standard memorandum of understanding, which will minimize the risk of miscommunication and divergent expectations. For Climate Cents, we must have guarantees that our funding contributions will flow directly and completely to the pre-set projects, and not be diverted to other programs or administrative costs. We must also regularly receive updated information about the results of the funding, with specific metrics such as trees planted and pounds of carbon reduced. We will also need to access to the partner’s project sites so we can document them with photo and videos. In return, partners should have a clear expectation of how roughly much funding they can expect from Climate Cents and on what basis and conceivable schedule it will be provided.

    UCLA Advance Heart Failure and UCLA Undergraduate Schools (Life Sciences,
    Computer Science) are collaborating to create an app and sensors built
    around the needs and metrics of the LA community. At the same time, we seek
    to support local businesses by pairing up with them to provide incentives to
    community members when visiting these businesses.It will use both AI
    (artificial intelligence) algorithms and user feedback to provide the best
    recommendations in multiple aspects of daily life to LA residents; Eat,
    Health, Life, Fitness. We are looking to collaborate with LA2050 to create a
    model that provides access to both clinical and preventative care through
    various platforms while integrating a degree of social networks within them.
  implement: "With a population of close to 4 million individuals, it is a stretch to make LA the healthiest city with campaigns and small scale projects. Rather it is more beneficial to approach the issue of quality of life and health care from a holistic point view accessible by ease from everyone while looking at preventative as well as clinical care. As such, we will need to approach the goal of a healthy city by determining metrics that are related to each other and their prevalence in their respective communities. \r\n\r\nPhase 1 will consist of developing a easy to use sensor (to detect different environmental measurements) and placing said sensors in multiple communities of LA to determine the air quality, toxin levels while also measuring bike and transit scores. Sensors will provide us with live regional data as well as detailed data which to benchmark against the whole of LA as well as against other parts of LA. We will then develop an artificial intelligence program and code it within a simple mobile device application which will be created alongside the program that can be accessible across various platforms such as tablets, phones, computers, etc. The application will consist of 4 programs when opened: Eat, Health, Life, and Fitness- all of which will provide access to several different options. \r\n\r\nPhase 2 will be establishing a wider range  of local businesses to provide incentives to LA residents to one: use the app, and two: provide discounts to residents from supporting local businesses. Incentives will however be only be used for the Food and Fitness aspect of the application. Within the Health option, we will create an AI (same program with different variables) that determines preventative care for basic ailments through the use of over 1,000,000 data points from past clinical care while providing access to local and state healthcare services from which to receive care from for more severe cases. \r\n\r\n"
  impact_live: "Our project may seem like a simple application however it uses complex algorithms, not introduced to a free market before, to target an entire city rather than just concentrate on a specific group of individuals. Los Angeles will be the first city to have an app dedicated to its’ residents and their well being. It seeks to bring preventative healthcare to all (through multiple methods) while basic clinical care onsite to others and access to clinical care to those with more severe cases. The software will be ready to use upon release to the public as information will already have been collected for recommendations to be made upon individualized data points. Individuals will be aware of their dietary, fitness and health habits everyday and will be provided with recommendations and incentives along the way for improvements to their health. Through the integration of social networks, LA, by 2050, will be fully aware of their eating, fitness, and health. The AI system will have more than enough data points to reference to create more sophisticated regiments for individuals. \r\n\r\n\r\nBy 2050 we will have a platform with an AI that can provide healthcare to much more complex cases with the wider base of data points available by then. In terms of air pollution and water metrics, we will have determined areas in LA most prone to elevated levels of air toxins and water usage through the use of sensors which can later be placed at more locations for a very low cost. We will be able to provide the city of LA within the next 5 years a thorough recommendation for improving water conservation and addressing air quality indexes. 2050 will see a less polluted city of LA after the introduction of incentive based programs (free bikes -already in progress in conjunction with local start ups, parking etc) for communities and individuals when participating in alternative transport such as biking, walking, public transport, and carpool.  "
  who_benefit: >-
    Our project aims for a top-down approach. Our aim is to initially approach
    several regions of LA for beta testing and sensor placement. This includes
    but is not limited to Westwood, Santa Monica, Venice, Downtown LA,
    Hollywood, Beverly Hills, Pacific Palisades, East LA, and Bel Air. This
    project will benefit three levels within LA. It will benefit 1) the
    population down to single individuals, 2)  their respective communities and
    3) City of Los Angeles. Based on the results from receptiveness of the
    population, the City of LA will be given extensive review and
    recommendations for improvement and or addition of low cost sensors to
    reduce and eliminate unhealthy air quality and pollution in the city. More
    specifically, this program will be accessible to anyone with a mobile device
    or computer ( from home, work, or pocket). Those without a mobile device
    will be able to easily access the program through a public library as
    everyones profile will be unique to them and their location. There is no
    separation of income barrier as this project is intended to target every
    individual from different communities. According to the CDC, obesity rates
    are rising in LA County–24.3% of adults while more than 20% of students in
    junior high school are obese. While this program will benefit everyone,
    there will be several more incentivized based models for age groups between
    12-18, and 18-40. 
  partners_collaboration: "We are collaborating with a range of individuals and groups, all of whom who come from various backgrounds and expertise. All of the following collaborators are confirmed and all of whom we have worked with in the past on several successful projects. \r\nUCLA Department of Medicine- Faculty members as well as leading departmental doctors will help develop the AI program for preventative and basic clinical care while advances in the program will allow for more complicated cases to be assessed by the the program. \r\nUCLA Advanced Heart Failure Lab- With extensive research in social network as well as Multi-Organ Dysfunction, the lab will provide their expertise in demographic participation on a zip code level and the most effective method of targeting populations  \r\nUCLA School of Engineering will help acquire/ develop sensors for testing several dream metrics; walking, air, pollution, toxins etc. They will also provide us with a team of undergraduate students for continuous support throughout the development and post development phase. \r\nUCLA Computer Science Department will provide us with app developers and coders who will create the UI as well as the AI program. Several students have worked for and are currently working for very successful and publicly traded startups and have extensive knowledge in AI software building and scaling such a system on a massive scale. This team will be available on hand throughout the project and after the projects success. In the past we have created for UCLA Medical Center its' first Heart Failure Calculator which uses several algorithms to determine mortality rates in patients with heart failure. \r\nUCLA Sociology Department faculty members will help with analyzing complex and big data sets. \r\nUCLA Life Sciences Division undergraduate students in conjunction with the School of Medicine and local fitness trainers will help develop multiple healthy dietary regiments based on user profile and needs. \r\nUCLA Business School undergraduate students and graduate students will seek to further establish connections with local and corporate businesses to provide incentives for users and rewards for those that reach their target goal/metric such as weight loss, miles walked than driven, etc. "

    Eat:1) Access to eateries in accordance with their fitness regimen. Users
    will see incentives/promotions associated with respective eateries as well
    as reward redemption sites for when users reach a milestone/target such as,
    walking 15,000 steps in a day and receiving a free yogurt at an
    establishment.  2) Access to local stores that provide organic, and healthy
    foods. Promotions exclusive for users such as discounts, sales, and
    freebies. 3)Depending on user target goals, our program will determine
    several meal plans for the user to choose from or provide healthy easy to
    make recipes. Health:1) Users will be given locations to the needed medical
    services and if determined to be a basic ailment by AI, will be provided
    with recommendations for treatment options. They will also be provided
    locations of closest pharmacies, and shops for prescription or over the
    counter medication. Users will also be given options from which to get
    insurance for those uninsured including an interfaced link to government
    health care. Individuals with mental illness will receive information to
    seek appropriate help from service providers near them. 2)The percent of
    residents receiving coordinated health care will be one of the dream metrics
    which we will impact by serving underserved populations with limited access
    to hospitals and medication by mobilizing mobile clinics to visit
    communities several times or based on need by users for free healthcare
    services. Life:Sensors placed in communities and data retrieved from other
    sources will allow us to provide users with live time information on current
    air toxins, air quality index, as well as general information of water usage
    as determined by the Department of Water and Power and then continuous
    recommendations for users to improve these metrics. Homes that conserve
    water will receive incentives from different companies. Changing user
    behavior now will significantly reduce pollution in the waterways by 2050
    while at the same time. 3)Access to pair individuals with jobs will be
    available to homeless people in a simple, easy to use online resume building
    and basic interview skill set. Fitness: Users can be structured a workout
    regimen that is tailored with their diet. This program will also use the
    phones system to monitor a steps, calories burned, incline, exercise rate,
    bike, transit score and sleep cycle (healthy sleeping habits). Users will be
    more inclined to keep fit if they see incentivized live progress.

  evaluate: " Success will be measured on several factors. While we would want all of LA to use this program at once, we can see results from a small population from which data can be extracted. \r\nWe will measure success by seeing how well mobile clinics are received by communities that need them. We will do this by sending surveys on mobile and web application to those who received treatment to rate improvement on quality of life and basic health. We will benchmark results to an initial survey taken before the implementation of our program. This will continue over the course of 6-12 months depending on success to determine the impact of our program.  \r\n\r\nWe will measure the success rate in transit, fitness and pollution/water metrics by looking at how much water has been conserved after giving residents and communities recommendations on water conservation based on sensor readings and then the same on air quality (reduction of cars, increase of carpool, walking, biking etc) all while providing incentives to do so. Seeing an increase in walking over a course of 6- 8 months will show success to the program. Seeing an improvement in conservation and alternative transits when benchmarking with initial readings will strengthen our foundation of incentivized programs. \r\n\r\nAI program success will be determined through both user feedback and in house testing to maintain accuracy of system. The program will be fed with sample ailments symptoms and asked to come up with recommendations. These will then be compared physician prognosis. \r\n\r\nSeeing an improvement in just one or two communities will prove that our program is an effective one and one that is self sustaining. The system only becomes better with more users and feedback.  "
  two_lessons: "It has been shown through studies and through basic human nature that we work on a rewards mechanism. If asked to do something, people are more inclined to follow through with the request and follow up with it if they are given something back in return. You cannot simply expect something to be done for free. Thats why while providing a service and asking residents of the LA community to strive for a better city and life, we are aiming to provide them with incentives for reaching certain goals and metrics. Past campaigns that targeted similar metrics did not create success on a large scale or at all due to the fact that either: 1) They did not maintain a continuous support structure that can be integrated within an individual's daily life and/or 2) reward them for improving themselves. \r\n\r\nAccess to healthcare is an issue all around the world. Some parts just can’t receive healthcare because they are either: 1) Too far from services provided to them and or 2) They don’t have money or insurance to pay for treatments. Mobile clinics have been met with an incredible amount of success in developing nations as many people there don’t have the financial resources or capability of going to a health care center. Implementing such programs within the city of LA in communities that are in a similar situation will allow for a clear interfacing of easily accessible health care from hospital to your streets. However while a mobile clinic can’t always be available, a need for a self supporting software is demanded. Here we develop an AI in conjunction with UCLA doctors. This AI program is aimed at serving basic ailments and non-emergency treatments for when access to proper health care isn’t readily available- all while continuously learning and improving recommendations as it receives more clinical data points to assess from.  "
  achievable_goal: "Please note, we will be doing tasks simultaneously as we have a wide range of student body to help with the program.\r\n1) Development of an APP will take 2 months\r\n2) AI program will take 6-7 months to build or less depending on complexity of algorithm and initial testing of accuracy\r\n3) We will use 12 months to network with businesses to provide rewards and incentives to app users. As is we have a good network of businesses to back us due to a strong start-up scene within the UCLA and LA community\r\n4) 1 month will be needed to set up server and anonymize the transfer of clinical data\r\n5) 1 month will be needed to create a set of basic dietary regimens and fitness routines\r\n6) 3-4 months will be needed to create a sensor, install sensor and coordinate with local services for access to their network of data\r\n7) 3 months will be spent in social promotion of the app through third party partners as well as through kick-off events  "
  major_challenges: "Barriers we anticipate is: 1) Getting people to use the app 2) Falsification of data to redeem rewards 3) Mobile Clinic Mobilization to a mass community \r\n\r\n1) Getting people to use the app will be a challenge but we are aiming to resolve it by offering generous reward program in the initial stages of our app. Some people may have concerns about privacy of data. However we intend to anonymize all user data and simply coding them in binary according to districts than individually so to get a holistic view of everything. This eliminates the need to worry by users. \r\n\r\n2) Some people may claim to have done or reached milestones to redeem incentives. We will place safeguards to limit the changes you can make to your user profile so it stays unique to one individual and allows you to complete certain goals before changing it. Fitness data will be automatically stored and changes will not be possible.  When measuring transit metrics, examples of pictures, pedometer or bringing your bike with you to the eatery will provide as extra ways to prevent people from misusing the program.  \r\n\r\n3) If there is a greater need for mobile clinics than anticipated we will coordinate with UCLA's mobile clinic program and ask for further mobile clinic vans from the school distribution program to meet demands as well as reach out to VC firms to fund the start up\r\n\r\n"
  competition: >-
    There is no other apps like this currently. Nor is their an AI program that
    self learns as more data points given to it. There have been talks of
    software companies creating one in Silicon Valley but to privatize it but
    are still under production. Some of us undergraduates who have worked for
    companies such as those want to build our own and open source it so it is
    publicly available to everyone for free. We know the algorithm as it is
    unique to us and want LA to be the first city in the world to have a self
    sustaining machine learning system to adapt to improving multiple aspects of
    daily life especially healthcare. These organizations are neither
    competitive or complementary as their programs are not public information
    yet so are not aware on what scale they are building their system or what it
    does exactly. 
  cost: >-
    With the initial budget, there isn't any expected extra costs. However in
    case of further overhead costs, we can expect an additional 10-15k if
    needed. However this can be acquired through the UCLA Spark (between 5K-10K)
    Program which helps fund small size projects for UCLA projects. Another
    option is VC firms with ties to UCLA who have already seen initial
    investment into a workable product and will make a small contribution to
    help make it prosper. Most of the cost will go towards a dedicated server
    and its' maintenance along with the upkeep of the super computers. Should we
    run into social promotion budgeting issues, we will seek freelance work from
    students at UCLA given that this is a team of undergraduates students at
    UCLA. We have full backing from multiple departments and their undergraduate
    student body if needed.  
  budget: "4K- Cost to design User Interface (UI) for app for IOS and Android. This also includes cost to deliver workable regimens, and dietary regimens from professional trainers.\r\n11K-Cost to create app with 4 modules (Eat, Health, Life, Fitness): This includes coding, front-end and back-end, as well as implementation of Ruby on Rails to interface with multiple servers. This is for both Android and IOS and Web\r\n15K- Social Marketing promotion for app 3 months from third party source (Mav 12 Marketing) to get people to download the app\r\n2K- Kickoff events for MyLA app and contests to get people to start using the app\r\n15K- Cost of developing AI program and transfer and anonymize clinical data into system. This includes testing the program on servers\r\n8.6K: \r\n2 Super Computers (1.5K each) One will be used to house AI program and the other used to house the app program itself. \r\n3 Macbooks (1.3K each- 3.9k total) This will be used to code for programs and develop mainframe for the program itself. They will also be used to test the web application\r\n2 Ipad Mini -Refurbished if possible (300 USD each) They will be used for testing the application on tablets. We will use our own phones for mobile testing. \r\n$25.00 USD to create Google Developer Account\r\n$25.00 USD to create Apple Developer Account \r\n \r\n$300.00 USD to purchase Adobe software if cannot be provided by school\r\n\r\n25K- This will be used to purchase several different types of server hosts. First of which will be shared hosting servers for web application use. The second which will be the brunt of the cost will be acquiring and maintaining a dedicated server for the AI programs clinical data sets as well as data sets gathered from users. Alternatively we are looking at cloud servers which are much cheaper yet will not serve our purpose after a year as we will need a dedicated server as the program becomes more intelligent. \r\n\r\n8K- Business development for incentives program; networking events, and overhead costs. Overhead costs include travel, lunches, dinner, events for businesses that are willing to participate in our program. \r\n\r\n10-11K for the development and prototype of transit and air metric sensors. However this can potentially and likely be free if there is an open source API in which case the money will be used to purchase more clinical data and develop more refined fitness and dietary regimens for users. The development of a prototype will be approximately 2K which is part of the 10-11K\r\n\r\n\r\n"

      UCLA Advance Heart Failure and UCLA Undergraduate Schools (Life Sciences,
      Computer Science) are collaborating to create an app and sensors built
      around the needs and metrics of the LA community. At the same time, we
      seek to support local businesses by pairing up with them to provide
      incentives to community members when visiting these businesses.It will use
      both AI (artificial intelligence) algorithms and user feedback to provide
      the best recommendations in multiple aspects of daily life to LA
      residents; Eat, Health, Life, Fitness. We are looking to collaborate with
      LA2050 to create a model that provides access to both clinical and
      preventative care through various platforms while integrating a degree of
      social networks within them.
  - name: implement

    explanation: ''
    answer: "With a population of close to 4 million individuals, it is a stretch to make LA the healthiest city with campaigns and small scale projects. Rather it is more beneficial to approach the issue of quality of life and health care from a holistic point view accessible by ease from everyone while looking at preventative as well as clinical care. As such, we will need to approach the goal of a healthy city by determining metrics that are related to each other and their prevalence in their respective communities. \r\n\r\nPhase 1 will consist of developing a easy to use sensor (to detect different environmental measurements) and placing said sensors in multiple communities of LA to determine the air quality, toxin levels while also measuring bike and transit scores. Sensors will provide us with live regional data as well as detailed data which to benchmark against the whole of LA as well as against other parts of LA. We will then develop an artificial intelligence program and code it within a simple mobile device application which will be created alongside the program that can be accessible across various platforms such as tablets, phones, computers, etc. The application will consist of 4 programs when opened: Eat, Health, Life, and Fitness- all of which will provide access to several different options. \r\n\r\nPhase 2 will be establishing a wider range  of local businesses to provide incentives to LA residents to one: use the app, and two: provide discounts to residents from supporting local businesses. Incentives will however be only be used for the Food and Fitness aspect of the application. Within the Health option, we will create an AI (same program with different variables) that determines preventative care for basic ailments through the use of over 1,000,000 data points from past clinical care while providing access to local and state healthcare services from which to receive care from for more severe cases. \r\n\r\n"

    answer: "Our project may seem like a simple application however it uses complex algorithms, not introduced to a free market before, to target an entire city rather than just concentrate on a specific group of individuals. Los Angeles will be the first city to have an app dedicated to its’ residents and their well being. It seeks to bring preventative healthcare to all (through multiple methods) while basic clinical care onsite to others and access to clinical care to those with more severe cases. The software will be ready to use upon release to the public as information will already have been collected for recommendations to be made upon individualized data points. Individuals will be aware of their dietary, fitness and health habits everyday and will be provided with recommendations and incentives along the way for improvements to their health. Through the integration of social networks, LA, by 2050, will be fully aware of their eating, fitness, and health. The AI system will have more than enough data points to reference to create more sophisticated regiments for individuals. \r\n\r\n\r\nBy 2050 we will have a platform with an AI that can provide healthcare to much more complex cases with the wider base of data points available by then. In terms of air pollution and water metrics, we will have determined areas in LA most prone to elevated levels of air toxins and water usage through the use of sensors which can later be placed at more locations for a very low cost. We will be able to provide the city of LA within the next 5 years a thorough recommendation for improving water conservation and addressing air quality indexes. 2050 will see a less polluted city of LA after the introduction of incentive based programs (free bikes -already in progress in conjunction with local start ups, parking etc) for communities and individuals when participating in alternative transport such as biking, walking, public transport, and carpool.

      Our project aims for a top-down approach. Our aim is to initially approach
      several regions of LA for beta testing and sensor placement. This includes
      but is not limited to Westwood, Santa Monica, Venice, Downtown LA,
      Hollywood, Beverly Hills, Pacific Palisades, East LA, and Bel Air. This
      project will benefit three levels within LA. It will benefit 1) the
      population down to single individuals, 2)  their respective communities
      and 3) City of Los Angeles. Based on the results from receptiveness of the
      population, the City of LA will be given extensive review and
      recommendations for improvement and or addition of low cost sensors to
      reduce and eliminate unhealthy air quality and pollution in the city. More
      specifically, this program will be accessible to anyone with a mobile
      device or computer ( from home, work, or pocket). Those without a mobile
      device will be able to easily access the program through a public library
      as everyones profile will be unique to them and their location. There is
      no separation of income barrier as this project is intended to target
      every individual from different communities. According to the CDC, obesity
      rates are rising in LA County–24.3% of adults while more than 20% of
      students in junior high school are obese. While this program will benefit
      everyone, there will be several more incentivized based models for age
      groups between 12-18, and 18-40.

      Eat:1) Access to eateries in accordance with their fitness regimen. Users
      will see incentives/promotions associated with respective eateries as well
      as reward redemption sites for when users reach a milestone/target such
      as, walking 15,000 steps in a day and receiving a free yogurt at an
      establishment.  2) Access to local stores that provide organic, and
      healthy foods. Promotions exclusive for users such as discounts, sales,
      and freebies. 3)Depending on user target goals, our program will determine
      several meal plans for the user to choose from or provide healthy easy to
      make recipes. Health:1) Users will be given locations to the needed
      medical services and if determined to be a basic ailment by AI, will be
      provided with recommendations for treatment options. They will also be
      provided locations of closest pharmacies, and shops for prescription or
      over the counter medication. Users will also be given options from which
      to get insurance for those uninsured including an interfaced link to
      government health care. Individuals with mental illness will receive
      information to seek appropriate help from service providers near them.
      2)The percent of residents receiving coordinated health care will be one
      of the dream metrics which we will impact by serving underserved
      populations with limited access to hospitals and medication by mobilizing
      mobile clinics to visit communities several times or based on need by
      users for free healthcare services. Life:Sensors placed in communities and
      data retrieved from other sources will allow us to provide users with live
      time information on current air toxins, air quality index, as well as
      general information of water usage as determined by the Department of
      Water and Power and then continuous recommendations for users to improve
      these metrics. Homes that conserve water will receive incentives from
      different companies. Changing user behavior now will significantly reduce
      pollution in the waterways by 2050 while at the same time. 3)Access to
      pair individuals with jobs will be available to homeless people in a
      simple, easy to use online resume building and basic interview skill set.
      Fitness: Users can be structured a workout regimen that is tailored with
      their diet. This program will also use the phones system to monitor a
      steps, calories burned, incline, exercise rate, bike, transit score and
      sleep cycle (healthy sleeping habits). Users will be more inclined to keep
      fit if they see incentivized live progress.

    answer: " Success will be measured on several factors. While we would want all of LA to use this program at once, we can see results from a small population from which data can be extracted. \r\nWe will measure success by seeing how well mobile clinics are received by communities that need them. We will do this by sending surveys on mobile and web application to those who received treatment to rate improvement on quality of life and basic health. We will benchmark results to an initial survey taken before the implementation of our program. This will continue over the course of 6-12 months depending on success to determine the impact of our program.  \r\n\r\nWe will measure the success rate in transit, fitness and pollution/water metrics by looking at how much water has been conserved after giving residents and communities recommendations on water conservation based on sensor readings and then the same on air quality (reduction of cars, increase of carpool, walking, biking etc) all while providing incentives to do so. Seeing an increase in walking over a course of 6- 8 months will show success to the program. Seeing an improvement in conservation and alternative transits when benchmarking with initial readings will strengthen our foundation of incentivized programs. \r\n\r\nAI program success will be determined through both user feedback and in house testing to maintain accuracy of system. The program will be fed with sample ailments symptoms and asked to come up with recommendations. These will then be compared physician prognosis. \r\n\r\nSeeing an improvement in just one or two communities will prove that our program is an effective one and one that is self sustaining. The system only becomes better with more users and feedback.  "
  - name: two_lessons
    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "It has been shown through studies and through basic human nature that we work on a rewards mechanism. If asked to do something, people are more inclined to follow through with the request and follow up with it if they are given something back in return. You cannot simply expect something to be done for free. Thats why while providing a service and asking residents of the LA community to strive for a better city and life, we are aiming to provide them with incentives for reaching certain goals and metrics. Past campaigns that targeted similar metrics did not create success on a large scale or at all due to the fact that either: 1) They did not maintain a continuous support structure that can be integrated within an individual's daily life and/or 2) reward them for improving themselves. \r\n\r\nAccess to healthcare is an issue all around the world. Some parts just can’t receive healthcare because they are either: 1) Too far from services provided to them and or 2) They don’t have money or insurance to pay for treatments. Mobile clinics have been met with an incredible amount of success in developing nations as many people there don’t have the financial resources or capability of going to a health care center. Implementing such programs within the city of LA in communities that are in a similar situation will allow for a clear interfacing of easily accessible health care from hospital to your streets. However while a mobile clinic can’t always be available, a need for a self supporting software is demanded. Here we develop an AI in conjunction with UCLA doctors. This AI program is aimed at serving basic ailments and non-emergency treatments for when access to proper health care isn’t readily available- all while continuously learning and improving recommendations as it receives more clinical data points to assess from.

    label: ''
    explanation: ''
    answer: "Barriers we anticipate is: 1) Getting people to use the app 2) Falsification of data to redeem rewards 3) Mobile Clinic Mobilization to a mass community \r\n\r\n1) Getting people to use the app will be a challenge but we are aiming to resolve it by offering generous reward program in the initial stages of our app. Some people may have concerns about privacy of data. However we intend to anonymize all user data and simply coding them in binary according to districts than individually so to get a holistic view of everything. This eliminates the need to worry by users. \r\n\r\n2) Some people may claim to have done or reached milestones to redeem incentives. We will place safeguards to limit the changes you can make to your user profile so it stays unique to one individual and allows you to complete certain goals before changing it. Fitness data will be automatically stored and changes will not be possible.  When measuring transit metrics, examples of pictures, pedometer or bringing your bike with you to the eatery will provide as extra ways to prevent people from misusing the program.  \r\n\r\n3) If there is a greater need for mobile clinics than anticipated we will coordinate with UCLA's mobile clinic program and ask for further mobile clinic vans from the school distribution program to meet demands as well as reach out to VC firms to fund the start up\r\n\r\n"

    answer: >-
      With the initial budget, there isn't any expected extra costs. However in
      case of further overhead costs, we can expect an additional 10-15k if
      needed. However this can be acquired through the UCLA Spark (between
      5K-10K) Program which helps fund small size projects for UCLA projects.
      Another option is VC firms with ties to UCLA who have already seen initial
      investment into a workable product and will make a small contribution to
      help make it prosper. Most of the cost will go towards a dedicated server
      and its' maintenance along with the upkeep of the super computers. Should
      we run into social promotion budgeting issues, we will seek freelance work
      from students at UCLA given that this is a team of undergraduates students
      at UCLA. We have full backing from multiple departments and their
      undergraduate student body if needed.
