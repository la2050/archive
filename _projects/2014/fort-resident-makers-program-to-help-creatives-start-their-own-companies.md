Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Currently FORT operates as a company that leverages reclaimed materials to
  create beautiful pieces of furniture. We also host DIY workshops, where
  community members learn from prominent artists/makers, make goods from
  reclaimed materials, and organize monthly events focused on community and
  design. Our inventory is available through our website and by appointment.
  FORT would like to evolve this established base into a new creative paradigm
  for social impact, empowering Los Angeles and creative industries/businesses
  at large. 
   
   Implementation would consist of 5 integrated components:
    
   • Rolling out our FORT Resident Maker Program. This unprecedented element would consist of selecting local makers each month and giving them the tools they need to launch their creative product. We would provide necessary allotted space for them to work in our workshop, required machinery including 3D printers, professional photography for their piece, space in our online marketplace, as well as the mentorship and resources needed to make it in the world as a newfound artisan entrepreneur. 
   
   • Acquisition and build-out of new location. FORT is currently housed out of a 1,650 sq loft in DTLA. A bigger space with more accessibility and visibility would be a great help to us in this endeavor. 
   
   • Fulfill already secured partnerships (elaborated upon in a subsequent question below). FORT has collaborated with some incredible organizations in our time of operation. In our efforts to make LA the best place to create in 2050 we will partner with the following:
   
   o No Right Brain Left Behind
   o Habitat for Humanity- 
   o Good Planet
   o VEDC (Valley Economic Development Center)- 
   o Mentor Matchmaker
   
   • Enhance our DIY WORKSHOPS by recruiting the most talented makers and designers from all over the world to share their craft with locals. We are modeling this after Restaurant 57 who takes visiting chefs in from all over. We will do the same by inviting worldly makers who come through LA. 
   
   • Establish Pop-up workshops and DIY seminars in various neighborhoods across LA to distribute the knowledge, skills, and a platform to Angelenos from all different economic levels.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  It is the age-old adage, “Give a man a fish…teach a man to fish...” Through
  the reverberating effects of our Resident Makers selling their products and
  acquiring the tools to become entrepreneurs themselves, FORT will facilitate
  an environment in which creatives can flourish in Los Angeles for years to
  come. In exchange for the platform to learn, refine, and launch their creative
  products through FORT, Makers will agree to give workshops themselves in a
  ‘pay it forward’ like fashion. Many of such workshops will be given in a
  pop-up like fashion in underserved areas of LA. This feature will grant
  children from struggling communities activities that will allow them to
  explore creative potentials. We will show them that through the usage of
  reclaimed materials they too can build and create things with very little to
  start.
   As for the future, 2050 will become a year in which all people in LA have the community resources to make financial means through their own creative endeavors. Given the community that we are building with the workshops and events centered around design, it will be much more commonplace for Angelenos to congregate on these common grounds. The divide of East LA and West LA will blur as we all gather mid-point in DTLA to remember that young, playful spirit of building forts. In addition to the social impact FORT will have, we will also have an environmental impact as the increased usage of reclaimed materials will correspondingly decrease the waste accumulating in landfills. In the year 2050, building with all new materials will become a thing of the past. Our population will have made the realization that most of what we need to build with, both intellect and material, is already here…just waiting for us to behold. That by reclaiming the goods and materials we already have readily available, we can make anew through great design and ingenuity. Expanding the current operations of FORT would be an incredible step towards such a reality.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  • The children of the Salamander Project (last year's recipient of LA 2050) as
  well as youth from other underserved communities will learn skills and explore
  their creative potentials through free workshops from FORT. 
   
   • Creatives who are chosen for the FORT Resident Maker Program will launch their product and be given resources to embark on their businesses.
   
   • Adult participants of the DIY WORKSHOPS given at FORT will build connections as well as pieces they get to take home with them.
   
   • Audiences of the FORT ‘Ted’-like talks from great creative thinkers and designers will leave inspired and excited about new perspectives.
   
   • Participants of our monthly round table dinner party will enjoy one another and provocative questions/table discussions about how to foster a better LA culture.
   
   • Older generations (as we will seek out retired craftsmen and makers to give talks and workshops) will pass on their incredibly valuable knowledge and experience the joy of knowing they are a necessary component of our society.
   
   • Local colleges, Jacqueline Sharp (FORT founder) through speaking engagements will give talks about entrepreneurialism and creating your own job in this new economy.
   
   Overall however FORT (Resident Makers Program) will help the LA community at large because it incredibly integrated with all of the 5 categories of LA2050.
   
   • LEARN- Education of the arts for all ages through the DIY workshops and lectures given at FORT.
   
   • CONNECT- FORT hosts community events, dinners, talks, and a monthly event that features a creative elderly who has much to share…bridging the gap between the young and the old.
   
   • LIVE- The environmental impact that FORT would have would come from diverting materials away from the landfills through the primary use of reclaimed materials.
   
   • PLAY- What better way to play than to build with new friends?
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: |-
  Yes, all of the following mentioned collaborators are confirmed:
   
   
   • No Right Brain Left Behind- FORT will build up and off of the success of past and future recipients of LA2050. We are partnering with NRBLB by giving free DIY workshops to kids of the Salamander Project who struggle with challenging circumstances. Such workshops will go hand in hand with their educational curriculum (ie if they are learning about electricity/Thomas Edison FORT will give a workshop to them on wiring lamps). 
   
   • Habitat for Humanity- will help supply us with reclaimed materials from which we build in return we help build homes and give workshops.
   
   • Good Planet- will also provide FORT with building materials. The supply from Good Planet comes directly from recycling the wasted wood, rope, metal, ect. that is ever flowing from commercial and movie set productions.
   
   • VEDC (Valley Economic Development Center)- will take special care of our FORT Resident Makers with one on one sessions with expert professionals who will help them start their own business after launching their product through FORT.
   
   • Mentor Matchmaker- will provide our FORT Resident Makers with experienced mentors to guide them in their journey of creating a career out of their creative passion.
