  Students who place in remediation are less likely to graduate from college.
  Unfortunately, under-represented students are most likely to place in remedial
  courses and thus the probability that they will earn a college degree drop off
  sharply. This has a destructive effect on individuals and their communities by
  perpetuating the cycle of trans-generational poverty. The remediation dilemma
  is particularly pervasive across the largest public university system in the
  nation, the CSU, which spends close to $30 million annually on remediation
  resulting in lower graduation rates. This project tackles the remediation
  crisis in 3 new ways: (1) linking the work of HS teachers & college
  professors, (2) offering concurrent enrollment courses to students who are
  typically excluded, and (3) creating a sustainable and scalable solution.
   
   First, college professors and HS teachers work together in the HS classroom during the regular school day. Traditionally, professors teach concurrent enrollment courses on college campuses without any involvement from K-12. Even when these courses are on HS campuses, they have consisted of professors teaching a class in isolation. In the LA Bridge Project, the professors and teachers co-teach using the same curriculum, textbook, assignments, assessments, & grading policies as the college courses. Further, the teachers & professors plan the courses together each summer & meet after each exam to score the tests together. This configuration alleviates the traditional blame game and builds sustainable relationships between K-12 and higher education faculties. 
   
   Second, under-represented students are traditionally excluded from concurrent enrollment opportunities. The thinking is that these courses are best suited for advanced students only, even though researchers consistently conclude that gifted students will be successful in college regardless of these opportunities. This project seeks to reverse that trend by offering these courses to students who have college aspirations but lack strong academic or consistent attendance records.
   
   Finally, this project was designed for sustainability & scalability. Our program is sustainable as teachers who co-teach with professors are certified by the university to continue offering college-level courses to their students as adjunct professors. It’s scalable because once teachers are certified, they can co-teach with an additional colleague, certifying them as well.

  The Los Angeles Bridge Project will help to make LA the best place to learn by
  alleviating the college remediation problem early and at the root. The
  immediate impact of this program is having LAUSD students graduate from high
  school college-ready. The long-term impact is that low-income Angelenos will
  be afforded the social mobility that comes with earning a college degree. LA
  County will also benefit from this project, in the long-term, in that we will
  have a highly educated and skilled workforce.
   
   Specifically, of the students who place in remediation, “fewer than 1 in 10 graduate from community colleges within three years and little more than a third complete bachelor’s degrees in six years.” This is detrimental as access to a college education is critical for improving people’s quality of life and society as a whole. On average, graduating with a Bachelor’s degree will result in $2.8 million in earned wages over a lifetime as opposed to $1.3 million with only a high school diploma. Society also benefits from a college-educated population with a robust economy, stronger civic engagement, and lower levels of crime, poverty, and healthcare costs. Unfortunately, college graduation rates for under-represented students (minority, first-generation, low-income) are decreasing in comparison to white, non-Hispanic students even though students of color constitute the nation’s fastest growing demographic. If current college graduation trends continue, there will be shortage of 16 million college-educated workers nationally and one million in California by the year 2025. Researchers have concluded that a major factor that hinders students’ ability to graduate from college is the high rate of academic remediation. 
   
   Students who are able to complete their college degree are adversely affected by remediation through the accumulation of greater debt, spending more time in college, and delaying their entrance into the workforce. This has a toxic effect on the nation and the state of California through lower income tax revenues and an unskilled workforce. 
   
   Los Angeles cannot afford to allow our most precious resource, our human capital, to go to waste. The solutions to our most pressing societal problems rest in the hearts and minds of our youth. Only by ensuring that the next generation of Angelenos see themselves as viable agents of change, can we ensure a brighter future for our great city and county.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The LA Bridge Project will benefit under-represented (minority, low-income,
  first-generation college) students from LAUSD. Specifically, we serve students
  residing in Downtown, East and South Los Angeles through CSULA, the San
  Fernando Valley through CSUN, and the South Bay through CSUDH. We target the
  lowest performing schools in the most economically disadvantaged areas of the
  school district. The median household income of the families in these
  communities is $22,650. As a result, 46% of them live below the poverty line
  and on average 99% of the students in these areas are eligible for free or
  reduced lunch. On average, only 54% of our students matriculate in
  post-secondary institutions compared to the school district average of 62% and
  the national average of 63%. We strategically target students who have college
  aspirations but not necessarily the strongest academic or attendance records.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  The Los Angeles Bridge Project began as a strategic partnership between LAUSD,
  CSULA, and College Bridge in the 2013-2014 school year. The initial pilot
  focused only on mathematics. Due to the significant early success of this
  program, CSULA scaled the project to an additional high school and added
  English for the 2014-2015 school year. MOUs are in place with CSULA and LAUSD.
  Additionally, we plan to scale-up through the north and south LAUSD service
  areas with CSUN and CSUDH. CSUN are confirmed partners with the MOU pending.
  CSUDH is in the early stages of partnership development.
   
   All three of these CSUs in the Los Angeles metropolitan area bring key benefits to this project. They offer in-kind donations of the professors’ salaries, use of university equipment and space, educational outreach (tutoring, college counseling, and school orientation), and financial aid resources (FAFSA workshops). LAUSD offers in-kind donations by providing the teacher and facilities to offer the courses in the regular school day. The three factors that are critical to the success of these collaborations are buy-in from (1) LAUSD high school teachers, (2) CSU professors, and (3) administrators in both LAUSD and CSUs.
   
   The LA Bridge Project ensures buy-in from all stakeholders by linking the work of the school district and higher education institutions. We bring together high school teachers and college professors to co-teach college-level math and English courses in order to offer students the opportunity to bypass academic remediation. By working shoulder to shoulder, this project eschews the traditional blame game and serves as bidirectional professional development for both instructors and administrators.
