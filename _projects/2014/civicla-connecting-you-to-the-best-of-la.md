Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Civic LA will serve as a catalyst for engagement and social mobility leading
  to a more vibrant Los Angeles County. Offering platforms for both online and
  offline participation in civic life, the initiative is positioned to bring
  stakeholders together -- Angelenos and institutions -- in ways that strengthen
  their relationships to one another and the neighborhoods, clients and causes
  they support. The goal is to help generate and facilitate solutions to
  problems facing communities through the engagement of their respective
  members; Civic LA will equip residents and organizations with the tools they
  need to expand economic opportunity and social mobility through their
  participation in civic life.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  The IUPUI Task Force on Civic Engagement broadly defines the term civic life
  and civic engagement interchangeably as a concept that generally includes
  activities that build on the collective resources, skills, expertise and
  knowledge of citizens to improve the quality of life in communities. The aim
  of Civic LA is to (with that definition in mind) fully support all five goals
  of LA2050 -- making Los Angeles the best and healthiest place to live, play,
  create, learn and especially connect. The project will help Angelenos address
  the concerns of their communities by serving as a conduit for information and
  resources. Civic LA will put everyday people in touch with their capacity to
  make a difference and create more fulfilling lives for themselves, their
  families and their neighbors. 
   
   Civic LA will gather and disseminate information from the nonprofit and public sector as well as private organizations on ways to participate in civic life across Los Angeles County. The initiative will offer a centralized mechanism to enlist, receive and coordinate support -- whether time and talent, financial resources, or political voice -- for civic engagement activities which may include: public meetings, forums, special events and community activities; skill and leadership training opportunities; service & volunteerism, governing board participation or other ways to contribute value to the community.
   
   As a convener, Civic LA will partner to host neighborhood based workshops and resource fairs where attendees can learn about enrollment/participation in eligible programs, services and public benefits for which they qualify. Examples may include early childhood education enrollment fairs, parent education classes, higher education and adult learning information sessions, employment fairs and career training, community issue education, and assistance for special populations (e.g. English language learners; small, minority or women owned businesses; veterans and military families, etc.). As an aggregator of content, Civic LA will provide online resources via the web and mobile technology that help Angelenos find and pursue engagement opportunities.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Whether your interest is in alleviating poverty by addressing homelessness and
  hunger, you’d like to see a better prepared workforce for emerging labor
  market needs, or just want to find a fun community activity to take your
  family to on a Thursday night, Civic LA will be the hub for you to access
  information on the many great assets Los Angeles has to offer. 
   
   The online platform will allow you use your voice to express opinions, tell your story, and share your world view. Find deeper connectivity to neighbors who share your interests. Learn about, contribute to, and enlist others to support the causes you believe in. 
   
   Imagine what the world would be like if every time you were inspired to help someone or something, you found a great way to do it. What if you better knew how to use, manage, assess, and understand the resources within your reach (human and otherwise) to enjoy a better life? In 2050, Civic LA could be the destination with a 35 year history for those desires to be achieved.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Civic LA will benefit all stakeholders who wish to stay up to date on what
  matters most to them in their your community. Residents and visitors; leaders,
  law-makers and developers of public policy; employers and employment seekers;
  parents and learners of all ages; activists, volunteers, philanthropists,
  agents of change and the providers of human services would all get value out
  of having a one-stop-shop specific to the interrelated networks that comprise
  the social fabric of Los Angeles County.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  Opportunity Nation is a bipartisan, national campaign comprised of more than
  300 businesses, educational institutions, nonprofits and civic organizations
  working together to expand economic mobility and close the opportunity gap in
  America of which Community Centered is a member. Civic LA will serve as a
  local coalition within the national campaign. 
   
   Opportunity Nation’s mission is to restore the promise of the American Dream by ensuring that all Americans – regardless of where they were born – have the opportunity to thrive. Through the work of a diverse coalition, the Opportunity Index (comprehensive research), the Shared Plan to Restore Opportunity and neighborhood opportunity summits, we will stimulate the conversation, advance issues and bring together unlikely allies to jumpstart the American Dream in Los Angeles.
   
   NationBuilder (a local resource) will support part of the technical infrastructure for online organizing and data management. NationBuilder is the world's first Community Organizing System. An accessible, affordable software platform that helps leaders grow and organize communities to achieve great things. NationBuilder was founded in November of 2009 and the company is located in downtown Los Angeles.
   
   NationBuilder offers easy-to-update websites, a people database and communication tools like email, text messaging and social media - all in one system. Businesses, nonprofits, governments, and politicians use NationBuilder to organize their communities and build more meaningful relationships with customers, supporters, and constituents. 
   
   Other entities such as school districts and institutions of higher education; chambers of commerce, business and professional associations; fraternal and other membership organizations; municipal, county, state, and federal government agencies and elected officials; providers of health and human services; places of worship, neighborhood groups, and volunteer mobilizing organizations will all be invited to participate in Civic LA activities.
