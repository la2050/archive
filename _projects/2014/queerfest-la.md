Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Because this will be our inaugural year, it has been paramount to QueerFest to
  engage the participation and interest of the Silver Lake community. Local
  businesses and neighborhood councils within our zone have given their
  full-hearted support for our free, inclusive festival. City officials will
  speak at events during the weekend, and the last living protester from the
  1967 Black Cat Riots will give a keynote address. We want members of our
  community to learn about their history, connect with each other, and play in
  open spaces while forging a deeper love for their neighborhood.
   
   In order to keep this event free for the public, we have raised a significant amount of money through local private donors and in-kind donations. We have engaged site operations specialists who have solved logistics at festivals such as Bonnaroo, Coachella, and Chive Fest to help us execute the street closure aspect of the festival. We’ve assembled a committee of local event producers, artists, and leaders to curate diverse queer programming that tells an exciting and relatable overall story. We’ve engaged local promoters, social media mavens, and local organizations to ensure that the word gets out to the community. Our Advisory Committee includes prominent leaders from organizations such as the American Foundation for Equal Rights (responsible for bringing the Prop 8 case to the Supreme Court) and GLSEN (creating Gay-Straight Alliances in schools). We have engaged local artists, artisans, and non-profits, and will give them a platform to educate and connect with the community.
   
   The main event will be Sunday’s festival and street closure, an outdoor celebration on Santa Monica Blvd. right alongside the hustle and bustle of Sunset Blvd (between Sunset and Hoover). We are working with local government officials to ensure a safe and easy closure. We will build two stages to host the best local queer talent, and we have commissioned fun, interactive, large scale art installations. In the middle of it all, we’ll build a small, urban green space as a kind of pop-up park, which will include a landscape installation with trees, grass, picnic tables, free water, and shade. This area will serve as a unique open space for dance performances, free speech, and impromptu classes.
   
   The festival will occur October 1-5, 2014.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Los Angeles is our city, and Silver Lake is our neighborhood -- today we want
  to strengthen our relationship with the place we live by celebrating our local
  queer history and empowering our residents to continue to make history. 
   
   QueerFest’s free and inclusive programming aims to deepen our community’s appreciation for its diverse cultural heritage, and will create a safe place to connect and explore ideas. Showing support for a significant (but historically marginalized) subset of the neighborhood’s culture has the potential to create more harmony within the overall neighborhood. Tenets of safety, diversity, and harmony will allow playful acts such as performances, dialogue, and other interactions to naturally develop. 
   
   Reimagining Santa Monica Blvd. into an open public venue allows for all play to occur in broad daylight. All who are interested in attending, and all ages are welcome - this is not a niche event. The park installation between the two stages will encourage a gathering place for relaxation and free speech. It’s a creative use of temporary outdoor space that enables people who are perfect strangers, of all ethnicities, with disparate income and educational levels, to come together and communicate with each other across every social border and boundary.
   
   In 2050, QueerFest will have encouraged even more community members, businesses, and artists to be in dialogue with local queer history. The festival could be transposed to other neighborhoods in Los Angeles, to help unearth local queer history elsewhere. Los Angeles will continue to be one of the most queer-friendly cities in the U.S., and like many other U.S. cities, will have a festival to help supplement its main PRIDE celebration (which was also founded in LA!).
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  QueerFest will directly benefit Silver Lake residents, whose relationship with
  their neighborhood will deepen through participation in our unique
  programming. That said, individuals from all over Los Angeles (and beyond)
  will be welcome to attend QueerFest’s events, and learn about our colorful
  history and culture. 
   
   LGBTQ individuals and their allies from around the city will benefit from the range of programming we plan to offer, which aims to represent a more diverse definition of what it means to be queer today. This is particularly significant for individuals who are just beginning to form their identity as members of the queer community, as well as those who support them.
   
   Los Angeles lovers of culture will benefit from QueerFest’s programming by being exposed to local artists’ cutting-edge performances and creations, while learning more about the complex cultural context of these works.
   
   Local businesses will gain exposure and traffic from the expected 10,000+ attendees over the course of the weekend. 
   
   QueerFest performers and exhibitors will benefit not only from the spotlight offered to them on the festival’s stages, but also from the opportunity to represent and show appreciation for the community they come from.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  We are proud to say that QueerFest is a confirmed project of the Pasadena Arts
  Council’s EMERGE Program, and that PAC will serve as our project’s 501(c)(3)
  fiscal sponsor. PAC serves as fiscal sponsor for install:WEHO, Native
  Strategies, Fallen Fruit, and KCHUNG in Chinatown. All donations to PAC
  specified for QueerFest will be tax deductible, and the staff of the Pasadena
  Arts Council has shared their extensive knowledge on how to run a successful
  festival and fundraise for a large scale arts project. 
   
   Critical to this collaboration: constant communication between the QueerFest committee and Pasadena Arts Council regarding budget/expenses; Pasadena Arts Council’s pre-approval on all grant applications; and their assistance on reaching out to their base for fundraising opportunities. 
   
   Additionally, in order for this festival to be a success, we must partner with local businesses. The Black Cat (a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument) has donated use of its space, as well as the adjacent raw space, to QueerFest. Programming site-specific aspects of QueerFest in this hallowed and historically queer space is a significant centerpiece to the fest, and gives it weight. Mack Sennett Studios have donated stages for screenings and a Launch Event. The Eagle LA, Akbar, and Hyperion Tavern have offered to host historic events and interventions in their venues.
   
   We have also collaborated with the Mayor's Office to produce the LGBT Heritage Month Closing Night, and are working closely with many additional city offices to ensure this festival is safe and significant for the community.
