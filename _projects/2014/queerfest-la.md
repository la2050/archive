  impact_play: "Los Angeles is our city, and Silver Lake is our neighborhood -- today we want to strengthen our relationship with the place we live by celebrating our local queer history and empowering our residents to continue to make history. \r\n\r\nQueerFest’s free and inclusive programming aims to deepen our community’s appreciation for its diverse cultural heritage, and will create a safe place to connect and explore ideas. Showing support for a significant (but historically marginalized) subset of the neighborhood’s culture has the potential to create more harmony within the overall neighborhood.  Tenets of safety, diversity, and harmony will allow playful acts such as performances, dialogue, and other interactions to naturally develop.  \r\n\r\nReimagining Santa Monica Blvd. into an open public venue allows for all play to occur in broad daylight.  All who are interested in attending, and all ages are welcome - this is not a niche event. The park installation between the two stages will encourage a gathering place for relaxation and free speech. It’s a creative use of temporary outdoor space that enables people who are perfect strangers, of all ethnicities, with disparate income and educational levels, to come together and communicate with each other across every social border and boundary.\r\n\r\nIn 2050, QueerFest will have encouraged even more community members, businesses, and artists to be in dialogue with local queer history. The festival could be transposed to other neighborhoods in Los Angeles, to help unearth local queer history elsewhere.  Los Angeles will continue to be one of the most queer-friendly cities in the U.S., and like many other U.S. cities, will have a festival to help supplement its main PRIDE celebration (which was also founded in LA!).  \r\n"
  who_benefit: "QueerFest will directly benefit Silver Lake residents, whose relationship with their neighborhood will deepen through participation in our unique programming. That said, individuals from all over Los Angeles (and beyond) will be welcome to attend QueerFest’s events, and learn about our colorful history and culture. \r\n\r\nLGBTQ individuals and their allies from around the city will benefit from the range of programming we plan to offer, which aims to represent a more diverse definition of what it means to be queer today. This is particularly significant for individuals who are just beginning to form their identity as members of the queer community, as well as those who support them.\r\n\r\nLos Angeles lovers of culture will benefit from QueerFest’s programming by being exposed to local artists’ cutting-edge performances and creations, while learning more about the complex cultural context of these works.\r\n\r\nLocal businesses will gain exposure and traffic from the expected 10,000+ attendees over the course of the weekend.  \r\n\r\nQueerFest performers and exhibitors will benefit not only from the spotlight offered to them on the festival’s stages, but also from the opportunity to represent and show appreciation for the community they come from."

  more_detail: "The first annual QueerFest focuses on a historic area of Los Angeles once known for its dense saturation of LGBT businesses and culture. Many formerly queer venues in the neighborhood will play host to installations, screenings, and events throughout the week leading up to the Fest -- and in some cases, become their former incarnations for a night. A veteran of Silver Lake will lead walking tours of historic LGBT landmarks in the neighborhood, and give insight into their significance to our community today. The week will culminate in a street closure on Sunday with a diverse outdoor program featuring live music and art performances, local queer artists and vendors, and a park installation / gathering place for the community.  \r\n"
  implement: "Because this will be our inaugural year, it has been paramount to QueerFest to engage the participation and interest of the Silver Lake community.  Local businesses and neighborhood councils within our zone have given their full-hearted support for our free, inclusive festival.  City officials will speak at events during the weekend, and the last living protester from the 1967 Black Cat Riots will give a keynote address.  We want members of our community to learn about their history, connect with each other, and play in open spaces while forging a deeper love for their neighborhood.\r\n\r\nIn order to keep this event free for the public, we have raised a significant amount of money through local private donors and in-kind donations. We have engaged site operations specialists who have solved logistics at festivals such as Bonnaroo, Coachella, and Chive Fest to help us execute the street closure aspect of the festival.  We’ve assembled a committee of local event producers, artists, and leaders to curate diverse queer programming that tells an exciting and relatable overall story.  We’ve engaged local promoters, social media mavens, and local organizations to ensure that the word gets out to the community.  Our Advisory Committee includes prominent leaders from organizations such as the American Foundation for Equal Rights (responsible for bringing the Prop 8 case to the Supreme Court) and GLSEN (creating Gay-Straight Alliances in schools).  We have engaged local artists, artisans, and non-profits, and will give them a platform to educate and connect with the community.\r\n\r\nThe main event will be Sunday’s festival and street closure, an outdoor celebration on Santa Monica Blvd. right alongside the hustle and bustle of Sunset Blvd (between Sunset and Hoover). We are working with local government officials to ensure a safe and easy closure. We will build two stages to host the best local queer talent, and we have commissioned fun, interactive, large scale art installations. In the middle of it all, we’ll build a small, urban green space as a kind of pop-up park, which will include a landscape installation with trees, grass, picnic tables, free water, and shade. This area will serve as a unique open space for dance performances, free speech, and impromptu classes.\r\n\r\nThe festival will occur October 1-5, 2014."

  partners_collaboration: "We are proud to say that QueerFest is a confirmed project of the Pasadena Arts Council’s EMERGE Program, and that PAC will serve as our project’s 501(c)(3) fiscal sponsor.  PAC serves as fiscal sponsor for install:WEHO, Native Strategies, Fallen Fruit, and KCHUNG in Chinatown.  All donations to PAC specified for QueerFest will be tax deductible, and the staff of the Pasadena Arts Council has shared their extensive knowledge on how to run a successful festival and fundraise for a large scale arts project.  \r\n\r\nCritical to this collaboration: constant communication between the QueerFest committee and Pasadena Arts Council regarding budget/expenses; Pasadena Arts Council’s pre-approval on all grant applications; and their assistance on reaching out to their base for fundraising opportunities.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, in order for this festival to be a success, we must partner with local businesses.  The Black Cat  (a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument) has donated use of its space, as well as the adjacent raw space, to QueerFest.  Programming site-specific aspects of QueerFest in this hallowed and historically queer space is a significant centerpiece to the fest, and gives it weight.  Mack Sennett Studios have donated stages for screenings and a Launch Event.  The Eagle LA, Akbar, and Hyperion Tavern have offered to host historic events and interventions in their venues.\r\n\r\nWe have also collaborated with the Mayor's Office to produce the LGBT Heritage Month Closing Night, and are working closely with many additional city offices to ensure this festival is safe and significant for the community.  \r\n"

  evaluate: "We will measure success by participation.  We hope to have most, if not all, of the businesses within our QueerFest zone contribute to our festival in some way.  We will gather reports from the businesses to evaluate if there are upward trends in sales during QueerFest.  We will also measure success by how many volunteers come forward to help power this event.\r\n\r\nWe will measure success by public attendance and engagement.  This is a free event for the community.  We will only succeed if they show up.  And we’ll only be successful if they enjoy the experience of QueerFest.  Positive feedback will be essential.\r\n\r\nWe hope for our project to not just continue for years to come, but to expand to other neighborhoods whose identities have been shaped by their local queer heritage. QueerFest LA can be easily transposed to other neighborhoods in Los Angeles.  "
  two_lessons: "After attending a neighborhood council meeting, we learned the importance of keeping our festival free.  For-pay festivals have their place, but Silver Lake residents have too often felt alienated by required entry fees.  We listened to the community we’re trying to serve, so our festival will be inclusive and free of charge.\r\n\r\nAfter speaking with local historic figures, we have learned that although history and education are important, they must be delivered in a fun and interactive way.  We should feel excited and empowered by our past, rather than lectured and labored.  The lesson is that \"to play\" also allows us to absorb, learn, and connect.\r\n"
  achievable_goal: "We've spent the last six months engaging local businesses, artists, and garnering support for this festival.  We've gotten venues and spaces donated.  We've presented to the Silver Lake Neighborhood Council.  We've met with and gotten support from our District's Councilman and the Board of Public Works.  We've built the infrastructure (logistics, operations) and sourced production quotes.\r\n\r\nWe've built the platform for QueerFest (which is a statement in and of itself).  We are now in the process of finding the funds to fuel it, and confirming a robust program schedule that synchs with our mission.\r\n\r\nWe plan to spend the month of September promoting and working out the last details.  This project will be achieved in October 2014."
  major_challenges: "One major challenge we have anticipated is not raising the sufficient funds for this festival.  In this case, our strategy is to prepare a downsized festival manageable by volunteers and artists, and capitalizing on the space and venue donations made by local businesses.  We want the first year of QueerFest to feel like a \"hit,\" rather than spread too thin.\r\n\r\nA second challenge is to be as inclusive with as we strive to be.  Despite how diverse our committee might be, there is a chance someone will feel left out.  Our strategy is to work with curators outside of our committee to make sure there is diverse representation in booths, performances, artists, and promotion.  We hope that seeing the attempts to reach out and fold local queer organizations into the mix will create a safe feeling and harmonious backdrop against which \"play\" will come to life."
  competition: "Yes.  Christopher Street West has produced LA PRIDE for 44 years, and is an institution in Los Angeles.  But many LGBTQA in this city do not participate in the celebration, feeling excluded because of the location, the programming, and the price ($25 entry).\r\n\r\nSan Francisco has Castro Street Fair.  Berlin has Transgenialer.  Los Angeles deserves to explore its queer roots beyond the gates of West Hollywood.\r\n\r\nThis festival dares to push this city’s LGBTQ festival boundaries through:\r\n1) Questions -- learning from our past and stimulating conversations about the future\r\n2) Diverse local talent -- many of whom perform on international stages\r\n3) Spaces, businesses, and meeting places with historic queer roots. These spaces have been significant not only for LGBTQ civil rights in Los Angeles but for the U.S. as a whole\r\n4) Free community access. Our festival is for the people.\r\n\r\nThrough our diverse program of performances, art installations, historic exhibitions, and spirited gatherings en masse, members of the Los Angeles LGBTQ community (and their allies) will better understand where we came from, where we are now, and where we can go tomorrow. While having lots of fun."
  cost: >-
    We estimate our sticker price at $250,000, but we have already had many line
    items donated.  We have privately raised $50,000 already.  We are beginning
    a public online fundraising campaign August 15.  We are selling booths and
    lot fees to local vendors for the street closure.  We are continuing to
    solicit private donations and partnerships with local businesses and
    corporations.  The target date for the festival is October 2014, with heavy
    promotion beginning September 1, 2014.

  Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?:
    - Central LA
    - Silver Lake
  Does your project impact Los Angeles County?: 'No'
  How will your project impact the LA2050 “Play” metrics?:
    - Access to open space and park facilities
    - Percentage of residents that feel safe in their neighborhoods
    - Number of residents with easy access to a “vibrant” park (Dream Metric)
    - Number (and quality) of informal spaces for play (Dream Metric)
  impact_metrics: "QueerFest, by educating festival goers on the queer experience, will breed tolerance for the LGBTQA community both local and at large.  LGBTQA residents will feel safer in their neighborhood knowing that they’re not only understood by their neighbors, but that there’s a place for them in Silver Lake.  \r\n\r\nQueerFest will create several informal spaces for play.  We will transform local establishments into the LGBT-oriented spaces of their past.  For example, the Black Cat, a popular Silver Lake restaurant, will be respun into its 1960s incarnation, the gay bar that played host to the Black Cat riots (which pre-date Stonewall).  Tours will be led throughout the neighborhood.  A dilapidated parking lot, once a gay-owned bookstore (A Different Light), will be reanimated with the Fest’s adjacent main stage.  A urban park will be constructed in the middle of our festival throughway.  Attendees will relax under real trees, drink free water, and enjoy impromptu performances and invigorating activities such as yoga led by a nearby studio.   \r\n"

What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Los Angeles is our city, and Silver Lake is our neighborhood -- today we want
  to strengthen our relationship with the place we live by celebrating our local
  queer history and empowering our residents to continue to make history. 
   
   QueerFest’s free and inclusive programming aims to deepen our community’s appreciation for its diverse cultural heritage, and will create a safe place to connect and explore ideas. Showing support for a significant (but historically marginalized) subset of the neighborhood’s culture has the potential to create more harmony within the overall neighborhood.

   Reimagining Santa Monica Blvd. into an open public venue allows for all play to occur in broad daylight. All who are interested in attending, and all ages are welcome - this is not a niche event. The park installation between the two stages will encourage a gathering place for relaxation and free speech. It’s a creative use of temporary outdoor space that enables people who are perfect strangers, of all ethnicities, with disparate income and educational levels, to come together and communicate with each other across every social border and boundary.
   
   In 2050, QueerFest will have encouraged even more community members, businesses, and artists to be in dialogue with local queer history. The festival could be transposed to other neighborhoods in Los Angeles, to help unearth local queer history elsewhere. Los Angeles will continue to be one of the most queer-friendly cities in the U.S., and like many other U.S. cities, will have a festival to help supplement its main PRIDE celebration (which was also founded in LA!).
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  QueerFest will directly benefit Silver Lake residents, whose relationship with
  their neighborhood will deepen through participation in our unique
  programming. That said, individuals from all over Los Angeles (and beyond)
  will be welcome to attend QueerFest’s events, and learn about our colorful
  history and culture.

   QueerFest performers and exhibitors will benefit not only from the spotlight offered to them on the festival’s stages, but also from the opportunity to represent and show appreciation for the community they come from.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
