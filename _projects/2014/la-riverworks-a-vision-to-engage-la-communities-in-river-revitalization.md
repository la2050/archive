Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  A new project to revitalize the LA River promises to deliver 18,000 jobs,
  billions in private development, and tremendous environmental benefits. But a
  fundamental question remains: who will access these benefits?
   
   Today, diverse and dynamic neighborhoods line the LA River’s banks. But with this investment, outside interest is intensifying. Rising rent costs and real estate speculation threaten to displace low-income families in the area. SEACA and Public Counsel want to make LA the best place to connect by engaging local community members to join together in crafting and advocating for policies that will allow them to remain in their neighborhoods and benefit from the job and recreational opportunities a revitalized LA River will bring.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Too often, community voices are left out of major decisions affecting the
  build out of our neighborhoods. Unless local residents are actively engaged
  and equipped with the tools to shape investments and large scale development
  projects, any resulting benefits and opportunities will not automatically
  reach current low-income residents. 
   
   SEACA and Public Counsel are proposing to engage residents, city officials, and other stakeholders in LA River communities to ensure that the return on our investment is shared by the low-income residents and families that called this area home long before it caught the eye of politicians and real estate developers. Through community engagement, legal research, and advocacy, we aim to maximize the positive impacts of a revitalized River, such as local job opportunities and expanded park space. And we aim to minimize negative impacts like the involuntary displacement of local residents and community-serving small businesses. Specifically, our project will achieve the following:
   
   1. Conduct a community assessment. 
   
   SEACA and Public Counsel will analyze data and speak with local community members, community-based organizations, and economic development experts/researchers to gain a deeper understanding of River-adjacent communities—including mapping community assets and assessing the risk of gentrification and displacement.
   
   2. Launch a community-informed policy and organizing strategy.
   
   We will use information gleaned from the community assessment to develop policy and organizing strategies that address LA River-area residents’ needs and priorities. In collaboration with stakeholder groups, we will educate and mobilize residents at workshops on the River investment and its impacts on the community. Then, in partnership with residents and other stakeholders, we will identify and develop legal and policy tools to help ensure the River build out benefits ALL Angelenos, including local communities. We will then work with city officials to include these policies in River investment plans.
   
   3. Monitor development to ensure community-developed policies are implemented. 
   
   Many residents are not aware of the magnitude of the potential investment, nor the potential opportunity the River brings if the investment is shaped with local communities in mind. As LA River development begins, we will monitor activities and share information with residents to help develop tools for meaningfully shaping River community benefits.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  In 2050, a revitalized LA River will serve as a main artery through the city,
  connecting many diverse and dynamic neighborhoods across the region. A greener
  and cleaner LA River will also strengthen a collective connection to our
  environment, providing all Angelenos with access to a precious source of
  recreation. To achieve this vision, jobs will be created and River-adjacent
  communities will see new investment. Our project is focused on helping
  existing residents connect with this process so they too can access the health
  and economic opportunities that the River promises.
   
   By engaging low-income residents, families, and entrepreneurs in existing River-adjacent communities to voice their concerns and advocate for policies that support local needs as well as regional goals, SEACA and Public Counsel will ensure that the communities that are connected to the River today can remain connected and thrive alongside a revitalized River 2050. Specifically, our project will help make LA the best place to connect today by:
   
   ● Engaging a broad range of stakeholders such as local residents, youth, seniors, and small business owners in multiple languages around the LA River plan;
   
   ● Connecting local government policies to the needs and priorities of River-adjacent communities;
   
   ● Linking local residents and other stakeholders to the political process;
   
   ● Connecting with a network of economic development experts to evaluate and cultivate strategies to address the needs of local neighborhoods;
   
   ● Leveraging the River restoration and related developments to expand access to opportunity for local residents and other stakeholders;
   
   ● Promoting the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by decreasing the median travel time to work through local employment opportunities and increasing the amount of affordable housing in this transit-rich area; and
   
   ● Addressing concerns about gentrification and displacement of residents and small businesses.
   
   A barricaded concrete River bisecting underserved neighborhoods has been an unfortunate image of disconnect and spatial inequity in the geography of our city. With this unprecedented investment, all that can change. But connection is key. Connecting local residents to opportunities starts with a connection to each other and the process.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Our project will benefit a diverse group of youth, families, seniors, small
  businesses, and other stakeholders who live, work, and play in the
  neighborhoods along the LA River. Many of these individuals are from
  predominantly Asian and Latino communities like Chinatown and Lincoln Heights,
  where low-income and working class families—the vast majority of whom speak a
  language other than English at home—work and shop at local small businesses;
  and Elysian Valley and Cypress Park, where long-time residents have cultivated
  a strong neighborhood identity with thriving commercial and creative spaces.
  These are neighborhoods that have made much from little; historically
  disinvested or underserved communities that have persevered while investment
  and opportunities repeatedly went elsewhere. 
   
   More than 11% of adults in the investment area are unemployed, compared to 8% countywide. Wage theft and overcrowding are common. In many LA River neighborhoods, incomes are much lower than the county average and poverty rates are much higher. And despite the proximity, physical access to the LA River or other recreational opportunities is limited. These are communities that have already waited too long for the opportunities and benefits that a revitalized and healthier River infrastructure can provide. Our project will help residents in these communities connect with the process, and in doing so, connect with the opportunities. 
   
   For small businesses and entrepreneurs, a revitalized LA River carries the potential of reinvigorating the area with new customers and business opportunities; people coming to spend a day at the River will need places to shop, eat, and rent recreation equipment. Large-scale infrastructure construction projects will require smaller contractors and suppliers. SEACA and Public Counsel will work with existing businesses and entrepreneurs in the area to ensure that they are able to continue operating in and benefit from the revitalized space.
   
   More broadly, the LA River revitalization plan will benefit all Angelenos by providing them with a place to explore the outdoors, get active, and play. By working to maintain the area’s diversity, we will ensure that people from all over Los Angeles feel welcome to enjoy the area and its offerings.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  SEACA and Public Counsel have agreed to collaborate on this project and have
  worked together to connect and mobilize diverse communities and create a more
  sustainable LA for the last five years. Through our partnership, communities
  have been able to come together to identify solutions to key needs such as
  jobs and affordable housing. SEACA trains hundreds of youth to become leaders
  in their communities in order to educate and mobilize seniors, working adults,
  and youth in five different languages. SEACA’s members include individuals
  residing in several River-adjacent neighborhoods. Public Counsel provides the
  land use knowledge to turn community priorities and goals into policy
  proposals that can be eventually adopted into law.
   
   In 2013, SEACA and Public Counsel successfully worked together to engage residents and develop a groundbreaking new land use plan for the Cornfields Arroyo area north of downtown Los Angeles. The campaign empowered and educated youth leaders to advocate for more affordable housing, environmental justice, and good jobs. As a result of our joint efforts in mobilizing the community and providing policy and legal support, the plan is expected to be an effective tool for producing affordable housing in the area and for preventing displacement of existing residents. The LA Times called the plan “A Model for LA Planning,” and it garnered the support of environmentalists, for-profit developers, labor unions, affordable housing advocates, transportation experts, AND the local community. 
   
   In addition, Public Counsel regularly partners with legal and policy experts like the Community Benefits Law Center and we expect to engage these partners as our platform is developed. 
   
   The three factors that are critical to our success will be our ability to:
   
   1. Actively engage local residents around complex policy issues; 
   
   2. Build a diverse coalition that brings together residents, local businesses, community organizations, and other stakeholders; and
   
   3. Identify and implement the appropriate legal and policy tools to ensure that River revitalization efforts are responsive and accountable to existing residents’ needs.
