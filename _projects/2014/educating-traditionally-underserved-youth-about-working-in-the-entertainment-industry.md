Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  We will teach youth from all over the Los Angeles area about the business of
  the entertainment industry, including workshops introducing all of the various
  jobs both on the set, on location, and behind the scenes. We will also
  continue our intensive workshops on story telling, radio producing, and film
  production, but extended to youth from all over the L.A. area.
    
   Using volunteers from the industry, we will acquaint students with what it is like to work in the entertainment field, how to apply for a job, and what training is necessary. We will also assist in job or internship placement.
   
   These activities will be integrated with our film festival, San Pedro International Film Festival. Student films will be screened during the annual festival and students will meet with and interview active professionals. This provides the participants with a full experience from creation of a film or documentary to the end user experience. Students will also come to understand the differences between old school filmmaking and the evolving online video culture.
    
   Art in Motion, Inc. (AIM), which organizes the San Pedro International Film Festival (SPIFF) and the youth training programs, is in the LA harbor area. We have access to several theatres including the historic Warner Grand. We also have access to harbor area locations, including the Battleship Iowa and the "tall ship" sailing vessels owned by the Los Angeles Maritime Institute. Students develop a new found fascination with location filming when trying to figure out how to shoot a scene on the upper deck of a battleship.
    
   Students from all over the Los Angeles area will be invited to come to San Pedro to participate in our programs. 
    
   One thing that sets AIM apart is our access to entertainment industry professionals. In fact, we have television actors, directors, and film editors who work on an unpaid, volunteer basis. We are also unique in having collaborated on a low power FM radio license, won in a recent FCC sponsored competition, and allowing us to teach radio broadcast skills in a live setting.
    
   We believe that traditionally underserved youth have a right to believe in their own futures. It is our job to assist them to discover their own creativity and to develop their own expressive skills.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: |-
  By creating the next generation of world class storytellers.
   With this program, we will be establishing a learning space for underserved youth who cannot afford or are not yet ready to go to film school. Much of what we will be teaching does not require an expensive film school education, and was traditionally absorbed as an element of studio employment. Those days are gone, but we can emulate the original process as much as possible. It’s learning by doing.
   
   The future of the entertainment industry depends on how well the creators of tomorrow can adapt to ever changing technology and the decreasing amount of time available to keep an audience interested. Los Angeles has historically been the film and media capital of the world, but in order for it to retain this distinction, we must utilize the talent of the professionals to train our next generation of world-class storytellers who come from all parts of LA and from different socio-economic backgrounds and ethnicities. For the last decade, Los Angeles has been losing jobs and productions to other parts of the US and to other countries, to the point that we must stop the outflow of jobs and retain our talent and money right here in LA. Los Angeles needs to be and remain the film capital. We hope to make this workshop/institute into a sought after program not only for local youth but for international students as well.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The most direct beneficiaries of the program are the students themselves, but
  we hope that in addition, the local economy will ultimately benefit as well.
  One effect of bringing students to culture is to stimulate them to become
  consumers of culture. The fallout of this is to benefit museums, the live
  theater, and serious films. We are also hopeful that the local entertainment
  industry will benefit by finding a pool of talented professionals who come
  from traditionally underserved and minority communities. The ultimate effect
  is on those communities themselves, as they have suffered high levels of
  unemployment historically. Of course we also expect that the local community
  will benefit immediately from the creative works made by the students which
  will be presented in public showings. The ultimate beneficiary of an industry
  that remains robust and authentically local over the next 4 decades is our
  entire economy.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  We have a history of collaboration with the Boys and Girls Club of San Pedro,
  which has joined us in our Youth Intensive Filmmaking Workshops. We work with
  entertainment industry professionals who enjoy teaching and coaching. We have
  concentrated on accentuating the story telling aspect of the creative
  endeavor, which is new to these students. We intend to extend our
  collaboration to youth organizations and schools from other, traditionally
  underserved areas of the city. The LA2050 grant will allow us to extend
  training to these students, and will provide a modest amount of seed money
  which we will use to develop a permanent presence.
   
   We have also collaborated with local organizations including the Pacific Battleship Foundation, which has graciously allowed us to use the Battleship Iowa for student training. We also have a collaboration with the L.A. Maritime Institute, a group which owns two sailing ships and which trains students in how to sail them. They have also graciously allowed us to use their ships.
   
   Art in Motion runs an annual film festival and has an ongoing relationship with the Grand Vision Foundation, which allows us use of the Grand Annex Theater for doing student training and for presenting formal screenings.
   
   We are currently in the process of recruiting a radio professional to do teaching of the FM production and broadcast curriculum, should we develop the funding to acquire equipment. 
   
   In our collaboration with the Boys and Girls Club, it is critical that our schedules mesh properly. This seems like it ought to be an easy thing to deal with, but we find that we have to be careful about planning well in advance. We also find that when two organizations each supply different pieces of equipment, we have to make sure in advance that all items will mesh properly. This isn’t exactly deep sociology, but when a whole class is depending on the faculty getting things right, we have to be sure to get them right.
   
   There are different factors when it comes to owners of sailing ships and other nautical items. Most importantly, we cannot schedule training on a ship if it is out to sea on the day of our class.
   
   The most critical issue with regard to collaborations is that both sides are aiming towards the same goals, and that both sides are able to agree to the overall process. We have concentrated on collaborations with organizations that are genuinely interested in youth education, and we find that it has worked well for all of us
