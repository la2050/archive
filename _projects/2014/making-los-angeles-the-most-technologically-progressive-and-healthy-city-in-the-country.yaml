  - Westside
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  UCLA Advance Heart Failure and UCLA Undergraduate Schools (Life Sciences,
  Computer Science) are collaborating to create an app and sensors built around
  the needs and metrics of the LA community. At the same time, we seek to
  support local businesses by pairing up with them to provide incentives to
  community members when visiting these businesses.It will use both AI
  (artificial intelligence) algorithms and user feedback to provide the best
  recommendations in multiple aspects of daily life to LA residents; Eat,
  Health, Life, Fitness. We are looking to collaborate with LA2050 to create a
  model that provides access to both clinical and preventative care through
  various platforms while integrating a degree of social networks within them.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: "With a population of close to 4 million individuals, it is a stretch to make LA the healthiest city with campaigns and small scale projects. Rather it is more beneficial to approach the issue of quality of life and health care from a holistic point view accessible by ease from everyone while looking at preventative as well as clinical care. As such, we will need to approach the goal of a healthy city by determining metrics that are related to each other and their prevalence in their respective communities. \r\n\r\nPhase 1 will consist of developing a easy to use sensor (to detect different environmental measurements) and placing said sensors in multiple communities of LA to determine the air quality, toxin levels while also measuring bike and transit scores. Sensors will provide us with live regional data as well as detailed data which to benchmark against the whole of LA as well as against other parts of LA. We will then develop an artificial intelligence program and code it within a simple mobile device application which will be created alongside the program that can be accessible across various platforms such as tablets, phones, computers, etc. The application will consist of 4 programs when opened: Eat, Health, Life, and Fitness- all of which will provide access to several different options. \r\n\r\nPhase 2 will be establishing a wider range  of local businesses to provide incentives to LA residents to one: use the app, and two: provide discounts to residents from supporting local businesses. Incentives will however be only be used for the Food and Fitness aspect of the application. Within the Health option, we will create an AI (same program with different variables) that determines preventative care for basic ailments through the use of over 1,000,000 data points from past clinical care while providing access to local and state healthcare services from which to receive care from for more severe cases. \r\n\r\n"
How will your idea/project help make LA the healthiest place to LIVE today? In 2050?: "Our project may seem like a simple application however it uses complex algorithms, not introduced to a free market before, to target an entire city rather than just concentrate on a specific group of individuals. Los Angeles will be the first city to have an app dedicated to its’ residents and their well being. It seeks to bring preventative healthcare to all (through multiple methods) while basic clinical care onsite to others and access to clinical care to those with more severe cases. The software will be ready to use upon release to the public as information will already have been collected for recommendations to be made upon individualized data points. Individuals will be aware of their dietary, fitness and health habits everyday and will be provided with recommendations and incentives along the way for improvements to their health. Through the integration of social networks, LA, by 2050, will be fully aware of their eating, fitness, and health. The AI system will have more than enough data points to reference to create more sophisticated regiments for individuals. \r\n\r\n\r\nBy 2050 we will have a platform with an AI that can provide healthcare to much more complex cases with the wider base of data points available by then. In terms of air pollution and water metrics, we will have determined areas in LA most prone to elevated levels of air toxins and water usage through the use of sensors which can later be placed at more locations for a very low cost. We will be able to provide the city of LA within the next 5 years a thorough recommendation for improving water conservation and addressing air quality indexes. 2050 will see a less polluted city of LA after the introduction of incentive based programs (free bikes -already in progress in conjunction with local start ups, parking etc) for communities and individuals when participating in alternative transport such as biking, walking, public transport, and carpool.  "
Whom will your project benefit?: >-
  Our project aims for a top-down approach. Our aim is to initially approach
  several regions of LA for beta testing and sensor placement. This includes but
  is not limited to Westwood, Santa Monica, Venice, Downtown LA, Hollywood,
  Beverly Hills, Pacific Palisades, East LA, and Bel Air. This project will
  benefit three levels within LA. It will benefit 1) the population down to
  single individuals, 2)  their respective communities and 3) City of Los
  Angeles. Based on the results from receptiveness of the population, the City
  of LA will be given extensive review and recommendations for improvement and
  or addition of low cost sensors to reduce and eliminate unhealthy air quality
  and pollution in the city. More specifically, this program will be accessible
  to anyone with a mobile device or computer ( from home, work, or pocket).
  Those without a mobile device will be able to easily access the program
  through a public library as everyones profile will be unique to them and their
  location. There is no separation of income barrier as this project is intended
  to target every individual from different communities. According to the CDC,
  obesity rates are rising in LA County–24.3% of adults while more than 20% of
  students in junior high school are obese. While this program will benefit
  everyone, there will be several more incentivized based models for age groups
  between 12-18, and 18-40. 
How will your project impact the LA2050 “Live” metrics?:
  - Access to healthy food
  - Healthcare access
  - Exposure to air toxins
  - Percent of imported water
  - Obesity rates
  - Rates of homelessness
  - Walk/bike/transit score
  - Acres and miles of polluted waterways
  - Rates of mental illnesses
  - >-
    Percentage of residents receiving coordinated healthcare services (Dream
    Metric)
  - Learn coding
Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.: >-
  Eat:1) Access to eateries in accordance with their fitness regimen. Users will
  see incentives/promotions associated with respective eateries as well as
  reward redemption sites for when users reach a milestone/target such as,
  walking 15,000 steps in a day and receiving a free yogurt at an
  establishment.  2) Access to local stores that provide organic, and healthy
  foods. Promotions exclusive for users such as discounts, sales, and freebies.
  3)Depending on user target goals, our program will determine several meal
  plans for the user to choose from or provide healthy easy to make recipes.
  Health:1) Users will be given locations to the needed medical services and if
  determined to be a basic ailment by AI, will be provided with recommendations
  for treatment options. They will also be provided locations of closest
  pharmacies, and shops for prescription or over the counter medication. Users
  will also be given options from which to get insurance for those uninsured
  including an interfaced link to government health care. Individuals with
  mental illness will receive information to seek appropriate help from service
  providers near them. 2)The percent of residents receiving coordinated health
  care will be one of the dream metrics which we will impact by serving
  underserved populations with limited access to hospitals and medication by
  mobilizing mobile clinics to visit communities several times or based on need
  by users for free healthcare services. Life:Sensors placed in communities and
  data retrieved from other sources will allow us to provide users with live
  time information on current air toxins, air quality index, as well as general
  information of water usage as determined by the Department of Water and Power
  and then continuous recommendations for users to improve these metrics. Homes
  that conserve water will receive incentives from different companies. Changing
  user behavior now will significantly reduce pollution in the waterways by 2050
  while at the same time. 3)Access to pair individuals with jobs will be
  available to homeless people in a simple, easy to use online resume building
  and basic interview skill set. Fitness: Users can be structured a workout
  regimen that is tailored with their diet. This program will also use the
  phones system to monitor a steps, calories burned, incline, exercise rate,
  bike, transit score and sleep cycle (healthy sleeping habits). Users will be
  more inclined to keep fit if they see incentivized live progress. 
Please explain how you will evaluate your project.: " Success will be measured on several factors. While we would want all of LA to use this program at once, we can see results from a small population from which data can be extracted. \r\nWe will measure success by seeing how well mobile clinics are received by communities that need them. We will do this by sending surveys on mobile and web application to those who received treatment to rate improvement on quality of life and basic health. We will benchmark results to an initial survey taken before the implementation of our program. This will continue over the course of 6-12 months depending on success to determine the impact of our program.  \r\n\r\nWe will measure the success rate in transit, fitness and pollution/water metrics by looking at how much water has been conserved after giving residents and communities recommendations on water conservation based on sensor readings and then the same on air quality (reduction of cars, increase of carpool, walking, biking etc) all while providing incentives to do so. Seeing an increase in walking over a course of 6- 8 months will show success to the program. Seeing an improvement in conservation and alternative transits when benchmarking with initial readings will strengthen our foundation of incentivized programs. \r\n\r\nAI program success will be determined through both user feedback and in house testing to maintain accuracy of system. The program will be fed with sample ailments symptoms and asked to come up with recommendations. These will then be compared physician prognosis. \r\n\r\nSeeing an improvement in just one or two communities will prove that our program is an effective one and one that is self sustaining. The system only becomes better with more users and feedback.  "
What two lessons have informed your solution or project?: "It has been shown through studies and through basic human nature that we work on a rewards mechanism. If asked to do something, people are more inclined to follow through with the request and follow up with it if they are given something back in return. You cannot simply expect something to be done for free. Thats why while providing a service and asking residents of the LA community to strive for a better city and life, we are aiming to provide them with incentives for reaching certain goals and metrics. Past campaigns that targeted similar metrics did not create success on a large scale or at all due to the fact that either: 1) They did not maintain a continuous support structure that can be integrated within an individual's daily life and/or 2) reward them for improving themselves. \r\n\r\nAccess to healthcare is an issue all around the world. Some parts just can’t receive healthcare because they are either: 1) Too far from services provided to them and or 2) They don’t have money or insurance to pay for treatments. Mobile clinics have been met with an incredible amount of success in developing nations as many people there don’t have the financial resources or capability of going to a health care center. Implementing such programs within the city of LA in communities that are in a similar situation will allow for a clear interfacing of easily accessible health care from hospital to your streets. However while a mobile clinic can’t always be available, a need for a self supporting software is demanded. Here we develop an AI in conjunction with UCLA doctors. This AI program is aimed at serving basic ailments and non-emergency treatments for when access to proper health care isn’t readily available- all while continuously learning and improving recommendations as it receives more clinical data points to assess from.  "
Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.: "Please note, we will be doing tasks simultaneously as we have a wide range of student body to help with the program.\r\n1) Development of an APP will take 2 months\r\n2) AI program will take 6-7 months to build or less depending on complexity of algorithm and initial testing of accuracy\r\n3) We will use 12 months to network with businesses to provide rewards and incentives to app users. As is we have a good network of businesses to back us due to a strong start-up scene within the UCLA and LA community\r\n4) 1 month will be needed to set up server and anonymize the transfer of clinical data\r\n5) 1 month will be needed to create a set of basic dietary regimens and fitness routines\r\n6) 3-4 months will be needed to create a sensor, install sensor and coordinate with local services for access to their network of data\r\n7) 3 months will be spent in social promotion of the app through third party partners as well as through kick-off events  "
Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?: "Barriers we anticipate is: 1) Getting people to use the app 2) Falsification of data to redeem rewards 3) Mobile Clinic Mobilization to a mass community \r\n\r\n1) Getting people to use the app will be a challenge but we are aiming to resolve it by offering generous reward program in the initial stages of our app. Some people may have concerns about privacy of data. However we intend to anonymize all user data and simply coding them in binary according to districts than individually so to get a holistic view of everything. This eliminates the need to worry by users. \r\n\r\n2) Some people may claim to have done or reached milestones to redeem incentives. We will place safeguards to limit the changes you can make to your user profile so it stays unique to one individual and allows you to complete certain goals before changing it. Fitness data will be automatically stored and changes will not be possible.  When measuring transit metrics, examples of pictures, pedometer or bringing your bike with you to the eatery will provide as extra ways to prevent people from misusing the program.  \r\n\r\n3) If there is a greater need for mobile clinics than anticipated we will coordinate with UCLA's mobile clinic program and ask for further mobile clinic vans from the school distribution program to meet demands as well as reach out to VC firms to fund the start up\r\n\r\n"
What resources does your project need?:
  - Money (financial capital)
  - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
  - 'Technical infrastructure (computers, etc.)'
  - Quality improvement research
