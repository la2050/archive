Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  CSU will work with partners to create a series of seven mini Earth Day South
  LA events as well as EDSLA 2015 and a new Produce Stand launch event in
  September 2015. The smaller events will take place in new locations and will
  be scheduled leading up to and after the main event in April 2015. 
   
   During September and October of 2014 and January 2015, we will work on details of the first 4 events to take place in November and December 2014, and February and March 2015. We will work with existing and new partners to determine the locations of these events and to plan educational programming and artistic content. This time will also be used to create a detailed outreach plan in the neighborhoods surrounding the event venues.
   
   EDSLA 2015 in April will be used as an ideal opportunity to showcase the artists and other partners with whom the mini events were created as well as details of the mini events already held. A dedicated booth will have displays slide shows etc. showcasing these events and materials soliciting partnerships for the remaining four events. In addition EDSLA’15 will be the official launch of re-vamped outreach strategy for CSU’s Village Market Place, featuring wraps around our vehicles including our Produce delivery bikes and visually arresting community postcards and posters. 
   
   May 2015 will be used to work on details of the last 3 events to take place in June, July and August 2015. We will work with existing and new partners to determine the locations of these events and to plan educational programming and artistic content. This time will also be used to create a detailed outreach plan in the neighborhoods surrounding the event venues.
   
   In September 2015 we will launch the new permanent Produce Stand/s created as a result of this project and we will use the opportunity to launch an expanded Produce Bag bike delivery service to meet the needs of our growing subscribers.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  By creating a series of events that will offer ongoing opportunities for
  collaborative creativity in educational, artistic, artisanal and food related
  programming, this project will make LA the best place to create now! Over the
  past six years, CSU’s annual event, Earth Day South LA has become a showcase
  of local skills, talents and innovation in community driven solutions to the
  everyday problems around us. 
   
   We have shown that community residents can come together and create a safe environment to have fun, celebrate our foods and cultures, learn about and participate in sustainable practices, and connect with each other and organizations working to make positive change in our neighborhood. The success of EDSLA has demonstrated that there is a thirst for information about and for opportunities to participate in the numerous and exciting projects taking place in our communities. We are proud that EDSLA has served as a catalyst for residents to become agents of sustainable change, improving the quality of our lives, and advancing a more just society.
   
   The event has taken spaces that already exist in our neighborhood, a school playground and a parking lot, and for one day of the year, with multiple partnerships we have transformed dull concrete into an amazing community space. Leaving behind permanent green spaces, adorned by beautiful art.
   
   This project will build upon the foundation created by leveraging the EDSLA brand to extend the creative space to a number of smaller events at various locations in South LA. The new venues and more localized nature of these mini EDSLA events will provide an opportunity to build new partnerships and transform new spaces.
   
   Just as EDSLA has done, these mini events will:
   *Cultivate, support, promote and provide a venue for local and earth friendly artists, performers, entreupreuneurs etc, to participate in, reflect, inspire and envision our movement for sustainable change.
   *Increase community residents’ awareness of organizations and individuals doing transformative work in our community.
   *Cultivate and nurture a culture and environment for collaboration among organizations and individuals working to advance sustainable change.
   This project will thus help to lay the foundation of a solid body of work for a creative and inspired LA in 2050.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The project directly benefits SCLA families by increasing access to high
  quality, affordable fresh produce. Liquor stores, fast-food chains, and
  corner/convenience stores comprise 94% of food retail outlets in SCLA. Only
  75% of food retail outlets sell fresh produce, compared to over 90% in
  wealthier areas of LA. Only 28% of adults in SCLA report that produce where
  they shop is high quality, the lowest in the county. This toxic food
  environment dramatically affects our community’s health. Residents have the
  highest rates of obesity in the county, adults 36% and children 29%. Adults
  have the highest rate of diabetes 12% and hypertension 29%. One in 4
  households are without a vehicle (compared to 8% in West LA), leaving
  residents dependent on the food retail nearest their homes. 
   
   This project directly benefits youth ages 13–19. Youth in SCLA face many personal and community barriers to obtaining and holding jobs. An alarming 74% of adults’ have not completed high school, and only 3% have earned a college degree. Worse yet jobs in SCLA are few in number and offer extremely low wages. Council District 8, where CSU operates, ranks last among LA’s 15 districts in total # of jobs and average wages. Through participation in CSU’s programs youth build confidence and are empowered to create change in their community and in their own lives. They leave with a broad set of skills in areas of urban agriculture, nutrition, cooking, community organizing and advocacy, poising them for future success. These youth are in integral part of our operations and receive on going opportunities for further internships, apprentiships and ultimately jobs, 5 of our current staff began with CSU as youth interns.
   
   This project directly benefits small farmers, we purchase almost exclusively from farmers of color with family operations who sell at the few farmers markets in our area, which are smaller and less profitable than other markets in the city. By purchasing from these growers we make the trip into town more profitable, hopefully ensuring that they will continue to sell at the markets in our community. In 2013 we spent $56,000 purchasing from small farmers. As the VMP expands we will increase these expenditures by an average of 20% annually, reaching $80,000 in 2015.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  EMH Creative Group and GREEDY City: Have co-hosted food-centered educational,
  arts and community events, including EDSLA’14 with CSU. Both bring extensive
  experience, will be co-hosts of EDSLA ’15 and mini events organized as part of
  this project. EMH Creative Group brings expertise in maximizing outreach and
  event impact through strategic use of social media, and GREEDY City works with
  an extensive network of artists, both will bring these resources to the table
  to support this project.

   Factors critical to the success of these partnerships: taking time to learn about each organizations history, goals and culture in order to build partnerships that can effectively accomplish project goals; having a shared interest in bringing services and healthy food access to South LA and a shared perspective that building vibrant local and regional food systems is a viable strategy for addressing the environmental, health, and social injustices; and having a shared commitment to work together to leverage each others resources and expertise to bring the best possible result to South LA Families.
