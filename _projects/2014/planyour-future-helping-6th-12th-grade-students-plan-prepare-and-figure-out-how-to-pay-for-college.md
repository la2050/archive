Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  CCGI helps 6th-12th grade students develop a career aspiration, and then plan,
  prepare and figure out how to pay for college.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  CCGI takes a three pronged approach to our goal of ensuring that all high
  school students graduate with a post-secondary plan. We:
   
   1) Build mobile (in development) and web based (CaliforniaColleges.edu) college and career planning tools that allow each student to develop their own individual portfolio.
   
   2) Partner with K-12 districts to integrate our tools into instructional time and counseling practice (both school based counselors and partner CBOS/university based outreach programs) so that all students meet 18 college and career planning milestones.
   
   3) Facilitate collaboration between our district partners and local colleges/universities to use student portfolios for college recruitment, admission and first year academic placement.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  By 2050, a student in LA will have ongoing college and career planning
  activities integrated into their educational experience irrespective of school
  district from 6th grade forward (likely earlier). All of those activities will
  contribute to their cumulative portfolio on CaliforniaColleges.edu which will
  be used to support counseling, recruitment, admissions, educational planning
  and the entire (seamless) application process to colleges, and financial
  aid/scholarship providers. The resultant rich repository for data about career
  aspirations and college readiness will be used by employers and educators in
  the state to support a rational and thougtful approach to developing native
  talent to meet our workforce needs and ensure a healthy and vibrant economy. 
   
   Today, we are proving pieces of this overarching concept, in real time with school districts, colleges and students themselves. Our progress on A-G analysis and planning tools during 2014-2015 will allow us to help districts increase the numbers of students who graduate eligible for admissions to a four year college or university. Increased awareness of post-secondary options and degree pathways will help students to more fully understand the steps ahead of them and arrive at post-secondary ready to succeed.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  We view our work as accountable first and foremost to students, and we place
  them at the center of the equation at all times. While our work focuses
  primarily on 6th-12th grade students, we house resources on our site for
  community college students and both the college and career planning resources
  on the site are relevant to adult learners as well.
   
   Our secondary clients include:
   
   Middle and high school counselors: with the worst counseling ratios in the country, California's school counselors manage average caseloads of 945 students each. We provide tools, lesson plans and user support to help counselors maximize the efficiency with whichthey work with each student, and automate portions of their work (nagging students for forms can be accomplished by mobile app notofication) so that their time can be used for actual counseling.
   
   Schools and districts: benefit by being able to track students progress in ways they've not had access to before. This is especially important as we are likely to see college readiness become a key indicator in API scores, as well as Local Control Accountability Plans.
   
   CSU Admissions: By providing CSU with pre-verified transcript data (already used for A-G progress analysis with students), we prevent them from having to re-enter data, or hand check transcripts against the Doorways database at UC Office of the President. At scale, this has the potential to save the system $12-$15M system-
   wide. More important this increases their ability to provide timely and accurate financial aid packages, and to devote more resources to student guidance and counseling during the counseling and admissions process.
   
   Community Colleges: Despite growing recognition that high school transcripts are key to successful first year academic placement, community colleges (as open access institutions) do not and will not request or require that transcript data from students. Our system allows them not only to access transcript data for that purpose, but non-academic data about student's career exploration and aspirations that will support educational planning.
   
   Community and University based college preparation programs: Counselors in these programs generally lack access to student's transcript data. By linking their portfolio to approved providers (we have an approval process), we help to unify and maximize the efforts of all adults participating in a student's planning process.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  We have signed MOUs with all five LA county school districts (named above),
  three of whom already have active data uploads to our system. The two newer
  districts are actively working on the file format that allows them to load
  data into our system.
   
   CCGI staff have been assigned to the districts and are actively working on 2014-2015 implementation plans.
   
   Outside of K-12 districts, we have very active partnerships with the following institutions of higher education:
   
   1) CSU Chancellor's office - has invested $170K in the engineering required to articulate CaliforniaColleges.edu with their CSU Mentor Application platform to allow for seamless application by students and receipt of pre-verified transcript data by their campuses offices of admissions.
   
   2) Rio Hondo Community College is piloting the use of data from our file format for first year academic placement of approximately 350 first year students who graduated from El Monte High school District in Spring 2014. Rio's Dean of Counseling works closely with CCGI to inform the development of counseling tools, messaging and the higher ed user role on our professional center/counselor facing portal - to maximize the use of our system for smoothing transition to community colleges. Our goals include expansion to all Rio Hondo's feeder districts (we are in three of six already) to prove the ability to place all incoming students based on transcripts rather than placement exams.
   
   3) We have initial conversations underway with LAUSD's Director of Secondary Education, Gerardo Loera, as well as local superintendent Bravo (ESC South), to pilot the use of CCGI tools in their high schools.
