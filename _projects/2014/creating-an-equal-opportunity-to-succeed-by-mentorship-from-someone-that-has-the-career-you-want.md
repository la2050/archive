Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  We have already started implementing the project on a small scale by
  completing the first release of the website.
   
   Currently the website has grown to 50 mentors and with the $100,000 we can scale much more quickly by adding dedicated technology resources and incorporating the students themselves in the growth process.
   
   The methodology used to implement the project will be the same technology product management/project management I learned from my prior career experience. For example, I follow the same project management techniques I learned at Goldman Sachs, the marketing experience I used when at Adobe, and user adoption/strategy from Live Nation/Ticketmaster.
   
   I have extensive experience in leadership functions and was the Class President of the USC MBA Program in 2011.
   
   More importantly, to gain mass adoption across college, community college, and high school campuses you will have to get buy-in and understand the perspective of users. In many previous jobs I have assembled teams of interns and helped them use their problem solving skills to take ownership of the product and building out the strategy within their own schools. After all they themselves are the target demographic, they will just need guidance and feedback as I let them take on a leadership role themselves.
   
   Gather the feedback of students and have them lead the deployment within their own communities and help them learn the business aspects by observing and guiding them throughout this process.
   
   Work with administration in universities, community colleges, and high schools to launch the product on a large scale. Continue to network with outside parties at education conferences to identify other means of deploying and gaining exposure for hte product.
   
   Work directly with leadership in student organizations to have them promote and reach out to the constituents to promote the product and get their feedback as well to refine the product.
   
   Work with teachers and professors to launch the product to their students as well as gain feedback from them regarding the product.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Today our project will help students will be able to identify and define
  career paths that they did not even know exist and jobs in industries that are
  growing rapidly (renewables, etc.). Students will be able to look for jobs
  they did not originally believe to be in their career path, they can
  experiment with different careers without spending years deciding whether or
  not they will like them, thus decreasing employee turnover. The medium in
  which we employ to help students throughout this path will incorporate social
  elements and gamification concepts to keep it interesting for those with the
  lower attention span. General advancement of skill sets directly related to
  these jobs would be great as well since the mentors will also be generating
  webinars, slideshows, and other content for students to learn from.
   
   Underemployment will decrease as the students are better able to market their skills and abilities to employers so that they can best use the skills that they developed attaining their college degree. Much of the reason for underemployment is students not being aware of how to translate their skills into the workforce.
   
   Students will be able to determine whether this career is a good fit for them through information interviews with anyone in the mentor network as well as eventually computer simulations so they can understand what a particular job function is like without having to spend years in a career to have that experience.
   
   By the year 2050 our dream is to have technology and processes in place where students can get help for their studies, guidance on careers, surveys that identify careers for students based on their personal passions, and virtual experiences in careers without having to experiment themselves in the workforce.
   
   Help everyone who wants a job get exactly the job that makes them happy.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  1. High school students - help high school students figure out which school is
  a great fit for them based on their passions and future goals (even if the
  goals are uncertain)
   
   2. College students - help students prepare to build skills and experience early to get internships and subsequently a full time job
   
   3. Career transitioners - help people see that they do not have to be stuck in the same job for 10 years just because that is all they have done. There are transferrable skills that one can market and new and emerging industries where no one yet has experience in that field. We can help guide people to career paths they did not foresee as possible.
