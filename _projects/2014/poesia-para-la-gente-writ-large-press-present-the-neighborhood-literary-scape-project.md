Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): |-
  The project will facilitate a series of 7 three-part programs. 
   
   Each program will begin with a 5-day poetry workshop held at a service
   facility/organization typically lacking in opportunities for literary participation - e.g. women’s shelter, foster care facility, day laborers center. These workshops will be facilitated by a published and acclaimed poet, feature a guest poet speaker for inspiration, and result in preparation of participants' poems for publication.
   
   The second phase will result in the publication of the work created during the workshop. The books will be published by Writ Large Press, the proceeds of which will go to support future literary projects, and/or for fundraising purposes for the organization where the workshop was held.
   
   In the final phase, both workshop participants (and/or their families) and a selection of acclaimed poets, who are local to the specific neighborhood, will read their published work at an open mic book launch at a selected local business as a means of attracting new customers, - e.g. a small produce market, a laundromat, or a bakery. The local business will then have the option of selling the book at their facility.
   
   At the culmination of the year-long project, we will celebrate the publication of the entire 7 book series at larger book launch event(s), to be held at a public space(s), venue(s) and bookstore(s). The series of 7 books will be made available for purchase individually or as a complete series box set, to be sold at local bookstores, and possibly state and nation-wide.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  First, The Neighborhood Literary-scape Project prompts residents and visitors
  to think about literary talent and inspiration as lying deep but unseen within
  a city neighborhood, rather than merely imported to performance venues or
  bookstores. We would especially like to unearth and highlight the expressive
  traditions of local communities of color, whose members engage in spoken word
  and other oral genres.
   
   Second, we would like to make poetry a resource for finding and publishing the voices, of individuals within organizations such as women’s shelters that lack educational and artistic resources that may also prove to validate their artistic expressions through published works.
   
   This project utilizes and builds upon Avenue 50 Studio and Writ Large Press’ on-going partnerships within the visual, musical, and literary arts communities of Los Angeles, creating a sustainable network of collaborations that could change the entire scope of the literary community of Los Angeles.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Our project seeks to highlight and legitimize local literary voices as a means
  for sparking public discourse and energizing the authentic spaces of the city.
  The neighborhood becomes, in effect, a literary event space, a literary-scape.
  The goal therefore is to not only continue drawing new visitors to the
  underserved neighborhoods of Los Angeles, but to draw their attention to
  overlooked or unusual spaces and to explore the idea that art can be
  everywhere and benefit everyone. In lieu of economic development being tied
  solely to new outsider business, this project cultivates and highlights the
  rich resources, everyday sites, and traditions of the existing community,
  enabling residents, local artists, and established businesses to benefit from
  the area’s increasing economic vitality, rather than being replaced.
   
   In addition, much research has been done on the benefits of writing poetry. For instance, in his book, “Opening Up: The Healing Power of Expressing Emotions,” acclaimed psychologist and researcher on the benefits of writing, Dr. James W. Pennebaker, suggests that writing about emotional topics improves the immune system by reducing “stress, anxiety and depression…” Poetry has long been used in support groups for people coping with grief, mental illness, cancer, and other illnesses. The poets who will facilitate the workshops, who we’ve received commitments from, have experience in teaching poetry to this advantage. 
   
   Specifically, this project would benefit the residents of 7 service facilities typically lacking in opportunities for literary participation - e.g. women’s shelter, foster care facility, day laborers center. It would also benefit their families, friends and neighbors who will take part in the celebrating of their published work through the book launch events. The events will be promoted in a way that would encourage and inspire the community-at-large to celebrate literary arts, and to recognize it as a much-needed, accessible and expressive art form. 
   
   The project would benefit the local businesses that would host the events. By promoting the business as a sponsoring partner, they will not only draw new visitors, but we would also help to establish the place of business as a “friend” of the art community, thereby helping to build a sustainable marketplace. Teachers, facilitators, educators and local vendors would also be utilized in the production of the workshops, publications and events.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  The Neighborhood Literary-scape Project brings together the following
  confirmed and committed partners: 1) Avenue 50 Studio’s Poesia Para La Gente
  program and 2) Writ Large Press.
   
   Poesia Para La Gente (Poetry for the People) is a program that brings poetry to the people of the community in non-traditional spaces/places. Economic hardship or various forms of social stigmas have affected some of these places, in one way or another, all locations are unique in providing a safe setting for artistic expression. Some of the places that Poesia Para La Gente has collaborated with and/or performed at have
   been the Metro train, Home Depot Day Laborer Job Centers, Guerrero’s Produce Market, Homeboy Industries, Grand Park Book Fest (poetry on demand), the local laundromat, etc. http://avenue50studio.org/poesia-para-la-gente
   
   Writ Large Press is an independent publisher, which has partnered with Poesia Para La Gente since 2013 to produce free literary events throughout Los Angeles, including Libros Para La Gente, which brings free books to low-income neighborhoods. This project adds targeted educational and business development dimensions to these efforts. www.writlargepress.com 
   
   Avenue 50 Studio and it’s Poesia Para La Gente staff will market, produce, and document the project, and engage acclaimed poets from L.A. and throughout California to facilitate 5-day workshops and perform their work at book launches. They will also organize visual artists, and assist in the production of the events. Writ Large Press will commit staff resources for publication and distribution of the new work in a series of 7
   books, and will organize musicians, sound, and projection equipment for the book launch events. www.avenue50studio.org
