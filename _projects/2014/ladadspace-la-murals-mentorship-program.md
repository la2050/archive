Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  LADADSpace’s strength lies in its deep relationships with property owners,
  restaurants, businesses, arts organizations, and artists in the Arts District
  and neighboring communities. We are rallying great support for the project
  across the Arts District and with our numerous community partners. LADADSpace
  has received encouragement from Councilmember Jose Huizar, who initially
  suggested that we create this program. LADADSpace is working with the LA
  County District Attorney’s Office to identify apprentices for the program.
  LADADSpace will supervise all program activities, overseeing the educational
  components while making sure apprentices meet internship objectives and their
  legally-mandated responsibilities. LADADSpace has recruited two qualified
  artist-instructors with years of experience teaching art at LAUSD high schools
  and at the college level. These artists will tailor the basic training program
  to individual program participants to ensure assignments and responsibilities
  are matched to their skill levels. The artist-instructors will meet regularly
  with LADADSpace administrators to ensure all program goals are realized.
  LADADSpace will also work with mentoring muralists to make sure that mural
  development deadlines are on track and that apprentices are committing to the
  work schedule as set by the muralist mentor. Finally, we will monitor
  apprentices as they manage their internship duties and fulfill internship
  responsibilities.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  In an effort to serve Los Angeles, which has the largest concentration of
  working artists in the country, it is part of LADADSpace’s mission to support
  and create opportunities for artists, inspiring vehicles for cross-cultural
  and interdisciplinary platforms for artistic expression. LADADSpace, in
  conjunction with its partners, is excited to organize a collective effort of
  local businesses, art galleries, non-profit organizations, restaurants, civic,
  and legal leaders to support the Los Angeles Muralist Mentorship program,
  helping beautify our communities, put local muralists to work, and support our
  most vulnerable and unsupported young artists. Taking taggers off the streets
  will decrease the amount of graffiti in Los Angeles. Even if only a few of the
  program’s participants pursue a career in the arts, that creates enormous
  potential for the emergence of new artists who will contribute to the growing
  transformation of the City's walls into a colorful cityscape that enriches the
  lives of visitors and residents. 
   We believe that the Los Angeles Muralist Mentorship Program will foster artistic entrepreneurship and inclusivity, creating opportunities that extend to neighboring communities and bolstering cross cultural and economic relationships between the Arts District, Central Los Angeles, and East Los Angeles. 
   
   LA2050 CREATE GOALS/Metrics that the Los Angeles Muralist LA Mentorship Program include:
   • Employment in creative industries
   • Measures of cultural and global economic influence (“soft power”) (Dream Metric)
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  1. The at-risk youth from East, Central, and South Los Angeles assigned to
  LADADSpace who will seize the opportunities offered by the program to alter
  the course of their lives and follow new pathways to a brighter future.
   2. The home communities of the apprentices, particularly members of their peer group who will witness the apprentice's transformation from tagger to artist. Home communities will also benefit from the contribution of the smaller art project that the apprentice brings back to and/or creates in his/her community
   3. Cultural tourists and city dwellers who delight in the proliferation of mural art on the City's walls.
   4. Property owners and the city at large benefitting from both the reduction of graffiti and the availability of new mural art in the city of Los Angeles.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Councilman Jose Huizar, District 14 - Confirmed, worked with in the past. He
  will assist in recruiting wall space, mural materials, & project promotion.
   
   LA County District Attorney’s Office, Prosecutor Dave Ikeda, Confirmed.
   He will match first time tagging offenders (through the LA County court system) with our program to satisfy their community service requirement. 
   
   Confirmed Muralist Mentorship Program Art Instructors
   Tod Lychkoff, artist/professor at LA Harbor College
   Derrick Hensman, artist & LAUSD art teacher & art instructor at UC Berkeley: will evaluate apprentice skill level, teach weekly lessons & supervise visits to LA Arts institutions over a three month period.
   
   Muralist mentors Tristan Eaton & Saber will mentor apprentices in the mural making. He pursued street art as a teenager and painted on everything in the urban landscape from billboards to dumpsters. He is a self-proclaimed skateboarding punk who as a teenager was arrested for various crimes including shoplifting and tagging with graffiti. He consults with Hasbro, Pepsi, and Nike, is sponsored by Versace, & his work can be seen at the Cooper Hewitt Museum and at the MOMA. Saber is most famous for an exceptionally large piece he did on the concrete bank of the LA River in 1997. The full color piece took 97 gallons of paint and 35 nights spread out over the course of a year to complete. The final work, measuring 250 x 55 feet has been called "the largest graffiti painting ever." Saber has been called by the Washington Post "one of the best Graffiti Writers of all time." Both muralists are confirmed and we have worked with them previously.
   
   Michael Walbrecht, VP Public Affairs, Warner Bros
   Will assist with the advising and placement of interns following the mentorship program and arts education. Confirmed, pre-existing partnership. 
   
   Department of Cultural Affairs- The Department of Cultural Affairs was authorized by the City Council to establish and run a City-wide mural program in Oct 2013. As such, we will work with DCA to identify resources, including use of available fiscal year 2014/15 City funding for the creation of new murals, in order to further fund the program. We will work with DCA to apply for Mural disposition plan funding, which provides $20K per City Council District for the creation of new murals. DCA will work with us through DCA's role in administering the City's mural program.
