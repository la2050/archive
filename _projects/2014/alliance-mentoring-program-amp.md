  AMP provides incoming Alliance college freshman with peer mentors who are
  successful second and third year Alliance college students. Through regular
  meetings and coaching which begin in the final semester of high school through
  the first year of college, mentors provide personal guidance and counseling to
  support the new college students' seamless transition into college, as well as
  success in that critical first year of college. AMP builds both mentor and
  mentee development by encouraging growth in the areas of leadership,
  communication, self-direction, and problem solving skills. In 2014-15, AMP
  will expand to include 700 Alliance college freshman and 100 mentors who
  attend 12 southern California colleges & universities.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Alliance begins by identifying mentors from Alliance alumni who are in their
  second or third year of college at one of the 12 largest feeder colleges for
  Alliance graduates. Potential mentors are nominated by Alliance teachers and
  administrators, interviewed and rated based on their academic success,
  resilience, campus involvement, time management, and willingness to commit to
  the program for a year. As the program expands, mentor recruitment will expand
  to include the existing pool of mentees who have successfully moved on to
  their second year of college. 
   
   After mentors are secured, mentee recruitment begins in April at 13 participating Alliance high schools. All Alliance students attending the targeted post-secondary institutions are eligible to participate and are highly encouraged to do so via an introductory program presentation that occurs during the school day at participating high school sites. Potential mentees provide personal and academic information that assists in developing the most productive mentor/mentee pairings. 
   
   The relationship between the mentor and the mentee is paramount to the success of the program. Mentees are placed in groups led by a mentor using information gathered during the recruitment process. After the group placements are completed, all AMP participants (mentors and mentees) meet at the high school site, prior to high school graduation. The purpose of these kick-off events is to enhance the bond between mentors and mentees and between mentees themselves. Mentors meet with their mentees formally four times throughout the school year to discuss specific topics related to the mentees integration into college life. Additionally, mentors and mentees are encouraged and often meet more frequently and informally throughout the year. 
   
   Mentors receive monthly professional development in a group setting to encourage collaboration and learning among mentors. Curriculum for the mentors is research-based and includes such topics as professional communication, data tracking, time management, leadership training, and problem solving skills. Additionally, professional development sessions include self-reflection, sharing of best practices, providing relevant feedback on AMP, and celebrating successes. 
   
   AMP mentors also work closely with the 12 colleges and universities, ensuring mentees are successfully integrated into existing university-based programs for first year and first generation college students.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  On average, college graduates have healthier, more productive and civically
  engaged lives. College graduate are two times more likely to vote than those
  without a degree, will earn 66% more income over their lifetime, are 67% less
  likely to live in poverty, and are two times more likely to volunteer. 
   
   Nationally, only 8.3 percent of low-income students earn a bachelor’s degree by their mid-20s. In Los Angeles Unified School District where 77% of students live in households so poor that they qualify for the federal Free and Reduced Lunch program, the importance of increasing college going and graduation rates are important for the long-term health of the economic, civic and cultural life of Los Angeles and for all its students. 
   
   Even for those high school graduates who go to college, nearly 50% do not graduate within 5 years. Research demonstrates that the majority of college dropouts happen in the first year with more than 30% of college freshmen quitting by the end of their freshman year. For low-income, first generation college students, this first year dropout rate is even more pronounced. As striking, anywhere from 10-40% of students experience "summer melt", the phenomenon in which students are accepted to college, but never actually attend college. Again, low-income and first generation students experience “summer melt” at far higher rates. 
   
   While Alliance students graduate high school and are accepted to college at rates significantly higher than their peers in LAUSD and the state, first year college persistence rates for our alumni mirror national trends. For each graduating class, 65% to 70% of students persist through the first year of college into the second. 
   
   In the first two years of AMP, the "summer melt" rate decreased from 22% to 15% and first year persistence rates increased from 85% to 90%. 
   
    AMP provides an innovative and sustainable way to support low-income students in their transition into and through that first critical year of college, significantly increasing their likelihood of post-secondary degree attainment and as a result a healthier, more productive and civically engaged life. 
   
   AMP also offers a unique partnership model between K-12 school districts and post-secondary institutions to support the seamless and successful transition into and through the first year of college.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  The immediate beneficiaries of AMP are the low-income students participating
  in the program -- both the incoming college freshman mentees and second and
  third year college peer mentors. AMP will increase mentee first year college
  completion rates and increase significantly their odds of graduating from
  college. AMP mentors also gain valuable leadership and work-readiness skills
  as part of the program. 
   
   AMP will also benefit the participating colleges and universities, strengthening the first year programming and persistence rates for its students. AMP students provide a systematic feedback and evaluation loop to inform universities about the efficacy of their first year and first generation programs. 
   
   Longer term, the beneficiaries will be the families and the communities of the AMP students. A college education changes more than just the life of a student, it has the power to change an entire community. Those with a college degree are more likely to be active in their neighborhoods by volunteering and voting in local elections. Most importantly, college graduates serve as role models for their families, friends and neighbors, inspiring them to follow in their footsteps.

  School, Alliance Collins Family College-Ready High School and Alliance Media
  Arts and Entertainment Design. In 2014-15, Alliance College-Ready Academy High
  School 16 will join the program. 
   
   Participating community colleges include East Los Angeles College, Pasadena City College, El Camino College, Santa Monica College, and Los Angeles City College. Participating four year universities include Cal State Los Angeles, Cal State Dominguez Hills, Cal State Northridge, Cal Poly Pomona, UCLA, UC Riverside, and UC Irvine. 
   
   The colleges and universities provide vital first year services to incoming freshman, including academic preparedness resources (via tutoring services, counseling, workshops and school orientation programs) and financial hardship resources (via financial aid, financial counseling, and work study). Additionally, several participating colleges visit Alliance high school campuses to educate and enroll incoming Alliance freshman in first year, university-based support programs and placement exams. Others have hosted orientation days specifically for Alliance alumni and incoming Alliance freshman, including discussion of the peer mentoring program. 
   
   Alliance through its college counselors, AMP coordinators and, most importantly, AMP mentors provide the necessary social and cultural capital to leverage the resources provided by the colleges and universities. Alliance mentors serve as extended outreach for college and university first-year completion programs.
