  Our coalition brings together a unique set of skills, including communication
  experts, business leaders, and community organizers. Our campaign focuses on
  one outcome with four primary components. When we win, 20% of Angelenos’ power
  will come from rooftop solar by 2020, and we will be on track to achieve our
  vision of 100% clean energy in LA by 2050. To get there, we propose four
  campaign components: (1) grassroots community education/empowerment to
  democratize solar; (2) demonstration solar projects; (3) media campaign; and
  (4) summer solstice solar event.
    
   1. Grassroots community education and empowerment
   a. Host three community solar fairs throughout Los Angeles to educate local communities about existing programs.
   b. Run five rooftop trainings for community organizations across the city to teach people about the benefits of solar and solar programs.
   c. Gather support from 100 additional community leaders or organizations.
   d. Collect 20,000 petitions.
   e. Educate public officials, including Los Angeles Department of Water and Power commissioners, about the benefits of implementing solar programs
   
   2. Demonstration Projects
   a. Complete at least one demonstration project on low-income, multifamily buildings, which will result in approximately 0.5 MW of installed solar while educating communities about the benefits of rooftop solar, generating clean power that would reduce utility bills for the owner and residents, and providing job training when possible.
   
   3. Media Campaign
   a. Use social media, infographics, and videos to engage Angelenos about the potential for rooftop solar, existing programs in LA, and the potential for new programs. 
   b. Generate six articles in local press highlighting the benefits of rooftop solar and four op-eds.
   
   4. Summer Solstice Solar Event
   a. Organize and host a free, public Summer Solstice event with music, food, games, and speakers to celebrate LA’s solar potential and engage Angelenos on the issue. Goal is to engage 3,000 Angelenos in one day.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Los Angeles has the dirtiest air in the country and reliance on fossil fuels,
  including for our power plants, creates smog and soot that leads to premature
  deaths and asthma attacks. In particular, the residents of mostly low-income
  communities and communities of color, where the worst polluters are located,
  experience disproportionate rates of youth and adult asthma hospitalizations,
  cancer, and premature deaths due to multiple stressors, including
  environmental factors. Health impacts from stationary pollution sources, such
  as oil refineries and power plants, are exacerbated by a lack of access to
  healthcare, limited access to healthy food, and other cumulative impacts.
   
   Equity is an essential part of our program. The growth of the green economy must come with equitable benefits that reach across every LA community. While this project has the potential to transform the city and help clean up our air more generally, we will focus on ensuring strong health and economic benefits in low-income communities that have been left behind during other periods of economic growth.
    
   This project will emphasize two communities that bear the brunt of fossil fuel pollution impacts: Pacoima and Wilmington.
   
   Pacoima is overburdened by multiple sources of pollution; a dearth of environmental benefits, such as access to open space; and a lack of access to high quality jobs, education, transportation, healthcare, and retail opportunities. Toxic facilities, such as metal fabricators, auto dismantlers, and dozens of waste processors, are concentrated in this area along with high levels of diesel truck traffic and an airport. These pollution sources are frequently within unsafe proximities to homes, schools, parks, and houses of worship. 
   
   Wilmington is a largely working class, Latino community and has some of the highest concentrations of pollution in the state. As a result, Wilmington residents experience some of the highest cancer risks. Wilmington is a vulnerable community with a population of 55,000 people with 87 percent of Latino heritage. 
    
   We know that rooftop solar alone won’t alone solve the overwhelming levels of pollution faced daily by Pacoima and Wilmington, but spurring rooftop solar installations in these communities is an important first step to ensuring that front-line communities lead the transition beyond fossil fuels, while driving economic investments that will improve access to jobs, healthcare, healthy foods, and more.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Los Angeles will benefit greatly from a robust market for rooftop solar on
  homes, office buildings, schools, warehouses, parking lots, and other
  facilities. Solar can benefit our environment, our health and our economy by
  providing cleaner air, reducing global warming, conserving water, and creating
  jobs. Our project generates a broad array of benefits for residents of LA and
  surrounding areas, with an emphasis on equity. In completing this project,
  there are a set of benefits that Angelenos will share broadly, as well as
  specific benefits to subsets of the city and county’s population.
   
   Economic Development: Expanding local solar power would create jobs and save Angelenos money. Increasing our city’s share of local solar to 20 percent by 2020 would create approximately 32,000 job-years of employment. To put this number in context, the University of California, Los Angeles—which ranks among the city’s leading employers—has a workforce of just under 32,000 people. Incentives have made it possible for the Los Angeles Unified School District to invest in a solar energy system that, when complete, will save up to $800,000 each month in electricity costs. These benefits should be available first in low income communities hit hardest by the recessions. 
    
   Water conservation: California is mired in a historic drought. Increasing our reliance on local rooftop solar would conserve valuable water by reducing the need for water guzzling power plants. Solar panels generate electricity without using any water beyond that needed for occasional washing. If 20 percent of our electricity generated from natural gas power plants was replaced with rooftop solar in LA, an estimated 435 million gallons of water per year would be saved.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  This project will be managed collaboratively by the Los Angeles Clean Energy
  Coalition (the coalition). Specifically, participants in the coalition include
  Communities for a Better Environment, Environment California Research and
  Policy Center, Global Green USA, Los Angeles Business Council, Natural
  Resource Defense Council, Pacoima Beautiful, and the Sierra Club. The
  coalition has worked together for nearly three years, building support for
  clean energy across Los Angeles. Our coalition represents various interests in
  Los Angeles that may not share all of the same goals but are united around a
  future in which Los Angeles relies on energy efficiency and renewable energy
  instead of coal and natural gas, producing an environmentally friendly economy
  that does not leave any of our communities behind. 
   
   Some of our groups represent low-income communities and communities of color that have long been underserved and are disproportionately affected by dirty fossil fuels the consequences of climate change. Others speak on behalf of some of the largest businesses in the city. Several coalition members are known for their technical and scientific expertise, and for their project-based work in Los Angeles. Our coalition also includes groups that focus on educating and organizing Angelenos to take action on issues they care about, often times through engaging and innovative social media campaigns. Together, we represent a range of interests and communities that are geographically and culturally diverse.
   
   In recent years the coalition has led the effort to transform LA’s relationship with energy by contributing to the following accomplishments:
   
   ● Supporting the implementation of the largest urban rooftop solar program in the nation;
   ● Doubling Los Angeles Department of Water and Power’s (LADWP) energy efficiency budget in 2012 (LA has now doubled energy savings in the last two years); and
   ● Securing a commitment from LADWP to end the use of coal no later than 2025.
