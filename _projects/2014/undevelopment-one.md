title: Undevelopment One
project_summary: >-
  Wouldn't it be good if streams that run from the mountains to the sea could
  again be connected to form a new river moving through our city?

    Lauren Bon’s Metabolic Studio and the Harrison Studio, Center for the Force
    Majeure, propose to renew downtown LA’s historic flood plain. While we don’t
    support the LA River haphazardly flooding, carefully constructed basins
    allowing saturation into unused industrial lots could create a flood plain
    corridor that runs along the LA River and makes use of the network of storm
    drains receiving water from the mountains and the hills around Northeast LA.
    Eemian age plants, from roughly 115,000 years ago would be introduced to
    prepare for a climate change, creating a prophetic ecology along the river
    corridor.  Climatologists predict that the climate experienced during that
    time is close to that which we will be facing in 50-100 years

    We have already identified the necessary permits, mapped potential
    implementation sites, and have confirmed the partnerships needed to
    accomplish the pilot Undevelopment project.

    Undevelopment One will be the pilot project for a hoped for network of
    Undevelopments that could, over time, create a paleo-botanical eavesment by
    redefining our historic flood plain. We have counted around 25 storm drains
    and about as many potential brownfields that are candidates for
    Undevelopment. By Undeveloping we mean pounding out unused tarmac and
    concrete and adding water and letting the land regain agency. Lauren Bon and
    The Metabolic Studio are about to break ground on a waterwheel which will
    bring LA river water back up to the city. When construction begins in early
    2015, the Harrison studio is proposing that cores be drilled down to the
    Eemian, 115,000 years ago, in order to conduct the appropriate pollen
    analysis to locate the species that had once lived there. Undevelopment One
    would take one of several possible sites along the edge of the LA River,
    reconnect it to LA River water, and establish on that site a greenhouse
    inside which potential future plant ensembles would be grown and released in
    the larger environment, in small experimental sites over the years as the
    weather warms. Our hope is that inspired  cooperation among land owners and
    agencies will allow remediation without necessarily owning and controlling
    the land. We hope to educate through Undevelopment One that Another City Is
    Possible, one in which we are connected by a common goal to see LA survive
    into the future with a limited water supply and warming temperatures and see
    water as a human right and a social commodity. We see this as a kind of
    utilitarian prophecy that is at the same time a botanical adventure.
  impact_live: "It should be understood that both the Metabolic Studio and the Harrison Studio see the Undevelopment proposal as a new urban narrative. Climatologists predict that the climate experienced during the Eemian Age is close to that which we will be facing in 50-100 years. We note that many cities in the world, perhaps a majority, have profoundly mistreated their river systems. The model that the Harrison Studio and Metabolic Studio wish to put in place is replicable as cities around the world realize that a new way to justify their relationship to nature and the larger environment within which they are embedded has been made available. Our hope is that all artists, engineers, politicians, urban planners and visionaries network plans, funding and initiatives to address entropy rebalancing—meaning that all living systems move toward entropy, but that rate of that process in contemporary society, the stress on nature and on all our living systems is such that we can no longer think of any individual city but rather of collective actions that can rebalance entropy.\r\n\r\n“Artists Must Create on the Same Scale that Society has the Capacity to Destroy.”"
  who_benefit: The LA River corridor and the broader Los Angeles watershed and community
  partners_collaboration: "Each Undevelopment project will be a public/private partnership requiring local, state, and federal agencies and private property owners to cooperate. Our team working on Bending the River Back Into the City is poised to assist with the implementation and have been confirmed: engineers from Geosyntec, landscape/construction professionals from Valley Crest, public affairs advocates from KindelGagan and climatologists from UCLA. The Metabolic Studio, in collaboration with the Harrison Studio, is applying for support for a pilot project for a network of Undevelopment projects. Helen and Newton Harrison of the Harrison Studio have been working with climate change and what future ecosystems might look like for many decades.\r\n\r\nIt should be understood that both the Metabolic Studio and the Harrison Studio see this work as a new urban narrative.

    Success will be measured by resource efficiency, community engagement and
    replicability on other sites and regions.

    The Harrison Studio has been looking at the Arroyo Seco’s repurposing since
    the mid 1980’s. First proposing a transformation of the lower Arroyo, then
    arguing for the restoration of the Arroyo Seco River and thereafter,
    redesigning the Devil’s Gate debris basin, which later became Hahamonga
    Watershed Park in Pasadena. Lauren Bon and The Metabolic Studio transformed
    a train yard into a cornfield in 2005. Notacornfield brought the Los Angeles
    State Historic Park into public consciousness. Ninety miles of irrigation
    stripping were used to irrigate what used to be a cornfield irritated by the
    unbridled LA River. Since that time they have been working to reconnect land
    and water in Los Angeles and in the Owens Valley where much of our urban
    water is sourced. Bending the River Back Into the City, a three part
    metabolic sculpture, will make a permanent reconnection possible. The studio
    is interested in extending the capacity of the waterwheel to include a large
    distribution network. Together the Harrison Studio and The Metabolic Studio
    see Council District One in Los Angeles as a political area that can become
    a role model in how water can be seen as social capital capable of
    supporting community and creating the capacity for environmental renewal.

    that nurture life.
  major_challenges: >-
    Land use restrictions and permit delays could possibly create timeline push
    backs for the pilot project.  We will and have already begun to engage all
    the appropriate stakeholders, agencies, and channels to create an efficient
    and timely path to completion and success to avoid such delays.
