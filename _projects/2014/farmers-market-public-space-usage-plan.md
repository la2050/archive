Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Angelenos have long standing reputation of being disconnected from each other,
  (not knowing your nextdoor neighbor) our project involves taking farmers
  markets to their roots; once known as Agoras in Ancient Greece, and present
  throughout the globe and in every culture. Today, these public spaces have
  largely lost the cultural and social significant role they played in
  developing society, cultivating community and establish social norms
  especially in major cities such as Los Angeles at a time when technology is
  increasingly replacing real human interaction. Our project will host open
  public philosophical inquiry to collectively help educate and develop critical
  thinking skills of angelenos of all ages, races, and cultural backrounds.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Our model is using Farmers Markets as public spaces to socially engage
  Angelenos at a time when real human interaction is becoming more and more
  rare, the need for public spaces to promote healthy lifestyles, preserve and
  cultivate humanity, nurture community and teach consideration of others; we
  believe is paramount.
   
   Personal connections; we believe is the most powerful force in humanity, it can be as simple as a smile, making a new friend on the first day of school, a great conversation or an instant shared in the company of strangers, moments that pass in seconds but stay with us forever, and help us to feel that we are not alone. For youth as well as adults these are the building blocks to the rest of their lives, providing a sense of security, and a since of value, and an identity that we all can connect with and feel a part of. This is what community should be, FHL helps cultivate community by developing farmers market public spaces from unused and underused public and private lands and repurposes them to create market spaces that operate around the concept of healthy eating, active living, and social engagement. 
   
   For social engagement, we incorporate the concept of using dialectical discourse to coordinate facilitated thoughtful discussions with the aim of harnessing the collective wisdom and knowledge of everyday people to confront important questions and issues facing society, and seek a collective resolve or create a better understanding of the problem.
    
   We will implement pilot programs in challenged market areas, markets facing largely minority low to middle income communities in Service Plan Areas 6 & 8 (SPA 6 & SPA8).
   
   We will enlist the help of local and national scholars to assist in facilitating discussions in the method of Dialectic Discourse.
   
   We will also enlist the support of local government officials, the business community, artist and professionals to generate a collaborative effort to harness social capital.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Our project will make los Angeles a more open, connected and understanding
  city that grows through its wealth of diversity when more people are given a
  voice and their knowledge and experiences are shared. The process of dialogue
  and the space of human interaction are good for us as individuals and
  essential for us as a society. For youth who will be the adults,
  professionals, and policy makers in 2050 it will inspire curiosity and wonder,
  nurture self-discovery, openness, empathy.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Our project will benefits Angelenos of all ages, races, cultures and
  backgrounds.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  Christopher Phillips- Scholar, Author Educator, founder of Socrates Cafe.
  (Confirmed)
   
   We will seek support for local government officials, local businesses, artist and other local stakeholders to create a collaborative effort.
