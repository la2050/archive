  HOPSCOTCH is planned for October 2015, but the concept for the project has
  been in development since April of 2013. We are currently at the stage of
  securing partners to realize this work. The Industry is thrilled to work with
  the Southern California Institute for Architecture on the design of the
  central hub. SCI-Arc will host the hub as well, meaning the radius of the
  project in the city encompasses downtown, Chinatown, Boyle Heights, and other
  sites that offer a wide range of vistas and cityscapes. Alex McDowell’s 5D
  World-Building Studio is also collaborating on the media elements of the
  project: video and media inside the cars and projections both onto the street
  and inside the cars. 
   
   The process for creating the music and narrative material is a highly unusual experiment in collaborative creation that speaks to The Industry’s passion for new ways of telling stories. The work is being developed with five of LA’s most innovative composers: Andrew Norman, Andrew McIntosh, Veronika Krausas, Ellen Reid, and David Rosenboom. Each composer is working with director Yuval Sharon and a writer to create highly individual pieces that will create one master narrative. Creative partners are given freedom to devise experiences with driving in mind, but part of each piece must be able to fit inside a limousine - one singer and one instrumentalist, perhaps; one live singer and one video of a singer playing on the limousine's television; two instrumentalists in the main cabin and the singer in the passenger seat; and endlessly on. This will create an unusually intimate experience for each audience member, and a different experience in each car. The timeline for creating the work goes through April of 2015. 
   
   In the coming months, The Industry will begin confirming its technology partners for the project—and of course a limousine partner! Sharon is also mapping out the geographic regions of the piece based on SCI-Arc as the hub. In the fall, we will secure the production team, and in February 2015 we will cast the singers, instrumentalists, actors, and dancers.
   
   Starting in February 2015, our PR campaign will begin with MPRM, the firm who successfully secured prominent international press for INVISIBLE CITIES. Also, during INVISIBLE CITIES, The Industry partnered with KCET-TV’s ARTBOUND to document the project in an Emmy award-winning hour-long documentary. The Industry plans to develop a similar partnership for HOPSCOTCH.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  The cultural scene we imagine in LA 2050 is a highly collaborative one, where
  the traditional boundaries that separate visual art, music, theater, film, and
  dance are broken down, and the conversation between the arts is fluid. The
  spirit of innovation, curiosity, and adventure that has always defined LA
  makes it the perfect candidate for the world’s next great center of
  creativity. We believe opera is an ideal catalyst for that transformation, as
  an inherently collaborative and multimedia art form. By creating ambitious
  large-scale collaborations with LA-based artists, The Industry’s projects have
  already worked to realize that vision in this city today, engaging and
  inspiring new audiences for the arts in general. HOPSCOTCH, will be our most
  ambitious celebration of the cooperative spirit of LA’s art-making future.
  It’s a project that is both “very LA” and an aspiration for what LA can still
  become.
   
   The city itself is the “set” of this particular project, and viewing the city with fresh eyes is a central theme of HOPSCOTCH. This project began with a central aspect of LA life: driving. Cars have defined life in LA—for better and for worse. Using driving to create a communal experience that transcends isolated cars will offer audiences a new vision of what is possible in our city.
   
   There’s nothing we take for granted as much as the city we live in, the evolving backdrops of our everyday lives. But the environment around us should be a constant source of the unexpected, full of surprise, inspiration, provocation. With HOPSCOTCH, we ask the audience to notice our streets in a vivid new way, seeking to transform our everyday view of the city. We hope to inspire Angelenos to fully embrace the entire city as a canvas for creative placemaking. 
   
   One of the most exciting elements of INVISIBLE CITIES at Union Station was the unpredictable collision of artists with everyday life, as singers mingled imperceptibly with the daily activity of the train station. In this way, art directly enriches our sense of the everyday life of our city; it is open to everybody and changes our perspective on our city. With HOPSCOTCH, we take that idea directly out into the streets, as the performance surrounding each vehicle will offer Angelenos an unexpected engagement with artists typically locked away in the opera house. The free central hub we are imagining invites people from diverse walks of life to experience a birds’ eye view of LA, geographically and artistically.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  HOPSCOTCH takes the entire city of Los Angeles as its backdrop, and we are
  creating a work that we believe will inspire the broadest possible spectrum of
  audiences: young audiences and new operagoers; art patrons and opera-lovers;
  technology enthusiasts; fans of multidisciplinary art, architecture,
  site-specific and community-based work; cultural tourists and members of the
  local community. We look to the eclectic and diverse audience that made
  INVISIBLE CITIES at Union Station a sold-out phenomenon. The scale of the
  project inspired people who even simply walked through the station during the
  opera; we believe HOPSCOTCH has even greater potential to reach as wide an
  audience of Angelenos as can be. Thanks to the central hub, HOPSCOTCH allows
  access to a large audience to experience the performance at no cost.
   
   A large-scale project like this has many additional beneficiaries, including corporate partners, sponsors, local businesses, and Los Angeles' Arts & Cultural establishment. SCI-Arc students will also benefit from this highly unusual real-world application of thoughts on temporary architecture and performance spaces. 
   
   Not to be overlooked are the artists who will benefit from this one-of-a-kind experience. The Industry has already helped launch artistic careers—composer Christopher Cerrone received a Pulitzer Prize and several commissions after INVISIBLE CITIES; tenor Timur Bekbusonov was discovered by his new international representative through his performance in CRESCENT CITY; composer Ellen Reid is receiving a high-profile workshop of an opera in New York that The Industry developed. The many singers, composers, dancers, and actors who will be given an opportunity through HOPSCOTCH will continue to make a significant impact on the cultural life of Los Angeles and beyond.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  The Industry is partnering with the 5D Global Design Studio (5D) and the
  Southern California Institute of Architecture (SCI-Arc) to help build the
  multimedia and logistical infrastructure to make this project a reality.
   
   SCI-Arc is a center of innovation and one of the nation's few independent architecture schools, dedicated to educating architects who will imagine and shape the future. An integral part of the emerging cultural hub of a city with a tradition of architectural experimentation, the school is devoted to finding radically new responses to the real needs and aspirations of today's world. SCI-Arc will be instrumental in helping The Industry develop and maintain its central hub for HOPSCOTCH in Downtown LA.
   
   5D is committed to "building worlds and the spaces in between" through interactive media and technology. Under the leadership of Creative Director Alex McDowell, set designer for Tod Machover's robot opera DEATH AND THE POWERS, 5D's interest in augmented reality situations make a natural fit for this project. 5D's role in the project will be to work in tandem with The Industry to imagine the most impactful and innovative ways to use technology as a storytelling tool, incorporated into both the sound and vision of HOPSCOTCH.
   
   These will be new partnerships for The Industry, and the three factors that will be critical to the success of this collaboration are:
   
   1. The freedom to play, experiment, and take risks in the development of the work.
   2. The shared vision of thinking outside the box and creating work that is of the highest quality possible.
   3. Keeping the artistic vision at the center of everything we do.
