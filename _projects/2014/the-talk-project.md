  more_detail: "The TALK Project puts life-saving information in the hands of over 500,000 Southern California elementary school families---printed materials available in Spanish and English and even Korean\r\nthat help parents and caregivers TALK with their children about guns and, importantly, help parents and caregivers talk with their friends, neighbors, and family about guns and safe gun storage. Free gun locks are also distributed upon request by returning a postcard included with TALK materials.\r\n"
  implement: "We have already implemented this project in some school districts in Los Angeles County. We work with school district officials to gain permission to distribute materials to elementary school children. Our brochures and reply cards are given to the schools and sent\r\nhome with children with a plan to have the children's caregivers learn about gun safety and how to TALK about it. We are putting together a coalition of funders to support the project in specific school districts. We have approval of Long Beach Unified, LAUSD and backing of the City of Los Angeles in addition to lawmakers and law enforcement. We just need the financial backing to get the lifesaving materials in place."
  impact_live: "Programs like this work! The evidence is clear and substantial: public\r\neducation campaigns, such as those for seat belt use and anti-smoking, resulted in significant behavioral change. We believe that The Talk Project will produce the same life-saving results! Here are some interesting facts we include in our TALK brochure from a few\r\nstudies conducted regarding guns: In 2013, in the United States, more than 5 children a month under the age of 12 – more than 1 a week – were killed at a family member’s home or at a friend’s home by guns that were improperly stored and secured. Research shows that storing guns locked and unloaded reduces the risk of both injuries and suicide by about 70%.\r\n– Journal of the American Medical Association (2005)\r\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that the safest home for a family is a home without guns. If there is a gun in the home, the gun should be stored unloaded and locked, with ammunition stored separately.\r\n– American Academy of Pediatrics Policy Statement: Firearm-Related Injuries in the Pediatric Population (October 2012)\r\n22% of children who live in a house with a gun handled a gun without their parents’ knowledge.\r\n– Misperceptions about Children and Firearms, Archives of Pediatric Adolescent Medicine (2006)\r\nHalf of all unintentional shooting deaths among children occur at home, and almost half occur in the home of a friend or relative.\r\n– Unintentional firearm deaths: a comparison of other-inflicted and self-inflicted shootings. Accident Analysis and Prevention (2010).\r\nWAGV not only intends to open an affirmative dialogue about guns and gun safety where proactive and preventative\r\ndiscussions did not exist, we expect to save lives as a result of this campaign.\r\nAccording to LA County Public Health, firearms-related deaths in our county are higher than the national average.\r\n"
  who_benefit: "In order to reap the benefits of other healthy activities, we must work on TALKing about guns to ensure our community is healthy today and in the future. \r\nResearch has shown that we must reach children when they are still in elementary school to be able to make change happen.\r\nOur education and safety campaign will enable us to assist in opening a dialogue about guns where one does not exist. Our specific audience will be caregivers of young children to help them learn about protecting the children in their care."
  partners_collaboration: "So far, we have collaborated with All Saints Church in Pasadena to launch our campaign in Pasadena schools. They provided the funding to make this happen as well as opening a door to the school district. We have worked with All Saints for 20 years and their partnership has been invaluable. \r\n\r\nOccidental Entertainment Group Holdings is a new partnership formed in 2014. They have provided financial support to distribute materials in school districts in Santa Monica, Malibu and Las Virgenes. They will continue to support WAGV's efforts by introducing us to new potential funders and to reach additional school districts.\r\n\r\nWe have the support and endorsement of is endorsed by Senator Dianne Feinstein; LA Chief of Police Beck; LA City Councilmembers Krekorian and Koretz; LA City Attorney Feuer; LA County Sheriff Baca, Burbank Chief of Police LaChasse; Dr. Walsh, Director of Public Health for the City of Pasadena; John Torres, former Deputy Assistant Director for the ATF; and Jack Scott, educator and former California legislator.\r\n\r\nWe are currently seeking support for distribution in Long Beach, Compton, Inglewood, LAUSD, Burbank, and Glendale.\r\nThese relationships are critical to providing financial support to create the materials and to distribute them; each collaborator uses their unique relationships to leverage connections with appropriate personnel in positions of decision-making; and each collaboration validates the need for the TALK Project."

  evaluate: >-
    Our evaluation will be on-going as this is a new project that will take time
    to be able to accurately measure outcomes. 
  two_lessons: "The most important lesson that resonates with us is that accidental firearm deaths are avoidable. In order to avoid the accidents, we must be open to conversation. \r\n\r\nAnother important lesson we have learned is that we cannot achieve our goal of reaching all families of elementary age children in LA County alone. We must have collaborators who open doors and provide financial backing to undertake such a major endeavor."
  achievable_goal: We know it is achievable because we have already implemented it!
  major_challenges: "The first major challenge we face is finding sufficient resources to create and distribute materials to such a large group. We are working nonstop to secure new partners in this endeavor.\r\n\r\nAnother major challenge we have is to differentiate ourselves as an organization and the TALK Project from other national campaigns by other well funded organizations. Our project was first, it is local and has a unique approach."
  competition: >-
    As stated above, there are other national organizations well funded that
    have similar programs. Ours is unique because we are specifically reaching
    out to families and caregivers of elementary age children via their schools.
    No other program is doing that for gun safety either locally or nationally.
  cost: "We anticipate the total cost of the TALK Project to exceed $750,000. We estimate the cost per family to be approximately $1.42. With the $100,000 from GOOD and Goldhirsh, we could reach over 70,000 families which would be almost 1/5 of our goal. \r\n\r\nAs stated previously, we are working to secure other collaborators and funding to complete our project."
  budget: "Here is our detailed budget:\r\n\r\nCost per family for materials and distribution: $1.42 We would use the entire grant to reach 70,422 elementary age families in Los Angeles County."

    Our project will keep kids safe, so they can have positive childhood
    experiences, free of firearms accidents; the project will strengthen
    communities with open discussions about guns and gun safety; and our project
    will reduce the rate of gun violence and accidental deaths as a result of
    unsecured firearms in LA County.

  There are three main objectives for the Invisible to Invincible Campaign: 1)
  Political/Community change regarding the four challenges identified in our
  research & policy report, 2) increasing awareness & support for homeless youth
  within our community and neighbors, and 3) personal transformation for program
  participants. As Jovenes continues to expand our housing capacity, we also
  seek to identify and address policies and systems that push youth into
  homelessness or which contribute to the challenges they face as they seek to
  move their lives forward. 
   
   Our youth recently made a documentary entitled “From Invisible to Invincible” which tells powerful stories of how they became homeless and highlights their resilience. The Invisible to Invincible Campaign will utilize this film, along with our research and policy report, to educate our community and empower our youth to create change. Currently, Jovenes is offering three types of internships within this campaign:
   
   1. Invisible to Invincible Interns: raise awareness of youth homelessness in our Los Angeles, and advocate for potential solutions. In addition, interns will work with Jovenes staff to develop and coordinate new tools and activities to assist our clients and youth in our community overcome their personal cycles of homelessness and access the necessary resources for a better future. These interns also lead presentations and screenings of the Jovenes documentary. 
   2. Peer Healthcare Ambassadors: Obtaining health coverage is a priority for homeless youth, but navigating the healthcare system presents a constant challenge. Through partnerships with agencies that specialize in healthcare enrollment, Jovenes is able to create internship opportunities where our youth become trained in healthcare promotion and conduct youth focused outreach and education activities to help other youth receive the care they need. 
   3. Social Media Ambassadors: Create content through blogs, Facebook, and Twitter to create awareness for the Invisible to Invincible Campaign and the challenges faced by homeless youth.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  This project has a chance to change the way LA sees and understands youth
  homelessness, and the ways homeless youth view themselves. By creating
  powerful content utilizing research, program-based data, and storytelling and
  utilizing the reach of social media, creative presentations, and strong
  partnerships, the #Invisible2Invincible campaign has the potential to help
  prioritize homeless youth as a population which needs every opportunity to
  succeed. 
   The young men housed at Jovenes come from a very diverse set of backgrounds and have many reasons why they are experiencing homelessness. We see youth who have recently immigrated to the US, youth recently released from jail, youth who have been institutionalized through the foster care system, LGBTQ youth who have been pushed out of their homes, youth with mental disabilities, youth leaving gangs, and a variety of ethnicities 
   Despite their differences, the youth (especially those who choose to participate in the #Invisible2Invincible Campaign) learn to see through what typically sets them apart and understand how to come together. Through Jovenes, youth learn that homelessness is just an experience that they are going through- it doesn’t define them or limit their dreams. This lesson exemplified in how youth begin to support one another, provide encouragement, and celebrate each other’s successes. Each of the youth has experienced times when they have been put down or made to feel invisible. By working together to tap into their inherent resiliency and strengths, they begin to feel Invincible and learn how to overcome their challenges in a positive and productive way.
   In addition to changing the narrative and raising awareness for homeless youth, this campaign can also make LA a healthier place to live today and in 2050 by advocating for increased permanent housing and ensuring at-risk and homeless youth have access to healthcare. Through Jovenes’ growing Continuum of Care, which is expanding to over 70 units of housing (including short-term shelter, permanent supportive housing, affordable housing, and subsidized rental units), we will be able to showcase the various ways our city can end youth homelessness through public/private partnerships. By creating youth-friendly healthcare outreach materials & presentations, this campaign can make the process for youth to enroll in healthcare a less daunting and more accessible opportunity.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  On any given night, there are over 5,000 youth experiencing homelessness on
  the streets of Los Angeles. In the public schools surrounding Jovenes, we have
  learned that there are over 1,000 students who face housing instability.
  Although the youth we serve come from diverse backgrounds, common barriers to
  a stable future are found throughout our target population. The findings in
  our Research and Policy Report, titled From the Fringes - Understanding
  Homelessness Transition Age Youth in Inner City Los Angeles. This report
  identified four main challenges faced by homeless youth, which we are
  addressing through the campaign: 
   1. Barriers to safe, supportive, and affordable housing
   2. Challenges accessing basic benefits and health services
   3. Barriers to educational, professional, and economic development 
   4. Overcoming trauma and emotional illiteracy.
   
   The membership base for the campaign primarily comes from the young men Jovenes serves in our shelter programs and youth who have exited homelessness and moved into permanent housing. When working with homeless youth, we see that providing small stipends recognizes the immediate needs of our youth and values the commitment they make to this project. In addition, Jovenes will continue to work with partners and volunteers to create storytelling projects featuring the youth we serve in order to highlight their stories, raise awareness, and improve our youth’s sense and vision of themselves through art.
   
   Through this campaign, Jovenes seeks to provide internships and leadership development activities to approximately 20 youth each year. All youth are between the ages of 18-25, are currently or have recently experienced homelessness, and are predominantly Latino and African-American. We seek to have a broad impact through this campaign that could potentially benefit the thousands of youth who experience homelessness in Los Angeles each year.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  In March 2014, the Invisible to Invincible Campaign began operating out of the
  brand new Wellness Center at the LAC+USC General Hospital, where we are able
  to engage in close partnership and youth development practices with the
  fifteen other organizations that are co-located at this facility. Basing these
  internships and activities out of the Wellness Center provides youth with
  valuable work experience in a professional setting. 
   Engaging with partners will be key to the success of the Invisible to Invincible Campaign. Partnerships are critical to advance our policy/systems change agenda, create additional opportunities for youth, and create storytelling projects. The following are key confirmed organizations and partners whom Jovenes is collaborating with to move this project forward:
   1. Wellness Center organizations
   2. Building Healthy Communities- Boyle Heights (includes over 40 Boyle Heights based non-profits)
   3. Corporation for Supportive Housing
   4. Department of Mental Health/Housing Institute
   5. The Los Angeles Coalition to End Youth Homelessness
   6. Boyle Heights Coalition for a Safe and Drug-Free Community
   7. Art Center College of Design
   8. Advancing Justice LA
   9. Boyle Heights Technology Youth Center/Youth Opportunity Movement
   10. Brothers, Sons, Selves Collaborative for Boys & Young Men of Color
