    We want to rebuild our platform so that we can cut the time it takes to
    produce mobile apps down, from months to only days, as well as release web
    based apps in the same day so that we can make the platform more affordable
    for nonprofits. By rebuilding our platform we'll be able to service more
    organizations in less time, for less money, ultimately connecting more
    people to volunteer and support opportunities. 
  implement: >-
    We'll rebuild our the core technology that drives our platform to allow
    organizations to deploy both mobile apps and/or web apps to recruit and
    manage volunteers, raise money through traditional donations and social
    fundraising tools, promote their events and recruit items they can ask for
    via wish lists. 100% of the grant would go toward the cost to produce the
    new technology by allowing us to hire extra developers.
  impact_connect: "Today the web apps will allows the smaller organizations that can't afford mobile apps the ability to launch and deploy web apps for super low or no cost. For todays larger organizations, they'll be able to build and deploy mobile apps within days rather than months to help them conect with their supporters. \r\nBy making the technology less expensive and more accessible for all organizations, we'll be abel to gather and assess real life data, helping us to architect a better future in 2050 based on real insights to the community."
  who_benefit: >-
    Nonprofit organizations that recruit volunteers, raise donations and host
    benefit events. Both small and large organizations would be able to utilize
    the technology.
  collaboration: >-
    We are already working closely with Habitat for Humanity of Greater LA on a
    beta version of the technology and they'll continue to support the platform.
    We'd also love to collaborate with all other local organizations on the
    build of the platform to suit their operational needs.

  evaluate: "Success would be defined by:\r\n\r\n- # of organizations using the platform\r\n- Cashflow stability to be able to continue to support the platform\r\n- # of individual using the applications\r\n- speed of applications to market\r\n- Amount of funds raised \r\n"
  two_lessons: "#1: We deployed a mobile DIY app solution that wasn't customizable enough\r\n#2: We deployed a beta mobile solution with Habitat for Humanity of Greater LA that we've been learning from"
  achievable_goal: >-
    We estimate that the platform rebuild would take 2 engineers roughly 400
    hours of work which would still allows us to get it to market and deploy to
    the market. 
  major_challenges: >-
    The major barriers to entry are #1: awareness of the platform existing and
    the #2 barrier we feel we'll run into is that people will feel like it might
    be expensive. We plan to leverage both inbound marketing and direct outreach
    to educate the public about the availability and the price points.  We'll
    also leverage  case studies as we have the experience to help other
    organizations understand the potential of direct impact.
  competition: >-
    There are other organizations doing pieces of this but the market is totally
    fragmented. We'd be releasing a platform offering the array of tools plus
    new ones, all inside of one platform and incredibly competitive pricing and
    sometimes free. 
  cost: >-
    We believe the $100k will cover the cost of the build out. Through sales of
    the product we plan to maintain the carry costs to continue to support the
    nonprofits who will be using the tools.
  budget: "$40k = Full time senior developer/data architect at $100 p/h x 400 hours\r\n$40k = Full time senior front end developer at $100 p/h x 400 hours\r\n$10k = Servers and subscription accounts to manage the development environment\r\n$10k = PR / Marketing for 3 months to build supporting revenue"
