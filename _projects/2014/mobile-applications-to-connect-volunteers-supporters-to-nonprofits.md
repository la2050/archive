more_detail: >-
  We want to rebuild our platform so that we can cut the time it takes to
  produce mobile apps down, from months to only days, as well as release web
  based apps in the same day so that we can make the platform more affordable
  for nonprofits. By rebuilding our platform we'll be able to service more
  organizations in less time, for less money, ultimately connecting more people
  to volunteer and support opportunities. 
implement: >-
  We'll rebuild our the core technology that drives our platform to allow
  organizations to deploy both mobile apps and/or web apps to recruit and manage
  volunteers, raise money through traditional donations and social fundraising
  tools, promote their events and recruit items they can ask for via wish lists.
  100% of the grant would go toward the cost to produce the new technology by
  allowing us to hire extra developers.
impact_connect: "Today the web apps will allows the smaller organizations that can't afford mobile apps the ability to launch and deploy web apps for super low or no cost. For todays larger organizations, they'll be able to build and deploy mobile apps within days rather than months to help them conect with their supporters. \r\nBy making the technology less expensive and more accessible for all organizations, we'll be abel to gather and assess real life data, helping us to architect a better future in 2050 based on real insights to the community."
who_benefit: >-
  Nonprofit organizations that recruit volunteers, raise donations and host
  benefit events. Both small and large organizations would be able to utilize
  the technology.
collaboration: >-
  We are already working closely with Habitat for Humanity of Greater LA on a
  beta version of the technology and they'll continue to support the platform.
  We'd also love to collaborate with all other local organizations on the build
  of the platform to suit their operational needs. 
How will your project impact the LA2050 “Connect” metrics?:
  - Rates of volunteerism
  - Adults getting sufficient social & emotional support
  - Attendance at cultural events
  - Participation in neighborhood councils
  - Percentage of Angelenos that volunteer informally (Dream Metric)
  - Government responsiveness to residents’ needs (Dream Metric)
  - Total number of social media friends (Dream Metric)
  - Attendance at public/open street gatherings (Dream Metric)
  - Raise more money
evaluate: "Success would be defined by:\r\n\r\n- # of organizations using the platform\r\n- Cashflow stability to be able to continue to support the platform\r\n- # of individual using the applications\r\n- speed of applications to market\r\n- Amount of funds raised \r\n"
two_lessons: "#1: We deployed a mobile DIY app solution that wasn't customizable enough\r\n#2: We deployed a beta mobile solution with Habitat for Humanity of Greater LA that we've been learning from"
achievable_goal: >-
  We estimate that the platform rebuild would take 2 engineers roughly 400 hours
  of work which would still allows us to get it to market and deploy to the
  market. 
major_challenges: >-
  The major barriers to entry are #1: awareness of the platform existing and the
  #2 barrier we feel we'll run into is that people will feel like it might be
  expensive. We plan to leverage both inbound marketing and direct outreach to
  educate the public about the availability and the price points.  We'll also
  leverage  case studies as we have the experience to help other organizations
  understand the potential of direct impact.
What resources does your project need?:
  - Network/relationship support
  - Money (financial capital)
  - Volunteers/staff (human capital)
  - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
  - Community outreach
