Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  We want to rebuild our platform so that we can cut the time it takes to
  produce mobile apps down, from months to only days, as well as release web
  based apps in the same day so that we can make the platform more affordable
  for nonprofits. By rebuilding our platform we'll be able to service more
  organizations in less time, for less money, ultimately connecting more people
  to volunteer and support opportunities.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  We'll rebuild our the core technology that drives our platform to allow
  organizations to deploy both mobile apps and/or web apps to recruit and manage
  volunteers, raise money through traditional donations and social fundraising
  tools, promote their events and recruit items they can ask for via wish lists.
  100% of the grant would go toward the cost to produce the new technology by
  allowing us to hire extra developers.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Today the web apps will allows the smaller organizations that can't afford
  mobile apps the ability to launch and deploy web apps for super low or no
  cost. For todays larger organizations, they'll be able to build and deploy
  mobile apps within days rather than months to help them conect with their
  supporters. 
   By making the technology less expensive and more accessible for all organizations, we'll be abel to gather and assess real life data, helping us to architect a better future in 2050 based on real insights to the community.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Nonprofit organizations that recruit volunteers, raise donations and host
  benefit events. Both small and large organizations would be able to utilize
  the technology.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  We are already working closely with Habitat for Humanity of Greater LA on a
  beta version of the technology and they'll continue to support the platform.
  We'd also love to collaborate with all other local organizations on the build
  of the platform to suit their operational needs.
