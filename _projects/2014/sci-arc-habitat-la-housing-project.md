  Project will benefit schools in Artesia, Long Beach, and 4 additional LA
  County communities that have not been selected.
Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Step 1: Identify Schools. We are currently identifying 6 urban public
  elementary schools that are located in lower-income communities within Los
  Angeles County (at the time of submission, 2 school districts are confirmed).
  We are selecting lower-income schools because historically, these schools have
  cut PE teachers from their budgets and have left PE Instruction to classroom
  teachers. The problem is that those classroom teachers have very little, to no
  training or experience in PE instruction or in outdoor classroom management
  skills. In the South Bay region of LA County, we have found that teachers in
  these communities are eager and willing to learn new techniques and skills to
  improve how they deliver PE. 
   
   Step 2: Conduct pre-assessment of Physical Education environment of each school campus. Present report of findings to school staff and parents.
   
   Step 3: Meet with teachers at the school to recruit them into the program. Over our 11 year history, we have found that teachers are more engaged and supportive when it is a voluntary program. Our experience is that 90% of teachers at a school do in fact volunteer to participate in the COPA program.
   
   Step 4: Conduct a large group teacher training at each participating school. Training will include laying out program expectations, introduction to web-based COPA support system, and having teachers play PE games, so they can be reminded of the joy of play.
   
   Step 5: Begin one-on-one peer coaching with participating teachers at each school. Over the course of the year, each teacher and their students will receive 4 individually tailored, outdoor, peer coached PE sessions.
   
   Step 6: Provide individually-tailored technical assistance to launch events/activities to promote PE/physical activity on campus. We will work with the school wellness committee, parents, teachers, students or any other stakeholder interested in physical activity – and provide technical assistance to improve the culture of PE/physical activity on the school campus. In the past, examples have included, launching a Walk to School Day event, creating a one-day Cardio-Carnival for students, designing a rainy-day schedule that still allows for PE instruction, training student leaders on organizing PE equipment. 
   
   Step 7: Conduct post-assessment of PE environment at each school. Provide report on improvements made during the school year and recommendations for future. Present findings to school and parents.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Decades ago, parents felt safe letting their children run freely in their
  neighborhoods, being active for hours before being called inside for dinner.
  That was the norm. Today, it simply isn’t happening. Right now, many if not
  most urban public elementary school children in LA County are NOT getting a
  chance to be active. In the communities COPA targets, parents just don’t feel
  safe having their kids run freely in their neighborhoods. On top of that,
  their children’s schools have cut their PE budgets, so children really can go
  days before they participate in any kind of moderate-to-vigorous physical
  activity. 
   
   COPA can change this for children. Today, COPA can make LA the healthiest place to live by reintroducing PE into schools in a fun, interactive, and all-inclusive way. It gives classroom teachers – who otherwise would be intimidated and unprepared – the tools and skills that they need to teach PE. It gives children an opportunity to learn proper movement skills and create a culture of activity within their own lives. COPA makes LA the healthiest place to live today because it teaches children – at a very young age – lifelong movement skills and the joy of being active. 
   
   COPA makes LA the healthiest place to live in 2050, because by then it will have created a generation of adults who will view daily physical activity as the norm. By 2050, COPA children today will be raising children of their own. They will have the expectation that their children will have PE instruction every day and they will instill this expectation in generations to come. By 2050, childhood obesity will no longer be an epidemic. The rates of childhood obesity will be so low that looking back, we will be shocked that we ever even allowed the rates to have been so high!
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Students’ enthusiasm for COPA PE is an eye-opener for teachers. They are able
  to interact with their students in a different, more relaxed setting than the
  classroom – through play! COPA means no one is waiting in lines and everyone
  has a piece of equipment, so there are fewer behavioral issues, which equates
  to higher motivation for both students and teachers. COPA is a positive PE
  experience for all.
   
   In COPA, children in grades K-5 learn developmentally appropriate movement skills, personal responsibility, how to stay safe while playing, how to assess their own exertion, respect for others, cooperation, and teamwork. Schools that have been in COPA for several years, report decreases in childhood obesity and independent evaluations of the program across multiple school sites show that COPA increases the time children spend in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) during a PE lesson.
   “COPA taught me the value of exercise and how to make it fun…I feel that COPA has been a great addition to the school”.--Ray, 5th Grade COPA Student
   
   Elementary school teachers benefit from the personal one-on-one peer coaching from a Providence Little Company of Mary Medical Center (Providence) PE Specialist. 150 teachers will receive COPA’s PE curriculum (aligned with California PE Standards), have access to their school’s new PE equipment, the COPA website, and will receive instruction on developmentally appropriate motor skills and outdoor classroom management. Working with their Peer Coach, they observe, co-teach and then independently teach the PE lessons.
   
   COPA helps teachers meet the longstanding state law in California of 200 minutes of PE every 10 days – an achievement that most schools are not reaching. COPA results show that there is an increase in the number of teachers who are confident in teaching PE and an increase in instructional time devoted to PE instruction. COPA also helps teachers achieve national standards of excellence in Physical Education instruction by making sure that at least 50% of their PE lesson is spent in MVPA.
   
   “The COPA Peer Coach Program made me a better PE teacher. I learned that although PE is an activity and "fun" for students, it needs to be taught just as if I was teaching a math lesson in the classroom. I learned once students are given the exact steps to be successful they have more fun which makes teaching PE fun for me.”--COPA Teacher
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Providence will partner with 6 LA County elementary schools that have never
  had COPA, serve children who live in lower-income communities, have high rates
  of childhood obesity, and that don’t currently offer systematic implementation
  of Physical Education. Two partners are confirmed - John F. Kennedy School in
  Artesia (part of the ABC Unified School District) and Robin Samana, Director
  of Elementary and K-8 Schools at the Long Beach Unified School District to
  identify schools in the LBUSD. We are in discussions with additional schools
  to confirm more sites. The “added benefit” that the participating schools will
  bring is that they are ready and willing to make a change within their school
  to improve student health.
   
   Three factors are critical to the success of our partnerships with participating schools. 
   
   1. Principal support. The Principal supports and encourages teachers to participate in this voluntary program. They need to create an atmosphere that supports PE as an added benefit to teachers – something that will keep their students more focused and that can improve academic achievement – rather than an added burden to the teachers’ schedules. 
   
   2. Teacher buy-in. We introduce the program to teachers and design a peer coach training schedule that accommodates their teaching schedule. 90% of teachers voluntarily enroll; 90% of enrollees complete the program. 
   
   3. Relationships between the teachers and the Peer Coach is critical to success. COPA teachers report high satisfaction with their relationships with their Peer Coach. A focus group of COPA teachers across 3 school districts agreed that the most significant factor in changing their instructional practice related to PE was their peer coach relationship. This is a direct result of the PE Specialist setting a tone of trust and openness. We know that most classroom teachers have little to no training in PE; we know that most teachers are apprehensive about taking a group of 30 kids outside with the expectation of teaching age-appropriate motor skills; and we know from our 11 years of experience that there are teachers who have their own personal memories of PE that are not so positive and that definitely don’t motivate them to teach PE themselves. The peer coach takes all of these factors into consideration, is able to work individually with the teacher and their students and build a relationship of trust and mutual respect that overcomes these barriers to teaching PE.
