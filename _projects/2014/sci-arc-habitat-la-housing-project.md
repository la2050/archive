    SCI-Arc, one of the top architecture schools in the US, and Habitat for
    Humanity, Greater Los Angeles are launching the SCI-Arc/Habitat LA Housing
    Project. The initiative is an exciting opportunity to innovatively redevelop
    neglected properties in LA and positively impact the communities they exist
    within.  The collaboration will include a series of SCI-Arc classes in which
    students creatively design affordable and sustainable housing to be built on
    land transferred to Habitat by LA County. The project champions the idea
    that beyond the crucial role of providing shelter, a well-designed home,
    both inside and in context to its urban fabric, can help improve the lives
    and well-being of its residents, as well as the community beyond its walls.
  implement: "In order to implement this project, starting in September 2014, SCI-Arc and Habitat LA will begin a series of design-build studios whose structure is set up to complete one SCI-Arc/Habitat home per academic year. The fall semester (Sept-Dec) of SCI-Arc’s academic schedule will be devoted to the student design of a home, the spring semester (Jan-April) will complete final documentation of the project, and during the summer semester (May-Aug) SCI-Arc students will join Habitat LA’s volunteers in order to acquire firsthand building experience during the construction phase of the project.  During this time, students may also use facilities at SCI-Arc to build components of the home at the school to then attach to the building on site.  \r\n\r\nManaged collaboratively, the SCI-Arc/Habitat LA Housing Project will be a partnership which bridges Habitat for Humanity’s mission to bring people together to build homes, communities, and hope with SCI-Arc’s mission to educate architects to engage, speculate, and innovate. Engaging with Habitat LA, residents, and the local community will play a vital role in the student design and build process. Offering students the educational opportunity for community-based involvement, whether through Habitat and resident input, or volunteering on site, will not only inform the project design itself, but can also have a meaningful impact on subsequent projects and the student’s future careers in architecture. \r\n\r\nSCI-Arc’s goals include: 1) examine everything about the built environment—from design and materials to culture and experience; 2) ask provocative questions to prompt new theoretical constructs; 3) lead the discussion on the future of architecture; and 4) create designs that change how people interact with each other and their environment. Each of these goals complements the very nature of this initiative and collaboration, which on the one hand brings innovative design with a focus on health and sustainability to the development model of Habitat LA, but also offers SCI-Arc students the opportunity to engage with real-world clients, local residents, and their greater LA community towards the final goal of a home for someone to live in and enjoy. \r\n"
  impact_live: "Understanding that where one lives contributes greatly to one’s physical and emotional well-being, this project will help make LA the healthiest place to live by helping low-income residents access mindful, creative, and environmentally sustainable design within their own homes and communities. Just as Habitat believes that everyone deserves a decent and affordable place to live, SCI-Arc believes that everyone equally deserves that place to be the best design and quality it can be.\r\n\r\nInnovative designs which respond to specific contexts and users allow a building to become more than a space that supplies crucial shelter, but also one that elicits great pride and ownership, and in turn improves emotional and mental well-being. In addition, tailored design decisions with a focus on health and sustainability can allow for a reduction in future energy costs, as well as increased quality of air, and life, for the residents.\r\n\r\nWith a timeline that would complete its first home in 2015, this project would begin making LA a healthier place to live with its first studio. Bringing good design to all levels of society is a goal that can improve the well-being of individual residents and help foster overall community pride. Allowing room for respectfully adventurous architecture in affordable housing can reinvigorate a sense of civic belonging in a place, something that can have lasting effects beyond one home. \r\n\r\nLooking to 2050, the intention for the project, a replicable model, is to evolve and grow in the coming years, keeping in mind the long term goal of making LA a healthier place to live. Last semester, SCI-Arc held a seminar on mitigation strategies that reduce air pollutants and foster healthy home environments. This research focused on a problem that is not only of national concern, but also a very real issue in the car-commuter culture of LA. SCI-Arc plans to continue studying such strategies for near-road conditions, especially given that project sites in the future may be freeway adjacent. Together with partners at UCR, modeling software will be used to test reductions in pollution from mitigation measures that can be implemented in future designs. Lastly, as the architects of tomorrow, this opportunity to develop creative, innovative, and sustainable design, in consultation with Habitat LA, residents, and the local community, is a tangible way to inspire students to work on these types of civic centered projects throughout their future careers. \r\n"
  who_benefit: "The spectrum of whom this project will benefit extends from individual homeowners, to students, to the wider population of LA County. \r\n\r\nHabitat for Humanity will determine an eligible owner for each home, which will be built in partnership with the families and individuals it supports, with each taking part in the construction of their home with up to 500 hours of ‘sweat equity.’ Once the home is complete, homebuyers are offered a 0% interest loan from Habitat LA.\r\n\r\nSCI-Arc is lucky to partner with an organization that already offers such an important program to an underserved segment of society in LA. In turn, as with many successful partnerships, this project hopes to create something bigger than the sum of its parts. SCI-Arc’s collaboration with Habitat LA will further benefit residents because the collaboration invites participatory design into Habitat’s existing model. Important health metrics are not only physical, but must include emotional and mental well-being.  As an architecture school, SCI-Arc believes strongly in the power of design to better people’s quality of life. This tenet crosses all programmatic barriers, and this project advocates that the same rule does and must apply to affordable housing as well, as every individual in society deserves the positive impact of design. \r\n\r\nIn addition to helping low-income families afford homeownership and have access to creative design, this project equally benefits the students participating in the project. As the architects of our next generation, these students will be defining the future of building in the years to come. More immediately, this project allows them the invaluable chance to design and help construct homes, as well as learn firsthand about the challenges that the real-world presents and the skillsets it demands.\r\n\r\nMore broadly, this initiative benefits the greater population of LA County. Planned as a multi-year and replicable initiative, the project has the potential to make a meaningful impact on the urban scale, with multiple homes planned for underserved communities in LA. Conceived as a project informed by its context, the communities where SCI-Arc and Habitat LA will be involved will play a crucial role in design development. Not only will these houses become a place to call home, each resident is a meaningful contributor to the civic process, helping to shape the communities they exist within.  \r\n"
  partners_collaboration: "Confirmed:\r\n-\tHabitat for Humanity, Greater Los Angeles\r\n-\tOffice of LA County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas and the LA County Community Development Commission \r\n\r\nIn Development:\r\n-\tUniversity of California, Riverside, Bourns College of Engineering \r\n\r\nWhile SCI-Arc’s main collaborator for the project is Habitat LA, the partnership would not be possible without pronounced help from LA County, who has provided the necessary land for this initiative. The first year’s home will be designed in Westmont, an unincorporated area in South LA. In addition, SCI-Arc has also been working with faculty and PhD students from UCR’s Bourns College of Engineering who have developed dispersion modeling software which can be used to measure reductions in pollution from mitigation strategies that will be tested on SCI-Arc’s campus and ideally implemented in future designs. This is the first time SCI-Arc has worked with all three above mentioned parties. \r\n\r\nThree factors that are critical to the success of the SCI-Arc and Habitat LA partnership are:\r\n\r\n1)\tShared project goals: The SCI-Arc/Habitat LA Housing Project is a collaboration in which all parties hope to further build upon a mutually beneficial platform. Through the initiative, SCI-Arc is excited to expand its design curriculum to reach underserved communities of LA, and to include a program that allows its students to be involved, for their educational benefit, from design to construction of a real-world housing project in their community. Habitat LA is eager to test new grounds for design innovation within its affordable homes and to integrate new strategies of sustainability into its model. \r\n\r\n2)\tPace/Patience: Keeping up with the annual ‘design-document-build’ timeline is crucial to the project’s success. It must, however, be done thoughtfully in order to respond to the needs of the residents and community. As the project progresses, resident input, both past and future, can be a key part of this process.\r\n\r\n3)\tCommitment/Leadership: The success of the collaboration is also dependent on the full commitment to the project by both main collaborators. To highlight each other’s commitment, both parties have drafted an MoU to better frame the goals and timeline of the initiative. In addition, SCI-Arc has appointed faculty member Darin Johnstone as the project coordinator and lead. A practicing LA architect, Darin is also the director of DID, SCI-Arc's introduction to design program for high school students.\r\n"

  evaluate: "While SCI-Arc and Habitat for Humanity, Greater Los Angeles will obviously measure success with the construction of the first SCI-Arc/Habitat LA home, many factors will play a part in how this success is measured throughout the project and beyond. \r\n\r\nFirst, continued dialogue between both parties during the student design development phase will be an important measure towards project realization. Habitat LA’s in-house architect will remain part of the student design process by attending crucial review points at SCI-Arc during the semesters. As with any architectural project, Habitat and its homeowner will act as a ‘client’ to the process, and will need to be consulted in order to better understand the needs that the home’s design will have to respond to. In turn, Habitat will also bring representatives from its Youth Programs and Speakers Bureau to the school in order to give students a better sense of the organization’s mission and goals.\r\n\r\nSecond, as mentioned, success will be measured by the positive completion of construction of the first SCI-Arc/Habitat LA home, planned for summer 2015. Together with Habitat LA’s existing volunteer structure, students will spend the summer semester gaining on-site building experience constructing the home. In addition, because the school has space and equipment suitable for building, students can also take advantage of SCI-Arc’s state of the art facilities to produce certain elements of the home on campus. The important element within this metric is student learning, with the design-build opportunity of the initiative being for their educational benefit\r\n\r\nThird, the future of the project will be evaluated based on the combination of the two aforementioned measures of success. Conceived as a multi-year initiative, this first year will set the groundwork for what has the potential to be a long term partnership. Ideally, with the success of the first year’s project development and execution, the next year’s students will have the chance to continue to make an even larger impact on the urban fabric of LA County.\r\n\r\nLastly, the true success of this project will lie in how the ultimate users, the homeowner and community, evaluate the home and space. While the design of the home is impossible to surmise before the students create it, we do know that key to what informs their decisions will be a focus on context, sustainability, a healthy home, and a space worthy of those who occupy it. \r\n"
  two_lessons: "Having been involved in the U.S. Department of Energy’s challenge to design, build, and operate a solar-powered home for the Solar Decathlon with Caltech, SCI-Arc is well aware of the great benefits that come from a sustainable design-build project. Cognizant of the positive effect of good design on the public, this opportunity is made even more impactful by knowing that these student-designed homes will influence the lives of real clients and, in turn, an entire community. \r\n\r\nSCI-Arc also understands the importance of providing a setting for students to have access to the affordable housing development model.  As the architects of our next generation, these students will be defining the future of building in the years to come. Having the opportunity to develop their creativity and innovation in the affordable housing field is a concrete way to inspire them to work on these types of projects throughout their future careers. \r\n"
  achievable_goal: >-
    Implementing the first SCI-Arc/Habitat LA Housing Project within the next
    twelve month is not only an achievable goal, but is also within the existing
    timeframe both partners are currently working with. As mentioned, starting
    in September 2014, SCI-Arc and Habitat LA will begin a series of
    design-build studios whose structure is set up to complete one
    SCI-Arc/Habitat home per academic year.  With the agreed upon ‘Fall: Design,
    Spring: Document, Summer: Build’ timeline, the first iteration of the
    SCI-Arc/Habitat LA Project will be complete at the end of the summer in
    2015. Taking advantage of the strengths of both partners, the design studios
    will be a chance for students to both design and document the home within
    two academic semesters. Following this, the home will begin construction
    under Habitat’s organized building schedule, whereby Habitat LA acts as
    general contractor and is supported by their existing framework of
    volunteers. 
  major_challenges: "The first challenge SCI-Arc anticipates will be aligning each individual organization’s timeline so that each phase can fall within the academic calendar structure of the initiative. As with any partnership, SCI-Arc and Habitat for Humanity, Greater Los Angeles will need to remain in close collaboration to ensure the project stays on course towards a 2015 summer build for the students.  \r\n\r\nThe second anticipated challenge will be raising costs towards advanced technologies and construction methods. While remaining respectful to the project’s intended program and its urban fabric, SCI-Arc’s focused role of design innovation and sustainability within this project will likely raise the cost of construction of the individual home above Habitat’s existing budget. It is important to note, however, that these decisions are made in consideration of the occupancy cost over time as opposed to the upfront construction costs, as many elements would ultimately decrease energy costs for the user as well as allow for more durable materials. In order to do so, SCI-Arc has committed to secure additional funds to cover the cost of advanced materials, construction techniques, or sustainability measures that may be incorporated into the project.\r\n"
  competition: "Yes, there are other models in which leading architecture schools have partnered with Habitat for Humanity or other affordable housing agencies in order to offer students a design-build program within their curriculum. Some examples include The University of Virginia’s ecoMOD / ecoREMOD project, Auburn University’s DESIGNhabitat Program, or Yale University’s Building Project. \r\n\r\nWhat makes this project unique is that such a program does not currently exist in Los Angeles. In a city boasting several design and architecture schools, this would be the only program in which an architecture school partners with Habitat for Humanity towards the goal of testing new grounds for design innovation within Habitat’s affordable homes and integrating new strategies of sustainability through student-designed projects. In a city named the ‘homeless capital of the US’, such an initiative would help offer well-designed housing for low-income families looking for and deserving of a better life.\r\n"
  cost: >-
    SCI-Arc is fortunate to partner with Habitat LA, who will be obtaining
    financing and/or donated materials and labor for each SCI-Arc/Habitat LA
    project in line with how they set a budget and construction timeline for all
    their other single-family residences. Above this budget, however, SCI-Arc
    has committed to secure additional funds to cover the cost of advanced
    materials, construction techniques, and sustainability measures that may be
    incorporated into the project. In addition, SCI-Arc will be seeking
    additional funds to help cover a faculty coordinator fee and student
    stipends during the summer, since students may not be eligible for financial
    aid during this time. While the final additional cost of construction and
    materials is unforeseeable at the moment, SCI-Arc estimates the total amount
    of this augmented design, student stipends, and coordinator fee as roughly
    $335,000. SCI-Arc is committed to securing this amount and has already
    received a significant pledge from an anonymous donor who has supported the
    school in the past. Grants such as LA2050 would play a crucial role in the
    project’s implementation.  
  budget: "The following is a breakdown of the three main categories towards which funds are being raised, along with how we would use the $100,000 for this project. \r\n\r\nCategory: Student summer stipends/scholarships\r\nDetail: 12 (estimate) at $10,000 each\r\nBudget: $120,000\r\nLA2050 Portion of Budget: $50,000\r\n\r\nCategory: Coordinator Fee\r\nDetail: Project coordination\r\nBudget: $15,000\r\nLA2050 Portion of Budget: $10,000\r\n\r\nCategory: Augmented Design\r\nDetail: Additional advanced materials, construction techniques, consultants, and sustainability measures (estimate based on research of similar programs)\r\nBudget: $200,000\r\nLA2050 Portion of Budget: $40,000\r\n\r\nTotal Budget: $335,000\r\nTotal LA2050 Portion of Budget: $100,000\r\n"

  impact_metrics: "Through SCI-Arc’s partnership with Habitat for Humanity this project will impact the number of households below the self-sufficiency standard and rates of homelessness. Being able to partner with such a well-respected affordable housing organization allows the initiative to have an immediate impact on families and individuals in LA. Because, however, the partnership will ensure that creative design, innovation, and sustainability are at the forefront of the affordable housing model, this project will also impact the LA2050 ‘LIVE’ metrics through an added metric of how an environment’s design can impact how we live. \r\n\r\nIn addition, from SCI-Arc’s seminar on mitigation strategies that reduce air pollutants and foster healthy home environments, as well as planned continued research at SCI-Arc on these mitigation strategies, this project can impact exposure to air toxins and increase the percentage of tree canopy cover. The seminar concluded with the premise that aggregated active and passive mitigation solutions can improve air quality of project sites and their neighboring properties. Through strategies such as filtration and barriers from traffic (walls, building materials, trees, and landscape), different approaches can greatly benefit how healthy a built environment can be. While initial project sites will not be freeway adjacent, pollution is still a very real issue in the car-commuter culture of Los Angeles and it is important that these strategies still inform design decisions, all contributing to a healthier home environment. \r\n"
Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Step 1: Identify Schools. We are currently identifying 6 urban public
  elementary schools that are located in lower-income communities within Los
  Angeles County (at the time of submission, 2 school districts are confirmed).
  We are selecting lower-income schools because historically, these schools have
  cut PE teachers from their budgets and have left PE Instruction to classroom
  teachers. The problem is that those classroom teachers have very little, to no
  training or experience in PE instruction or in outdoor classroom management
  skills. In the South Bay region of LA County, we have found that teachers in
  these communities are eager and willing to learn new techniques and skills to
  improve how they deliver PE. 
   
   Step 2: Conduct pre-assessment of Physical Education environment of each school campus. Present report of findings to school staff and parents.
   
   Step 3: Meet with teachers at the school to recruit them into the program. Over our 11 year history, we have found that teachers are more engaged and supportive when it is a voluntary program. Our experience is that 90% of teachers at a school do in fact volunteer to participate in the COPA program.
   
   Step 4: Conduct a large group teacher training at each participating school. Training will include laying out program expectations, introduction to web-based COPA support system, and having teachers play PE games, so they can be reminded of the joy of play.
   
   Step 5: Begin one-on-one peer coaching with participating teachers at each school. Over the course of the year, each teacher and their students will receive 4 individually tailored, outdoor, peer coached PE sessions.
   
   Step 6: Provide individually-tailored technical assistance to launch events/activities to promote PE/physical activity on campus. We will work with the school wellness committee, parents, teachers, students or any other stakeholder interested in physical activity – and provide technical assistance to improve the culture of PE/physical activity on the school campus. In the past, examples have included, launching a Walk to School Day event, creating a one-day Cardio-Carnival for students, designing a rainy-day schedule that still allows for PE instruction, training student leaders on organizing PE equipment. 
   
   Step 7: Conduct post-assessment of PE environment at each school. Provide report on improvements made during the school year and recommendations for future. Present findings to school and parents.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Decades ago, parents felt safe letting their children run freely in their
  neighborhoods, being active for hours before being called inside for dinner.
  That was the norm. Today, it simply isn’t happening. Right now, many if not
  most urban public elementary school children in LA County are NOT getting a
  chance to be active. In the communities COPA targets, parents just don’t feel
  safe having their kids run freely in their neighborhoods. On top of that,
  their children’s schools have cut their PE budgets, so children really can go
  days before they participate in any kind of moderate-to-vigorous physical
  activity. 
   
   COPA can change this for children. Today, COPA can make LA the healthiest place to live by reintroducing PE into schools in a fun, interactive, and all-inclusive way. It gives classroom teachers – who otherwise would be intimidated and unprepared – the tools and skills that they need to teach PE. It gives children an opportunity to learn proper movement skills and create a culture of activity within their own lives. COPA makes LA the healthiest place to live today because it teaches children – at a very young age – lifelong movement skills and the joy of being active. 
   
   COPA makes LA the healthiest place to live in 2050, because by then it will have created a generation of adults who will view daily physical activity as the norm. By 2050, COPA children today will be raising children of their own. They will have the expectation that their children will have PE instruction every day and they will instill this expectation in generations to come. By 2050, childhood obesity will no longer be an epidemic. The rates of childhood obesity will be so low that looking back, we will be shocked that we ever even allowed the rates to have been so high!
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Students’ enthusiasm for COPA PE is an eye-opener for teachers. They are able
  to interact with their students in a different, more relaxed setting than the
  classroom – through play! COPA means no one is waiting in lines and everyone
  has a piece of equipment, so there are fewer behavioral issues, which equates
  to higher motivation for both students and teachers. COPA is a positive PE
  experience for all.
   
   In COPA, children in grades K-5 learn developmentally appropriate movement skills, personal responsibility, how to stay safe while playing, how to assess their own exertion, respect for others, cooperation, and teamwork. Schools that have been in COPA for several years, report decreases in childhood obesity and independent evaluations of the program across multiple school sites show that COPA increases the time children spend in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) during a PE lesson.
   “COPA taught me the value of exercise and how to make it fun…I feel that COPA has been a great addition to the school”.--Ray, 5th Grade COPA Student
   
   Elementary school teachers benefit from the personal one-on-one peer coaching from a Providence Little Company of Mary Medical Center (Providence) PE Specialist. 150 teachers will receive COPA’s PE curriculum (aligned with California PE Standards), have access to their school’s new PE equipment, the COPA website, and will receive instruction on developmentally appropriate motor skills and outdoor classroom management. Working with their Peer Coach, they observe, co-teach and then independently teach the PE lessons.
   
   COPA helps teachers meet the longstanding state law in California of 200 minutes of PE every 10 days – an achievement that most schools are not reaching. COPA results show that there is an increase in the number of teachers who are confident in teaching PE and an increase in instructional time devoted to PE instruction. COPA also helps teachers achieve national standards of excellence in Physical Education instruction by making sure that at least 50% of their PE lesson is spent in MVPA.
   
   “The COPA Peer Coach Program made me a better PE teacher. I learned that although PE is an activity and "fun" for students, it needs to be taught just as if I was teaching a math lesson in the classroom. I learned once students are given the exact steps to be successful they have more fun which makes teaching PE fun for me.”--COPA Teacher
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Providence will partner with 6 LA County elementary schools that have never
  had COPA, serve children who live in lower-income communities, have high rates
  of childhood obesity, and that don’t currently offer systematic implementation
  of Physical Education. Two partners are confirmed - John F. Kennedy School in
  Artesia (part of the ABC Unified School District) and Robin Samana, Director
  of Elementary and K-8 Schools at the Long Beach Unified School District to
  identify schools in the LBUSD. We are in discussions with additional schools
  to confirm more sites. The “added benefit” that the participating schools will
  bring is that they are ready and willing to make a change within their school
  to improve student health.
   
   Three factors are critical to the success of our partnerships with participating schools. 
   
   1. Principal support. The Principal supports and encourages teachers to participate in this voluntary program. They need to create an atmosphere that supports PE as an added benefit to teachers – something that will keep their students more focused and that can improve academic achievement – rather than an added burden to the teachers’ schedules. 
   
   2. Teacher buy-in. We introduce the program to teachers and design a peer coach training schedule that accommodates their teaching schedule. 90% of teachers voluntarily enroll; 90% of enrollees complete the program. 
   
   3. Relationships between the teachers and the Peer Coach is critical to success. COPA teachers report high satisfaction with their relationships with their Peer Coach. A focus group of COPA teachers across 3 school districts agreed that the most significant factor in changing their instructional practice related to PE was their peer coach relationship. This is a direct result of the PE Specialist setting a tone of trust and openness. We know that most classroom teachers have little to no training in PE; we know that most teachers are apprehensive about taking a group of 30 kids outside with the expectation of teaching age-appropriate motor skills; and we know from our 11 years of experience that there are teachers who have their own personal memories of PE that are not so positive and that definitely don’t motivate them to teach PE themselves. The peer coach takes all of these factors into consideration, is able to work individually with the teacher and their students and build a relationship of trust and mutual respect that overcomes these barriers to teaching PE.
