  L.A. Futures builds success tracks for public high school youth into college
  and career
Does your project impact Los Angeles County?: 'No'
Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - South LA
  - San Gabriel Valley
  - South Bay
  - Westside
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  L.A. Futures is a work-based learning program which partners public schools
  with major creative companies to prepare students for success in college and
  beyond. Students build competencies and life skills through professional
  mentorships, job role exposure and student-driven public service projects.
  Through these real-world experiences, students can build success tracks into
  our community's thriving creative industry. An industry which represents over
  10% of the gross economic contribution to the Los Angeles region needs a
  job-prepared talent pool to draw upon. High school is where to start.
  Educational entrepreneurship, through business and community partnerships,
  provides the resources. L.A. Futures is the connection.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Since it was inaugurated several years ago, L.A. Futures has served hundreds
  of upper-division high school students who have gone on to higher education at
  twice the rate of their peers.  Through partnering with creative organizations
  like TBWA\CHIAT\DAY, DDB, Ruben Postaer & Associates (RPA), The Phelps Group,
  GreyWorldWide, Muse Advertising, Saatchi & Saatchi and IgnitedUSA, the program
  has provided real world applications to college and career-bound initiatives
  within secondary public schools.  Curriculum development and learning
  materials have been aligned with Common Core Standards with an emphasis on
  21st century skills of creativity, communication, collaboration and critical
  thinking. Students enrolled in L.A. Futures participate in the program
  throughout their upper-division experience.  Throughout their experience,
  students routinely attend sessions at the headquarters of the creative
  companies that serve as school partners.  During these sessions, students
  engage in a comprehensive curriculum that imparts principles, techniques and
  tools for self-development in exciting new career roles.  Mentored by industry
  professionals, students get an inside look at key projects from strategy
  through creative execution.  They learn how business is managed and see how
  today’s creative professionals with across disciplines. Working in teams,
  students are also challenged to put their learning into practice by engaging
  with local nonprofits which become their clients. .  For example, Dorsey High
  School senior class participants revamped promotional pieces for education,
  parenting and job training at Community Build, an inner city resource for
  underserved youth. In the end, students leave the program with increased
  social capital, practical tools, higher expectations and a clearer understand
  of the demands of today’s employer. We believe that L.A. Futures is a powerful
  link in the continuum of college-bound-to-career efforts at a critical time in
  their decision-making process. 
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to LEARN today? In 2050?: >-
  California's leading educators are proponents of  building smaller learning
  communities, such as "pathways" and "academies" which focus on broad industry
  themes, such as business and entrepreneurship, arts, entertainment and media,
  engineering and health services, et al.. In fact, this movement toward schools
  within schools is gaining quick momentum. Consequently, the Los Angeles
  Unified School District is showing marked interest in this model and
  work-based learning practices, in general. L.A. Futures is the connective
  tissue between the creative industry and schools and, as such, creates the
  dynamic partnerships that take it from theory to application. Jobs are the
  priority concern of our high school students. At the same time, creative
  companies in Los Angeles boast some of the most exciting career opportunities
  in which they're interested. Through direct exposure, the L.A. Futures program
  connects the dots for our students from where they are-to higher education-to
  the jobs they aspire toward. This makes learning exciting, real and tangible
  for them. L.A. Futures will help make Los Angeles the best place to learn in
  2050 because our creative workforce will come for our own community--because
  the creative industry will be richer because of the multiple voices that are
  represented in its products and services--because industry will be able to
  meet diversity of employment goals--and because our workforce will be prepared
  and energized to shift culture through job roles and practices we don't even
  know the names of!  
Whom will your project benefit?: >-
  Participants of L.A. Futures mirror the ethnic and economic strata of local
  public school student populations. Current data describes our Academy student
  population as follows: 72.3% Latino, 9.6% Black, 10.1% White, 4% Asian, 2.1%
  Filipino and Pacific Islander, .04% Native Amer. & 1.9% mixed races. 67% of
  our students are classified as low-income and are eligible for the federally
  assisted free lunch program. By drawing from the current and future talent
  pool of our own community the creative industry is greatly benefitted if we
  bear in mind that 726,300 direct and indirect jobs, or 1 in 7 jobs, represent
  the human capital that vitalizes this industry. 
How will your project impact the LA2050 “Learn” metrics?:
  - >-
    Percentage of community college students completing a certificate, degree,
    or transfer-related program in six years
  - Youth unemployment and underemployment
  - District-wide graduation rates
  - HS student proficiency in English & Language Arts and Math
  - Academic Performance Index scores
  - College matriculation rates
  - >-
    Student education pipeline (an integrated network of pre-schools, K-12
    institutions, and higher education systems that prepares students for
    seamless transitions between high school, higher education institutions, and
    the workforce) (Dream Metric)
  - >-
    Industry diversity of employment goals, preparedness for new and future job
    roles, diverse generations impact on the products and services of the
    creative industry
Please elaborate on how your project will impact the above metrics.: >-
  L.A. Futures emboldens classroom learning by learning and life skill
  experiences with industry professionals in the classroom and at their places
  of work.  Theory and principles are translated into real-world practices and
  our students connect acquired knowledge with the needs and expectation of the
  workplace. As such, our students make the connection between college and
  career and become workforce ready. By developing the talent and capacity of
  our younger generations, we are investing in the future viability of our local
  economy.
Please explain how you will evaluate your project.: >-
  Formal evaluation measurements are used to assess the performance and
  quality-level of the L.A. Futures program and to make recommendations for
  improvement. This includes entry, mid-point and exit surveys; Dialogue with
  educators and business partners to assess and improve curriculum delivery,
  strengthen overall program experience, and cultivate further career pathway
  opportunities; Further data is gathered of senior class before and after
  graduation to calculate college and vocational training and admission rates;
  In the coming year, we intend to form an advisory council of educators and
  industry professionals to help us bring the L.A. Futures program to the next
  level. 
What two lessons have informed your solution or project?: "The following two lessons have informed our project:\r\n1) The expressed need for industry to hire within our own community\r\n2) The need for students to literally see and experience exciting job roles that they can aspire toward."
Explain how implementing your project within the next twelve months is an achievable goal.: >-
  We have four business partners and four school partners and the program has
  already been tracked. This includes classroom visits and visits to companies'
  major headquarters. Meetings between partners are currently taking place at
  this time, for the purpose of creating scheduling and curriculum development.
  We are also in the process of forming further collaborations with
  community-based organizations who serve as clients for the students'
  campaigns. 
Please list at least two major barriers/challenges you anticipate. What is your strategy for ensuring a successful implementation?: >-
  One barrier is to be able to accomplish this with a small staff, led by a
  Program Coordinator and Lead Instructor Mentors. Our strategy for meeting that
  challenge is to work with volunteers who also serve as professional mentors.
  Another barrier is to have enough reserve funding to be able to have the
  flexibility to bring in tools and resources where needed. To address this, we
  hired a grant writer to insure the sustainability of the program. Further, we
  are creating a strategic plan for developing the program over the next 3
  years, building an advisory panel to broaden student participation and
  business collaboration.
What resources does your project need?:
  - Network/relationship support
  - Money (financial capital)
  - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
  - 'Technical infrastructure (computers, etc.)'
  - Quality improvement research
