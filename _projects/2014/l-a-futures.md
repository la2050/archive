Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Since it was inaugurated several years ago, L.A. Futures has served hundreds
  of upper-division high school students who have gone on to higher education at
  twice the rate of their peers. Through partnering with creative organizations
  like TBWA\CHIAT\DAY, DDB, Ruben Postaer & Associates (RPA), The Phelps Group,
  GreyWorldWide, Muse Advertising, Saatchi & Saatchi and IgnitedUSA, the program
  has provided real world applications to college and career-bound initiatives
  within secondary public schools. Curriculum development and learning materials
  have been aligned with Common Core Standards with an emphasis on 21st century
  skills of creativity, communication, collaboration and critical thinking.
  Students enrolled in L.A. Futures participate in the program throughout their
  upper-division experience. Throughout their experience, students routinely
  attend sessions at the headquarters of the creative companies that serve as
  school partners. During these sessions, students engage in a comprehensive
  curriculum that imparts principles, techniques and tools for self-development
  in exciting new career roles. Mentored by industry professionals, students get
  an inside look at key projects from strategy through creative execution. They
  learn how business is managed and see how today’s creative professionals with
  across disciplines. Working in teams, students are also challenged to put
  their learning into practice by engaging with local nonprofits which become
  their clients. . For example, Dorsey High School senior class participants
  revamped promotional pieces for education, parenting and job training at
  Community Build, an inner city resource for underserved youth. In the end,
  students leave the program with increased social capital, practical tools,
  higher expectations and a clearer understand of the demands of today’s
  employer. We believe that L.A. Futures is a powerful link in the continuum of
  college-bound-to-career efforts at a critical time in their decision-making
  process.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  California's leading educators are proponents of building smaller learning
  communities, such as "pathways" and "academies" which focus on broad industry
  themes, such as business and entrepreneurship, arts, entertainment and media,
  engineering and health services, et al.. In fact, this movement toward schools
  within schools is gaining quick momentum. Consequently, the Los Angeles
  Unified School District is showing marked interest in this model and
  work-based learning practices, in general. L.A. Futures is the connective
  tissue between the creative industry and schools and, as such, creates the
  dynamic partnerships that take it from theory to application. Jobs are the
  priority concern of our high school students. At the same time, creative
  companies in Los Angeles boast some of the most exciting career opportunities
  in which they're interested. Through direct exposure, the L.A. Futures program
  connects the dots for our students from where they are-to higher education-to
  the jobs they aspire toward. This makes learning exciting, real and tangible
  for them. L.A. Futures will help make Los Angeles the best place to learn in
  2050 because our creative workforce will come for our own community--because
  the creative industry will be richer because of the multiple voices that are
  represented in its products and services--because industry will be able to
  meet diversity of employment goals--and because our workforce will be prepared
  and energized to shift culture through job roles and practices we don't even
  know the names of!
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Participants of L.A. Futures mirror the ethnic and economic strata of local
  public school student populations. Current data describes our Academy student
  population as follows: 72.3% Latino, 9.6% Black, 10.1% White, 4% Asian, 2.1%
  Filipino and Pacific Islander, .04% Native Amer. & 1.9% mixed races. 67% of
  our students are classified as low-income and are eligible for the federally
  assisted free lunch program. By drawing from the current and future talent
  pool of our own community the creative industry is greatly benefitted if we
  bear in mind that 726,300 direct and indirect jobs, or 1 in 7 jobs, represent
  the human capital that vitalizes this industry.
