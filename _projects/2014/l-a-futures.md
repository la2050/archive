Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Since it was inaugurated several years ago, L.A. Futures has served hundreds
  of upper-division high school students who have gone on to higher education at
  twice the rate of their peers. Through partnering with creative organizations
  like TBWA\CHIAT\DAY, DDB, Ruben Postaer & Associates (RPA), The Phelps Group,
  GreyWorldWide, Muse Advertising, Saatchi & Saatchi and IgnitedUSA, the program
  has provided real world applications to college and career-bound initiatives
  within secondary public schools. Curriculum development and learning materials
  have been aligned with Common Core Standards with an emphasis on 21st century
  skills of creativity, communication, collaboration and critical thinking.
  Students enrolled in L.A. Futures participate in the program throughout their
  upper-division experience. Throughout their experience, students routinely
  attend sessions at the headquarters of the creative companies that serve as
  school partners. During these sessions, students engage in a comprehensive
  curriculum that imparts principles, techniques and tools for self-development
  in exciting new career roles. Mentored by industry professionals, students get
  an inside look at key projects from strategy through creative execution. They
  learn how business is managed and see how today’s creative professionals with
  across disciplines. Working in teams, students are also challenged to put
  their learning into practice by engaging with local nonprofits which become
  their clients. . For example, Dorsey High School senior class participants
  revamped promotional pieces for education, parenting and job training at
  Community Build, an inner city resource for underserved youth. In the end,
  students leave the program with increased social capital, practical tools,
  higher expectations and a clearer understand of the demands of today’s
  employer. We believe that L.A. Futures is a powerful link in the continuum of
  college-bound-to-career efforts at a critical time in their decision-making
  process.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  California's leading educators are proponents of building smaller learning
  communities, such as "pathways" and "academies" which focus on broad industry
  themes, such as business and entrepreneurship, arts, entertainment and media,
  engineering and health services, et al.. In fact, this movement toward schools
  within schools is gaining quick momentum. Consequently, the Los Angeles
  Unified School District is showing marked interest in this model and
  work-based learning practices, in general. L.A. Futures is the connective
  tissue between the creative industry and schools and, as such, creates the
  dynamic partnerships that take it from theory to application. Jobs are the
  priority concern of our high school students. At the same time, creative
  companies in Los Angeles boast some of the most exciting career opportunities
  in which they're interested. Through direct exposure, the L.A. Futures program
  connects the dots for our students from where they are-to higher education-to
  the jobs they aspire toward. This makes learning exciting, real and tangible
  for them. L.A. Futures will help make Los Angeles the best place to learn in
  2050 because our creative workforce will come for our own community--because
  the creative industry will be richer because of the multiple voices that are
  represented in its products and services--because industry will be able to
  meet diversity of employment goals--and because our workforce will be prepared
  and energized to shift culture through job roles and practices we don't even
  know the names of!
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Participants of L.A. Futures mirror the ethnic and economic strata of local
  public school student populations. Current data describes our Academy student
  population as follows: 72.3% Latino, 9.6% Black, 10.1% White, 4% Asian, 2.1%
  Filipino and Pacific Islander, .04% Native Amer. & 1.9% mixed races. 67% of
  our students are classified as low-income and are eligible for the federally
  assisted free lunch program. By drawing from the current and future talent
  pool of our own community the creative industry is greatly benefitted if we
  bear in mind that 726,300 direct and indirect jobs, or 1 in 7 jobs, represent
  the human capital that vitalizes this industry.

    L.A. Futures is a work-based learning program which partners public schools
    with major creative companies to prepare students for success in college and
    beyond. Students build competencies and life skills through professional
    mentorships, job role exposure and student-driven public service projects.
    Through these real-world experiences, students can build success tracks into
    our community's thriving creative industry. An industry which represents
    over 10% of the gross economic contribution to the Los Angeles region needs
    a job-prepared talent pool to draw upon. High school is where to start.
    Educational entrepreneurship, through business and community partnerships,
    provides the resources. L.A. Futures is the connection.

    our students connect acquired knowledge with the needs and expectation of
    the workplace. As such, our students make the connection between college and
    career and become workforce ready. By developing the talent and capacity of
    our younger generations, we are investing in the future viability of our

  evaluate: >-
    Formal evaluation measurements are used to assess the performance and
    quality-level of the L.A. Futures program and to make recommendations for
    improvement. This includes entry, mid-point and exit surveys; Dialogue with
    educators and business partners to assess and improve curriculum delivery,
    strengthen overall program experience, and cultivate further career pathway
    opportunities; Further data is gathered of senior class before and after
    graduation to calculate college and vocational training and admission rates;
    In the coming year, we intend to form an advisory council of educators and
    industry professionals to help us bring the L.A. Futures program to the next
    level. 
  two_lessons: "The following two lessons have informed our project:\r\n1) The expressed need for industry to hire within our own community\r\n2) The need for students to literally see and experience exciting job roles that they can aspire toward."
  achievable_goal: >-
    We have four business partners and four school partners and the program has
    already been tracked. This includes classroom visits and visits to
    companies' major headquarters. Meetings between partners are currently
    taking place at this time, for the purpose of creating scheduling and
    curriculum development. We are also in the process of forming further
    collaborations with community-based organizations who serve as clients for
    the students' campaigns. 
  major_challenges: >-
    One barrier is to be able to accomplish this with a small staff, led by a
    Program Coordinator and Lead Instructor Mentors. Our strategy for meeting
    that challenge is to work with volunteers who also serve as professional
    mentors. Another barrier is to have enough reserve funding to be able to
    have the flexibility to bring in tools and resources where needed. To
    address this, we hired a grant writer to insure the sustainability of the
    program. Further, we are creating a strategic plan for developing the
    program over the next 3 years, building an advisory panel to broaden student
    participation and business collaboration.
  competition: >-
    This project is unique because it is not a one-time event, it is sequential.
    Generally, others offer field trips, career days and job shadowing. In some
    cases, internships are available. These are vital to students' growth and
    job preparedness. What sets LA Futures apart is that it is a two-year
    program. Students are drawn in and their learning is customized, objectives
    and interests are met. Sequential experiences de-mystify the industry. Our
    mentors develop personal relationships with student participants they serve.
    As a result, internships become more likely from engagement.
  cost: >-
    Our current budget for LA Futures is $ 65,000. One of the main costs is
    hiring personnel to service our delivery. We believe for LA Futures to
    increase its profile and impact - to ready it for its fuller potential, a
    budget of $ 150,000 is necessary. We are working with a professional grant
    writer and focussing our energies to develop the program to serve a broader
    number.  The $ 100,000 should be used to provide support for the Program
    Coordinator, to hire a Communications Outreach Specialist, and to provide
    for professional printed materials for all collaborative parties
  budget: "Program Coordinator $ 49,000 \r\nCommunications/Outreach Specialist $ 38,000 \r\nProfessional Printed Materials for all collaborative parties $ 13,000 \r\nCurriculum materials; PR and Informational Packages and Tool Kit \r\n\r\nTOTAL = $ 100,000"

      California's leading educators are proponents of  building smaller
      learning communities, such as "pathways" and "academies" which focus on
      broad industry themes, such as business and entrepreneurship, arts,
      entertainment and media, engineering and health services, et al.. In fact,
      this movement toward schools within schools is gaining quick momentum.
      Consequently, the Los Angeles Unified School District is showing marked
      interest in this model and work-based learning practices, in general. L.A.
      Futures is the connective tissue between the creative industry and schools
      and, as such, creates the dynamic partnerships that take it from theory to
      application. Jobs are the priority concern of our high school students. At
      the same time, creative companies in Los Angeles boast some of the most
      exciting career opportunities in which they're interested. Through direct
      exposure, the L.A. Futures program connects the dots for our students from
      where they are-to higher education-to the jobs they aspire toward. This
      makes learning exciting, real and tangible for them. L.A. Futures will
      help make Los Angeles the best place to learn in 2050 because our creative
      workforce will come for our own community--because the creative industry
      will be richer because of the multiple voices that are represented in its
      products and services--because industry will be able to meet diversity of

      L.A. Futures emboldens classroom learning by learning and life skill
      experiences with industry professionals in the classroom and at their
      places of work.  Theory and principles are translated into real-world
      practices and our students connect acquired knowledge with the needs and
      expectation of the workplace. As such, our students make the connection
      between college and career and become workforce ready. By developing the
      talent and capacity of our younger generations, we are investing in the
      future viability of our local economy.

      Formal evaluation measurements are used to assess the performance and
      quality-level of the L.A. Futures program and to make recommendations for
      improvement. This includes entry, mid-point and exit surveys; Dialogue
      with educators and business partners to assess and improve curriculum
      delivery, strengthen overall program experience, and cultivate further
      career pathway opportunities; Further data is gathered of senior class
      before and after graduation to calculate college and vocational training
      and admission rates; In the coming year, we intend to form an advisory
      council of educators and industry professionals to help us bring the L.A.
      Futures program to the next level.

      We have four business partners and four school partners and the program
      has already been tracked. This includes classroom visits and visits to
      companies' major headquarters. Meetings between partners are currently
      taking place at this time, for the purpose of creating scheduling and
      curriculum development. We are also in the process of forming further
      collaborations with community-based organizations who serve as clients for
      the students' campaigns.

      One barrier is to be able to accomplish this with a small staff, led by a
      Program Coordinator and Lead Instructor Mentors. Our strategy for meeting
      that challenge is to work with volunteers who also serve as professional
      mentors. Another barrier is to have enough reserve funding to be able to
      have the flexibility to bring in tools and resources where needed. To
      address this, we hired a grant writer to insure the sustainability of the
      program. Further, we are creating a strategic plan for developing the
      program over the next 3 years, building an advisory panel to broaden
      student participation and business collaboration.

      This project is unique because it is not a one-time event, it is
      sequential. Generally, others offer field trips, career days and job
      shadowing. In some cases, internships are available. These are vital to
      students' growth and job preparedness. What sets LA Futures apart is that
      it is a two-year program. Students are drawn in and their learning is
      customized, objectives and interests are met. Sequential experiences
      de-mystify the industry. Our mentors develop personal relationships with
      student participants they serve. As a result, internships become more
      likely from engagement.

      Our current budget for LA Futures is $ 65,000. One of the main costs is
      hiring personnel to service our delivery. We believe for LA Futures to
      increase its profile and impact - to ready it for its fuller potential, a
      budget of $ 150,000 is necessary. We are working with a professional grant
      writer and focussing our energies to develop the program to serve a
      broader number.  The $ 100,000 should be used to provide support for the
      Program Coordinator, to hire a Communications Outreach Specialist, and to
      provide for professional printed materials for all collaborative parties
