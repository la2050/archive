    L.A. Futures is a work-based learning program which partners public schools
    with major creative companies to prepare students for success in college and
    beyond. Students build competencies and life skills through professional
    mentorships, job role exposure and student-driven public service projects.
    Through these real-world experiences, students can build success tracks into
    our community's thriving creative industry. An industry which represents
    over 10% of the gross economic contribution to the Los Angeles region needs
    a job-prepared talent pool to draw upon. High school is where to start.
    Educational entrepreneurship, through business and community partnerships,
    provides the resources. L.A. Futures is the connection.
  implement: >-
    Since it was inaugurated several years ago, L.A. Futures has served hundreds
    of upper-division high school students who have gone on to higher education
    at twice the rate of their peers.  Through partnering with creative
    organizations like TBWA\CHIAT\DAY, DDB, Ruben Postaer & Associates (RPA),
    The Phelps Group, GreyWorldWide, Muse Advertising, Saatchi & Saatchi and
    IgnitedUSA, the program has provided real world applications to college and
    career-bound initiatives within secondary public schools.  Curriculum
    development and learning materials have been aligned with Common Core
    Standards with an emphasis on 21st century skills of creativity,
    communication, collaboration and critical thinking. Students enrolled in
    L.A. Futures participate in the program throughout their upper-division
    experience.  Throughout their experience, students routinely attend sessions
    at the headquarters of the creative companies that serve as school
    partners.  During these sessions, students engage in a comprehensive
    curriculum that imparts principles, techniques and tools for
    self-development in exciting new career roles.  Mentored by industry
    professionals, students get an inside look at key projects from strategy
    through creative execution.  They learn how business is managed and see how
    today’s creative professionals with across disciplines. Working in teams,
    students are also challenged to put their learning into practice by engaging
    with local nonprofits which become their clients. .  For example, Dorsey
    High School senior class participants revamped promotional pieces for
    education, parenting and job training at Community Build, an inner city
    resource for underserved youth. In the end, students leave the program with
    increased social capital, practical tools, higher expectations and a clearer
    understand of the demands of today’s employer. We believe that L.A. Futures
    is a powerful link in the continuum of college-bound-to-career efforts at a
    critical time in their decision-making process. 
  impact_learn: >-
    California's leading educators are proponents of  building smaller learning
    communities, such as "pathways" and "academies" which focus on broad
    industry themes, such as business and entrepreneurship, arts, entertainment
    and media, engineering and health services, et al.. In fact, this movement
    toward schools within schools is gaining quick momentum. Consequently, the
    Los Angeles Unified School District is showing marked interest in this model
    and work-based learning practices, in general. L.A. Futures is the
    connective tissue between the creative industry and schools and, as such,
    creates the dynamic partnerships that take it from theory to application.
    Jobs are the priority concern of our high school students. At the same time,
    creative companies in Los Angeles boast some of the most exciting career
    opportunities in which they're interested. Through direct exposure, the L.A.
    Futures program connects the dots for our students from where they are-to
    higher education-to the jobs they aspire toward. This makes learning
    exciting, real and tangible for them. L.A. Futures will help make Los
    Angeles the best place to learn in 2050 because our creative workforce will
    come for our own community--because the creative industry will be richer
    because of the multiple voices that are represented in its products and
    services--because industry will be able to meet diversity of employment
    goals--and because our workforce will be prepared and energized to shift
    culture through job roles and practices we don't even know the names of!  
  who_benefit: >-
    Participants of L.A. Futures mirror the ethnic and economic strata of local
    public school student populations. Current data describes our Academy
    student population as follows: 72.3% Latino, 9.6% Black, 10.1% White, 4%
    Asian, 2.1% Filipino and Pacific Islander, .04% Native Amer. & 1.9% mixed
    races. 67% of our students are classified as low-income and are eligible for
    the federally assisted free lunch program. By drawing from the current and
    future talent pool of our own community the creative industry is greatly
    benefitted if we bear in mind that 726,300 direct and indirect jobs, or 1 in
    7 jobs, represent the human capital that vitalizes this industry.

  evaluate: >-
    Formal evaluation measurements are used to assess the performance and
    quality-level of the L.A. Futures program and to make recommendations for
    improvement. This includes entry, mid-point and exit surveys; Dialogue with
    educators and business partners to assess and improve curriculum delivery,
    strengthen overall program experience, and cultivate further career pathway
    opportunities; Further data is gathered of senior class before and after
    graduation to calculate college and vocational training and admission rates;
    In the coming year, we intend to form an advisory council of educators and
    industry professionals to help us bring the L.A. Futures program to the next
    level. 
  two_lessons: "The following two lessons have informed our project:\r\n1) The expressed need for industry to hire within our own community\r\n2) The need for students to literally see and experience exciting job roles that they can aspire toward."
  achievable_goal: >-
    We have four business partners and four school partners and the program has
    already been tracked. This includes classroom visits and visits to
    companies' major headquarters. Meetings between partners are currently
    taking place at this time, for the purpose of creating scheduling and
    curriculum development. We are also in the process of forming further
    collaborations with community-based organizations who serve as clients for
    the students' campaigns. 
  major_challenges: >-
    One barrier is to be able to accomplish this with a small staff, led by a
    Program Coordinator and Lead Instructor Mentors. Our strategy for meeting
    that challenge is to work with volunteers who also serve as professional
    mentors. Another barrier is to have enough reserve funding to be able to
    have the flexibility to bring in tools and resources where needed. To
    address this, we hired a grant writer to insure the sustainability of the
    program. Further, we are creating a strategic plan for developing the
    program over the next 3 years, building an advisory panel to broaden student
    participation and business collaboration.
  competition: >-
    This project is unique because it is not a one-time event, it is sequential.
    Generally, others offer field trips, career days and job shadowing. In some
    cases, internships are available. These are vital to students' growth and
    job preparedness. What sets LA Futures apart is that it is a two-year
    program. Students are drawn in and their learning is customized, objectives
    and interests are met. Sequential experiences de-mystify the industry. Our
    mentors develop personal relationships with student participants they serve.
    As a result, internships become more likely from engagement.
  cost: >-
    Our current budget for LA Futures is $ 65,000. One of the main costs is
    hiring personnel to service our delivery. We believe for LA Futures to
    increase its profile and impact - to ready it for its fuller potential, a
    budget of $ 150,000 is necessary. We are working with a professional grant
    writer and focussing our energies to develop the program to serve a broader
    number.  The $ 100,000 should be used to provide support for the Program
    Coordinator, to hire a Communications Outreach Specialist, and to provide
    for professional printed materials for all collaborative parties
  budget: "Program Coordinator $ 49,000 \r\nCommunications/Outreach Specialist $ 38,000 \r\nProfessional Printed Materials for all collaborative parties $ 13,000 \r\nCurriculum materials; PR and Informational Packages and Tool Kit \r\n\r\nTOTAL = $ 100,000"

    L.A. Futures emboldens classroom learning by learning and life skill
    experiences with industry professionals in the classroom and at their places
    of work.  Theory and principles are translated into real-world practices and
    our students connect acquired knowledge with the needs and expectation of
    the workplace. As such, our students make the connection between college and
    career and become workforce ready. By developing the talent and capacity of
    our younger generations, we are investing in the future viability of our
    local economy.
