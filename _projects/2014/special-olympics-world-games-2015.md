Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Patterned after the Olympic Games, the Special Olympics World Games occur
  every two years alternating between Winter and Summer. LA 2015 will be the
  largest event in LA since the 1984 Olympics. 7,000 athletes from 177 countries
  will compete in 25 events over 9 days supported by 3,000 coaches and 30,000
  volunteers. 500,000 spectators will enjoy LA’s world-class venues, including
  the Athlete Villages hosted at USC and UCLA, and Opening Ceremony at the Los
  Angeles Memorial Coliseum. 500,000 spectators and visitors will experience
  LA’s destinations, a projected $415 million boost to the local economy.
  Special programs include athlete physical exams, Host Town and festivals at
  USC & UCLA.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  The 2015 Special Olympics World Summer Games Organizing Committee, Inc. (GOC)
  is the nonprofit operating and management structure set up to fulfill the
  mission of funding, planning, and staging LA2015. LA2015 will require the
  skills of 157 paid staff, 220 student interns, plus 30,000 volunteers. Our
  anticipated costs over a four-year period ending December 2015 are expected to
  total $74 million. Some of that will be covered with corporate sponsorships,
  Opening Ceremony tickets, and merchandise sales, as well contributed services
  and donated product. But $30 million will come from foundations, government
  and individuals. 
   
   Extensive planning is required to develop the operational plans necessary for the production of an event on the scale of the Olympics. The GOC hosted Invitational Games June 6-8, 2014 at USC and Griffith Park. This event hosted athletes from 13 countries, which allowed the GOC to test plans for competition venues, airport arrivals/departures, medical operations and Healthy Athletes, delegation services, language services, credentialing, food & housing, and limited transportation and security. Overall this event was a great success and enabled the GOC to learn some important lessons when planning for LA2015. 
   
   In order to scale operations and meet the demands of an extensive hiring plan, LA2015 is heavily utilizing social media and awareness marketing. The GOC has created an amplifier program to give all LA2015 partners the tools to seamlessly share LA2015 content with their networks. LA2015 has created “Support An Athlete,” an online campaign where individuals can sponsor and be connected with their athlete. Finally, the volunteer recruitment plan launched in December 2013, with the objective of finding nearly 30,000 local individuals, from physicians to parking attendants. For the first time in World Games history the GOC has implemented a CRM database, which has already expanded registration capabilities. After LA2015 all data and lessons learned will be shared in the transition leaving Special Olympics Southern California with thousands more trained and committed volunteers.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  LA2015 is an extraordinary opportunity for Angelenos to come together and host
  the world. A city with more than 135 nationalities represented, Los Angles
  offers a built in fan base for nearly every visiting delegation. Volunteerism
  is the backbone of LA2015, requiring the support of 30,000 volunteers from
  across Los Angeleles. Together Angelenos will welcome thousands of athletes,
  their coaches and families. These games are an embodiment of what Los Angeles
  is all about -- a vibrant civic fabric full of hopes and dreams. LA2015 is
  just the needle to stitch our communities together. If USC and UCLA can get
  behind a common cause so too can Watts and Woodland Hills. 
   
   A study commissioned by the Los Angeles Tourism and Convention board estimates LA2015 will bring a $415 million boost to the local economy as a result of the World Games. It also is worth noting there will be no other large-scale world events taking place in the United States prior to the USOC selection for the host city of the 2024 Summer Olympic Games. The IOC and USOC leadership will attend LA2015. Los Angeles has a unique opportunity to showcase to these Olympic committees just what LA can do if given the chance to host the 2024 Olympic Games – certainly a contributing factor to Los Angeles in 2050.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  LA2015 serves every population attending and participating in the movement
  leading up to the event and at the Games including: athletes, coaches, family
  members, spectators, volunteers, 100 Host Town communities throughout Southern
  California, k-12 students, elected officials, business owners, arts
  institutions, hotels, and you. All ethnicities, ages, gender and socioeconomic
  status are represented. 
   
   Athletes are the heart of Special Olympics. Our athletes are children and adults with intellectual disabilities (ID) from all around the world. They are finding success, joy and friendship as part of our global community. As their lives open up, athletes gain the confidence that comes with achievement. They feel empowered. At any age and in every country, our athletes are learning new skills, making new friends and gaining in fitness and confidence. Special Olympics athletes are twice as likely to be employed as people with ID who don’t participate in Special Olympics and their positive health indicators are twice as good as well. Finally, because of an increased sense of well-being and personal health, our athletes are twice as likely to live on their own as people with ID who don’t participate in Special Olympics.
