Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  When budgets are cut, those without a voice in government are the hardest hit.
  Foster youth are the most vulnerable Angelenos because the foster care system
  is overburdened. The hard working, well-intentioned folks working on their
  behalf have neither the time nor the means to develop, produce and execute a
  nuanced strategy to recruit their ideal candidates for foster parents and
  mentors. More than 150,000 child abuse investigations were launched in the
  county last year alone. Working with limited resources, we want and need the
  county’s social workers focused on one thing: the safety of all our kids. 
   
   FosterMore has done significant research and partnered with Hollywood storytellers to craft video and online messages to change the perception of foster youth and spark a desire to help these youth in need. The LA2050 grant will provide the necessary resources to launch a full-scale marketing and recruitment campaign.
   
   The campaign will combine well-researched and tested messages with the latest online marketing tools and tactics to generate leads, which will be followed up on by a local foster parent recruitment agency that has demonstrated a 500% increase in converting leads to foster parents over the past two years and the most high-impact program working with foster youth in schools to graduate high school.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Only 5 percent of foster youth are proficient in math and only 20 percent in
  English. Housing the largest population of foster youth in the state and
  second largest in the nation, we must do something now! 
   
   By recruiting dedicated and caring individuals to foster parent and mentor youth in care, we hope to improve outcomes. It’s a fact that four out of five foster youth have had to repeat a grade by the third grade. Children in foster care are at high risk for maltreatment and stress that cause developmental delays and set them behind as early as kindergarten. They are less likely to be enrolled in preschool and foster youth are twice as likely as the general population to leave high school without a diploma. Many foster youth experience more than five school changes. 
   
   The challenges these youth face from an educational and social emotional development standpoint are unimaginable to most. However, the well-researched and evidence-based models designed by the FosterMore coalition partners prove that with the right foster parents and mentors, these youth can succeed and thrive. 
   
   We anticipate that by reintroducing foster youth to Los Angeles residents in 2014, we can shift public opinion and support for these youth. As Los Angeles produces more and more foster youth success stories, we will continue to experience increased levels of support for foster youth, thereby increasing the number of foster parents and mentors as well as public support for the agencies tasked with their well being. This project is the first and most critical step in taking the foster parent shortage from crisis to surplus.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Last August The Los Angeles Times reported the county’s shortage of foster
  care beds had reached “a crisis point.” At that time “officials acknowledged
  they don’t have enough personnel to promptly feed children or change
  diapers.” 
   
   The largest immediate beneficiaries of this project will be the 28,000 kids in Los Angeles County’s foster care system. In addition, roughly 2,500 youth in the county “age-out” meaning they reach the age at which they can no longer remain a ward of the state in foster care, without having received permanent placement. This population of foster youth fares the worst, with more than half living in poverty, a quarter incarcerated the lowest high school and college graduation rates of all youth. 
   
   The FosterMore coalition’s project to recruit mentors and foster parents will have the secondary impact of generating more interest in adoption, and moving more and more kids into permanent homes. 
   
   The community as a whole will benefit because on average, for every young person who ages out of foster care, taxpayers and communities pay $300,000 in social costs like public assistance, incarceration, and lost wages to a community over that person's lifetime. With more than 200,000 youth aging out in the past decade, you can conservatively estimate this problem incurs almost $8 billion in social costs to the United States every year.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  FosterMore will serve as the lead for the project. FosterMore is a coalition
  of nonprofit organizations and foundations united to increase opportunities
  for youth in foster care. Lead funding and strategic partners include, Casey
  Family Programs, The Entertainment Industry Foundation, Conrad N. Hilton
  Foundation, Anthony & Jeanne Pritzker Family Foundation, Stuart Foundation and
  Youth Villages. The effort is directed by co-founders, Jennifer Perry,
  Executive Director of the Children’s Action Network and David Ambroz,
  Director, Corporate Citizenship and Social Responsibility, Disney-ABC
  Television Group. Managing the effort is Mark Daley, of Propper Daley, A
  Social Impact Agency. 
   
   Raise a Child, a leader in foster and adoptive parent recruitment will work with potential recruits to see them through the long and often frustrating process of certification to placement. United Friends of the Children will collaborate by providing volunteer opportunities for individuals wishing to volunteer their time and talents to advance a foster child through education.
