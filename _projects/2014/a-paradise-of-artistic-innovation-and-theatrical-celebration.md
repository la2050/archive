Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Our first step will be to focus our efforts on maintaining the highest class
  of artistry and professionalism in Theatre in Los Angeles. Through high
  standards of excellence we build our reputation to bring credit and a good
  name to San Pedro and the surrounding areas as an arts district. This includes
  seeking and partnering with an increasingly large group of internationally
  known artists, as well as fostering relationships with LA's growing theatre
  community. 
   
   This reputation, only now beginning to flourish, can be sustained through creative ad campaigning and most especially through bringing ever more students into our world-class actor training programs. This is the ultimate goal for us! We are at our best when we have students to nurture and to foster into the cycle of mentorship in combination with our professional company of artists. We will provide scholarships to these student and aspiring artists to ensure that they have the opportunity to invest in themselves. We are eager to invest in students who are eager to invest in themselves, and these scholarships will provide many such opportunities.
   
   This will include the continued establishment of our 1 month and then 3 month conservatory programs as well as the growth of our single and drop-in class menu. In these programs we train actors, directors, and artists of all backgrounds to tap into their talent and artistic instinct to become self sustaining artists who can foster growth in themselves and also in others. The key to this process is a cycle of mentorship. 
   
   The next piece of the process will be in providing enhancements to our performance space so that our artistic ambition can be matched my technical and practical precision. This will give the professional company added opportunity to push their limits artistically, and through that process mentor the students in that process as well. The student then has the perspective to become self empowering and sustaining.
   
   The culmination of the process is to showcase the work of our organization to the San Pedro community and our neighbors. The final portion of the project involves inviting our community to see and experience what their friends and neighbors in the city have been a part of, and inviting them to take part in it as well. After all theatre is incomplete unless the creators get to share it with the audience and give them an opportunity to filter the experience through their eyes, ears and minds.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  For today, LA needs an unabashed arts district that is not tied to nor unduly
  influenced by the Hollywood film business. It needs a place where theatrical
  art and artists can grow and challenge themselves without the taint of
  Hollywood's glitz and glamour. The artists who train and work with us are held
  to the highest standards of professionalism and artistry, helping to build and
  sustain a culture of dedication and art that is often (though not always)
  lacking in Los Angeles. 
   
   San Pedro is in the process of rising to become a sought after destination in LA. We aim to lead and be a part of the cultural renaissance! 
   
   For the future... Our goal when moving our company to San Pedro was to find a place where we could put down roots and firmly establish ourselves as a major player in the regional theatre circuit. In the same way that Oregon Shakespeare Festival put Ashland, OR on the map, we want to do the same for San Pedro and the Port of Los Angeles area. 
   
   Our ultimate goal is to have San Pedro as our "mother ship" site, and have other Theatrum Elysium ('TE' of TE San Pedro Rep) satellites through out the city and country - envision TE NYC, or TE Toronto! But first, we establish "Elysian Fields". This is an artistic haven on a piece of idyllic land nearby where TESPR houses it's professional company of actors and artists. Not only will a full season of theatre and dance be produced here, but Elysian Fields will house a full accredited MFA program training Actors, Directors and Playwrights and Dramaturgs. Beyond that this training program will be multi-disciplinary and house training for musicians, singers, dancers, visual artists and fine artists. We believe that though the medium may be different the artists still speaks from the same desire to express no matter if they wield a paint brush or toe shoes or a script.
   
   It is in Elysian Fields that the potential of the cycle of mentorship is truly seen. The professional company trains the students in classes where they learn side by side with the other professionals. The students learn how to learn from the professionals in class with them, and are further mentored in the productions that rehearse and perform in the performance venues.
   
   In 2050 Theatrum Elysium's Elysian Fields will be a foundation of what makes LA's arts and theatre scene vibrant, respected and well known. We can't wait to get there!!
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Our project will benefit most directly the neighborhood and community of San
  Pedro. This burgeoning arts district will be sustained and supported by our
  success. This will in turn create opportunities for other organizations to
  come into town to plant in the ground that we have helped to furrow and
  cultivate. Additionally, the restaurants, shops, bars and clubs of San Pedro
  will all benefit if increased traffic come through San Pedro in search of the
  arts.
   
   Beyond San Pedro, the class of aspiring actors and artists who are constantly beaten down by the juggernaut that is Hollywood will certainly benefit. The training that we offer is specifically geared to tap into the students talent and help to bring out what they would think of as their ideal artistic self. This is the artist that can be self sustaining. This is the artist that can create work independent of "the biz". This is not to say that the business at large does not create meaningful work, but to be truly meaningful the cumulative work of all the artists of every level in the city must be fostered and grown. Broadway in NYC would mean very little if Off-Broadway and Off-Off-Broadway did not exist to challenge it and push its limits and boundaries. Similarly, the greater LA area's work will be made better by having a community of artists who are pushing themselves and each other to be better, more innovative, less bound by tradition, less afraid of failure, and more and more proud of LA as an artistic breeding ground!
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  At this time we have no partner organizations, however, due to the
  collaborative nature of our work in the theatre, we are open to collaboration
  with other organizations.
