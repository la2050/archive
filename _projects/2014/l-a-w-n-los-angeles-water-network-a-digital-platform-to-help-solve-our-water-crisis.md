  L.A.W.N. Los Angeles Water Network: A digital platform to help solve our water
  crisis
project_summary: >-
  Wouldn't it be good if streams that run from the mountains to the sea could
  again be connected to form a new river moving through our city?

Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Undevelopment One will be the pilot project for a hoped for network of
  Undevelopments that could, over time, create a paleo-botanical eavesment by
  redefining our historic flood plain. We have counted around 25 storm drains
  and about as many potential brownfields that are candidates for Undevelopment.
  By Undeveloping we mean pounding out unused tarmac and concrete and adding
  water and letting the land regain agency. Lauren Bon and The Metabolic Studio
  are about to break ground on a waterwheel which will bring LA river water back
  up to the city. When construction begins in early 2015, the Harrison studio is
  proposing that cores be drilled down to the Eemian, 115,000 years ago, in
  order to conduct the appropriate pollen analysis to locate the species that
  had once lived there. Undevelopment One would take one of several possible
  sites along the edge of the LA River, reconnect it to LA River water, and
  establish on that site a greenhouse inside which potential future plant
  ensembles would be grown and released in the larger environment, in small
  experimental sites over the years as the weather warms. Our hope is that
  inspired cooperation among land owners and agencies will allow remediation
  without necessarily owning and controlling the land. We hope to educate
  through Undevelopment One that Another City Is Possible, one in which we are
  connected by a common goal to see LA survive into the future with a limited
  water supply and warming temperatures and see water as a human right and a
  social commodity. We see this as a kind of utilitarian prophecy that is at the
  same time a botanical adventure.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  It should be understood that both the Metabolic Studio and the Harrison Studio
  see the Undevelopment proposal as a new urban narrative. Climatologists
  predict that the climate experienced during the Eemian Age is close to that
  which we will be facing in 50-100 years. We note that many cities in the
  world, perhaps a majority, have profoundly mistreated their river systems. The
  model that the Harrison Studio and Metabolic Studio wish to put in place is
  replicable as cities around the world realize that a new way to justify their
  relationship to nature and the larger environment within which they are
  embedded has been made available. Our hope is that all artists, engineers,
  politicians, urban planners and visionaries network plans, funding and
  initiatives to address entropy rebalancing—meaning that all living systems
  move toward entropy, but that rate of that process in contemporary society,
  the stress on nature and on all our living systems is such that we can no
  longer think of any individual city but rather of collective actions that can
  rebalance entropy.
   
   “Artists Must Create on the Same Scale that Society has the Capacity to Destroy.”
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: The LA River corridor and the broader Los Angeles watershed and community
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Each Undevelopment project will be a public/private partnership requiring
  local, state, and federal agencies and private property owners to cooperate.
  Our team working on Bending the River Back Into the City is poised to assist
  with the implementation and have been confirmed: engineers from Geosyntec,
  landscape/construction professionals from Valley Crest, public affairs
  advocates from KindelGagan and climatologists from UCLA. The Metabolic Studio,
  in collaboration with the Harrison Studio, is applying for support for a pilot
  project for a network of Undevelopment projects. Helen and Newton Harrison of
  the Harrison Studio have been working with climate change and what future
  ecosystems might look like for many decades.
