  The Mirror, Mirror Project starts with one simple idea-- to see one
  another--face to face. Mirror, Mirror sits us directly in front of a homeless
  epidemic we nearly ignore, and ourselves--so we can take a look at what we
  have been overlooking. Without the security of our studio walls, Mirror,
  Mirror welcomes professional artists and homeless youth to sit across from
  each other and see how creating portraits of the other makes us each the
  same--human beings. 
   Once the pairs are finished with their portrait, each portrait is displayed side by side in a traveling art installation in parks all across LA where the community is invited to connect with the work, the artists and the youth.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  1. Invite Artists: First, invitations to professional artists working in
  any/all mediums in Los Angeles will be asked to participate to work with a
  youth of My Friend’s Place (the goal is to get about 80-100 different artists
  signed up). Once signed up, the artists will get a livescan (background check)
  done before coming into the center to work with the youth. 
   
   2. Hold Information Meeting(s): An artist kickoff event will be held at a specific location to give the artists a chance to get their livescans done and to get all the details for participating in the project. 
   
   3. Create Art: The artists can provide art materials as they wish to share with their partners or select from the materials we have provided. They will collaborate with their partner to create their portrait and have their portrait created by their partner. Once the artists have their livescans complete (and they have cleared) the artists will be able to pick a day they would like to come into the drop in center during the 3-4 month art making period. (We will create a sign- up sheet for the artists to pick from specific days and times so there are not more than 6 artists coming into the center at one time).
   As the artists sign up and start coming into the center, myself and another lead artist will help make sure the artists and youth are getting paired up together and have a space to work together on their portraits. 
   
   4. Frame the Work: The artists and youth will be able to work together until they finish their portraits. Once each partnership finishes a portrait, we will take them to get framed. 
   
   5. Install the work and hold exhibitions: The portraits will be displayed for the community to interact with in exhibitions around LA. The artwork will be to stored on a mobile truck to be able to transport to different parks across LA. At each park we will have open-air exhibitions with mobile display walls to set up at each location.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  TODAY: This project helps make LA the best place to connect today because it
  gives people a space for real interaction between two communities that
  normally don't connect with one another. The outcome is that each partner sees
  something they never saw in themselves which consequently gets projected not
  only in their portraits but in their perspectives forever. As this project
  continues into the future, greater compassion between the people in our
  community will be present. This project acts as a portal to ourselves, to
  others, and our society as we connect across social boundaries. This project
  allows us to powerfully share the magic of the artistic process and positively
  influence the youth to see their own dreams and empower them to purse
  something that inspires them and even seek help to get out of their current
  situations. The artists see what they have been blind to and are able to form
  new perspectives and get past judgments they have on the homeless.
   
   2050: People will be able to have a changed perspective of what homelessness looks like. They will feel more empathy towards people that don’t have a home and be able to connect on a new level. In 2050 more people will want to volunteer at drop-in centers, provide services for drop-in centers, bring food, materials, and come up with better ideas to help young people without a home. Because this project allows us to see what the homeless need on a deeper level, we can see where we are still lacking shelter, clothing, food, access to wifi, transportation, and employment opportunities.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: |-
  1. At-Risk Youth
   First the project will benefit the youth of My Friend’s Place. Not only will the youth get a one-on-one mentorship but they will feel heard and seen on an individual level. They will have a chance to share a story and passion through a form of art that excites them and get the support they may be wanting to express an idea with guidance. 
   
   2. Artists
   The artists will benefit greatly through this project as they will be forced to step outside their comfort zones of their studios to create art. They will have a space to let their walls down, be vulnerable themselves and share stories with youth they may haven’t shared with anyone else. The artists will open themselves up to a new perspective on what it means to be without a home and actually put themselves in their partner’s shoes. They will be forced to work on a new level, have the chance to be a teacher and a student at the same time. They will find themselves having a much bigger connection to their partner than they initially thought and open up a whole new level of seeing people for who they are instead of making judgments from an outside appearance. 
   
   3. The Community
   As the exhibition gets to travel around the LA parks, our whole community gets to experience the relationships that were formed through this project. The youth, artists, and the community in each park will be invited to experience the portraits and the stories of the relationships that formed and get to know others they may have never had the chance to meet before. 
   
   4. Community parks
   The parks around LA will benefit as this will open up excitement and activity. This project will show the community that the parks are always there to enjoy the beautiful city of LA and the community that we are.
   
   5. My Friend’s Place 
   This will benefit My Friend’s Place drop-in center in a way that will reinforce their model of being a low barrier service structure using their harm reduction approach. By bringing the MM Project to this drop-in center it will provide education and support and equip the youth to reduce the harmful effects associated with high risk street
   survival behavior and minimize the psychological, physical, and social barriers that typically deter youth from seeking and accepting assistance from a social service agency.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: |-
  1. My Friends Place (http://myfriendsplace.org/) (CONFIRMED)
   We have not worked together before but we have worked with Safe Place for Youth (which is a very similar drop-in center two times before)
   
   Three Factors:
   1. Create detailed timeline of project: That we sit together together as a team and map out all the details of this program together making sure MM Project and My Friend’s Place have a specific plan of the entire project including how many artists will be coming in each day to work, which staff will be coordinating the project and helping pair youth and artists together. 
   2. The safety of the participants: Both the youth and artists feel taken care of and respected as they create their artwork.
   3. Communication between MM Project coordinators and My Friend’s Place directors and staff 
   
   
   2. MOCA (Not confirmed but have reached out and hoping to do a mobile exhibit unit for the final closing exhibition (after the exhibit has gone to all the parks) like they did with the Mike Kelley mobile homestead exhibit outside their museum)
   
   Three Factors:
   1. Able to use space outside of MOCA 
   2. Open communication between MOCA and MM Project on rules of exhibiting outside the museum 
   3. Will be able to advertise with MOCA of the exhibition 
   
   
   3. PARKS of LA (None of these are confirmed yet and are just ideas of different parks around LA and the goal is to bring the exhibition to a broad audience in many different parks) 
    -Griffith Park 
   -Grand Park
   -Exposition Park
   -Kenneth Hahn State Rec Area
   -Barnsdall Art Park 
   -Pan Pacific Park Rec Center
   -Hollenbeck Park
   -Chesterfield Square Park 
   -Santa Monica
   -Venice
   
   Three Factors:
   1. The mobile exhibition will be able to find a nice location at each park to create a open air exhibition by opening the truck and creating a community event for a period of 3-4 hours on a specific day
   2. The park will allow the event to be advertised on a website
   3. The parks will each have a written contract with specific rules so that the exhibit and park are in clear agreement and communication for each event in order to ensure each event is carried out safely
