  ADL contracts with over two dozen facilitators to provide training to
  interested schools in the Los Angeles area. They have been trained to ensure
  top quality programming and fidelity to the program models. The facilitators
  are overseen by ADL’s full-time Project Director for its A WORLD OF
  DIFFERENCE® Institute who handles all coordination and logistics for
  educational programming in the region. The Project Director is assisted
  locally by an administrative assistant and supported more broadly by ADL’s
  national Education Division and its network of 28 regional offices across the
  United States. All facilitators must go through an extensive background and
  security check prior to being issued a contract to facilitate in ADL’s A WORLD
  OF DIFFERENCE® Institute. Facilitators must renew contracts on an annual
  basis. All Becoming An Ally programs are guided by two facilitators who model
  the importance of an anti-bias approach to preventing and addressing
  bullying. 
   
   Rigorously evaluated and based on top notch research and evidence, the Becoming An Ally program utilizes cutting edge, interactive learning activities. Each school goes through a detailed needs assessment and an agenda setting process with ADL’s A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE® Institute Project Director in the weeks leading up to their program. Following each day-long program, the Project Director will then produce evaluation reports, identify next steps, and engage in technical assistance with the school to continue its work towards a bias-free and non-violent learning environment.
   
   Few schools are able to pay the full costs of the program. Initiatives like LA2050 and the foundations that support them are critical to making these programs available. ADL’s Pacific Southwest Regional Office has waiting lists for clients eager to access these programs but unable to pay for them. Funding from LA2050 would allow ADL to immediately begin implementing programs and addressing unmet needs at schools across Los Angeles County.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Today, far too many students in Los Angeles are dropping out of school,
  skipping school, and engaging in anti-social activities because they are
  targeted in school by bullying, violence and bias-related behavior. According
  to 2011 data from the United States Centers for Disease Control and
  Prevention, more than 15 percent of Los Angeles students report that they have
  been bullied on school property while 29 percent report being in one or more
  physical fights in the last year. More than 12 percent report being the target
  of electronic and cyberbullying. Even worse, students in Los Angeles are
  significantly more likely to report a recent suicide attempt than students in
  other areas across the United States. 
   
   ADL’s Becoming An Ally equips students with the skills they need to be an ally to targets of bullying and positively shift social norms around bullying, harassment and other forms of aggression. As Los Angeles students then teach these values to their peers—and eventually their own children—long-term changes in norms will be sustained through 2050 and beyond. These anti-bullying programs will create safer and more welcoming school climates which result in students being more committed to and engaged with their schools—both as current students and after they graduate. 
   
   Anti-bias and anti-bullying education at all ages helps to reduce violence and community strife and promote safety. Bias- and bullying-free learning environments are crucial to good mental health for the County’s younger residents now and in the years ahead.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  ADL can train up to 1,200 educators and school staff at 30 trainings across
  the County over the next year. Assuming each teaches 100 students per year,
  those 1,200 school staff will then use the skills acquired through their
  training to positively impact the lives of more than 120,000 students each
  year. The Becoming An Ally program is tailored for elementary, middle and high
  school educators and staff. K-12 students will benefit from their educators
  being trained through the project. They in turn will shift social norms
  regionally related to bullying and pass those values onto people younger than
  them as well as future generations. The primary beneficiaries (1200 staff
  members) will help secondary beneficiaries (120,000 students) shift social
  norms and create safer places for many thousands of future students, the
  tertiary beneficiaries. Further, all of the County’s residents will benefit
  from safer schools and communities.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  At the national level, ADL has existing partnerships with the following
  organizations and initiatives to address bias and bullying: the Ad Council,
  the American Bar Association’s Anti-Bullying Initiative, Cartoon Network’s
  Stop Bullying, Speak Up initiative, Common Sense Media, Center for Safe and
  Responsible Internet Use, Cyberbullying Prevention Center, the Gay, Lesbian
  and Straight Education Network (GLSEN), the Great American NO BULL Challenge,
  the International Bullying Prevention Association, MTV’s A Thin Line and Look
  Different campaigns, Not In Our School, the Olweus Bullying Prevention
  Program, PACER’s National Bullying Prevention Center, Share My Lesson,
  Stand4Change, StopBullying.gov, and the Human Rights Campaign’s Welcoming
  Schools Program. Each of these organizations and initiatives have partnered
  with ADL to make the anti-bullying programs successful and bring a wide
  variety of perspectives and resources to augment ADL’s anti-bullying work.
  ADL’s office in Los Angeles is ready to engage these partnerships to ensure
  the success of our anti-bullying work in the region.
   
   Education staff from ADL’s Pacific Southwest Regional Office also hold local positions on the Los Angeles Unified School District’s Commission on Human Relations, Diversity and Equity and the City Human Relations Commission’s Anti-Bullying Coalition. ADL also works closely with the Los Angeles County Human Relations Commission and other regional partners to plan local conferences including the Cyber Crime Prevention Symposium. Through its work on coalitions, commissions and similar partnerships, ADL can draw expertise and resources from law enforcement, elected officials, school officials and other human relations experts. ADL’s local partners assist in identifying schools in need of anti-bullying training and disseminating crucial information across diverse networks.
