Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  L Creativo is already working towards the goals of the project outlined in
  this proposal. The team is ready to continue working with the same intensity
  and dedication that have made our accomplishments possible so far. 
   
   The team is already in place, the ideas are developed and the system is working. 
   
   L Creativo will take every step necessary to make this vision come into fruition, while maintaining the guiding core values and mission. Elevating the Latin indie music community of Los Angeles is our purpose.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Latinos are changing the cultural and political landscape of America, and Los
  Angeles has a very important role in shaping the discussion. What will Latinos
  relate to and identify with? What will they listen to? Who will they vote for?
  LA has the potential of capturing the imaginations of an ever growing
  population and inspire them to be creative and to have a meaningful say in the
  globalized world. Los Angeles’ influence in 2050 will be in part determined by
  the state of the Latino and the foundation supporting them to enable their
  expression.
   
   L Creativo is a company founded by Angelenos who have real connections to the Latin American music scene Los Angeles, as well as in Latin American countries. After years of working their way into the LA music scene, the realization that Los Angeles was missing a cohesive support structure for independent artists, especially in the Latin market, inspired the founders to seek these solutions to fill this void. L Creativo believes it is important for Latinos in LA to be connected with their heritage.
   
   So why is L.A., arguably one of the most important Latin cities in the world, not the birthplace of artists like Bomba Estéreo, Ana Tijoux, and Carla Morrison? Of course, there are some great LA based artists, like Ozomatli and La Santa Cecilia, but those bands seemed to be the exceptions rather than the natural outcome of a fertile scene. L Creativo sees this as a result of an old paradigm for the role of the Latino in Los Angeles that confines Latinos to the stereotype. L Creativo is here to provide the platform for the new Latinos to express themselves without the pressure of abiding to a role in order to fit a market, and therefore helping Los Angeles change its views on the Latino and start recognizing us more as equally contributing factors to the Angeleno culture.
   
   In the near future, L Creativo's proposal will provide a boost in creative energy and projects by the Latin independent music and art scenes of Los Angeles. By facilitating real connections to the traditional music and film industries in Los Angeles, artists will find ways of producing their art and start opening business opportunities. 
   
   L Creativo long-term goal is ensure that the creative community finds a subsistence mode, which is the ultimate way of supporting creative artists and projects.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  L Creativo believes in the avenues in this proposal as ways to facilitate
  creative projects, initially for the immediate community, but holding a
  constant expansion with aims of catapulting LA into a more influential role in
  the Latin indie music and art industries and becoming the best place to
  create! 
   
   Los Angeles consumers of culture, Latinos or otherwise, who seek stimulation from a positive source of creativity will welcome the unique experiences that L Creativo events offer. Bringing artists from Latin America and talent from Los Angeles together, sets the groundwork for collaboration and cross pollination. The creative community will benefit greatly.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  All collaborators are confirmed and active. It is key that they all contribute
  what they are good at and love, that they are in for the long-run and that
  they have a sense of belonging with LA.
