Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  We will fundraise the funds and become certified as B Corporation. Once we
  have the funds we can do the following:
   Obtain a lease or purchase property
   Purchase equipment
   Design the space for the needs of the families
   Marketing and awareness
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Currently, children in South LA experience many injustices related to play.
  There are only a handful of indoor play facilities in the area. The play
  facilities that do exist promote play but also promote unhealthful eating,
  such as Chuck-E-Cheese and the play gyms at McDonalds. Lack of green space,
  play space and healthy food choice options all contribute to the growing rate
  of obesity among children in LA County. Tickleberry Place will combat the
  trifold issues of lack of play space, lack of green space, and lack of healthy
  food by providing a space where children and families can eat, play, and learn
  about healthy living. 
   Our children our exposed to a large number of harsh chemicals and toxic materials. Tickleberry Place will be a play space made from environmentally friendly materials. In addition, Tickleberry Place will use products and methods to keep the play space toxic free. This is particularly important as about 1 in 11 children have asthma in Los Angeles. 
   
   Children can play in the play gym or participate in community building games facilitated by the Tickleberry team. When children are done playing,they can eat healthy organic produce grown in Tickleberry’s garden. Food will be healthful but also culturally relevant to the majority black and Latino residents in the neighborhood near Tickleberry.
   
   What will distinguish Tickleberry from other indoor play gyms is its focus on education for families. Through a partnership with educational organizations, Tickleberry will offer classes, workshops, and events for parents on topics such as gardening, healthy eating, sustainable living, and healthy child development. 
   
   Our goal is for Tickleberry Place to be a community hub for health and wellness. With a local space that caters toward fun and well being, Tickleberry Place will help make LA the best place to learn in 2050.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  This will benefit families in South and Central Los Angeles, but it is not
  limited to other neighborhoods and communities.
   
   Tickleberry Place was designed to meet the unique needs of South LA. Historically, South LA has experienced violence, lack of access to safe play spaces to children, limited access to healthy foods. This limits opportunities for children to play and for parents to connect in a public space about values such as healthy living for families. Tickleberry caters to this demographic of Black and Latino families with children ages 6 months to 10 years old. Tickleberry begins in South LA as it is the highest need region for issues of food access and play space. However, the location of Tickleberry makes it accessible to the greater Los Angeles’ Community. Tickleberry welcomes participation from families across the city. Eventually, it is the goal of the founders to expand Tickleberry into other regions of the city, so that families will not have to travel far for safe, environmentally friendly, healthful play spaces for children.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  As of right now, we don’t have any partners or collaborators on the project.
  Having a partner would be a great opportunity for collaborating on this cause
  of creating healthy and sustainable play spaces in Los Angeles. We are open to
  having partners and are looking for them.

  evaluate: "Raise at least $500,000 to fund opening the facility \r\nGain 100,000 followers and supporters in the community (government, customers)\r\nObtain facility location with parking in the South/Central Los Angeles area that is within ¼ mile of the residents and is easily accessible for residents within 2 mile radius\r\nMeet the requirements for Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design (LEED) Green building Certification\r\nOpen doors in Spring 2015\r\nBecome certified as a B-corporation. \r\n"
  two_lessons: "The first lesson is that there are not any indoor play spaces in the South and Central Los Angeles Area. Because of the lack of indoor play for the families, we have to travel outside of the area to obtain it. \r\n\r\nThe second lesson is that the South and Central Los angeles neighborhoods are considered food deserts with not many places to buy healthy organic foods or many business that provide healthy, eco-friendly, and sustainable services. \r\n\r\nHaving a background in User Experience, improving people’s experiences and making things easier, created the idea for Tickleberry Place. Tickleberry Place will provide a solution to these lessons by creating a fun indoor place for families that also provides a healthy and environmental alternative. \r\n"
  achievable_goal: >-
    Opening Tickleberry Place will be achievable within a year because we simply
    have to gain the funds, find a location, build and design, and open doors. 
  major_challenges: "The first major challenge we anticipate is gaining enough capital/funding to finish the project in the time frame. With the challenge of gaining the capital we need, it pushes back when we can start to provide this experience for families. \r\n\r\nThe second major challenges to anticipate is finding the perfect location to meet our needs of having at least 4000 sq ft, accessible from the public transportation, and has plenty of parking space.   \r\n\r\nWe would like to obtain a space that is in south LA but accessible to the 10 and 101 freeways so that families from the greater Los Angeles area can easily access Tickleberry Place. \r\n\r\nThis items affect our customer experience and can make it a challenge for them, if these requirements are not met. The space needs to be easily accessible, therefore creating a seamless experience. \r\n"
  competition: "In South Los Angeles there are relatively few indoor play gyms. The most prominent indoor play spaces are the areas at the Fox Hills Mall and Baldwin Hills Malls. The advantage they have is that they are accessible and free. However, they do not provide access for babies and small children, and do not provide opportunities for play. Additionally, they are located next to food courts, promoting unhealthy eating. \r\n\r\nThere are a few places in other neighborhoods and cities that provide indoor play for kids. However, we are unique because will be accessible to the public on weekends, provide healthy organic food options, eco-friendly, and serve as a community hub for families. A Magical Forest is a indoor play gym located in Culver City that provides a similar experience experience, where they have toys made of natural materials. However, like most indoor play gyms in the Los Angeles Area, they are closed on the weekends for private birthday parties. This creates a struggle for parents to take their kids to a open play space on the weekends. As most Los Angeles parents and children have work and school during the week, and are looking for activities during the weekend. Tickleberry Place will be open on the weekends by having a large enough space with a room for private parties, in addition to the open play area. \r\n\r\nThere are a number of Indoor play gyms in the Los Angeles area that strive to be the best at providing family entertainment for profit. Tickleberry Place is about being the best for Los Angeles by providing a space of fun, health, sustainability, and community. We will be committed to solving social and environmental problems as a Certified B-Corporation. \r\n"
  cost: "To launch an endeavor such as this will take more than $100,000. However, $100,000 is significant seed capital to procure a location for one year and to outfit that location with a few eco-friendly play apparatuses, plus cost for marketing and fee for becoming a certified B-Corporation. \r\nWe estimate that the total cost will be about $600,000 for building and design, play equipment, kitchen equipment, website development, marketing, building lease (or purchase), employees (pay and training), plus administration costs. To obtain the rest of the funds, we are working on a crowdfunding video campaign, a couple of fundraising events, applying for additional grants, and investor opportunities. "
  budget: "We will use to $100,000 grant for the following estimated costs:\r\n\r\nBrand Building and Advertising:\r\nSocial Media Management ($500 monthly)\r\nT-shirts ($2,000)\r\nWebsite design, development, and management ($3,000)\r\nShort film illustration videos ($1,000)\r\n\r\nFundraising:\r\nFundraising events ($4,000)\r\nCrowdfunding Video ($1,000)\r\n\r\nBuilding:\r\nLease ($4,000-$6,000 monthly, until doors open)\r\nBuilding/Architecture Design ($30,000)\r\nFacility Equipment ($15,000)\r\n\r\nOther:\r\nB-Corporation certification fee ($500)\r\nAdmin/Miscellaneous cost ($5,000)\r\n1-2 Part-Time employees ($7,000)\r\n"

    answer: "The first lesson is that there are not any indoor play spaces in the South and Central Los Angeles Area. Because of the lack of indoor play for the families, we have to travel outside of the area to obtain it. \r\n\r\nThe second lesson is that the South and Central Los angeles neighborhoods are considered food deserts with not many places to buy healthy organic foods or many business that provide healthy, eco-friendly, and sustainable services. \r\n\r\nHaving a background in User Experience, improving people’s experiences and making things easier, created the idea for Tickleberry Place. Tickleberry Place will provide a solution to these lessons by creating a fun indoor place for families that also provides a healthy and environmental alternative. \r\n"

    answer: "The first major challenge we anticipate is gaining enough capital/funding to finish the project in the time frame. With the challenge of gaining the capital we need, it pushes back when we can start to provide this experience for families. \r\n\r\nThe second major challenges to anticipate is finding the perfect location to meet our needs of having at least 4000 sq ft, accessible from the public transportation, and has plenty of parking space.   \r\n\r\nWe would like to obtain a space that is in south LA but accessible to the 10 and 101 freeways so that families from the greater Los Angeles area can easily access Tickleberry Place. \r\n\r\nThis items affect our customer experience and can make it a challenge for them, if these requirements are not met. The space needs to be easily accessible, therefore creating a seamless experience. \r\n"

    answer: "In South Los Angeles there are relatively few indoor play gyms. The most prominent indoor play spaces are the areas at the Fox Hills Mall and Baldwin Hills Malls. The advantage they have is that they are accessible and free. However, they do not provide access for babies and small children, and do not provide opportunities for play. Additionally, they are located next to food courts, promoting unhealthy eating. \r\n\r\nThere are a few places in other neighborhoods and cities that provide indoor play for kids. However, we are unique because will be accessible to the public on weekends, provide healthy organic food options, eco-friendly, and serve as a community hub for families. A Magical Forest is a indoor play gym located in Culver City that provides a similar experience experience, where they have toys made of natural materials. However, like most indoor play gyms in the Los Angeles Area, they are closed on the weekends for private birthday parties. This creates a struggle for parents to take their kids to a open play space on the weekends. As most Los Angeles parents and children have work and school during the week, and are looking for activities during the weekend. Tickleberry Place will be open on the weekends by having a large enough space with a room for private parties, in addition to the open play area. \r\n\r\nThere are a number of Indoor play gyms in the Los Angeles area that strive to be the best at providing family entertainment for profit. Tickleberry Place is about being the best for Los Angeles by providing a space of fun, health, sustainability, and community. We will be committed to solving social and environmental problems as a Certified B-Corporation. \r\n"

    answer: "To launch an endeavor such as this will take more than $100,000. However, $100,000 is significant seed capital to procure a location for one year and to outfit that location with a few eco-friendly play apparatuses, plus cost for marketing and fee for becoming a certified B-Corporation. \r\nWe estimate that the total cost will be about $600,000 for building and design, play equipment, kitchen equipment, website development, marketing, building lease (or purchase), employees (pay and training), plus administration costs. To obtain the rest of the funds, we are working on a crowdfunding video campaign, a couple of fundraising events, applying for additional grants, and investor opportunities. "
