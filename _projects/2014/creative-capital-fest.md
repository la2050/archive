Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Creative Capital Fest will be a world class music, technology, and arts
  festival that showcases Los Angeles' innovative & creative industries,
  artists, and organizations (branding LA as a global "Creative Capital");
  facilitates cross-sector connection of ideas between LA's inspired minds;
  attracts investors and entrepreneurs from around the world; and delivers
  "creative capital" in the form of grants to innovative organizations that work
  to make our city a better place to live and create.
   
   We plan to host the first major festival over two days in fall 2015, with the core event in Grand Park in DTLA. The event will feature three stages of live entertainment & speakers, with interactive technology integrated into the lifeblood of the event.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  We're going to be working with a variety of partners to coordinate the
  capstone event of LA Innovation Week 2014 on October 11th of this year. That
  event will bring together partners from around LA to connect and celebrate a
  successful week of events highlighting and celebrating innovation and
  creativity in our city, and will kick off the planning stages for Innovation
  Week and the capstone Creative Capital Fest in fall 2015.
   
   With the LA2050 grant, we will host a series of convenings with LA creative and civic leaders to refine our shared vision and develop a common agenda for the citywide event we'll host together, as well as create content for a citywide crowdfunding campaign alongside core partners to raise grassroots funds and build serious buzz behind our movement. We'll also use some of these initial funds to formalize a relationship with a major festival production company that will work with us throughout the planning process and help to bring in large sponsors that will make this event even more viable.
   
   We've had conversations with multiple major festival production companies that have bought into our vision and will be invaluable partners as we aim to quickly scale up this event. We've quickly realized that this is an idea that sells itself, and with a major event production company as a partner and a large-scale, inclusive, and collaborative strategic planning process we know that this vision will scale quickly.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  It's no secret that LA is home to more innovators, entrepreneurs,
  entertainers, creators, visionaries, and dreamers than just about any place on
  earth. But while we have had great success exporting our dreams to the world,
  we aren't yet home to a single world class event (think SXSW, Disrupt) that
  brings people together to celebrate innovation and creativity happening right
  here in LA - to attract investors and entrepreneurs from around the world, to
  inspire and retain young and talented Angelenos, to facilitate cross-sector
  connection and collaboration, to give back to orgs making our city better -
  and to have way too much fun.
   
   It's time to shine the spotlight on LA.
   
   Creative Capital Fest will be a world class, citywide event that shows off LA as a global creative capital, facilitates greater collaboration between LA's creative industries, and attracts the best and brightest investors and entrepreneurs to our city. Angelenos are yearning for a world class showcase event - let's create it together.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  This event will connect LA startups and social entrepreneurs to capital.
  Founders to talent. Creative leaders in LA's diverse creative industries to
  one another. It will play a major role in branding LA as a "creative capital"
  - as a place for dreamers and doers to accomplish big things. Today, we are
  forced to look outside our home, to Austin, to the Bay, to Chicago, or New
  York to showcase our projects. This limits the opportunity to only those who
  can make the journey, while providing outsized benefit to the people in those
  towns. SXSW alone contributed over $200M to the Austin economy in 2014. Think
  of what that revenue would do for business owners in Los Angeles.
   
   Beneficiaries of this event will include:
   
   Existing LA companies - a chance to show off LA companies and products to the world.
   
   Young entrepreneurs and college students in Los Angeles - an opportunity to connect with, be inspired by, and identify employment opportunities with innovative companies, organizations, and thought leaders that are based right here in LA. 
   
   LA's startup community - Silicon Beach LA, Bixel Exchange, and other organizations are already doing amazing work to build up and connect LA's startup community, and this event will represent a complementary opportunity.
   
   Up-and-coming LA musicians and entertainers - major showcase opportunity
   
   Creative Los Angeles nonprofits and social enterprises - a large percentage of revenue from the event will be allocated in the form of Creative Capital Grants to organizations making our city a better place to live and create, and the festival will be a fantastic showcase opportunity for LA's creative do-gooders.
   
   Investors in LA and elsewhere - an event that attracts investors and consumers to LA, and an opportunity for investors to connect with startups and companies in Los Angeles
   
   Los Angeles entertainment lovers - a world class music and entertainment event
   
   LA's creative industries - an opportunity for LA's creative industries to connect with one another and facilitate cross-sector collaboration.
