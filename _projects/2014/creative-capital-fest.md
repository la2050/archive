  more_detail: "Creative Capital Fest will be a world class music, technology, and arts festival that showcases Los Angeles' innovative & creative industries, artists, and organizations (branding LA as a global \"Creative Capital\"); facilitates cross-sector connection of ideas between LA's inspired minds; attracts investors and entrepreneurs from around the world; and delivers \"creative capital\" in the form of grants to innovative organizations that work to make our city a better place to live and create.\r\n\r\nWe plan to host the first major festival over two days in fall 2015, with the core event in Grand Park in DTLA. The event will feature three stages of live entertainment & speakers, with interactive technology integrated into the lifeblood of the event."
  implement: "We're going to be working with a variety of partners to coordinate the capstone event of LA Innovation Week 2014 on October 11th of this year. That event will bring together partners from around LA to connect and celebrate a successful week of events highlighting and celebrating innovation and creativity in our city, and will kick off the planning stages for Innovation Week and the capstone Creative Capital Fest in fall 2015.\r\n\r\nWith the LA2050 grant, we will host a series of convenings with LA creative and civic leaders to refine our shared vision and develop a common agenda for the citywide event we'll host together, as well as create content for a citywide crowdfunding campaign alongside core partners to raise grassroots funds and build serious buzz behind our movement. We'll also use some of these initial funds to formalize a relationship with a major festival production company that will work with us throughout the planning process and help to bring in large sponsors that will make this event even more viable.\r\n\r\nWe've had conversations with multiple major festival production companies that have bought into our vision and will be invaluable partners as we aim to quickly scale up this event. We've quickly realized that this is an idea that sells itself, and with a major event production company as a partner and a large-scale, inclusive, and collaborative strategic planning process we know that this vision will scale quickly.\r\n"
  impact_create: "It's no secret that LA is home to more innovators, entrepreneurs, entertainers, creators, visionaries, and dreamers than just about any place on earth. But while we have had great success exporting our dreams to the world, we aren't yet home to a single world class event (think SXSW, Disrupt) that brings people together to celebrate innovation and creativity happening right here in LA - to attract investors and entrepreneurs from around the world, to inspire and retain young and talented Angelenos, to facilitate cross-sector connection and collaboration, to give back to orgs making our city better - and to have way too much fun.\r\n\r\nIt's time to shine the spotlight on LA.\r\n\r\nCreative Capital Fest will be a world class, citywide event that shows off LA as a global creative capital, facilitates greater collaboration between LA's creative industries, and attracts the best and brightest investors and entrepreneurs to our city. Angelenos are yearning for a world class showcase event - let's create it together."
  who_benefit: "This event will connect LA startups and social entrepreneurs to capital. Founders to talent. Creative leaders in LA's diverse creative industries to one another. It will play a major role in branding LA as a \"creative capital\" - as a place for dreamers and doers to accomplish big things. Today, we are forced to look outside our home, to Austin, to the Bay, to Chicago, or New York to showcase our projects. This limits the opportunity to only those who can make the journey, while providing outsized benefit to the people in those towns. SXSW alone contributed over $200M to the Austin economy in 2014. Think of what that revenue would do for business owners in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nBeneficiaries of this event will include:\r\n\r\nExisting LA companies - a chance to show off LA companies and products to the world.\r\n\r\nYoung entrepreneurs and college students in Los Angeles - an opportunity to connect with, be inspired by, and identify employment opportunities with innovative companies, organizations, and thought leaders that are based right here in LA. \r\n\r\nLA's startup community - Silicon Beach LA, Bixel Exchange, and other organizations are already doing amazing work to build up and connect LA's startup community, and this event will represent a complementary opportunity.\r\n\r\nUp-and-coming LA musicians and entertainers - major showcase opportunity\r\n\r\nCreative Los Angeles nonprofits and social enterprises - a large percentage of revenue from the event will be allocated in the form of Creative Capital Grants to organizations making our city a better place to live and create, and the festival will be a fantastic showcase opportunity for LA's creative do-gooders.\r\n\r\nInvestors in LA and elsewhere - an event that attracts investors and consumers to LA, and an opportunity for investors to connect with startups and companies in Los Angeles\r\n\r\nLos Angeles entertainment lovers - a world class music and entertainment event\r\n\r\nLA's creative industries - an opportunity for LA's creative industries to connect with one another and facilitate cross-sector collaboration."

  evaluate: "Metrics will include:\r\n\r\nNumber of LA-based startups that receive investment as a result of the event\r\n\r\nNumber of quality Jobs and volunteer opportunities created for young Angelenos,\r\n\r\nFunds and resources directly allocated to LA-based impact-oriented organizations as a direct result of the festival\r\n\r\nNumber of foreign nationals (especially investors) attending the festival \r\n\r\nNational and international media hits highlighting Los Angeles as a mecca for innovation and creativity."
  two_lessons: "Combining music, business, and technology is a proven breeding ground for innovation and a proven stimulator of economic activity. SXSW boasts 72,000 participants and is a showcase destination for countless Los Angeles-based innovators,  creators, and dreamers. Our goal as a city should be to give those Los Angeles' creators a major showcase event right here at home.\r\n\r\nLiving and working in LA has awarded us the privilege to be surrounded by inspired, brilliant, and capable leaders working in diverse creative sectors,  but our experience is that those sectors are largely siloed off from one another and don't collaborate on a deep enough level. We plan to create an event that facilitates the building of connections between LA's creative industries."
  achievable_goal: "We'll be collaborating with a variety of partners, including LA2050, to pull together the capstone event of Innovation Week 2014 on October 11th. This event will be a hugely scaled-down version of the eventual Creative Capital Fest, but will provide an opportunity to deliver an entertaining networking event for our Innovation Week partners that will lay the groundwork for a scaled up Innovation Week and Creative Capital Fest in 2015.\r\n\r\nWe have had conversations with multiple major festival production companies that have bought into our vision and will be invaluable partners as we aim to quickly scale up this event. We've quickly realized that this is an idea that sells itself, and with a major event production company as a partner we know that we can handle the on the ground logistics to scale this vision quickly."
  major_challenges: "Barrier 1:\r\n\r\nFunding and sponsorship dollars - an event of the scale we plan to build requires major capital on the front end. We're supremely confident that we'll be able to sell major sponsors on this vision, especially with the initial boost that an LA2050 grant would provide. We have already had a number of very promising conversations with potential large sponsors, and we would leverage the LA2050 grant to bring in additional sponsorship dollars that will help make this event a reality\r\n\r\nBarrier 2:\r\n\r\nGetting full buy-in from LA's creative industries -  It's crucial that this event becomes an integral part of the larger movement to showcase and brand Los Angeles, and that we integrate leaders from LA's creative industries as partners right from the start. We're confident that our vision for Los Angeles is right in line with the various businesses, organizations, and individuals on the front lines of selling LA as a \"creative capital.\""
  competition: "Silicon Beach Fest\r\n \r\nDigital LA\r\n \r\nJay-Z's \"Made in America\" Music Festival in Grand Park\r\n \r\nLA Cleantech Incubator's GloSho.\r\n \r\nLA Area Chamber of Commerce, Bixel Exchange\r\n \r\nLA Movie Fest\r\n \r\nFYF Fest\r\n \r\nThere are a variety of organizations that put on events that could in some ways be perceived as competitive with our event, but we plan to develop deep partnerships with organizations in Los Angeles that area already doing great work to connect and showcase Los Angeles innovators. This event will create a platform that will add value to the work of innovation-oriented organizations n Los Angeles."
  cost: "This information is for internal purposes only and will not be publicly displayed.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the costs of producing this event will cost in the range of $750k - $1.25 million, depending on how ambitious we want to go with the initial 2015 festival.  In either case, we're confident that we'll be able to at least break even in year one via ticket sales and sponsorships. \r\n\r\nThe $100,000 will be a gigantic boost, and we will be able to leverage that initial infusion of money to attract major sponsors and headliner entertainment for our 2015 event."
  budget: "$20k will be used to bring a major festival production company (likely C3) as a partner and to conduct an initial financial assessment for the scaled-up festival. We'll work with that partner to set up meetings with potential major sponsors and musical headliners.\r\n\r\n$15k will be utilized to fund a series of convenings throughout Los Angeles with creative industry and civic leaders to lay out a shared vision for the Creative Capital Fest\r\n\r\n$15k will be delivered to our partners at Innovation Week to help fund staffing for a massively scaled up week of innovation-focused events and activities in 2015 in the lead-up to the Creative Capital Fest.\r\n\r\n$15k will be used to develop a compelling crowdfunding campaign, with a shareable call-to-action video featuring notable Los Angeles musicians, artists, politicians, and creative industry leaders. We believe that we could potentially raise the majority of the money needed to host this festival via a major leveraged crowdfunding effort.\r\n\r\n$5k will be spent on creating comprehensive branding and promotional elements for the festival at an extremely cut rate\r\n\r\n$15k will be utilized as a down payment to lock down a top-notch headlining LA artist, which we will be able to leverage as we go out to attract an elite group of LA-based entertainers and speakers.\r\n\r\n$15k will be kept as reserve for additional expenses (e.g. travel) associated with early stage activities to build this event.\r\n"
