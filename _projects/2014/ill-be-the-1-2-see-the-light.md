  Through service learning educational programs, student made documentary films,
  social media campaigns, youth summits, educational art installations,
  literature publication, and online curriculum, IBT1 encourages youth to get
  involved and interested in larger social issues by using inspiring, creative
  mediums. 
   
   
   Presented with opportunities in the class room to address present day, real-world challenges students will take on projects that test out their critical thinking and team-building skills on issues that will immediately have an impact on their local communities, and they’ll build up their confidence in their ability to impact real change while doing it. Of course, we need to teach our youth the basics about the important global issues at hand, but it is also our responsibility to restore in them the belief that they can indeed make a difference and that their actions matter. We need to give them the opportunity to experience that they, indeed, can be the one to make a change for the better. 
   
   Our premiere program based on this philosophy, SEE THE LIGHT, will launch in over 10+ Los Angeles based Secondary Schools Fall 2014. Designed to walk teachers and students through an eco-challenge that impacts their school and/or community to which they must propose and vote on a chosen project to implement as a potential solution to the presented problem. 
   
   This fall we will address the five main topics of soil health, waste management, energy, air quality, and ocean health in that particular school and group of students. Each school participating will be provided with 3 visits from an IBT1 program lead. We will provide the following; three classroom discussions, a presentation about our program; actionable take home tool kit that addresses the eco-challenge; a sustainability plan for the school and student related to the challenge; tools for science, environmental and film clubs to launch peer-to-peer learning campaigns; access to our online tools, how to videos, social media engagement, and tracking system; comprehensive volunteer, internship, and learning database; and resources in English and Spanish language. 
   
   SEE THE LIGHT will empower students to take on an eco challenge, art installations, media campaigns, and documentary films that push forward social change. With our online portal students will be able to track their groups’ project, find and log volunteer hours, and earn points toward green products, healthy food, and scholarships.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  SEE THE LIGHT is uniquely designed to take advantage of the rich resources we
  have in the LA metropolitan area – namely the bar-setting arts and
  entertainment industry and the thriving local non-profit community- and make
  them more available to the youth engaged in our programs. Many of these youth,
  especially those in the less affluent areas, would never otherwise have
  exposure to such resources. By creating collaborative partnerships between
  local non-profits (Heal the Bay, Tree People, etc.), the creative arts and
  entertainment industry, local governing bodies, and local schools we create a
  learning web for students that inspire them at a passion level so the learning
  flows naturally. We show them the benefits of cross-pollinating from the many
  sectors of society to come up with creative solutions to long-held societal
  problems. We create an “innovation-incubator” for our youth to nurture and
  build confidence in the budding leader inside. Through mentorship programs and
  youth summits in our programs and online community, we connect youth directly
  with places of potential future employment. 
   With SEE THE LIGHT, LA does become the best place to learn today because we bridge the gap between school and the community’s outside resources. We take the pressure off of schools to “do it all,” and we provide an avenue for outside agencies to bring their resources to the schools in an easy-to-use, immediately impactful way. What’s more, with every new year of the program, the learning web only grows stronger. The integrated community of learning that expands well beyond the walls of any one school grows bigger and more sophisticated every year. Graduates of the program can come back and act as mentors. Communications between schools, non-profits, and the entertainment industry get more frequent, more clear, and more creatively rich. We start to funnel well-trained youth into internship jobs at some of the collaborating non-profits or corporations that take part in out learning web. By the year 2050, other metropolitan areas will be emulating our model for integrated learning systems that empower our youth, our communities, and our local industries.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The youth of today – leadership training, direct hands on experience,
  opportunities to direct their future success and access to meeting folks who
  can get them in the job market
   
   The schools – we take over where they don’t have the capacity to take the students. Everything from teaching them emotional intelligence, conflict resolution, management skills as well as we connect schools to the local resources in the community that they wouldn’t otherwise have access to.
   
   The industries and non-profits– entertainment industry needs vibrant young minds with innovative ideas that address real world problems. We are a key component in that pipeline, getting the best of the best youth in position to be future employees at these places.
   
   Future generations and the planet – we are protecting the future generations of this planet by giving our best offering to this current next generation. We are teaching them from an integrated place, teaching them systems thinking so that they can address the complex problems we face with a holistic approach. We are teaching them how to be stewards of this earth. Like Einstein said “to solve a problem, you have to operate from a higher level of consciousness than the one the problem was created on.” We are offering that new high level way of thinking as a promise for a better future for all.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Non-profits – Tree People, Heal The Bay, Kiss The Ground, Global Green and
  ACE.
   
   Governing agencies – City of LA Mayor's office and their Sustainable goals. 
   
   Institutions of higher learning – partnering with film schools and Universities. We are working with UCLA. 
   
   Secondary Schools – University High, Amino Inglewood High School, Amino Westrside Middle School, Muse School (these are confirmed) and more to come. 
   
   CREEC- CA Dept of Ed.
   
   Arts and Entertainment Industry– partnering with film schools such as LA Film so students will be exposed to the entertainment industry through media projects we build with the students.
   
   Three factors critical to the success of our collaboration: 1) regular and open communication. Not a lot of institutions are used to working in such a collaborative and innovative way. There’s a lot of disconnects and “re-invent the wheel” stuff in the non-profit world and entertainment industry here. By putting the focus on the youth and not on any one organization, we give the power over to the people and encourage a much higher level of organization. There’s a learning curve in and of itself in this collaboration. We are staffed at IBT1 with experts in empowerment and leadership training and fully intend to have one of the first things we do to be to inculcate the collaborating partners into our new model of thinking. We need to walk our talk for it to work. In addition, we are staffed amply to do regular follow up with our partners and support a regular open flow of communication clearly. 2) acknowledgment for the system as it currently works. We do have our feet on the ground, even if our vision is to shoot for the stars, so to speak. We know we have to be palatable to the schools learning agenda, especially with standardized testing, so we are partnering with CREEC to ensure we are doing this in a way that’s approachable enough for the schools that they’re able to fit it in their scheduling. 3) a clear plan. High level collaborations are awesome, but they need clear strategy and direction. Through the discipline comes the freedom. We have big goals, but they start with small strategic steps. We have very clear game plans about who to engage in year one, and what we need from who to make this work. We constantly re-evaluate and course correct, but are savvy to the need for specific and measurable benchmark goals, especially in the early stages of partnerships until a more naturalorganic rhythm starts to unfold.
