Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  In order to increase college graduation rates of low-income students living in
  Section 8 and Public Housing, the CDF will continue operating its longstanding
  HAR Scholarship program. This program has been in operation for 17 years and
  awards college and vocational training program students with scholarships up
  to $1,000. By 2019, the CDF plans to increase scholarship size to up to
  $2,500. Scholarship awards are disbursed to students throughout the school
  year based on meeting academic milestones. 
   
   Additionally, the CDF will continue to implement and expand the College to Career Mentorship program. This program was launched in 2014 and matches college students of all ages with a mentor that is currently working in their field of interest. The one-to-one relationship is meant to give students an opportunity to learn firsthand about their career field, build their network, and receive strategic career planning advice in a supportive environment. Most mentors are first-generation college graduates that are eager to share their experiences with students. Each mentor pair is expected to meet at least 4 times per year, including one mandatory job visit.
   
   Beyond these two currently operated programs, the CDF will take the baby shower model and start hosting College Showers. These events will celebrate the milestone of attending college and prepare students with financial and emotional support needed. Not only will students receive needed school supplies such as USB flash drives and extra-long bed sheets (for those living in dorms), but also with advice from college graduates. Similar to baby shower, the College Shower will be family oriented and provide a launching pad for student achievement and a rare opportunity to celebrate this important milestone.
   
   To fully implement these three components, the CDF will hire an Outreach Coordinator responsible for recruiting, outreaching, and creating a community for students and mentors. In total, the Coordinator will have a case load of approximately 250 people include students, parents, and mentors.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Project: SCHOLARS will make Los Angeles the best place to learn today by
  creating an equitable learning environment that all students regardless of
  income and background can expect to succeed. WIth both financial and emotional
  support, students will be engaged and posed for success. Additionally,
  Project: SCHOLARS will make Los Angeles the best place to learn in 2050 by
  removing the old stigma of Housing Projects being a place for drugs, crime,
  violence, and fraud. Rather those living in poverty will have the same chance
  and expectation to succeed academically and in their career as their higher
  income counterparts because they will have the positive role models as proof.
  If the least among us, those that have the greatest challenges, can succeed
  then all of Los Angeles can succeed!
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  CDF and Project: SCHOLARS benefit a specific sub-population of the Los Angeles
  Community: low-income housing residents, that is Section 8 and Public Housing
  residents. In Los Angeles County there are over 100,000 families enrolled in
  one of these two housing programs. This target population is made up of some
  of our region’s most disadvantaged youth and families that struggle from more
  than poverty. The vast majority of low-income residents are economically
  unstable and vulnerable and have also dealt with extreme adversity such as
  being formerly homeless, transition age youth (TAY) leaving the foster care
  system, victims of domestic or sexual violence, physically or mentally
  disabled, among other challenges. A particularly unique aspect of the CDF’s
  target population is that there are no age limits, and in fact, the CDF
  encourages adults to return to higher education. The CDF believes that while
  it is important to support youth transitioning from high school to college,
  supporting adults (especially adults with children) can be challenging but is
  also important to ending generational poverty. Parents returning back to
  school have the opportunity to not only improve their lives but also the lives
  of their children. Without Project: SCHOLARS, our clients are at-risk of being
  stuck in the vicious cycle of generational poverty.
   
   Although direct services are provided to low-income housing residents, the ripple effects of Project: SCHOLARS goes well beyond the individual participant. While the students receive the direct benefit of financial and emotional support as they persist through college, their family and the greater community gains a new positive role for educational excellence, perseverance, and resiliency as well.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  The CDF will work with the Housing Authority of the County of Los Angeles
  (HACoLA) to implement Project: SCHOLARS. This partnership is confirmed and
  longstanding. The benefits of working with HACoLA is the ability to work
  directly with site staff to access residents that are college-bound or current
  college students. HACoLA offers their residents case management, afterschool
  programming, and clinical psychological services. The relationships that their
  staff build through these and other programs is a compliment to CDF's
  programming.
