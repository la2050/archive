  more_detail: >-
    In 2012 we opened The L.A. Fort with the idea of creating a place where the
    public could come learn new skills, teach each other, grow creatively, and
    invest in their own creative capital while maintaining social and
    environmental awareness and ensuring sustainability. Membership is open to
    the public for all to participate and enjoy.Our main struggle in fully
    realizing this idea has been acquiring permits for the performance arts
    space. We aim to acquire permanent permits in order to heavily involve the
    public.In the short amont of time ocupying our phisical space we have
    produced and curated a series of all inclusive programs and art events
    complete with full installations made and produced by our membership.
  implement: "We currently work out of a 5,000 sq ft space that is permitted for offices. To implement our idea, we would build more ADA accessible restrooms, change the permits for the space use to performance art space and offices. We will also be able to hire a permitting consultant and make small aesthetic changes to the space to make it more suitable for different audiences and community members. \r\n\r\nWe currently hold open workdays, yoga, craft nights, workshops, readings and other activities to promote community empowerment as well as low-income workspace and studio space but no event is quite as powerful the ones we became known for that fully immersed audiences in music and interactive art. Our events not only give Angelenos a chance to create something completely of its own but it allows the public to open their minds to what they too could accomplish. Our open platform gives the opportunity to people who may not think of themselves as artistically inclined to work in a group and create something much bigger than themselves while mixing art and music in a nontraditional way for Los Angeles. \r\n\r\nThis also gives us the chance to fund new programs proposed by the public and our membership through small investments and give the guidance they need to become self sufficient and create entrepreneurs."
  impact_create: "Our aim is to become a neighborhood cultural institution by focusing on education and accessibility to LA contemporary artists. By empowering our base through meetings where members get to decide the direction of projects, we are creating community building experiences and building generations of community leaders.\r\n\r\nAllowing people to take agency and ownership over space has proven to create stronger ties in a community through our experience. Our goal is to give that opportunity to as many people as will take it. By giving people the tools and space to empower each other, more projects and ideas are bound to find root. "
  who_benefit: "Our project benefits mainly the downtown and surrounding areas but our aim is to be a haven for all of Los Angeles county. Our membership takes part in different installations and events all over the county as a group and individually so our reach is much further than our physical location. We are intent on working with multi-faceted groups of different economic levels and age ranges and purposefully offer a scale of events to reflect our goal. Primarily our target age range is 18-55 although we work to include younger and older audiences through different mediums. We are open to all and do not discriminate but a large percent of our  membership consists of strong women and encourage all women to take on leadership roles. \r\n"
  partners_collaboration: "Pasadena Arts Council is our fiscal sponsor who has 50 years of experience in the arts in Los Angeles. \r\n\r\nArts:Earth Partnership - AEP spends its time working with arts organizations to expand their mission to include sustainability and to harness the immense creativity, innovation and leadership within the cultural sector to help solve the issues around pollution, climate change and the preservation of our precious natural resources.

  evaluate: "We have quarterly performance reviews that we ask our patrons to complete as well as monthly public meetings where all input is welcome and encouraged. We collect most of our data through GoogleForms and Survey Monkey. We encourage honest feedback to properly re-calibrate our operations and are always looking to improve. \r\n"
  two_lessons: "1. Developing a creative economy while building community amongst artist and musician can be very challenging and rewarding. In providing a space for the community to actively participate in alternative music and art we have seen first hand the collective spirit that enables the community to be the change they want to see happen and have a decisive voice in their future. \r\n\r\n2. There's a definite need for physical space. Being able to provide space for groups to meet and collaborate has blossomed new friendships, business relationships and brought different communities together. The L.A. Fort is a canvas for the people who involve themselves and has given thousands of people exposure to different groups outside of what they’ve known. It’s also given artists and musicians a space to refine their craft, learn new skills and grow, contrasting with each other. It’s allowed people to find other people they work well with and collaborate outside of our space while still using The L.A. Fort as a home base. \r\n"
  achievable_goal: "We are a very hard working team. Our space is almost unrecognizable from when we moved in a little over a year and a half ago. Up until now, we have been totally self sufficient relying on the willingness of our community for material, financial, and time donations. We have already done the majority of the leg work, most important of which, creating a positive reputation. With the proper funding it would not take us long to reach our desired goal. \r\n"
  major_challenges: "1. The biggest barrier we face is the lack of funds to implement all of our ideas. We have a very strong team full of ambition and unique dreams that want to succeed and build new ways to participate in the music and arts in Los Angeles while creating creative economy and developing social and cultural awareness.  \r\n\r\n2.Permits can be a difficult process in Los Angeles but with our funding, we will be able to hire a permitting consultant to make sure that we are abiding by California law and can move forward successfully. \r\n"
  competition: "Think Tank Gallery in downtown Los Angeles is an arts cooperative that hosts alternative art and music events and includes live/work spaces. Another similar space is ArtShareLA which is a sanctuary for the arts in downtown LA that hosts community events and has live/work space. \r\n\r\nThe main difference between these two spaces and The L.A. Fort  is the amount of agency we give to the public and our membership. There are no walls between those who run the Fort and those who are involved. Our structure is set up to allow people to become as involved as they want to be from just attending programs, all the way to running programs and administration while continuing to maintain our integrity and strong image. Although we are able to name similar organizations, we differ in our organizational structures in order to empower and create a strong base for the creative community to grow. \r\n"
  cost: "We will utilize all $100,000 for update and installing four (4) unisex ADA compliant bathrooms and file a lot change with the city. We will also update all of our electricity and lighting for green efficiency along with our Sound Reinforcement & Lighting System in our theater and performance space.In addition we will update our air conditioning, concrete floor and bring new opportunities to our programs.\r\nIf any additional costs accrue, we will continue to pursue state, city and federal grants as well as seek private donors and investors.\r\n"
  budget: "$40,000 - (4) unisex ADA compliant bathrooms\r\n$30,000 - LOT change of use with the city of Los Angeles, from storage to community center \r\n$10,000 -Updating Sound Reinforcement and lighting system\r\n$5,000 - Updating our electricity and house lighting for green efficiency \r\n$5,000 - Update our concrete floor \r\n$5,000 - Upgrading our air conditioner unit in install ducting throughout the building \r\n$5,000 - Creating entrepreneurial opportunities through our programming, enabling our members to empl"

  impact_metrics: "As a young and emerging arts center, we have already directly and indirectly created jobs between members, other organizations and directly through The L.A. Fort itself. We always encourage and support the growth of other spaces as well.\r\nThe L.A. Fort is a space to learn from each other as well as teach each other. Through our time bank, we are able to value members skills and time as assets. This allows us to involve people of different education levels with validity."
Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  We currently work out of a 5,000 sq ft space that is permitted for offices. To
  implement our idea, we would build more ADA accessible restrooms, change the
  permits for the space use to performance art space and offices. We will also
  be able to hire a permitting consultant and make small aesthetic changes to
  the space to make it more suitable for different audiences and community
  members. 
   
   We currently hold open workdays, yoga, craft nights, workshops, readings and other activities to promote community empowerment as well as low-income workspace and studio space but no event is quite as powerful the ones we became known for that fully immersed audiences in music and interactive art. Our events not only give Angelenos a chance to create something completely of its own but it allows the public to open their minds to what they too could accomplish. Our open platform gives the opportunity to people who may not think of themselves as artistically inclined to work in a group and create something much bigger than themselves while mixing art and music in a nontraditional way for Los Angeles. 
   
   This also gives us the chance to fund new programs proposed by the public and our membership through small investments and give the guidance they need to become self sufficient and create entrepreneurs.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Our aim is to become a neighborhood cultural institution by focusing on
  education and accessibility to LA contemporary artists. By empowering our base
  through meetings where members get to decide the direction of projects, we are
  creating community building experiences and building generations of community
  leaders.
   
   Allowing people to take agency and ownership over space has proven to create stronger ties in a community through our experience. Our goal is to give that opportunity to as many people as will take it. By giving people the tools and space to empower each other, more projects and ideas are bound to find root.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Our project benefits mainly the downtown and surrounding areas but our aim is
  to be a haven for all of Los Angeles county. Our membership takes part in
  different installations and events all over the county as a group and
  individually so our reach is much further than our physical location. We are
  intent on working with multi-faceted groups of different economic levels and
  age ranges and purposefully offer a scale of events to reflect our goal.
  Primarily our target age range is 18-55 although we work to include younger
  and older audiences through different mediums. We are open to all and do not
  discriminate but a large percent of our membership consists of strong women
  and encourage all women to take on leadership roles.

    answer: "As a young and emerging arts center, we have already directly and indirectly created jobs between members, other organizations and directly through The L.A. Fort itself. We always encourage and support the growth of other spaces as well.\r\nThe L.A. Fort is a space to learn from each other as well as teach each other. Through our time bank, we are able to value members skills and time as assets. This allows us to involve people of different education levels with validity."

    answer: "1. Developing a creative economy while building community amongst artist and musician can be very challenging and rewarding. In providing a space for the community to actively participate in alternative music and art we have seen first hand the collective spirit that enables the community to be the change they want to see happen and have a decisive voice in their future. \r\n\r\n2. There's a definite need for physical space. Being able to provide space for groups to meet and collaborate has blossomed new friendships, business relationships and brought different communities together. The L.A. Fort is a canvas for the people who involve themselves and has given thousands of people exposure to different groups outside of what they’ve known. It’s also given artists and musicians a space to refine their craft, learn new skills and grow, contrasting with each other. It’s allowed people to find other people they work well with and collaborate outside of our space while still using The L.A. Fort as a home base. \r\n"

    answer: "We are a very hard working team. Our space is almost unrecognizable from when we moved in a little over a year and a half ago. Up until now, we have been totally self sufficient relying on the willingness of our community for material, financial, and time donations. We have already done the majority of the leg work, most important of which, creating a positive reputation. With the proper funding it would not take us long to reach our desired goal. \r\n"

    answer: "Think Tank Gallery in downtown Los Angeles is an arts cooperative that hosts alternative art and music events and includes live/work spaces. Another similar space is ArtShareLA which is a sanctuary for the arts in downtown LA that hosts community events and has live/work space. \r\n\r\nThe main difference between these two spaces and The L.A. Fort  is the amount of agency we give to the public and our membership. There are no walls between those who run the Fort and those who are involved. Our structure is set up to allow people to become as involved as they want to be from just attending programs, all the way to running programs and administration while continuing to maintain our integrity and strong image. Although we are able to name similar organizations, we differ in our organizational structures in order to empower and create a strong base for the creative community to grow. \r\n"
