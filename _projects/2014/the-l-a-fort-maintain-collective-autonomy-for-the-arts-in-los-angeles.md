Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  We currently work out of a 5,000 sq ft space that is permitted for offices. To
  implement our idea, we would build more ADA accessible restrooms, change the
  permits for the space use to performance art space and offices. We will also
  be able to hire a permitting consultant and make small aesthetic changes to
  the space to make it more suitable for different audiences and community
  members. 
   
   We currently hold open workdays, yoga, craft nights, workshops, readings and other activities to promote community empowerment as well as low-income workspace and studio space but no event is quite as powerful the ones we became known for that fully immersed audiences in music and interactive art. Our events not only give Angelenos a chance to create something completely of its own but it allows the public to open their minds to what they too could accomplish. Our open platform gives the opportunity to people who may not think of themselves as artistically inclined to work in a group and create something much bigger than themselves while mixing art and music in a nontraditional way for Los Angeles. 
   
   This also gives us the chance to fund new programs proposed by the public and our membership through small investments and give the guidance they need to become self sufficient and create entrepreneurs.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Our aim is to become a neighborhood cultural institution by focusing on
  education and accessibility to LA contemporary artists. By empowering our base
  through meetings where members get to decide the direction of projects, we are
  creating community building experiences and building generations of community
  leaders.
   
   Allowing people to take agency and ownership over space has proven to create stronger ties in a community through our experience. Our goal is to give that opportunity to as many people as will take it. By giving people the tools and space to empower each other, more projects and ideas are bound to find root.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Our project benefits mainly the downtown and surrounding areas but our aim is
  to be a haven for all of Los Angeles county. Our membership takes part in
  different installations and events all over the county as a group and
  individually so our reach is much further than our physical location. We are
  intent on working with multi-faceted groups of different economic levels and
  age ranges and purposefully offer a scale of events to reflect our goal.
  Primarily our target age range is 18-55 although we work to include younger
  and older audiences through different mediums. We are open to all and do not
  discriminate but a large percent of our membership consists of strong women
  and encourage all women to take on leadership roles.
