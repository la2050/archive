Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  RUN4YOURLIFE - 10K Walk/Run where you get paid to participate. Mobile app
  registration, start training, complete the event and get paid.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  RUN FOR YOUR LIF will host a 10K event to get LA moving! We believe that if
  people start to exercise, they will want to continue. So by signing up via a
  mobile app, training everyday for a minimum of a month - all documented via
  the app, then come to the final event day, walk/run 10K and get a check!
   
   We truly believe and have seen it happen that if you start to work out, you will start to eat right and you will feel better, and want to continue this healthy lifestyle. The first event of it's kind, LA will be the leader in taking action against fighting obesity. Parents will engager the kids, who will get paid too! What a great way to teach kids the importance of being active. 
   
   Event will end with a Health fair and celebration!
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  You kidding me? This is a no brainer! This event will without a doubt make LA
  one of the healthiest places to live. We will actually be doing something to
  get people to MOVE and be active - literally for their life. The city is so
  focused on automobile transportation. If we get people to feel better just by
  walking some where (to train for the RUN FOR YOUR LIFE 10K) then we have made
  a step in the right direction. 
   
   Research shows that the hardest part about getting in shape is starting to work out. So by giving people an incentive to work out, we are getting them to take that first step. 
   
   LA will be taking the first step in the country to believe that we MUST change the way we live our lives … we will be the first city to really make a culture change … to MOVE.
   
   Each year we can do the event, making cash prizes larger. More and more people will sign up. By 2050, we will have a city that is all about being active, exercising and eating healthy. This will lead to the change of other cultures in the city such as increased ride sharing, using public transportation more, hopefully we will have a Bike Share Transit system that will be in use by then) in short, LA will have become a health (no smog) active city that everyone will want to live in!
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  The people of LA. Anyone who wants to take action and has wended to improve
  their health but never had a reason to. This will benefit the mom in South
  Central and her kids, the man in Santa Monica who wants to run but just has
  not found the time to start, the grandma who wants to start exercising and now
  is being asked by her grandson to do it with her.
   
   EVERYONE!
   
   We will come together as a city and community! Rich, poor, young, old, black, white, we are LA. and LA MOVES - RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  We will need to work with a mobil app company to create the app for this
  event. We will also work with an organization who has put on large walk/runs
  for LA.
   
   These have not bee secured but we are in the process now of getting them.
