    According to Bonnie L. Vorenberg, President of ArtAge and a nationally
    recognized expert in senior theatre, and according to AARP, senior theatre
    is one of the fastest-growing recreation and culture trends in the country. 
    Los Angeles stands to benefit from this growing trend with the niche
    entertainment that Senior Star Power offers. The city is already actively
    involved in supporting theatre venues as a key component in all arts- and
    culture-promotion projects with a special emphasis on Hollywood and the
    downtown Broadway areas. It was noted recently that Los Angeles saw a
    record-breaking 42.1 million visitors in 2013, a factor which will drive
    city investment in tourism in years to come.  With the influx of new and
    innovative creative theatre, LA can reach the 50 million+ visitors goal. A
    case in point: In 2012, Branson, Missouri welcomed over 7.3 million
    visitors.  Tourism is the Branson/Lakes Area's chief industry, with an
    estimated $2.9 billion in tourism-related spending in 2012. Average age of
    visitors was 58 years. 79% of activities participated in were shows.  Senior
    Star Power can bring these tourists and their spending power to Los Angeles.
  who_benefit: >-
    Senior Star Power's project will directly benefit the aging population of
    60+ years and indirectly benefit the entire Los Angeles community. There’s
    no doubt that all of these aging adults wish to keep active and vital. Along
    with this wish, comes, for many in Los Angeles, a strong interest in
    activities structured around entertainment and performing arts, especially
    theatre.  Senior citizens now account for 20 of every 100 adults of working
    age in the greater Los Angeles area, and by 2034, that number will reach 36
    of every 100 adults. That’s a gain of nearly 1 million senior citizens in
    the area.  By 2050 it is projected that the number will be 50 of every 100
    adults.

    This project is a logical extension of our mission to empower the aging
    population to manage their own health, stay active, and lead more fulfilling
    lives. Our goal is to obtain a safe and workable environment where we can
    provide year-round theatre arts programming including audience-pleasing
    musical and theatre productions, workshops, and classes that benefit all
    communities. We know that theatre brings together many arts experiences that
    offer health and social benefits. For example, there’s acting (imagination),
    dancing (physical movement), singing (memory), and music (relationships).
    Important too, is the fact that these experiences enrich the soul, stimulate
    the mind, and promote wellness and social participation in Los Angeles.
  implement: >-
    We will solicit sponsorships from corporations, use social media and
    YouTube, fundraising events and programs, submit grant applications, stay in
    the public eye through publicity, community outreach, motivational seminars,
    workshops with community partners, enlisting celebrity seniors in our
    mission, engage the officials of the city of Los Angeles.

    that will encourage visitors to stay multiple days in the city.

  evaluate: "1. Sold out performances\r\n2. Number of tours generated\r\n3. Overwhelming response of attendees to workshops and classes\r\n4. The number of seniors inspired to live longer and healthier lives.\r\n5. Number of senior rejuvenating their careers and reinventing their lives.\r\n6. Number of businesses in proximity to the Senior Theatrical Arts & Cultural Complex energized and flourishing"
  two_lessons: "1.  Evidence that the aging population is increasing at a fast rate and requires more services directed to their tastes and needs.  There is no theatrical complex in Los Angeles dedicated to this mission.\r\n\r\n2. The fact that this increasing population is living longer means that there is a more urgent need for a facility that inspires and motivates like Senior Star Power's Senior Theatrical Arts & Cultural Complex."
  achievable_goal: >-
    Senior Star Power has a track record of 3 sold out musical productions as a
    for profit company.  Senior Star Power produced 2 sold out musical
    productions under our 501(c)(3) nonprofit.  These 5 productions we all
    performed in different rentals theatres.  Our first goal is to acquire a
    donated facility for the 2015 production and our workshops.  We have all our
    teachers in place and the production team in place.
  major_challenges: "1. Acquiring the necessary funding and facility to proceed.\r\n\r\n2. Making people aware of the aging population's need to be kept active and engaged in community and wellness."
  competition: >-
    No.  Senior Star Power is the only company dedicated to engage, inspire, and
    enrich the health and wellness of seniors through entertainment and the
    theatre arts.
  cost: "Theatrical Production Budget (Estimated) - $125,000.00 - Estimate is based on 99-seat donated theatre facility. \r\nClasses/Workshop Budget (Estimated) - $3,250.00\r\n\r\nSenior Star Power would raise the extra $28,250 needed via fund raising events, pre-ticket sales, donations and sponsorships\r\n"
  budget: "Theatrical Production Budget\t      $125,000.00 \r\nBased on 99 seat donated theatre - income & budget increase according to venue size.  This includes a director, musical director, writer, choreographer, set designer, lighting designer, sound designer, costume designer, stage manager and actors.\t\r\n\t\r\nWorkshop Budget - Based on 3 workshops - 6 weeks each\t\r\nFacility Rental\t                            $450.00 \r\nTeachers\t                                         $1,800.00 \r\nTotal workshops                             $3,250.00\r\n\r\n"
