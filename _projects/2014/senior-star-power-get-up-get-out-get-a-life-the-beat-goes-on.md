Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  We will solicit sponsorships from corporations, use social media and YouTube,
  fundraising events and programs, submit grant applications, stay in the public
  eye through publicity, community outreach, motivational seminars, workshops
  with community partners, enlisting celebrity seniors in our mission, engage
  the officials of the city of Los Angeles.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  According to Bonnie L. Vorenberg, President of ArtAge and a nationally
  recognized expert in senior theatre, and according to AARP, senior theatre is
  one of the fastest-growing recreation and culture trends in the country. Los
  Angeles stands to benefit from this growing trend with the niche entertainment
  that Senior Star Power offers. The city is already actively involved in
  supporting theatre venues as a key component in all arts- and
  culture-promotion projects with a special emphasis on Hollywood and the
  downtown Broadway areas. It was noted recently that Los Angeles saw a
  record-breaking 42.1 million visitors in 2013, a factor which will drive city
  investment in tourism in years to come. With the influx of new and innovative
  creative theatre, LA can reach the 50 million+ visitors goal. A case in point:
  In 2012, Branson, Missouri welcomed over 7.3 million visitors. Tourism is the
  Branson/Lakes Area's chief industry, with an estimated $2.9 billion in
  tourism-related spending in 2012. Average age of visitors was 58 years. 79% of
  activities participated in were shows. Senior Star Power can bring these
  tourists and their spending power to Los Angeles.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Senior Star Power's project will directly benefit the aging population of 60+
  years and indirectly benefit the entire Los Angeles community. There’s no
  doubt that all of these aging adults wish to keep active and vital. Along with
  this wish, comes, for many in Los Angeles, a strong interest in activities
  structured around entertainment and performing arts, especially theatre.
  Senior citizens now account for 20 of every 100 adults of working age in the
  greater Los Angeles area, and by 2034, that number will reach 36 of every 100
  adults. That’s a gain of nearly 1 million senior citizens in the area. By 2050
  it is projected that the number will be 50 of every 100 adults.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  We will engage all government, civic, education, nonprofit, and faith-based
  organizations to participate in our activities. We will also work with local
  travel and hospitality businesses to develop tourist packages including
  lodging, bus tours, dining, shopping, and other entertainment attractions that
  will encourage visitors to stay multiple days in the city.

    This project is a logical extension of our mission to empower the aging
    population to manage their own health, stay active, and lead more fulfilling
    lives. Our goal is to obtain a safe and workable environment where we can
    provide year-round theatre arts programming including audience-pleasing
    musical and theatre productions, workshops, and classes that benefit all
    communities. We know that theatre brings together many arts experiences that
    offer health and social benefits. For example, there’s acting (imagination),
    dancing (physical movement), singing (memory), and music (relationships).
    Important too, is the fact that these experiences enrich the soul, stimulate
    the mind, and promote wellness and social participation in Los Angeles.

  evaluate: "1. Sold out performances\r\n2. Number of tours generated\r\n3. Overwhelming response of attendees to workshops and classes\r\n4. The number of seniors inspired to live longer and healthier lives.\r\n5. Number of senior rejuvenating their careers and reinventing their lives.\r\n6. Number of businesses in proximity to the Senior Theatrical Arts & Cultural Complex energized and flourishing"
  two_lessons: "1.  Evidence that the aging population is increasing at a fast rate and requires more services directed to their tastes and needs.  There is no theatrical complex in Los Angeles dedicated to this mission.\r\n\r\n2. The fact that this increasing population is living longer means that there is a more urgent need for a facility that inspires and motivates like Senior Star Power's Senior Theatrical Arts & Cultural Complex."
  achievable_goal: >-
    Senior Star Power has a track record of 3 sold out musical productions as a
    for profit company.  Senior Star Power produced 2 sold out musical
    productions under our 501(c)(3) nonprofit.  These 5 productions we all
    performed in different rentals theatres.  Our first goal is to acquire a
    donated facility for the 2015 production and our workshops.  We have all our
    teachers in place and the production team in place.
  major_challenges: "1. Acquiring the necessary funding and facility to proceed.\r\n\r\n2. Making people aware of the aging population's need to be kept active and engaged in community and wellness."
  competition: >-
    No.  Senior Star Power is the only company dedicated to engage, inspire, and
    enrich the health and wellness of seniors through entertainment and the
    theatre arts.
  cost: "Theatrical Production Budget (Estimated) - $125,000.00 - Estimate is based on 99-seat donated theatre facility. \r\nClasses/Workshop Budget (Estimated) - $3,250.00\r\n\r\nSenior Star Power would raise the extra $28,250 needed via fund raising events, pre-ticket sales, donations and sponsorships\r\n"
  budget: "Theatrical Production Budget\t      $125,000.00 \r\nBased on 99 seat donated theatre - income & budget increase according to venue size.
