Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  MECAY will provide kids with hands-on learning experiences that will open
  their minds to the Middle East and North Africa. We will serve Kindergarten
  through High School. Elementary students will greatly benefit from programs of
  this nature and it is necessary to cultivate this understanding at early
  stages of child development. This will also gain the interest of a larger
  number of educators and families.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  The Los Angeles public school system is in dire need of this program.
  Inadequate resources and information to educate youth on the culture and the
  history of the Middle East serve to perpetuate a cycle of misunderstanding
  that is a key component of many of the problems that America and the world at
  large face today.
   
   The contemporary Arab and Muslim world is generally associated with the selective images of war, terrorism or oil fields. The majority of Los Angeles youth grow up with negative, and often false, images and stereotypes of Arabs/Muslims. These stereotypes are perpetuated through films and television, creating an environment of distrust towards Middle Eastern American communities. After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 Los Angeles County experienced a fifteen-fold increase in anti-Arab/Muslim hate crimes. Racial profiling and acts of violence are generally perpetrated by individuals ignorant of Arab and Muslim heritage, who often mistake other Americans for Middle Easterners (ie Sikh community).
   
   In order to promote a deeper understanding of the Middle Eastern American community, schools need to educate youth on the positive cultural contributions people from the Middle East bring to the world. In order for harmful negative stereotypes to be eradicated, Middle Easterners themselves need to take initiative, but also Americans need to see the world situation with clear and educated eyes in order to not perpetuate an endless cycle of distrust. Education is the key.
   
   The Arab/Middle East is in fact a diverse region that includes for example Iranian Bahais, Palestinian Christians and Arab Jews, along with a wide range of other minority communities.The greater Middle East isa complex quilt of cultures and ethnicities (Berbers, Kurds, Armenians, Assyrians, Chaldeans, Druze etc.), each with a unique history and contribution to the host society.
   
   
   Through our programs, this mosaic quilt will be unfolded for Los Angeles youth through face-to-face encounters with guest speakers/performers from the region and hands-on workshops and classes.
   
   The wars and occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan have sparked a public interest
   in the Middle East, prompting more questions about Arabs and the Muslim world. Building bridges between disparate communities is an essential component of harvesting understanding in Los Angeles. The development of cultural enrichment programs like MECAY is necessary for today’s youth.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: 'UP to 10,000 K-12 youth and their parents in Los Angeles County.'
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  We will partner with multiple community organizations, such as Muslims for
  Progressive Values, and the Craft and Folk Art Museum, as well as LAUSD.
