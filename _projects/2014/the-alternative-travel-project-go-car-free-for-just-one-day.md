  The Alternative Travel Project encourages people to volunteer days outside the
  bubble of their cars & find new ways to travel. 
   We believe that the steps an individual takes toward alternative travel, even for a single day, can have local, regional & global impact. While cars are often a necessary part of our modern existence, they don't have to be a part of our every day.
   Our project involves an awareness campaign & surveys of the attitudes and users of ‘alternative’ methods of travel in LA. We will collaborate with CicLAvia during 3 events, and feedback our results through videos and an app developed to track ATPers activity. 
   The future we envision for 2050 is for LA to be a city where car-free travel is the norm, not the exception.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  During 3 CicLAvia events we will share information on the Alternative Travel
  options that are available across Los Angeles. We will survey participants on
  their awareness of car-free travel to gauge the level of consciousness amongst
  the city’s residents. 
   
   By taking a baseline survey at the December 2014 CicLAvia event, and repeating the process at the March & May 2015 events, we can measure the impact of our efforts with a group of Angelenos who are likely to have a fairly high perception & positive view towards Alternative Travel. 
   
   We will also undertake two surveys within the Arts District, as part of a neighborhood pilot where transit connections are being improved, and redevelopment in housing and business is growing. This area is a great example of a neighborhood where the walkability is high, access to transit is good and there are plans to improve it even further. 
   
   We will speak with residents and local businesses twice during the course of the year; using results from these surveys as a comparison to the information collected during CicLAvia – where the majority of individuals already somewhat embrace ATP. 
   
   In response to our awareness campaign, we hope to gather stories highlighting the positive impact of an ATP lifestyle, and find out if, over the course of the year, more participants choose to take the Open Streets model into their everyday lives. 
   
   Can we encourage the ‘CicLAvia only’ cyclist/walker/metro user to replicate a multi-modal lifestyle for some everyday journeys? 
   
   Alongside data collection, we will expand the information provided on our website, & produce two new videos to encourage and inspire ATP action within Los Angeles, & around the world. We will also develop a smartphone app for participants to track their ATP mileage – allowing us to build a regional & global view of our impact in terms of CO2 saved, miles traveled and calories burned. This information will feed into a page on our website to be shared worldwide.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Traveling car-free for just ONE day, will bring people into closer contact
  with all that the city has to offer. It will increase foot and bike traffic to
  the local community and create an opportunity to discover new people and
  places. By bringing people face to face with their neighbors and local
  businesses, they are more likely to frequent the walkable area surrounding
  their homes and choose to invest more in their own community. Alternative
  Travel also brings a sense of togetherness and connection with fellow
  passengers. Where drivers only see those around them as traffic and a source
  of stress, travel by public transit, walking & cycling humanizes the journey
  and our fellow citizens. 
   
   Los Angeles is filled with distinctive challenges when it comes to travel, and is known as ‘car-centric’ and for its ‘horrific traffic.’ 
   ATP plans a different future perception of the city. By encouraging a culture shift in how we travel in LA and working with mainstream media and the raconteurs of our city to export this lifestyle, we can create a new, more positive LA story. 
   
   Today’s reality is that huge improvements in infrastructure have been made in recent years, but despite this vast change in the availability of public transportation, so many residents are still unaware of the possibilities on their own doorstep. ATP will make car-free travel in LA ‘hip’, it will help to break down the stigma attached to taking the bus and highlight the benefits of leaving the car at home. 
   
   By shifting people’s attitude to car-free travel, demand will naturally rise, and in turn this will lead to higher frequency services, a safer system, and quicker journeys
   
   Through our website, videos and social media, we will provide information on the news and services of agencies and non-profits working to improve travel infrastructure. ATP will be a one-stop-shop for information on all car-free travel in Los Angeles and inspire our community to get involved in shaping the future of the city and how we move.
   
   Let’s experiment by going car-free for just one day in 2014; let’s empower the citizens of Los Angeles in 2050 to embrace car-free living as a rule, rather than an exception.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Our project will benefit Angelenos who are unaware or nervous about the
  opportunities for walking, cycling or taking transit in their city. It will
  also benefit the County of Los Angeles in attracting new talent amongst the
  millennial generation who place a high value on transit availability.
   
   According to a Transport for America study: 54% of millennials surveyed say they would consider moving to another city if it had more and better options for getting around, and 66% say that access to high quality transportation is one of the top three criteria in considering deciding where to live next. "This survey reinforces that cities that don't invest in effective transportation options stand to lose out in the long-run," says Michael Myers, a managing director at The Rockefeller Foundation. 
   
   We don’t want LA to lose out by 2050!
   
   Our project will also benefit LADOT, Metro and their current users, by providing a positive, vibrant and exciting perspective on commuting by transit. We will work with the agencies to break down the stigma associated with transit in LA & empower their customers to appreciate their contribution to improving air quality, road traffic, social cohesion, and their own health.
   
   By providing a fun, fresh and engaging view of LA’s ATP options, we aim to create new customers for transit, walking and cycling, and a platform to receive feedback on how the service works for those leaving their cars at home for the first time. 
   
   Despite its reputation as a car-centric city, 80% of LA County residents live within walking/biking distance (3 miles) of the frequent transit system, and the LA County MTA carries over 1.46 million passengers per day – the second highest in the country after New York City! This fact is a huge surprise to most locals and we want to help to change that by bringing more people to public transit options.
   
   As we learn more about the motivations to embrace or avoid alternative travel across Los Angeles, we can begin to further understand how the infrastructure can better service its customers and increase its value to the population of LA.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  Collaboration with like-minded organizations is integral to ATP. Much of the
  information we share with our supporters includes best practice examples,
  opportunities for involvement in community campaigns, and notice of events
  being held by other organizations. 
   
   In addition, we have been able to meet and share ideas with a variety of partners; including CicLAvia, LA County Bicycle Coalition, the Mayor’s Office, Metro, LADOT, Safe Routes to School & LA Walks. 
   Collaboration with CicLAvia will include a physical presence at their events. CicLAvia will provide tent space at one of the hubs along their route, as well as promotion of our project. During these events we will invite Metro & LA DOT to share information on local transit options. 
   
   We will invite participants to join our community by volunteering car-free days between CicLAvia events & encourage supporters to share their stories, tips & triumphs with us via social media. 
   Collaboration with CicLAvia is confirmed, and we have worked with them at two previous events. CicLAvia benefits our project by bringing a huge audience, already familiar with Alternative Travel. Factors critical to the success of this collaboration are that we ensure enough volunteers to undertake the survey aspect, provide a welcoming booth to encourage people to visit us, and have a robust survey in place. We will ask participants to sign up to a mailing list so that we are able to follow up at a later date with the same group.
   Within our ‘ATP lifestyle’ neighborhood pilot area in the Arts District, we hope to work with local retailers, theHUB community of impact professionals, LA Clean Tech Incubator, GenesisLA & the Little Tokyo Services Center as well as the property developers creating new living spaces in the area. These collaborations are not confirmed, but we are in the process of introducing our project to these organizations. Success in the Arts District relies upon listening to what is important to the local people and understanding how ATP can benefit their neighborhood.
   To carry out these surveys we would like to collaborate with the Luskin School of Public Affairs at UCLA – their Institute for Transportation Studies would be a huge asset in assisting us with survey work & data analysis. This collaboration is not yet confirmed, though our collaborator CicLAvia is already working with the Luskin School & other UCLA researchers on several related projects, making this a natural partnership with the school.
