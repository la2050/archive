Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Specific site selection for the sculpture locations will be coordinated with
  District 9 representatives and local leaders in small groups at face to face
  meetings. An initial site will be based on visibility, site suitability, and
  safety. The potential sculpture themes will be developed by Conant-Moran
  Design and Fabrication. The Sculptures will be designed, fabricated and
  installed by Conant-Moran Inc.. The themes for the sculptures will be
  contemporary and will be readily recognized as things the community
  recognizes. Potential sculptures include Nintendo controller, Etch-a-sketch,
  Lego Man, Jacks, Light Bright, Tetris and similar ideas. The sculpture are
  approximately 10 times actual size. Implementation is not complex. The
  decisions needed are straight forward. Fabrication of the metal structures is
  a one person job. It is important that this application does not imply more
  complexity than there will be.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Presently, there is an obvious lack of public art and likewise lack of
  appreciation of art. The grantee has experimented with placement of artistic
  pieces in public areas and has noted the inquisitiveness, attention, and
  curiosity of those who live and work in the neighborhood. Revitalization of a
  neighborhood must include instilling or creating pride in the neighborhood.
  The sculpture pieces are intended to be the focal point of neighborhood pride.
  The sculptures are intended as a seed for the future. Any change in the
  culture of a community is preceded by a change in the environment. A piece of
  art occupying a small space can have a big role in changing perspectives of
  individuals who otherwise may not have their artistic inquisitiveness piqued.
  Whether someone is walking by, riding by in a personal vehicle or mass
  transit, or on a bike or skate board, a glance which captures an art piece can
  transform thoughts from day to day concerns to "what if". The sculptures are
  being presented as a first step and not an end-all. We cannot pretend to
  predict the future, but we can guide the change by contributing positive
  changed to the urban environment. Installing a simple piece of art on a street
  corner has changed one neighborhood at Broadway and 58th, and can be
  replicated to change more communities. Like the story of the person throwing
  small starfish into the ocean, small action, but it makes a big difference to
  the starfish.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The project is intended to benefit those who live and work in the community.
  The benefits are quality of life issues that are improved by positive changes
  to the environment. Those positively affected by the addition of art to the
  environment runs the gamut from old to young, male and female, business owner
  to the unemployed, rich and poor. Any positive change in the environment or
  culture directly or indirectly changes things for the good - for everyone.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  The collaborators for this project are local leaders and District 9 staff who
  will assist with site selection and the unveiling BBQ's. These collaborators
  are not specifically named. They will be contacted as sculpture projects are
  developed. The number of collaboration participants will be small because the
  primary beneficiaries live and work in the immediate neighborhood.
   
   1. Community Involvement
   2. Communication between parties
   3. Recognition of contributions
