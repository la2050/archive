    Six to ten metal sculptures will be placed in neighborhoods with the intent
    to enhance public spaces and introduce art into a culture that is otherwise
    barren of community-based art.  The unveiling will  BBQ be proceeded by a
    Community BBQ and Family oriented entertainment.  The project illustrates
    that art can be a source of pride for the community  and will serve as a
    landmark for conversation and neighborhood identification. A pilot project
    has been initiated at 58th and Broadway where a Rubik's Cube metal sculpture
    has been installed. The public acceptance and positive reception has
    encouraged this application for funds. The fact that the sculpture has not
    been vandalized is testament to high public regard for the art.
  implement: >-
    Specific site selection for the sculpture locations will be coordinated with
    District 9 representatives and local leaders in small groups at face to face
    meetings.  An initial site will be based on visibility, site suitability,
    and safety.  The potential sculpture themes will be developed by
    Conant-Moran Design and Fabrication.  The Sculptures will be designed,
    fabricated and installed by Conant-Moran Inc.. The themes for the sculptures
    will be contemporary and will be readily recognized as things the community
    recognizes.  Potential sculptures include Nintendo controller,
    Etch-a-sketch, Lego Man, Jacks, Light Bright, Tetris and similar ideas.  The
    sculpture are approximately 10 times actual size.  Implementation is not
    complex.  The decisions needed are straight forward. Fabrication of the
    metal structures is a one person job.  It is important that this application
    does not imply more complexity than there will be. 
  impact_create: >-
    Presently, there is an obvious lack of public art and likewise lack of
    appreciation of art.  The grantee has experimented with placement of
    artistic pieces in public areas and has noted the inquisitiveness,
    attention, and curiosity of those who live and work in the neighborhood. 
    Revitalization of a neighborhood must include instilling or creating pride
    in the neighborhood.  The sculpture pieces are intended to be the focal
    point of neighborhood pride. The sculptures are intended as a seed for the
    future.  Any change in the culture of a community is preceded by a change in
    the environment. A piece of art occupying a small space can have a big role
    in changing perspectives of individuals who otherwise may not have their
    artistic inquisitiveness piqued. Whether someone is walking by, riding by in
    a personal vehicle or mass transit, or on a bike or skate board, a glance
    which captures an art piece can transform thoughts from day to day concerns
    to "what if".  The sculptures are being presented as a first step and not an
    end-all.  We cannot pretend to predict the future, but we can guide the
    change by contributing positive changed to the urban environment. 
    Installing a simple piece of art on a street corner has changed one
    neighborhood at Broadway and 58th, and can be replicated to change more
    communities.  Like the story of the person throwing small starfish into the
    ocean, small action, but it makes a big difference to the starfish.   
  who_benefit: >-
    The project is intended to benefit those who live and work in the
    community.  The benefits are quality of life issues that are improved by
    positive changes to the environment. Those positively affected by the
    addition of art to the environment runs the gamut from old to young, male
    and female, business owner to the unemployed, rich and poor.  Any positive
    change in the environment or culture directly or indirectly changes things
    for the good - for everyone.
