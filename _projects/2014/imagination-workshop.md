  The implementation strategy for the Ribbon Gardens proposal primarily revolves
  around two concurrent elements: 1) fostering community support and engagement
  and 2) design, installation and planting of the various Ribbon Garden
  elements. Element one is achievable through Global Green’s extensive expertise
  at capacity building and community planning combined with the neighborhood’s
  demonstrated interest in food access through the creation of its community
  garden. Element two is achievable as the planters have already been designed
  and a planting palette has been developed. Further, we have previously tested
  this concept at the block level in April 2014 in Oakland, California, and from
  this event, we are prepared for neighborhood-scale integration. The
  implementation of the Frogtown Ribbon Gardens proposal will include the
  following steps: refine designs and communication materials; begin community
  outreach; acquire construction and planting materials; build planter kits;
  host community installation event; evaluate progress and build capacity for
  expanding Ribbon Gardens network to other food deserts in Los Angeles. 
   
   Following an outreach effort to build a neighborhood coalition and leverage the strength of an existing community garden and the existing network of fruit trees distributed throughout Elysian Valley, the implementation strategy follows two paths. First, kits will be created for each planter that include lumber in pre-cut dimensions, fasteners, assembly and planting instructions so that all that is needed for assembly is a power drill. Global Green will host an installation event for community members and volunteers to assemble, install and plant these planters. The second strategy is the distribution of assembly and planting instructions in a booklet for residents to make their own planters. Each planter has been designed with ease of fabrication in mind, and as a result, all lumber cuts are either 90o or 45o, and can be performed free of charge at most hardware stores. The average parkway strip in Elysian Valley is 180 square feet, and with an average of 24 strips per block, there is nearly a basketball court’s worth of planting space each. Using a conservative .3 yield, roughly 1,300 pounds of fresh food per block per year can be produced; a significant contribution towards a healthier diet in a neighborhood lacking access to healthy foods, and assuming an average produce price of $2 per pound, a significant cost savings as well.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  The USDA has estimated that 23.5 million US residents live in food deserts-
  low-income areas where a significant share of residents is more than half a
  mile from the nearest market- and Los Angeles is home to many such pockets of
  limited food access. Elysian Valley is one of the most prominent of these food
  deserts, particularly due to its geography with the LA river to it’s east and
  south and 5 and 2 freeways to the north and west. As a result of this
  hemmed-in nature, ease of access to produce is particularly critical, and the
  Frogtown Ribbon Gardens proposal will help alleviate some of the pressures
  associated with living in a food desert while simultaneously advancing public
  discourse and engagement in a proactive, hands-on approach. Access to fresh
  and healthy food has been identified as one of the key indicators in many
  health issues in the American populace, and by empowering residents of Elysian
  Valley with the capacity to grow their own, the Frogtown Ribbon Gardens
  proposal continues already established community momentum in this vein.
   
   In addition to mitigating long-standing community food access issues in Elysian Valley, the Frogtown Ribbon Gardens serve as a neighborhood-scale pilot project for a readily implementable strategy to combat conditions found throughout Los Angeles' food deserts. The consciously designed and branded Ribbon Garden planter elements combined with the inherently community-driven nature of this effort will raise attention and advance conversation around this issue to foster complementary zoning and policy priorities by the City to further reduce the occurrence and effects of food deserts in LA. By the Fall of 2015, Los Angeles will have a neighborhood-scale pilot project demonstrating the viability of this approach. By 2050, the lessons learned from the project and the momentum gained through iterative adaptations in food deserts across the city will yield a robust network of community-driven food production and significant inroads made into the reduction of childhood obesity and other key indicators inherently tied to conditions found in food deserts.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The primary beneficiaries of this proposal are low-income households with
  limited access to fresh or healthy food in Northeast Los Angeles, specifically
  those in Elysian Valley. There is a real and demonstrated need for increased
  food access in many neighborhoods throughout Los Angeles County, and the
  Frogtown Ribbon Gardens provide a readily implementable, hands-on approach to
  mitigating the adverse health impacts associated with limited food options.
  This lack of access is underscored by the fact that Elysian Valley meets the
  USDA's criteria for a food desert - it is a low-income neighborhood where most
  of its residents live more than half a mile from the nearest market, a
  significant concern in this automobile dependent neighborhood. In addition to
  this USDA designation, as Los Angeles prepares its new Health and Wellness
  Element for the General Plan, the Planning Department has released data
  revealing that residents of Elysian Valley are in the lowest bracket for
  neighborhood food sources (9) and exhibits a childhood obesity rate of 28%.
  Elysian Valley’s childhood obesity rate is the key demographic indicator
  targeted for change by the Frogtown Ribbon Gardens. While this grant
  application seeks funds to support the research, production and installation
  of a Ribbon Garden network in Elysian Valley, the lessons learned as part of
  this pilot project will be applied to other communities in food deserts
  throughout Los Angeles. As a result, this means that while the initial impact
  of this proposal is primarily at the neighborhood scale, its long-term
  influence will be felt throughout Los Angeles. Secondary beneficiaries of the
  Ribbon Gardens proposal include visitors and residents of the neighborhood as
  the network of lush planters will help activate the streetscape and provide a
  more welcoming and lively public realm.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Three potential collaborators for this project- The Northeast LA Riverfront
  Collaborative, The Elysian Valley Community Garden and the Santa Monica
  Mountains Conservancy. The initial concept for the Frogtown Ribbon Gardens was
  developed as a competition entry for the Northeast LA Riverfront
  Collaborative. Our proposal won an Honorable Mention from competition judges
  and signals the viability of this proposal. Moving forward, we intend to
  connect with the Collaborative to gain their regional expertise and assistance
  with implementing the Ribbon Gardens approach in other food deserts in
  Northeast LA.
   
   The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy operates the Marsh Street Nature Park, Elysian Valley Gateway Park, Steelhead Park and Oso Park- three of which are situated against the western edge of the LA River in Elysian Valley. Connecting the Ribbon Gardens to these community assets and, in turn, to the river, will help solidify their presence as important fixtures in the community which both beautify the neighborhood and provide fresh, affordable and healthy food.
   Perhaps the most productive potential partners to collaborate with in Elysian Valley are the residents that in 2010 rallied together to promote access to healthy food, and established a .25-acre community garden at the intersection of Blake Avenue and Rich Street. This community driven effort simultaneously signals a desire for access to healthy produce and a demonstrated ability to self-organize to achieve this vision - two elements critical for the successful implementation of the Frogtown Ribbon Gardens proposal. The need and demand for fresh fruit and vegetables in Elysian Valley, however, far outstrips the production capacity of its community garden.We hope that by working in conjunction with this group, Global Green can leverage their community expertise and local gardening experience to see our mutual vision for increased food access in Elysian Valley to fruition. 
   
   While we have not worked directly with any of these groups in the past, we are confident that we can reach mutually beneficial partnerships with all three to combat the effects of food scarcity in Elysian Valley. Three factors critical to the success of these proposed collaborations are 1) ensuring collaboration, not competition, 2) identifying and pooling our mutual assets to develop the best implementation approach and 3) developing strategies to continue the Ribbon Gardens network beyond the LA2050 grant.
