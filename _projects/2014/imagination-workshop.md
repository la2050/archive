impact_metrics: "Imagination Workshop seeks to help psychiatric patients, homeless veterans, at-risk youth, and other disenfranchised individuals synthesize thoughts and feelings in the realm of metaphor through creating and portraying fictional characters far removed from themselves under the direction of specially-trained professional theatre artists.  We provide weekly hour-long sessions in which two or three IW theatre artists lead fifteen mental health patients in structured exercises, based on acting and playwriting training techniques, that lead the patients to create fictional characters far removed from themselves, improvise and write scenes and sometimes whole plays featuring those characters, and finally to embody those characters on stage, in a professionally mounted production, staged and designed by professional theater arts.Among the results of this experience for the patients are often improved social skills, enhanced performance in job interviews, and higher self-esteem, all buttressed by the accomplishment of writing and acting in a play.  Scientific studies at the UCLA Semel Institute have proven these results.  \r\n\r\nImagination Workshop currently serves psychiatric outpatients at the UCLA Semel Institute, seniors suffering from Alzheimer’s at the Virginia House in Sherman Oaks, and high school students with behavioral issues at Olympic High School in Santa Monica.  In the recent past we have served homeless veterans at New Directions and the Salvation Army at the VA in Westwood, aging veterans suffering PTSD at the California State Home for Veterans, and the criminally insane at Patton State Hospital in San Bernardino and Metropolitan Hospital in Norwalk.  \r\n"

more_detail: >-
  One hundred homeless veterans and veterans suffering PTSD have a series of 20
  weekly structured hour-long meetings (in groups of 15) where they are mentored
  by professional theater artists (actors, writers, directors) in the creation
  of four original theater works, which are then mounted professionally for the
  general public in Los Angeles professional theater venues, and are performed
  by the veterans and professional actors together, under the direction of a
  professional theater directer and produced by a professional theater producer.
implement: >-
  We train and supply the professional theater artists, and continue our 20 year
  relationship with services at the Veterans Administration such as New
  Directions, the Salvation Army, and the California State Home for Veterans, as
  well as other veteran homes and services all over Los Angeles in serving their
  clients (the veterans), but on a larger scale than before by supplying more
  artists in order to serve 100 vets.  We arrange for the meeting space, and
  then rent the theater spaces for performance
impact_live: >-
  Scientific testing at the UCLA Semel Institute has shown that among those who
  suffer mental illness, participation in Imagination Workshop's theater
  workshops for the mentally ill leads to a higher functioning, better life,
  which includes improved social skills, higher functioning in job interviews,
  the establishing of ego boundaries through the experience of creating and
  embodying fictional characters, better participation in groups and programs,
  and the ability to stay out of the hospital.  Our work with homeless veterans
  and those suffering PTSD in the past has been very successful and helped
  hundreds of vets live fuller lives.  By helping 100 Los Angeles veterans live
  healthier lives, we help La become the healthiest place to live today.  By
  creating a continuing program that reaches out and serves this many vets every
  year, we help make a heathy LA in 2050.
who_benefit: >-
  Our project will directly benefit 100 homeless veterans and veterans suffering
  PTSD, their families, and their community.  Through professional theater
  presentations, we will reach audiences of several hundred theater-goers and
  share with them the nature of our work and the needs of our veterans.
partners_collaboration: >-
  In 2012, IW, with a a grant from Metabolic Studio, led 20 weekly sessions at
  the Calvet Center with 40 senior vets and homeless vets from the California
  State Home for Veterans and the Salvation Army Veteran Home that resulted in
  an original theater production at the Odyssey theater, seen by 150 people. 
  From 2000 to 2010, IW ran a weekly group of homeless veterans at New
  Directions that resulted in three original theater productions at Theater
  Theater and The Greenway Theater.  All of these organizations have issued IW a
  standing invitation to work with their vets, but have not, of late, been able
  to fund our work.  With funding, IW is definitely invited to work with these
  organizations.
How will your project impact the LA2050 “Live” metrics?:
  - Rates of homelessness
  - Rates of mental illnesses
evaluate: "1.  Veterans participation in groups, the writing of an original script, and the public performance.\r\n\r\n2. Doing screenings of the veterans' participation in their programs (12 Step, New Directions, etc.)  in partnership with staff at New Directions, Calvet, and the Salvation Army, before after and during their participation with IW.\r\n\r\n3.  Follow up reports on the participating veterans' progress in job finding, self-care, sobriety (for 12 step veterans, and in controlling PTSD."
two_lessons: "1.  Everyone has the creative spark.  \r\n\r\n2. The experience of creating and performing original theater involves disciples that positively effect the happiness and fullness of life for the mentally ill."
achievable_goal: >-
  Weekly sessions with homeless and PTSD veterans could begin immediately at
  with Calvet, the Salvation Army, or New Directions, or at a rented space.  The
  connections with the veteran agencies are already established.  During six
  months of weekly sessions with our professionally trained theater artists, the
  scripts for the four theater works will be written by staff and clients
  together.  Each theater work will take two months of rehearsal, which can all
  be simultaneous.  The theater is a rental, and the publicity is a three month
  process.  IW has been creating original theater with the mentally ill for 45
  years.
major_challenges: "1.  Getting the veterans from the various agencies to meet together at one time is a difficult problem.  With this funding we could solve it by having several groups going that offer an array of meeting times.\r\n\r\n2. Scheduling a professional theater venue in LA with performance space available at the right time.  This is solved because IW has long-standing relationships with LA area theaters, and they do their best to accommodate us."
What resources does your project need?:
  - Money (financial capital)
  - Volunteers/staff (human capital)
  - Publicity/awareness (social capital)
