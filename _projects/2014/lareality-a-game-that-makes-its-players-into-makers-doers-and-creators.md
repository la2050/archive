Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Simply: we are expanding the scope of a proven project to benefit the entire
  city.
   
   Reality uses a simple card game mechanic to suggest creative projects – often those require collaborators who have their own cards and skills. It motivates the act of creating by arranging wonderful surprises for top players and other players who distinguish themselves in key ways. 
   
   Expanding the game to LA as a whole involves folding in more creative disciplines and re-balancing the game to play out over an entire city instead of just one college campus. Location also plays a big role in Reality – we encourage players to develop a curious mind and explore their surroundings and the larger cultural context of their city. We’d push this angle heavily in developing LAReality. 
   
   Community is also a big part of making the game successful. For our campus games, we built online communities and integrated the powerful social networks our players already used in ways that were engaging and sometimes challenging. Bringing the game to the city as a whole means a significant expansion of that infrastructure and the people to run it. 
   
   Rewards are also a big factor that motivates creation in the game. Doing exceptional work earns once-in-a-lifetime encounters with luminaries in their fields. In our campus game, top players found themselves unexpectedly meeting director John Singleton, touring the Museum of Jurassic Technology with game designer Jenova Chen, and being whisked to the Warner Lot in a limo to present their resumes to powerful executives. Significant effort from the game runners goes into securing these rewards, but they’re powerful motivators. 
   
   We’ll expand that to the broader creative community of Los Angeles. Imagine unexpectedly going on a culinary tour of K-town with Roy Choi, or meeting Shepard Fairey to scope the graffiti murals of LA. Enlisting the participation of powerful Los Angeles creators will make the project special and ensure a level of participation we’ve seen great results with so far. 
   
   We’re constantly adding new technologies and surprises to our game. Growing it to promote more times of creativity means we also need to expand our exhibition platforms. One of the things we love about LA is the incredible number of pop-up exhibition venues organized by small groups passionate about some aspect. Our plan to grow Reality to all of Los Angeles also involves linking these groups and working towards a common, amazing cultural explosion.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Creating is a habit. The game helps build those habits. It produces new
  creative work as a natural byproduct of trying to “win” the game. The effects
  will be immediate. Los Angeles, already known around the world as a place
  where creativity flourishes, will see a spike in new works. Since the game
  doesn’t own or seek to profit off what’s created for the game, the originators
  are free to pursue their ideas or interesting discoveries as far as they can
  imagine.
   
   Everyone sits on their couch at some point and talks about the thing they would make if they just had the time, or the money, or the motivation. We can’t help in a tangible way with time or money, but as practicing creatives, we’ve observed that when it matters, you MAKE time. We’ve seen Reality provably cause students who protest they’re too busy and too broke and too tapped to create not just short films, but entire transmedia shared universes linking dozens of projects across all mediums. We really truly think the game has the power to get more people off the couch and chasing their dreams.
   
   In 2050? Well, like we keep saying, creating is a habit – but it’s also like fitness. It hurts at first, but when you get in the habit, it becomes easier. You do a little every day and before you know it, it’s second nature. Los Angeles is suffering a little bit of a creative brain-drain as other cities have begun luring creatives away – but if we keep the city itself fertile for creativity by building not just a place, but a community of creators, Los Angeles of 2050 will be a hell of a place to make cool stuff.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  If you've always wanted to create something, the game is for you. If you live
  in this city because it's a mecca for talent, because it offers food and art
  and music and film and technological wonders you wouldn't find wherever it was
  you came from or would go to, then LAReality is also for you.
   
   We know you said to be specific, but the truth is it could benefit anyone. All you have to do is engage with it. Engage a little, engage a lot, it's designed to be as casual or all-consuming as you want to make creativity in your life. We think it's perfect for this initiative.
   
   One thing, though: 
   
   We place a high premium on inclusion. One thing we've prided ourselves on when developing Reality is smashing the completely toxic and baseless gates some like to erect on creating based on gender, race, creed, orientation, or other socioeconomic factors. 
   
   Obviously, we think the opposite is the case - there are voices out there being shut out by certain creative fields that need to be heard MORE and not less. This is a venue for those voices. So if you've ever felt trapped or boxed in or unheard - oh, we are most definitely for you.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Reality already has three years worth of inroads and good ties with the
  entertainment industry. If LAReality gets selected, we plan to expand to other
  creative professions. 
   
   From past experience, three crucial factors for participation from outside partners are:
   - be flexible to their schedules and life's demands
   - give them ownership over the experience and how they'd like it to play out
   - keep the experience small and intimate - this makes it special and doesn't turn it into a circus
