Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  MNMS currently has 20 school clubs in 4 states, most of which are based right
  here in Southern California. MNMS currently offers schools the opportunity to
  create MNMS School Clubs, host Inspire Empathy Keynotes, Leadership Days and
  Inspire Empathy Days to accomplish the goal of creating the next generation of
  “empathetic leaders.”
   
   With the support of LA2050, in 2014-2015 trained MNMS School Club Advisors will lead Inspire Empathy Days on school campuses, providing in-depth workshops that take students through the process of becoming a Changemaker. We believe that when youth talk to youth, they listen, so School Club Advisors and MNMS Founder 16-year-old Amit Dodani spend time training student leaders from within schools to take on leadership roles during the event. Students are exposed through interactive workshops and exercises to the skills of an empathetic leader: storytelling, teamwork, leadership and service.
   
   Inspire Empathy Days are supplemented by Leadership Training for School Club Leaders. What makes MNMS unique is that we provide an ongoing, student-driven vehicle to continue Inspiring Empathy on their campus and in their community. Each school club is provided with a Resource Guide and a School Club Advisor who is accessible for support year-round.
   
   MNMS’s goal is to provide the “Inspire Empathy Day” programming to as many schools as possible; however, not every school can afford the costs associated with the program. Financial support allows us to make this programming accessible to schools that may not otherwise have access to it.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  According to Bill Drayton of Ashoka “those that don’t master empathy, will be
  marginalized.” We believe that MNMS can create future leaders who understand
  the skills of an empathetic leader at a deeper level. They are able to work in
  diverse teams, lead purpose driven organizations, and mobilize their own
  communities to identify and solve problems that they are passionate about.
    
   What if by 2050 we could have thousands of these changemaker stories originate from LA? Imagine a world in which youth are inspired by other youth. These young Changemakers will not wait to be given a fish, but will identify ways to fish for themselves.
    
   The lack of empathy is the root cause for many of the issues faced by today’s youth, like peer harassment and a high dropout rate. Research shows that more often that not, anti-bullying programs are ineffective because most students are neither the bully nor the victim. Additionally, the word “bully” has been used so much that students and faculty are almost desensitized to its implications. MNMS believes bullying to be the symptom, not the cause. Our aim is to solve the problem, i.e. the lack of empathy, by engaging the entire student body, faculty, and administration, as well as the local community. In order to create connectivity and unity, we believe we have to create a culture of empathy.
    
   Along with the impact of inspiring empathy in the student body, the MNMS program solves significant problems faced by our schools: a lack of leadership opportunities, a lack of connectivity within the student body itself as well as between students and teachers, and the lack of a relationship between the school and the surrounding community.
    
   MNMS School Clubs solve these issues by providing leadership opportunities to students that may not fit into the existing hierarchy of student councils and volunteer groups. Students are given the tools to take initiative and pursue projects that use their own passions to benefit their school and local community. “In-school” projects connect students with other students, as well as with faculty and administration. Community projects connect students through book drives, care packages, etc. to the people around them.
    
   We envision a 2050 in which everyone is moved to be a Changemaker in his or her community. By mastering empathy, Angelenos will be empowered to engage with one another and succeed in a diverse world in which people from different backgrounds work together to succeed.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The Los Angles community, schools, faculty, students and families are some of
  beneficiaries of the MNMS programming. 
   
   The support from LA2050 would allow MNMS Inspire Empathy Day programming in 2014-2015 to reach 30 new schools that may not otherwise have been able to afford it. This will directly impact around 7,500 students in the LA area and the indirect impact will reach thousands of teachers, students and citizens in Southern California.
   
   Additionally, local communities are impacted by School Club activities such as book/food/toy drives, care packages, clean-ups, etc. and our social media network allows the story of every Inspire Empathy Day to reach hundreds of young people all over the country and world, highlighting the changemakers of Los Angeles.

How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: |-
  MNMS has learned from, worked with and supported organizations like:
   Ashoka
   Peace First 
   Teach for America
   KIPP LA
   CADA
   These organizations are thought leaders in various focuses like empathy, peacemaking and education. Each one of them has added tremendous value to MNMS.
   
   At MNMS we believe in the power of collaboration and engaging the entire community; we partner with specific institutions in LA to connect kids to people in their local communities. For example, MNMS book drives run by school clubs in LA have partnered with the UCLA Olive View Hospital, the Van Nuys Library, the Platt Library, KIPP LA and other organizations and community centers to bring books to people in these communities, who may not have access to them. Other school clubs have read to children in local elementary schools, donated to shelters for at-risk youth, and made care packages for individuals in need- all relevant ways of connecting schools and students with members of their local community.
   
   We have partnered with Ashoka and Peace First. They have been content providers for some of our larger events- including the Social Entrepreneurship Camp for Young Changemakers- and continue to provide strong support for MNMS.
