Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  EnrichLA has a significant track record for designing, building, and providing
  programming at schools across Los Angeles. Within the last 3 years, EnrichLA
  has built over 60 gardens in Los Angeles schools, and in the 2013-2014 school
  year, we offered our Garden Ranger Program at 25 schools.
   
   To implement this project, we will identify 11 schools that want an edible school garden within their schoolyard. We already have a wait-list of schools so this will not be a problem. Once the needs of the individual school have been identified, and a garden design created, we work with a crew of volunteers to transform the garden space in the span of a single day! Our volunteer groups are made up of students, staff, and parents, local community members, as well as volunteer groups such as Gay 4 Good, Do Good Bus, UCLA Volunteers, USC Helenes, and more!
   
   The next step will be to hire additional Garden Rangers that serve at these sites. These Garden Rangers are educated and experienced, and they are thoroughly trained in our Garden Ranger curriculum and EnrichLA standards so as to offer the best possible experience to students. The Garden Rangers will then provide weekly garden classes and garden maintenance at these schools, as well as organize community workshops and work days.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Our motto is to put “A Garden in Every School” and thereby with every school
  garden we create, we are offering students, parents, teachers, and community
  members the opportunity to play, and with that play, to live and learn. The
  beauty of our endeavor is that with every garden we create, we are in effect
  establishing an incubator for new opportunities; for communities to come
  together over a garden work day, for teachers to become stewards of the
  environment, and for children to become acquainted, by the sweat of their own
  brow, with those fruits and vegetables that will most nourish them. 
   
   In less than three years EnrichLA has converted over 60 parcels of unused open space into productive gardens at Los Angeles’ most needy schools. Over the course of the next school year EnrichLA plans to build 11 new gardens at 11 schools, making our total number of school gardens built 75. That means acres of asphalt removed, acres of green space available to families otherwise unable to access parks, and acres of crops to nourish thousands of families otherwise without access to healthy options. 
   
   Beyond the immediate benefit of creating garden space, EnrichLA fosters lasting connections with the schools it partners with--through community workshops, providing consistent garden maintenance, and through the implementation of our “Garden Ranger” program. Slated for 35 schools in the 2014-2015 school year, the “Garden Ranger” program engages whole classrooms in garden-based education. Students become acquainted with healthy foods (some of which, like beets and artichokes, students had prior never been exposed to) and concepts of environmental stewardship, all the while pursuing a curriculum that meets the standards of a California education.
   
   In 2050, LA will have a garden in every single one of its schools. Many schools will maintain urban farms, the produce from which will supplement greatly the food available through school lunches. In 2050, every single one of these schools will maintain a robust garden-based educational curriculum, with home-grown and EnrichLA Garden Rangers working side by side to acquaint the next generation of Angelenos with the food that sustains a healthy and robust society. By the end of their secondary education, Angelenos of the 2050’s will be environmentally conscious and environmentally active horticulturalists, nutritionists, ecologists, and socially responsible members of their community.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The expansion of our Garden Ranger Program to eleven new schools will offer
  the program to a minimum of 5,500 students who previously lacked access to a
  school garden and to our Garden Ranger Program. 
   
   Although the Garden Ranger Program primarily targets youth in schools, the gardens we create are available to the entire community as a launching pad for further collaboration. We have seen how parents, teachers, teens, and children of all backgrounds will come together to build a garden from scratch within a single day. 
   
   By building new edible gardens and green spaces in these 11 schools, thousands of school students, teachers, staff, and parents will have access to an outdoor space where they can live, learn, and play. These green spaces offer people in park-poor communities with access to green space. 
   
   Schools themselves benefit from the garden; the Garden Ranger Program improves their campus aesthetic and has the ability to improve their academic standing. We have seen firsthand how the installation of a garden at Thomas Starr King Middle School brought about such a change in the school environment and morale that school’s API jumped from the 600’s to well over 800 in a matter of 5 years. Science classes gain an outdoor laboratory with which they can conduct real-world experiments, children have a new outdoor area to play during recess, some teachers take their lunches to the garden, and neighbors help maintain the space. In short, the entire community benefits.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  EnrichLA has worked with partners such as Kaiser Permanente, St. Johns
  Wellness Center, LAUSD Facilities, Whole Foods, Whole Kids Foundation, Tree
  People, and more. EnrichLA is open to new and continuing partnerships as we
  hope to partner with like-minded organizations concerned with offering edible
  education and green spaces to local students.
