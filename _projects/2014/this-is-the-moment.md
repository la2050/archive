  more_detail: >-
    I like to propose a project where artists from various cultures will engage
    and collaborate in a project to create dance, music, and share stories.

    I would like to collaborate with appropriate artists from various groups and
    ensembles, and solo artists to come together to engage in something that can
    be profound and creative! This will not only represent each participant's
    cultural background and artistry,  but also appreciate and foster the other.
  impact_create: >-
    This project will represent what Los Angeles is, a multicultural society
    that is meant to live vibrantly, and share our resources, culture, and
    customs. This is a common platform for people to come together in a special
    way.
  who_benefit: >-
    The project will benefit especially  the youth ,and create cultural
    awareness and foster tourism, and tolerance among us.

  two_lessons: 'Curiosity and Coexisting '
  achievable_goal: >-
    With nearly 30 years of experience in the arts field, I am realistic about
    the time required to conceive and implement. This is an achievable goal.
  major_challenges: >-
    My strategy is to plan, engage collaborators, hold several preliminary
    meetings, and implement necessary steps to go forward with the project.
  competition: >-
    I am not aware of any other organization doing similar work. I specialize in
    both intercultural presentations and traditional Indian dance work. This is
    a unique combination and I bring a wealth of information and experience to
    the table. Having lived in Los Angeles for over 40 years and produced for
    nearly 30 years,  I can be realistic in what I am able to accomplish. 
  cost: 'I plan to conceive this project with the budget of $100,000.'
  budget: "Artists & Designers - $50,000\r\nProduction - $30,000\r\nMarketing & Exhibition - $20,000"
