  We are working to cultivate leaders at all levels of the education system by
  recruiting more teachers with demonstrated leadership abilities, maximizing
  their impact through better training and development, and extending their
  impact by supporting them as alumni. In order to achieve our mission, Teach
  For America – Los Angeles will:
   
   1. Recruit Outstanding and Diverse Leaders: Our nationwide recruitment model dramatically expands the talent pool of future teachers and leaders that local schools can access. We are committed to diversifying Los Angeles’ teaching force, and have dedicated efforts to increase the representation of corps members who share the racial and socioeconomic background of our students, and who come from a variety of professional backgrounds. We are diversifying the ECE landscape, with over 75% of our incoming corps members identifying as people of color. Students from low-income communities will benefit from this broadened base of exceptional talent for potential ECE corps members.
   
   2. Maximize Our Impact on Student Achievement: Our success is ultimately predicated upon our corps members’ ability to provide a solid, life-changing education to their students. We ensure success in the classroom through extensive training, ongoing support, and consistent progress measurement. Our corps members receive individualized feedback from teacher coaches, who provide one-on-one support throughout their two-year commitment. Teacher coaches use data collected during classroom observations and real-time student achievement tracking to identify areas for improvement and ensure adequate progress toward individualized goals. With Teach For America’s support, our ECE corps members are expanding opportunities for their students in the classroom and beyond. 
   
   3. Foster and Accelerate the Leadership of our Alumni: We continue to expand our alumni base in Los Angeles, and foster their ongoing leadership as a force for long-term change. After gaining firsthand knowledge and insight into the educational opportunity gap – and its solvability – our corps members become lifelong leaders in the fight for educational equity from a variety of sectors. If we are serious about building quality in ECE, then we need to have a growing pipeline of young leaders who are willing to commit to the work.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Today, our corps members pursue ambitious growth goals, aiming for their
  students to achieve at least 1.5 levels of growth on the Desired Results
  Development Profile, far above the state-recommended growth target of 1 level.
  In many classrooms, like May Webster’s, we see even more dramatic growth. May,
  a 2010 Los Angeles corps member, taught preschool in Lennox, and was selected
  as Preschool Teacher of the Year by Los Angeles Universal Preschool. May was
  able to achieve 1.66 levels of growth in her classroom and overcome the
  statistics predicting that students from low-income backgrounds will enter
  kindergarten already 12 – 14 months behind their wealthier peers. With May’s
  leadership and passion, her students started kindergarten already reading at a
  first-grade level. 
   
   Our corps members not only focus on student growth, but also invest families in their efforts. Victoria Hong, a 2011 Los Angeles corps member, instructed two classrooms of 17 dual language learners aged 3-5 as a Head Start Teacher at Pacific Asian Consortium in Employment. Victoria’s vision was to inspire in her students a love for learning, and to encourage their parents to become lifelong advocates for their child’s education. In addition to teaching her students a rigorous curriculum, Victoria also facilitated parent sessions to increase their awareness of the educational opportunity gap and provided resources to help them support their child’s learning. Her students achieved more than 1.5 years of growth, and their parents felt empowered to fight for high-quality educational opportunities.
   
   Imagine a world in which all children across Los Angeles have access to such caring, qualified teachers who can help level the playing field by actively pursuing ambitious growth goals, and engaging with and educating their students’ families. If all of our students entered kindergarten on similar academic levels and had families who felt empowered to advocate for their education, our entire country would benefit! We would see the long-term benefits with more students graduating high school and attending college, and more adults holding stable jobs with higher earnings (Source: HighScope Perry Preschool Project). High-quality early education is the best investment we can make and Teach For America is prepared to expand our ECE efforts to ensure that all students in Los Angeles are on the path to a brighter future!
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  By bringing in and supporting highly committed and effective ECE teachers,
  Teach For America – Los Angeles is playing a pivotal role in the trajectory of
  Los Angeles’ young students’ education, shaping their initial understanding of
  what it means to be a successful student and an active member of a learning
  community. Teaching in some of the highest-need communities in Los Angeles,
  our ECE corps members will serve over 300 students and their families each day
  in the 2014-15 school year. The beneficiaries of our work are verified through
  their qualification for the federal free- and reduced-price lunch program.
  Children from families with incomes at or below 185% of the poverty level
  (which equates to $43,568 for a family of four in 2014) are eligible for
  reduced-price or free meals. Over 95% of the students we serve on a daily
  basis are eligible for this program. We currently estimate that 60 to 80% of
  the students we serve are Latino, and 20 to 40% are African American. 
   
   The work we do is about people. It is about our students, who have the potential to achieve at the highest levels. It is about their parents, who want the best for their children and their community. It is about our corps members, who work relentlessly to lead their students on more promising academic trajectories. It is about our alumni, who work in education and across a variety of fields to accelerate the pace of change. It is about our staff members, supporters, and partners, who make all of these efforts possible. Together, this movement of individuals reflects a rich diversity of experiences and is united by a shared vision that one day, all children in this nation will have the opportunity to attain an excellent education.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  At Teach For America, we believe that transformation happens through
  partnership. We consistently engage with other partners in this work, such as
  First 5 LA, as collaboration is essential to our efforts to further our ECE
  initiative. Our confirmed partnerships with the following organizations are
  vital to the success of our program:
   
   1. Loyola Marymount University (LMU), our university partner for over a decade, where our corps members enroll in credentialing courses during the school year and pursue their Master’s degrees during their second year. In the 2013-14 school year, all of our ECE corps members completed their Master’s degrees at LMU. 
   
   2. Westside Children’s Center, one of our ECE partner schools, provides high-quality early education programs to serve 400 at-risk children (ages 0 – 5) from very low-income families in southwest Los Angeles County. Since 2012, our ECE corps members have attended summer institute training at Westside Children’s Center, during which they receive training in pedagogy and teaching strategies in model classrooms. The teachers at Westside Children’s Center mentor our corps members and gain exposure to the Teach For America instructional program. The current CEO of Westside Children’s Center, Heather Carrigan, joined Teach For America – Los Angeles’ inaugural class after graduating from Princeton University in 1990. While teaching at Warren Lane Elementary School in Inglewood, Heather learned first-hand about teachers’ daily struggles combating educational disparities and has since committed her career to fighting poverty through education reform.
   
   3. St. Anne’s, one of our ECE partner schools, serves some of the most abused, abandoned, neglected, and otherwise challenged young women and children in Los Angeles County. St. Anne’s offers an array of comprehensive programs including but not limited to, transitional housing, child care, family literacy, and educational and vocational preparation. All of their programs strive to empower and educate by providing the highest level of care and resources so as to help young women and children recognize their own value and potential, giving them the hope and the tools needed for a better future.
