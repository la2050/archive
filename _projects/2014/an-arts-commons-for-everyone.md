  The Arts Commons will include:
   
   1) An outdoor stage and gathering space for performances.
   
   2) A children’s playground and garden.
   
   3) An outdoor oven and communal table.
   
   4) Numerous park benches.
   
   5) Public murals by local artists.
   
   6) Extensive upgrades to the indoor black box theater, allowing for more diverse and higher-quality literary readings, theatrical and musical perfomances, film festivals, and other community events.
   
   7) A refurbished central lobby in which community members can socialize and enjoy refreshments after attending an event or participating in a workshop.
   
   8) A redesigned literary space and small-press bookstore for free community writing workshops.
   
   9) An upgraded art gallery in which local artists can display their work.
   
   10) Upgrades to the existing bathroom facilities.
   
   11) The creation of an outdoor workshop space in our backyard poet’s garden, allowing us to offer an increased number of free writing workshops and literary seminars that cover a wider array of genres and themes. 
   
   12) A community vegetable garden (this portion of the project is already under construction, and will be completed regardless of whether or not we receive funding).
   
   A master plan for the outdoor portion of the Arts Commons has already been prepared by the noted design firm Rios Clementi Hale. One major portion of the project – the community vegetable garden – has already commenced under the direction of our partner organization, Kiss the Ground. Given funding, community volunteers organized by ourselves and Kiss the Ground, will begin construction on the rest of the proposed Arts Commons. Most of the landscaping, as well as construction of the outdoor performance space and community table,will be done by volunteers. Professionals will be used to wire the outdoor performance space for sound and lighting, to upgrade the indoor theater, and to improve restroom facilities. We and our partner organizations hold a lease on the land and have secured all necessary permits, so all that we require is the necessary funding to begin construction.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  In an era of increasing inequality, there are few venues in which people of
  all backgrounds share space, let alone interact. Los Angeles has a particular
  lack of public spaces in which people from different walks of life are
  encouraged to engage in dialogue with each other.
   
   Beyond Baroque has long combatted this radical shrinking of the public sphere by offering high-quality weekly writing workshops that are free of charge to the community. In these workshops, creative professionals working on their novels often come in contact with with restaurant servers looking to tell their own stories, lawyers receive feedback on their poetry from nannies, and the elderly exchange drafts of short-stories with teens. 
   
   Our proposed Arts Commons carries both the spirit and content of this programming out into the open air by creating an arts park along Venice boulevard in Venice. This park will provide a beautiful outdoor space in which people can gather for outdoor workshops and performances, collaborate on growing vegetables in a community garden, have fun in a playground, or just relax over a nice picnic. In turn, visitors to the park can wander inside to Beyond Baroque to enjoy a reading or concert in our refurbished indoor theater, socialize over a refreshment in our lobby, or peruse our small-press bookstore. Or they can move next door to take in the art presented by our sister organization, the Social and Public Art Resource Center (SPARC).
   
   The Venice Arts Commons takes the virtues of the traditional public park – a safe space in which different kinds of people can relax and mingle – and reimagines the park as a participatory venue for people to engage in artistic and educational dialog with their community. By bringing performances, readings, concerts, interactive writing workshops, and other kinds of art-making out into the open alongside a community garden, playground, and picnic area, the Venice Arts Commons will serve as a vital civic space not only for the Venice community, but for arts audiences from across the city. We believe it will serve as a model for other community arts centers and public spaces across the city, making Los Angeles in 2050 a city in which the arts are are interwoven into the public and civic life of the city.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  1) People in the communities of Venice, Mar Vista, Santa Monica, Culver City,
  Palms, Playa Vista, and Marina del Rey.
   
   2) Literary audiences from across Southern California who attend readings and performances in either the outdoor or indoor theaters.
   
   3) Arts audiences who come to enjoy the outdoor murals in the garden, the art on display in our art gallery, or who visit Social and Public Art Resource Center next door.
   
   4) Aspiring writers of all ages who participate in our workshops.
   
   5) Teen writers who participate in writing programs for youth.
   
   6) Elderly writers who participate in our writing workshops for seniors.
   
   7) Children in the community looking for a playground.
   
   8) Dog walkers.
   
   9) Community members interested in learning about sustainable growing practices in the community garden planted by Kiss the Ground.
   
   10) Local artists and writers.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: |-
  -Kiss the Ground
   Kiss the Ground is dedicated to rebuilding the soils in order to improve human and planetary health. They have spearheaded the idea to transform the outdoor grounds into a public space, and are currently digging a community vegetable garden that will be the first component of the proposed Arts Commons.
   
   -Rios Clementi Hale
   Amongst other projects, the Los Angles firm Rios Clementi Hale designed L.A.’s recently opened Grand Park. Working with Kiss the Ground, they created the plan for the Arts Commons and community vegetable garden.
   
   -Social and Public Art Resource Center (SPARC)
   SPARC is dedicated to using public art to address contemporary issues and questions of social memory. It shares the grounds of the Old Venice City Hall with Beyond Baroque and its arts programming is an essential component of the proposed Arts Commons. SPARC has committed to the design plan created by Rios Clementi Hale.
