    We propose to transform the grounds of the historic 1906 Old Venice City
    Hall into an Arts Commons that provides Los Angeles with a multi-use,
    indoor/outdoor space for performance, art-making, relaxation, learning,
    play, cooking, gardening, and community gathering.  This project will
    revitalize the interior of the Old Venice City Hall, upgrading the existing
    lobby and theater so that it can serve as an improved venue for
    performances, literary talks, and community meetings. More dramatically, it
    will transform the existing hardscrabble “lawn” surrounding the building
    into a beautiful public park, community vegetable garden, outdoor classroom,
    and open-air theater.
  name: An Arts Commons for Everyone
  impact_play: "In an era of increasing inequality, there are few venues in which people of all backgrounds share space, let alone interact. Los Angeles has a particular lack of public spaces in which people from different walks of life are encouraged to engage in dialogue with each other.\r\n\r\nBeyond Baroque has long combatted this radical shrinking of the public sphere by offering high-quality weekly writing workshops that are free of charge to the community.  In these workshops, creative professionals working on their novels often come in contact with with restaurant servers looking to tell their own stories, lawyers receive feedback on their poetry from nannies, and the elderly exchange drafts of short-stories with teens.  \r\n\r\nOur proposed Arts Commons carries both the spirit and content of this programming out into the open air by creating an arts park along Venice boulevard in Venice.  This park will provide a beautiful outdoor space in which people can gather for outdoor workshops and performances, collaborate on growing vegetables in a community garden, have fun in a playground, or just relax over a nice picnic.  In turn, visitors to the park can wander inside to Beyond Baroque to enjoy a reading or concert in our refurbished indoor theater, socialize over a refreshment in our lobby, or peruse our small-press bookstore.  Or they can move next door to take in the art presented by our sister organization, the Social and Public Art Resource Center (SPARC).\r\n\r\nThe Venice Arts Commons takes the virtues of the traditional public park – a safe space in which different kinds of people can relax and mingle – and reimagines the park as a participatory venue for people to engage in artistic and educational dialog with their community.  By bringing performances, readings, concerts, interactive writing workshops, and other kinds of art-making out into the open alongside a community garden, playground, and picnic area, the Venice Arts Commons will serve as a vital civic space not only for the Venice community, but for arts audiences from across the city.  We believe it will serve as a model for other community arts centers and public spaces across the city, making Los Angeles in 2050 a city in which the arts are are interwoven into the public and civic life of the city.\r\n\r\n"

  evaluate: "The evaluation of the project is simple.  First, and most importantly, we will consider it a success if we are able to transform the ugly, dying lawn surrounding the Old Venice City Hall into a vibrant park that is utilized by a broad spectrum of people. \r\n\r\nSecond, we will consider it a success if we can use the outdoor space increase the number of free writing workshops, discussion groups, educational seminars. readings, performances, concerts, film screenings, and art openings that we and our partner organizations present to the public by at least 25%.\r\n\r\nThird, we will consider the project a success if we can improve attendance at our arts events by 30%."
  two_lessons: "Art should be a participatory activity for all.\r\n\r\nThe winnowing of vital public space and social exchange is a deep threat to our civic and social health.  Los Angeles needs more spaces in which people can be encouraged to engage with their fellow citizens.\r\n"
  achievable_goal: >-
    This project is as shovel-ready as they come. As was mentioned above, the
    master plan for the exterior portion of the Arts Commons was created by
    noted design firm Rios Clementi Hale.  The sustainable agriculture group
    Kiss the Ground has already begun constructing a community vegetable garden
    on the land jointly shared by Beyond Baroque and SPARC.  Beyond Baroque and
    our partner organizations maintain a lease on all the land proposed for
    development, and all have agreed to the master plan created by Rios Clementi
    Hale.  In addition, all necessary permits have been obtained.  The only
    remaining necessary step need to begin construction of the Arts Commons is
    to secure funding, meaning that this is an easily achievable project within
    the next twelve months.
  major_challenges: "1) We anticipate it will be a struggle to gather the necessary volunteers for the project.  Fortunately, we and our partner organizations have extensive ties to the Venice community.\r\n\r\n2) The Old Venice City Hall is badly in need of re-wiring.  It could be that installing a sound system for outside the building will require upgrades to our existing electrical infrastructure.  If necessary, we are prepared to raise additional funds in order to accomplish this."
  competition: >-
    We are not aware of any similar projects.  Though there a number of
    community vegetable gardens being constructed across the city, our project
    is unique in that it attempts to bring literary, visual, and performing arts
    programming into an outdoor recreational space.  
  cost: >-
    We estimate the total cost of the project, including the vegetable garden,
    to be $200,000.  Kiss the Ground has already raised a significant portion of
    these funds and applied them to construction of the garden.  We plan on
    raising additional funds from our donors, and by soliciting contributions
    from the Venice community.
  budget: "Upgrades to the indoor theater, including curtains to improve sound quality, and new lighting - $7,000\r\n\r\nUpgrades to the lobby and small press bookstore (new paint, carpet, lighting) - $5,000\r\n\r\nUpgrades to the art gallery, including new lighting - $5,000\r\n\r\nConstruction of the stage  - $5,000\r\n\r\nConstruction of the playground - $15,000\r\n\r\nLandscaping (including purchase of plants) - $20,000\r\n\r\nConstruction and installation of park benches - $15,000\r\n\r\nConstruction of outdoor oven, classroom, and communal table - $13,000\r\n\r\nInstallation of audio for outdoor performances - $10,000\r\n\r\nAdditional expenses - $5,000\r\n\r\nTotal: $100,000\r\n"

  impact_metrics: >-
    The Venice Arts Commons creates a safe public space for the Venice
    community.  This improves access to open space and park facilities, and
    increases the number of Los Angeles residents who live within a ¼ mile of a
    vibrant park. Through our arts programming, some of which are for youth, we
    will increase the number of children enrolled in aftershool programs.  Many
    of our programs are for seniors, which in conjunction with our youth
    programming, increases opportunities for intergenerational play.  Above all,
    the Arts Commons makes literature, theater, music, and public art an
    accessible part of Los Angeles’ recreational spaces.
Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): |-
  The Arts Commons will include:
   
   1) An outdoor stage and gathering space for performances.

   3) An outdoor oven and communal table.
   
   4) Numerous park benches.
   
   5) Public murals by local artists.
   
   6) Extensive upgrades to the indoor black box theater, allowing for more diverse and higher-quality literary readings, theatrical and musical perfomances, film festivals, and other community events.
   
   7) A refurbished central lobby in which community members can socialize and enjoy refreshments after attending an event or participating in a workshop.
   
   8) A redesigned literary space and small-press bookstore for free community writing workshops.

One major portion of the project – the community vegetable garden – has already commenced under the direction of our partner organization, Kiss the Ground.  Given funding, community volunteers organized by ourselves and Kiss the Ground, will begin construction on the rest of the proposed Arts Commons.  Most of the landscaping, as well as construction of the outdoor performance space and community table,will be done by volunteers.  Professionals will be used to wire the outdoor performance space for sound and lighting, to upgrade the indoor theater, and to improve restroom facilities.  We and our partner organizations hold a lease on the land and have secured all necessary permits, so all that we require is the necessary funding to begin construction.\r\n"

    answer: "In an era of increasing inequality, there are few venues in which people of all backgrounds share space, let alone interact. Los Angeles has a particular lack of public spaces in which people from different walks of life are encouraged to engage in dialogue with each other.\r\n\r\nBeyond Baroque has long combatted this radical shrinking of the public sphere by offering high-quality weekly writing workshops that are free of charge to the community.  In these workshops, creative professionals working on their novels often come in contact with with restaurant servers looking to tell their own stories, lawyers receive feedback on their poetry from nannies, and the elderly exchange drafts of short-stories with teens.  \r\n\r\nOur proposed Arts Commons carries both the spirit and content of this programming out into the open air by creating an arts park along Venice boulevard in Venice.  This park will provide a beautiful outdoor space in which people can gather for outdoor workshops and performances, collaborate on growing vegetables in a community garden, have fun in a playground, or just relax over a nice picnic.  In turn, visitors to the park can wander inside to Beyond Baroque to enjoy a reading or concert in our refurbished indoor theater, socialize over a refreshment in our lobby, or peruse our small-press bookstore.  Or they can move next door to take in the art presented by our sister organization, the Social and Public Art Resource Center (SPARC).\r\n\r\nThe Venice Arts Commons takes the virtues of the traditional public park – a safe space in which different kinds of people can relax and mingle – and reimagines the park as a participatory venue for people to engage in artistic and educational dialog with their community.  By bringing performances, readings, concerts, interactive writing workshops, and other kinds of art-making out into the open alongside a community garden, playground, and picnic area, the Venice Arts Commons will serve as a vital civic space not only for the Venice community, but for arts audiences from across the city.  We believe it will serve as a model for other community arts centers and public spaces across the city, making Los Angeles in 2050 a city in which the arts are are interwoven into the public and civic life of the city.\r\n\r\n"

      The Venice Arts Commons creates a safe public space for the Venice
      community.  This improves access to open space and park facilities, and
      increases the number of Los Angeles residents who live within a ¼ mile of
      a vibrant park. Through our arts programming, some of which are for youth,
      we will increase the number of children enrolled in aftershool programs. 
      Many of our programs are for seniors, which in conjunction with our youth
      programming, increases opportunities for intergenerational play.  Above
      all, the Arts Commons makes literature, theater, music, and public art an
      accessible part of Los Angeles’ recreational spaces.

      This project is as shovel-ready as they come. As was mentioned above, the
      master plan for the exterior portion of the Arts Commons was created by
      noted design firm Rios Clementi Hale.  The sustainable agriculture group
      Kiss the Ground has already begun constructing a community vegetable
      garden on the land jointly shared by Beyond Baroque and SPARC.  Beyond
      Baroque and our partner organizations maintain a lease on all the land
      proposed for development, and all have agreed to the master plan created
      by Rios Clementi Hale.  In addition, all necessary permits have been
      obtained.  The only remaining necessary step need to begin construction of
      the Arts Commons is to secure funding, meaning that this is an easily
      achievable project within the next twelve months.

    answer: "1) We anticipate it will be a struggle to gather the necessary volunteers for the project.  Fortunately, we and our partner organizations have extensive ties to the Venice community.\r\n\r\n2) The Old Venice City Hall is badly in need of re-wiring.  It could be that installing a sound system for outside the building will require upgrades to our existing electrical infrastructure.  If necessary, we are prepared to raise additional funds in order to accomplish this."

      We are not aware of any similar projects.  Though there a number of
      community vegetable gardens being constructed across the city, our project
      is unique in that it attempts to bring literary, visual, and performing

      We estimate the total cost of the project, including the vegetable garden,
      to be $200,000.  Kiss the Ground has already raised a significant portion
      of these funds and applied them to construction of the garden.  We plan on
      raising additional funds from our donors, and by soliciting contributions
      from the Venice community.
