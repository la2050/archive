  The idea: Individuals can create social solutions to hard problems that
  frequently seem insurmountable or dependent on major infrastructure.
   +
   Individuals only change their behavior based on 1:1 positive experiences. = A social/educational program making bicycling feel safe, fun and accessible – in the middle of car-centric Los Angeles!
   
   LA Bike Trains are regular group rides along the safest routes, led by trained 'conductors.' But it gets better. We've built in education, rider support and are working on a mobile app to become a major transportation alternative and "first mile/last mile" solution. Everyone wants to “beat the traffic” or avoid parking and L.A. Bike Trains is a fun solution that’s easy to talk about or participate in
What is your idea/project in more detail?: |-
  #1 Promotion: print materials, signage and traditional media
   #2 Develop USA's first urban (traffic) specific ride leader training program
   #3 Create new routes based on need as determined by the Commuter Survey http://labiketrains.com/commuter-survey/
   #4 Connect current efforts into a web based (mobile) app that suggests routes at all times and provides real-time tracking of live routes for anyone to "hop on/hop off."
   #5 Connect LA Bike Trains to major educational and employment organizations to help facilitate bicycling to major commuter destinations.
   
   Right now we have the benefit of being almost 2(!) years old. We've got a solid team, program and lots of community support - even internationally! Cities from San Francisco to London have asked "how do you do it? We want Bike Trains in our city!" But even in LA few people who would benefit the most have heard of us or know how we can make their commute and their life better. 
   
   We also need a huge increase in commuter survey responses. The tactic we've taken is that in addition to our own collection, we are working with major transportation and city agencies to get access to their data as well. 
   
   Everything is about breaking down barriers - from helping people learn how to safely and comfortably bike commute on their own or with us. No topic is too silly; most are worried about sweating and not looking professional enough, or too serious.. we are always addressing safety and helping people get over real safety concerns. We do that by showing up, running on time and being generous with everything we know. 
   
   Being an LA Bike Trains conductor is a big job and only the most kind hearted, energetic and wonderful people can do it. Conductors are unpaid volunteers who spend a lot of time making sure their communication is great, that riders feel safe and have a good time and participate in any number of other development or advocacy work. 
   
   That means that even beyond the Bike Trains, we're developing an incredible volunteer network across Los Angeles. After primary conductors, we have 'back up' conductors. We are always looking for volunteer web/mobile developers, event coordinators, community organizers, educators and happy people. Right now our volunteer list is 100+ strong and growing.
   
   We've got an unreleased app 'beta' but we need funding and specific development talent to get it to the point where we can release it into the wilds of LA city streets safely.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Today, L.A. Bike Trains is a novel approach using a fun social experience to
  educate Angelinos about bicycles for transportation. We primarily address
  crude concerns, from safety fears to a total lack of knowledge on how to
  navigate the city without a car and what stuff is needed. We answer a lot of
  the same questions again, and again. All of these questions can be found
  online, but we have discovered that the most important element in creating
  behavior change is emotional, via 1:1 human experience. We provide that and
  inspiration for taking the next steps.
   
   We’re also at an exciting intersection – helping define what multi-modal transportation looks like. From using our experience to assist with Open Streets events, collaborate with major transportation/urban development projects and the creation of innovative bike friendly routes via a mobile app… there’s no limit to where we can grow in the future.
   
   Right now the biggest need is basic education and advocating for infrastructure developments, while creating an authentic bicycle culture that makes Angelinos more resilient. As infrastructure improves and social acceptance of bicycling for transport gains, we’ll be able to focus on bicycle specific innovation within LA’s ever changing urban transit mix. Having built a massive network of volunteers, participants, collaborators and channels of communication we’ll be able to facilitate an evolution that may bring us to work more closely with mass transit, urban planning, the bicycle industry itself or any number of potential avenues.
   
   What doesn’t change between now and 2050 is our commitment to using the bicycle as the greatest tool we have for connecting individuals and communities in Los Angeles. The bicycle is a great equalizer between rich and poor, languages and backgrounds. Transportation equality and access is one of the greatest projects the city must undertake to allow all of its’ citizens access to educational, recreation and occupational opportunity.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Like most start-up projects, we’ve had to begin in communities that are
  naturally receptive to what we’re doing. It’s no surprise that we’re popular
  in the young, affluent and very Caucasian neighborhood of Silverlake, but the
  real promise is in the Latino communities of East LA and beyond. Reaching
  diverse and low income populations – the ones who stand to gain the most from
  this project – requires a lot more effort. From being able to faithfully offer
  communication, assistance and service in multiple languages. It’s also
  important to have the resources necessary to reach those populations in
  meaningful ways. 
   
   In more affluent neighborhoods we can simply promote online and begin rides at local cafes. In traditionally poor neighborhoods, the barriers are much higher. That means we need to spend a lot more time and money to bring the same spirit of service; by providing free coffee at a local park and being present at community events. Conductors bear a huge responsibility, not only in taking on the responsibility and potential liability of leading regular rides, but also educating, encouraging and connecting people to a broader community, bicycling resources and providing an empathetic window into what their specific neighborhood requires to become receptive to community adoption of a ‘bike train.’
   
   Too many projects attempt to reach out to Spanish speaking community by simply offering a website in Spanish. We understand that we need to be able to fully support communities that are predominantly Spanish speaking. That means working with existing groups, recruiting existing leaders and research into what is most needed. Having the time, thoughtfulness and creativity to bridge the project into a different framework is how we plan to be successful in positively impacting divers populations in Los Angeles. Incremental, rather than blanket progress. To do that faithfully it has to happen organically and that is extremely difficult to predict.
   
   L.A. Bike Trains is in the position to most positively impact disadvantaged and low-income communities. By making the bicycle (often in combination with public transport) a reliable and desirable transportation option, individuals stand to gain mobility, save a significant percentage of their income and begin to solve some of the most pressing health issues seriously affecting low-income populations. We address this goal through an all-inclusive, holistic approach.

   These organizational collaborators range from organizations that we can rely on to help us promote our work to their audiences, to those that provide more in-depth assistance with knowledge or professional connections to being able to support us financially or with ‘in-kind’ donations. These are the organizations that are our “first tier” whenever we need anything or just want to explore possibilities.
    
   The primary collaborations that we want to develop are with university bicycle coalitions. A successful test run and development of 2 new routes going to UCLA was launched during bike week May 2014. We now want to deepen that relationship so that more staff and students will utilize L.A. Bike Trains as their transportation resource. L.A. Bike Trains would like UCLA to support those routes via funding, promotion and technical assistance – such as data collection and research. With a UCLA collaboration in process, it can serve as a template for additional collaborations with other schools, such as USC, but also large employers from the city of LA to Sony Entertainment.
