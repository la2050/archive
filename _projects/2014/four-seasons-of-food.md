  We will be testing our project in the San Fernando Valley, but it will have an
  impact on the whole city.
Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  I. Develop the Digital Platform using open source GIS data as well as research
  and mapping already in progress.
   
   A. Interactive Mapping of LA’s Water Systems 
   This tool will visualize LA's water resources and consumption, allowing users to clearly understand where our water comes from (local, imported, recycled), how much water is being consumed and how this breaks down across LA by various factors (neighborhoods, demographics, etc.). Users can zoom around LA to see their community as it compares to other communities. 
   
   B. Inventory and geolocate water projects that are already occurring in Los Angeles. Research and outreach to organizations and agencies in the San Fernando Valley (for the pilot study) to gather information about water related initiatives. These projects will be uploaded to the mapping platform for users and other organizations to learn more about them and find out how they can get involved or work together.
    
   C. Design mechanisms for organizations to upload content (images, data, opportunities to volunteer or donate) for existing projects or to add new projects & content to the map.
   
   II. Test and improve the app: Pilot test in the San Fernando Valley
   Recruit residents and organizations in the San Fernando Valley to participate in a pilot program. Arid Lands Institute has already conducted significant research on the opportunities and constraints for projects in this area and is very active in this community. Using this network and research, we will test the viability of the program. Based on this feedback, we will work to improve it prior to launching city-wide.
   
   III. Document our findings: Create a report that details our findings
   
   IV: Future Applications Post Grant: 
   A. Expand the app to include more neighborhoods in the city. 
   B. Involve more organizations and create more partnerships
   C. Promote the app and market the final version to the Los Angeles public
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Drought has always been a significant problem for Los Angeles, but this
  problem will only be exacerbated over the next few decades without a major
  intervention. By 2050, LA’s population is projected to increase to 40 million,
  placing a much bigger demand on an already minimal supply. In addition,
  climate change is expected to reduce the snowpack in Sierra Nevada by 25%,
  which is a key contributor to LA’s water reservoirs. LA currently imports 85%
  of its water. As population increases, we need to improve our efforts increase
  our local supply of water so we can be closer to water independence. 
   This proposal seeks to address the issues related to drought by means of raising awareness and creating incentives for citizens to become active in the solution. By providing a transparent interchange of information, this tool will encourage citizens to become active participants in larger scale sustainability interventions for the city. This tool will also highlight priority areas and opportunities for future projects that can help us work towards water independence by 2050.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  This project will benefit the larger population of Los Angeles. By improving
  our efforts to increase our local water supply and reduce our water
  consumption at the neighborhood scale (as well as the city scale), we can work
  towards obtaining water security for the city as we grow in the coming
  decades.
   
   This project will also benefit the many organizations, agencies and non-profits who are working hard to solve our water crisis by providing them with a larger platform to showcase their work. By increasing transparency and providing a centralized platform for water-related projects, this work can be bolstered through a stronger network providing opportunities for sharing resources, getting volunteers, and getting donations to continue their work.
   
   These agencies and organizations include:
   - LA Department of Water and Power (LADWP)
   - LA Sanitation Bureau, Public Works
   - Metropolitan Water District of Southern California
   - Neighborhood Councils
   - LA City Green Streets Committee
   - Heal the Bay
   - Los Angeles Conservation Corp
   - Los Angeles Beautification Team
   - Green LA
   - Environment Now
   - Trust for Public LAND
   - Santa Monica Mountain Conservancy
   - Sierra Club
   - Los Angeles Water Keeper
   - Tree People
   - Water LA
