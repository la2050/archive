  The Original Green Community Food Hub helps low-income farm entrepreneurs
  create businesses in South LA that are economically and environmentally
  sustainable. The project: transforms food systems so children and families
  have healthier foods in their communities; improves community access to good
  food; and reinvigorates local economies. 
   
   We’ve worked with residents in the hub area since November 2009 and have established a co-working homestead with a growing site and commercial kitchen, for low-income food entrepreneurs to develop businesses in an incubator setting. We will support at least 19 entrepreneurs during the budget period. Most will grow at their own sites on an average of .01 acres, producing about 4000 pounds of food annually. When all are certified (by March 2015) the food hub will have the capacity to impact 200,000 residents in nearby communities. 
   
   Integral to our food hub is the online aggregator we developed. It represents the local food market -- populated and informed by local entrepreneurs, small yard farms, larger vacant lot farms, restaurants utilizing their produce and consumers. The area is seeing intense attrition and outright loss of large grocery stores. The online food hub fills some of that niche, providing information about local restaurants and healthy food markets that buy local, in addition to location and availability of production resources like our commercial kitchen. The online tool informs consumers about community-based distribution sites (for producers in the food hub) and allows producers to tell their own story about how, why and when they grow. In addition to facilitating connections between consumers and producers, it brings resources to the community and promotes social entrepreneurship and food justice. 
   
   In 12-months, we will undertake the following: establish a business incubator and co-working space for beginning food producers; launch farmer training and mentoring programs (including a three-month, farm development and certification curriculum) to support producers in their first through third years of establishment; offer four workshops for producers and community members to learn about local food access issues and solutions; and connect with local and national urban farming training organizations to share project outcomes and replicate best practices. 
   
   We are also pursuing acquisition of 67,000 square feet of growing space in the food hub area, which will significantly expand healthy food options.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  Presently and in 2050, our project expands individual and community health by
  increasing access to healthy food options. It also expands health by
  reinvigorating and strengthening local economies that support healthy
  activities. Residents are more able to meet dietary recommendations when there
  is a positive and robust local food environment. 
   
   A food hub, by addressing the barriers small producers have to joining the food supply chain, increases access to fresh, local food. With the support of the food hub, small producers are able to participate in sales to residents who receive food assistance. The use of sustainable agricultural practices also contributes to local health by decreasing the negative impact of agriculture on the environment. 
   
   It is well-established that increasing the availability of local, fresh food options improves health outcomes now, and it follows that with increased opportunities and activities, this will be even more so in 2050. Implementing the project now, we can reduce food insecurity for 10% of area residents. Nearly two-thirds of adults in the area reported that it was difficult to access fresh fruits and vegetables. The California Agricultural Resource Directory reports that, per year, one acre of land in Los Angeles can produce 25 tons of fruits and vegetables, generate $220,000, supply 36 families fruits and vegetables and create at least three green jobs. Various studies about the area also show that every dollar invested in food production yields $6 worth of produce. Working pursuant to these factors, in 12 months the project and its 19 grower families will decrease numbers of food insecure families by: providing fresh produce, weekly, to nearly100 local households; providing approximately 75,000 pounds of fresh, locally grown produce to residents in South Los Angeles; and achieving a minimum of 360 unique food sales per month.
   
   Food security is derived from a sustainable food system. As more residents are engaged in the local food economy, the system becomes more sustainable. A local food supply chain, one that is also informed and supplied by local residents, improves the local economy and gives rise to food justice. It also encourages the local knowledge that bonds a community and inspires social equity. 
   
   We seek to improve community health not just physically, but socially and economically. All that we do now and succeed in will have positive impact and support future residents.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Our clients are all at (or very well below) the Area Median Income and live
  primarily in the wider communities of South Los Angeles. 
   
   The population of approximately 200,000 surrounding our site is primarily African-American and Latino with women heads of household in the majority. Ten percent of that population is children under five-years-old. One-in-six residents is low-income and food insecure. The unemployment rate in the neighborhood is near 74% higher than the county average.
   
   All of the project participants will be low-income, socially disadvantaged, beginning food producers. The entire project budget will be used to address this population.
   
   The target audience consists of food producers and consumers. Our producers are low-income food entrepreneurs in South Los Angeles. They are being recruited from approximately 200 households in the 1/4 mile radius of the homestead / business incubator site. They are at or below 50% of the Area Median Income (considered “very low” and “extremely low” income). Seventy-five percent of the residents we serve are at very low income – 50% of AMI. Fifteen percent are at extremely low median income – 30% of AMI. Five percent self-identify as homeless. The area has the highest rate of childhood obesity in Los Angeles County and 1-in-6 residents is likely to experience food insecurity.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Participants have been contacted and recruited through outreach and
  association with local organizations including Community Coalition, LA Green
  Grounds, and the Baldwin Hills-Crenshaw Farmers Market. New participants will
  be recruited in the same manner as well as through partners who sit on the
  Food Policy Roundtable of the Community Health Councils. All of our new
  participants are in the beginning phase of their businesses. 
   
   There is no food hub in South Los Angeles. Our work will be the first organized and developed system. In the immediate area, we have a relationship with the manager of the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw farmers market. Since 2010, we have worked with community organizations educating residents about access to healthy food options along with our own work supporting those who grow and prepare their own food for distribution. We also access a number of guerilla gardeners who are sharing and growing food with neighbors but could reach and connect with consumers in South Los Angeles on a broad scale through our food hub network. 
   
   Three factors critical to success of any of our proposed collaborations are: increased access to local actors already interested in food production and consumption of healthy food; increased access to people working in the food justice and social equity arena, so integral to community improvement and overall health; and increased access to people who are actively growing quality food in local spaces.
