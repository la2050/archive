Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  Arts LANDed is a neighborhood-based artist-in-residence program at local
  schools & an ongoing event resource aggregator/mapping website for teachers &
  families to find & attend art events near where they teach, work, or live.
  Using existing resources from LA County’s Arts for All to ForYourArt, Arts
  LANDed leverages the worthy data produced to become a hands-on program on
  contemporary art for teachers, artists, & students at LAUSD schools. The goal
  is to nurture a new generation of artists & thinkers by providing an
  infrastructure for teachers to connect with local arts organizations,
  supplement curriculum with field trips or artist visits & access the living
  classroom of everyday LA.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  LAND’s process for the 2-part project will be straightforward, with the pilot
  artist-residency program mirroring the future possibilities of the website.
  For the artist-in-residence program, LAND will approach ten arts
  organizations, artist-run spaces, &/or artists to partner on the project.
  Working with the arts organizations whom we select & who self select for
  interest in the project, we will partner with schools walking distance from
  the arts organization. If a STEAM or VAPA school is in the vicinity, we will
  approach those schools first. Together with the artists, we will network in
  the community by attending meetings/gatherings, connecting with parent groups
  at the school, & building relationships with educators. We will talk with
  teachers about style, grade level, standards, & curriculum. The educator &
  artist will design a project that works for the school semester – from a
  performance art piece or collaborative sculpture, to more traditional
  printmaking, claywork, or mural, to a final exhibition for the current
  programming. This process will take 2 to 3 intensive months of relationship
  building, aiming to launch the residency at the start. LAND will act as a
  liaison & support for the artist. The program also includes visits to the art
  space, led by a museum educator who LAND will contract with for the art space
  & to provide mentorship to the artists-in-residence.
   
   On the website, LAND will work with Matt Murphy Design and Athletics— experienced in creating multi-function platforms—to design a site integrating neighborhood mapping & a complementary event RSS that sorts by current location & date, expanding out from your location to adjacent addresses & then further out. The events will include everything from poetry readings, to art exhibits, to comedy or a small concert, work of art, or whatever is nearby. Other options might include smart phone enabled check-ins. This website will be a resource for all—including educators who might see something that relates to a lesson or upcoming event that serves as a resource to their classrooms—in more deeply connecting with their neighborhood, with a special focus on family arts programs. The pilot projects at schools will be documented that they continue to live on as inspirational examples for educators. A blog for participating teachers & artists will be included as a supplement to the page, with photos. A final page with volunteer contributions and experiences, will be maintained by LAND.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  At the root of Arts LANDed is generating/promoting creation and artistic
  sustainability by educating the next generation. The program will informally
  and formally link LA’s significant creative production to schools and
  educators interested in further developing and integrating arts into their
  curriculum on a neighborhood level as a part of everyday life. 
   
   The project will connect volunteer and paid artists more deeply with their neighborhoods with the artist-in-residence school program; connect students with benefits of art education; connect teachers with practical, supportive resources for integrating the arts into their curriculum both online and in-person; and connect neighbors with informal arts participation, creation, and enjoyment opportunities in their neighborhoods.
   
   Strong neighborhood connections are the building blocks of vast Los Angeles County. A key characteristic of the overall project is its location-specificity, opening doors and creating linkages for neighbors of different generations or cultural/social backgrounds to connect with one another through enjoying the arts in the neighborhood where they live. It challenges artists to take their studio practices out of the studio and into the community in neighborhoods where they are already present.
   
   This type of creative collective social cohesion supports community well-being as well as individual well-being. In some Los Angeles neighborhoods, communities live side by side with one another but do not frequent the same places. The idea behind this project is to model art for the next generation as inclusive and welcoming – a place for them to be. As well, it is in growing connections around a common goal as neighbors.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  LAND’s continued vision is to help create and foster a multi-platform
  connectivity within Los Angeles and beyond, ultimately creating an
  international web linking institutions, artists, and cities. Arts LANDed will
  create this in literal form in an online platform, and expand our reach into
  an educational program connecting students, teachers, artists, and
  neighborhoods together, benefitting these specific groups and the general
  public. 
   
   Students will benefit from high-quality arts education in their public schools, integrating this into their standard curriculum and allowing for a creative outlet. Students will be able to interact with a professional artist directly to be exposed to how an artist’s process works, while also being able to contribute to the artist’s ongoing projects as they bring this work into the classroom. Students may not encounter and experience contemporary art in other ways besides this program, and some that may not be able to afford the admission to a museum are able to access contemporary art as it is incorporated into their curriculum. 
   
   Teachers will benefit from having an artist-in-residence as they will have support from a professional artist to provide arts lessons and support in the often overcrowded public school classrooms. Teachers will work directly with the artists to determine appropriate assignments and activities based on the students’ needs and interests. 
   
   Artists living and working in Los Angeles County will benefit from this program and resource as their time will be compensated and this is critical to assist them in being able to provide for themselves as working artists. Expanding their practices to the classroom setting will create new environments for creativity and artistic production. As many artists become teachers to supplements their income, this program will be an excellent tool for those transitioning into the education field. 
   
   All of the aforementioned groups are culturally diverse and range in age, and each will benefit from the Arts LANDed program and website. The general public will benefit from this comprehensive resource of the current art activity throughout Los Angeles County, functioning as an educational tool, connecting link between artists and schools, and a resource for all art happenings.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  As LAND does not have a permanent exhibition space, we approach all projects
  and programs as collaborations. LAND will partner with Los Angeles-based arts
  organizations to include them in Arts LANDed, by integrating their current
  exhibitions and programming onto the website, and offering the resources to be
  involved in the education program, particularly as it relates to upcoming
  exhibitions or with artists that live/work nearby. In the past we have
  partnered with institutions including MOCA, The Getty, LACMA, the Hammer
  Museum, MOLAA, and the MAK Center to engage a large and diverse public
  audience at multiple sites throughout Los Angeles. We would approach
  institutions such as these, along with smaller organizations as well, to be
  involved in the project, offering students access to the highest caliber
  institutions in Los Angeles. These programming partners are not confirmed at
  this stage in the project, but given our past relationships, we feel confident
  that they would be interested in taking part in this program. We would also
  approach other colleagues and organizations we have not yet had the chance to
  work with and would be thrilled to do so, such as The Mistake Room, LACE,
  LA><ART, and 18th Street Art Center. 
   
   LAND’s website designer, Matt Murphy Design and Athletics, designed LAND’s current website, and is a confirmed partner. Athletics has been working on developing the programming for similar aggregate websites, and would design and implement the full website, from design to code to maintenance and updating. Athletics has already begun to set up the wireframe for the website, and is committed to creating a user-friendly, highly functional website and app. 
   
   LAND has not yet collaborated with LAUSD and is very excited about the prospect of doing so. This collaboration is not confirmed, though we feel that the STEAM approach to teaching, where the arts are built in to lessons, shaping connections between concepts and encouraging students to think creatively, would allow for integration of this program seamlessly. STEAM schools would be part of this pilot program, and thereafter, we would expand to other LAUSD schools. 
   
   Three factors that are critical to the success of these collaborations are: 1.Institution’s willingness to participate in the program, in addition to other educational programs in place 2. Athletics’ ability to aggregate all relevant arts listings 3. LAUSD’s openness to integrating this program into existing curricula
