Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  The year long pilot program will benefit kids & the community of South LA, but
  our app based platform will benefit the entire Green Dot Network and then
  hopefully all of LAUSD
What is your idea/project in more detail?: |-
  We have a 3 phase plan!
   
   1) Introduction & development:
   
   We’ll present the PWMP to students, refine our ideas based on feedback & research (with our partners: Green Dot, CalArts, NRBLB) & prepare the pilot after school program
   
   •Needs assessment & partner alignment
   •Research indicators: assess wants/needs of teachers & students, youth attitudes, career aspirations, music level & preferences
   •Survey at-risk indicators (crime rates, enrollment, grades, etc)
   •Refine & plan pilot after school program
   •Recruit & video/record well-known LA musicians for the program
   •Strategic partnership & sponsorship development (includes academic feeder programs)
   
   2) Implement after school pilot program at Locke:
   
   The pilot enables students to work on a song, make a virtual band, learn tech, music & performance skills, culminating in a live student music concert (hopefully with celebrity participation). The pilot will also focus on translating skills into scholarship & career opportunities.
   
   •After-school pilot program in the Locke "Jetspace" (2 hour sessions) twice/week for 20 weeks
   •CalArts teacher/mentors & The New History will run all sessions
   •Program will align with & supplement Locke’s existing music curriculum
   •Students build skills in a safe & fun environment after school
   •Students will write, record, produce (using Garageband, with both physical & software instruments) and perform (live for video capture) their parts to a song
   •Students learn to use basic video editing software (iMovie) to compile their performances together with those of peers and pro musicians to make a “virtual band”
   •Students can share their performances & virtual bands online
   •Students will perform a community music concert with pro LA musicians
   
   3) Build app to scale the PWMP
   
   Informed by the pilot, we’ll build a scalable model using a tablet app based platform that automates the audio/video recording, editing process, as well as creates a student virtual music network.
   
   •Evaluate pilot (follow-up research w/students, community, teachers, musicians)
   •Reassess research indicators (comparative study of students before/after program)
   •Connect students with career opportunities/scholarships
   •Based on the above, build app and online platform to automate and scale PWMP
   •Provide Green Dot network & other under-funded schools with the new PWMP tablet app, to implement a full-scale test program.
   •Create opt-in teacher training program to help implement PWMP
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  By creating a platform that gives our students the skills to play with music,
  technology & each other, we’ll build the foundations of a truly creative
  generation in LA. 
   
   We want LA in 2050 to be a city where our public school kids don’t see the recording industry & famous musicians as being inaccessible. Using basic tech we can enable them to actually play together, create together & inspire each other.
    
   Last year, in Green Dot’s winning LA2050 proposal, they wrote: “More than ever, the city’s communities require inspiration & motivation to believe that something better is possible (…) We work to equip them with the tools necessary to become empowered & authentic agents of change”. The PWMP will validate & expand upon that work to make LA the best place not only to Play in 2050, but to Learn, Create, & Collaborate.
    
   At a time when arts education funding has taken a stark downturn, it’s more vital than ever to use innovative methods & practices to ensure LA’s students (especially the at-risk) have places & contexts to acquire tools to be creative, imaginative & productive members of an engaged society.
    
   Our education system is often accused of separating students from engaging deeply in play & benefiting from the incalculable value & creativity it fosters. The current system can isolate students in a narrow academic paradigm, that earnestly tries to ensure their basic economic survival, but can become deeply uncreative & alienating to kids, resulting in their rejection of education entirely. This, coupled with a rapidly changing society & economy, can leave them unprepared for the “real world”, and/or with skill sets for menial jobs soon obsolete.
    
   We want our kids in 2050 to be given (at least in their music classrooms) the tools to play & collaborate on positive creative projects, & be inspired by mentors that have succeeded in ways they admire. We want our students to then use these tools as a gateway to good jobs in LA.
   
   Music is not just an art form or a career path... at it’s core, it’s a platform for sharing, storytelling & playing together. That’s why music has almost always been at the heart of our communities. If every school in LA participated by 2050, our virtual music network would bridge socio-economic and physical distances, foster connection, & unite students across the city through creative play. Not only would this nourish our economy, but contribute significantly to a safer, more equitable and vibrant city.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  First, it’ll benefit Locke students, teachers & the Watts community.
  Post-pilot, it’ll grow to impact students & educators across LA, and
  eventually, any school with internet access.
    
   Locke was opened in ‘67 in response to the Watts’ riots, to provide the community with a safe & prosperous school. The band program quickly became one of the country’s best, performing at LA Rams games, marching in the Rose Bowl Parade, & traveling globally. Several Locke alumni even went on to successful recording careers as well.
    
   The program has since dwindled into obscurity, with nearly zero enrollment. The equipment & facilities have fallen into total disrepair with broken instruments & band rooms.
    
   This year, Green Dot launched an effort to return Locke’s music program to its former glory, from repairing instruments to renovating classrooms & building an outreach program. A new music curriculum is being designed from scratch, creating a unique opportunity for the PWMP to innovate & inform that process. 
   
   Today, Watts is the 4th deadliest neighborhood in LA County, with 6.6 killings per square mile, and a median age of 21, among the youngest in the county. We must rally hard for these young minds. In 2003, California cut arts funding by 94%. Today, the state spends less than $1 per kid per year.
    
   Music is enough. A study released in 2012 by the National Endowment for the Arts, monitored over 70,000 at-risk American students of various ages for 19 years. They found at-risk students with access to arts-rich curriculum had: higher GPAs & test scores, graduated from high school, attended college, read the newspaper, volunteered & voted.
    
   Another UCLA study of 25,000 middle & high school students found that students involved in the arts watch less TV, did more community service, and were generally more engaged with education.
   
   Our response: create a platform that’s as compelling & fun as it is relevant & useful. We want to build communities & economies by inspiring kids. There’s no lack of opportunity - LA employs more artists than any other city in the U.S., with a sector that consists of nearly 1 million direct & indirect jobs. By 2016, these numbers are projected to grow; for example, we’ll have 14% more sound engineers (earning $59,470/year on average).
   
   When we foster creative platforms & programs, we prepare LA kids for these jobs, creating generations of sustainable communities. Laying these foundations will benefit all of LA by 2050.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  Our confirmed partners are Green Dot Public Schools, No Right Brain Left
  Behind (NRBLB) & CalArts Community Arts Partnership (CAP).
    
   Green Dot is the largest charter school organization in Southern California, serving 10,300 at-risk students in 18 schools across LA, half of them turnarounds of LAUSD’s lowest-performing schools. 90% of students graduate with 76% going on to attend college, making their schools among the highest performing ‘minority’ schools in California. In 2008, Locke was one of the lowest-achieving schools in the nation. Four years into Green Dot’s leadership, Locke scored over 600 API compared to a pre-transformation score of 511. Green Dot’s expertise will guide our implementation at every stage.
    
   NRBLB’s LA2050 award-winning project created the Locke “Jet Space”, which we’ll use as our program’s epicenter. We’ll increase the Jetspace’s impact by bringing music programming and permanent technological infrastructure. In the future, as we expand the PWMP’s reach, we hope to work hand-in-hand with NRBLB as they continue to imagine the future of creative spaces and programing in more schools.
    
   Additionally, we’ll partner with CAP, harnessing their expertise to mentor, teach, research, and co-create school-based arts programs. CAP offers free, after-school and education-based co-curricular arts programs for youth ages 6-18. Their teaching corps comprises of accomplished CalArts faculty, alumni and student instructors. As expert program creators who enable youth to discover and create original works of art, they’ve received numerous honors, including the National Arts and Humanities Youth Program Award, for fostering the creative & intellectual development of America’s children.
    
   Under the leadership of Locke’s new music director, Matthew Cotton, we’ll also forge ties with USC & the LA Opera. We hope to provide access to internships, scholarships, and feeder programs with CAP, USC, LA Opera & more. 
    
   We also hope to attract participation from famous musicians, and inspire students with an opportunity to be in a “virtual band” with them. We’ll lean on our entire professional & personal network to achieve this goal.
    
   Finally, we have relationships with many socially conscious local tech firms, including Pull Creative,100 Years, Ludlow Kingsley & Arts of Olympus, who are all on board to help. Together we will create the most impactful program and platform possible.
