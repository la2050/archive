Which area(s) of LA does your project benefit? Other (elaborate): >-
  M3TNT is a community based arts project performed on the Metro Gold line. It
  is the most innovative transit-oriented “Happening” in Los Angeles, featuring
  music, dance, theatre and puppets along the various stops between Union
  Station and Memorial Park. The production seeks to connect people to areas
  they would not otherwise go and to offer an alternative to sometimes
  inaccessible and expensive art venues. M3TNT with performances in communities
  along strategically selected station stops. Audiences will travel from station
  to station in mixed groups while experiencing a communal journey.
What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  The work to make M3TNT a reality has already begun and though there is still
  much to do we are on pace to a successful opening. To date we have identified
  and secured a core group of theatre artists to consult and collaborate on the
  project including Guillermo Aviles-Rodriguez the creator of Meet Me @Metro and
  an authority on transit-oriented performances in Los Angeles. In March of 2014
  we reached out to the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority
  (Metro) and started the negotiations with Diane Dominguez, Senior Real Estate
  Officer at Metro for the use of selected stops along the Gold line, including
  Union Station, China Town, Highland Park, Mission, Del Mar, and Memorial Park.
  We have also reached out to the Metro Art Docent Council to secure metro
  volunteers during our performances. We will also begin strategic outreach to
  government officials who oversee the areas in which the show happens, such as
  City Council members José Huizar (District 14) and Gilbert Cedillo (District
  1). 
   Another key component of making this project a reality is the community councils and other organizations found along the Gold line route, they will most accurately know the hidden treasures of their community. Ideally, we want to have these groups collaborate in the development of the logistics of the project. Currently our M3TNT production and artistic teams are assembling a strategic project plan to disseminate to potential community and artistic collaborators. It is after this that our artistic collaborators will be selected and oriented to Metro rules and regulations. It is a goal of Company of Angels that all support staff attend a Metro safety training and so we have met with Richard Morallo of Metro’s Community Relations Office to secure spots for all our volunteers and staff well in advance of the technical rehearsal in April of 2015. In addition, it is our goal to secure all permits for performing spaces by November of 2014. All artistic collaborators and performers will need to develop and rehearse their pieces while marketing and outreach plans are designed and executed. During April 2015, we will go into tech rehearsals and performances for key stakeholders and community members. We are working on including a live feed of the opening performance as well as producing short commercials to advertise M3TNT on Metro’s Bus TV channel. During May – July 2015, the surveys distributed during performances will be analyzed and results presented to Metro.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  Considering the unacceptably high level of segregation in Los Angeles, both
  geographic and economic, between poor communities (mostly of color) and more
  affluent communities (mostly White) a project like Meet Me @the Metro:
  Theatre/In/Transit strategically and sensitively provides a safe and creative
  context for these two groups to undertake an interactive and creative journey.
  M3TNT has a unique ability to bring people to view public transportation as a
  familiar and even pleasurable means of transportation as well as holding the
  potential to increase ridership among the artistic community and art
  attendance among the transit using community. A potential long-term effect of
  this brand of art is that people will decide to return to some of the
  communities they visited for the first time during our show, this may even
  provide some of the more economically depressed areas along our shows route to
  experience added income. One strategy we will employ to facilitate this is to
  have merchants along the Gold line offer discount coupons to any M3TNT
  audience members who return to the neighborhood to shop or eat within a month
  of the production. A transit-oriented project like this can also go a long way
  to providing a “hip factor” to public transportation amongst an art going
  public that like, Los Angeles as a whole, is car-centric. 
   For some time now, the art and performance community in Los Angeles has been searching for a model to produce work that is sustainable, accessible and relevant; M3TNT offers a model that achieves these goals effectively. Too many low-income communities are left out of the equation when it comes to interactions with quality arts and performance. Often times, issues of geography prevent people from venturing too far outside their neighborhood. Knowing this, we have the responsibility to assure that the artist of the future will look for new and creative ways to collaborate with non-arts organizations to bring theater to the masses. M3TNT represents a new fusion between art and transit, transporting audience members through LA using a variety of site-specific artistic experiences along Metro. People need this project because it connects them to quality art where they live and work, rather than requiring them to come to it. This project is participatory, encourages audiences to be an active part of the performances, and directly influences the shape and the trajectory of their experiences.
How will your idea/project help make LA the best place to connect today? In LA2050?: >-
  Through Meet Me @the Metro: Theatre/In/Transit, Company of Angels (CoA) seeks
  to reach people who would not otherwise be able to experience art and connect
  them with communities that offer art and culture. Our vision is to serve both
  artists and audiences from all of Los Angeles’ communities. Some key
  populations we want to reach out to include under-represented groups from
  downtown skid row with plans to incorporate a group of skid row performers who
  have taken some of our theatre workshops into the show. We will also set aside
  a portion of our tickets for audience members from key zip codes that have a
  high concentration of low income residents and we will have bilingual
  marketing to reach out to the Spanish speaking community along the Gold line.
  Historically the more affluent and theatre going community has been well
  represented in this brand of work so we are confident that our goal to reach
  out to the less fortunate will not preclude us from marketing to all of Los
  Angeles. In fact, the mixture and connecting of different races and economic
  levels is one of the main goals of M3TNT. The artists - writers, designers,
  actors, directors, stage managers whose work we will exhibit will all
  represent the communities that make up Los Angeles’ diverse landscape and so
  they too are beneficiaries of this project's magic. It should be noted, that
  CoA has a long record of multicultural work. Out of the last 37 main stage
  productions since 2007, 35 have depicted under-represented communities,
  including the LGBTQ, Thai, Mexican immigrant, African-American, Japanese, and
  South Asian communities (The other two plays, which depicted the White
  community, were directed by artists of color).
   The participants in our projects typically range in age from late teen to adult and we will assure a high level of participation from this group in the staging of M3TNT. In the last 2 years, we have produced 10 original works exclusively by theater artists from under-represented groups in Los Angeles, including Latino, African-American, Asian, and LGBTQ and the make up of our M3TNT will be consistent with this trend.
Whom will your project benefit? Please be specific.: >-
  CoA plans to reach out to Los Angeles city and county government, DOT, civic
  organizations, small and large businesses, nonprofit agencies, artists and
  individuals. Thus far, CoA has confirmed collaborations with the following
  organizations all of which have collaborated in the production of
  site-specific work in the past. 
   
   *Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro): http://www.metro.net/
   A fundamental component of Meet Me @the Metro is the smooth travel of our audience from station to station. Metro is the most important organization to help with this. They will provide permits, a group of key volunteers and help with the visibility of the project.
   
   *Opera Del Espacio (ODE): http://www.operadelespacio.org/
   Assuring artistic diversity is important to this production and ODE brings just that, they are a movement based company and have participated in many site-specific transit-oriented projects on Metro trains. 
   
   *Rick Burkhardt: http://princemyshkins.com/rickburkhardt2.html
   Rick is an Obie-award-winning playwright, performer, composer, and songwriter whose original chamber music, theater, and text pieces have been performed all over the world. Rick has unparalleled experience composing music for site-specific transit-oriented projects on Metro trains.
   
   *Vox Box Arts Collective (VAC): http://www.voxboxarts.com/home.html
   VAC is a nonprofit multi-cultural interdisciplinary arts group dedicated to presenting live performance, film, and visual arts to children and adults of diverse incomes, cultures, and abilities. The Artistic Director has experience with Site-specific transit-oriented work. 
   
   *Teatro Arollo//Theater Stream (TA): http://www.teatroarroyo.com/
   TA is the only theatre producing work in the Highland Park area and so they are vital to the artistic and geographic integrity of the project. 
   
   Three factors that are critical to the success of our proposed collaboration with new collaborators are experience with site-specific work, availability of artists and coordination of scheduling. When it comes to non-confirmed collaborators who have not experienced the power of transit-oriented site-specific work these three factors often come up.
