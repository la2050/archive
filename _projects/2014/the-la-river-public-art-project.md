  name: The LA River Public Art Project
  impact_play: "A vibrant and dynamic synthesis of recreation, restored habitats, and curated art sites will transform the LA River zone into a globally significant and vital urban oasis. Through creative, multidimensional planning and infrastructure, and the inclusion of nature, play, and art, the LA River will be a model of urban revitalization and creative play. \r\n\r\nFrom Griffith Park to Downtown Los Angeles the LA River provides a diverse range of active and passive recreation with trails, pocket parks, kayaking and opportunities for recreation. We propose to include combinations of activities and art and expand and enhance our play at the river.    \r\n\r\nWe aspire to high quality and rewarding opportunities for play. Play can be simple, but can challenge and build our bodies, minds, spirits and communities. Play involves and encourages us to be curious, social and healthy. Play is an essential element of the education of our children. Arts and culture experience and education are essential to 21st Century success. \r\n“Arts learning experiences play a vital role in developing students’ capacities for critical thinking, creativity, imagination and innovation. These capacities are increasingly recognized as core skills and competencies that all students need as part of a high-quality and complete 21st-century education….one that includes learning in and through the arts…”2 --The National Task Force on the Arts in Education\r\n\r\nAn inclusionary approach to park and open space planning, as envisioned in the Cultural Master Plan, will avoid segmentation, compartmentalization, and single purpose definitions of nature, art and play. We can transform habitat restoration and traditional recreation into an environment that makes us brighter, healthier and economically successful. A well developed plan for integration of art and cultural programming into public and private revitalization will ensure that we stimulate curiosity, bring forward the unique qualities of the river communities and create resources to inspire our creative community and attract world class tourism.\r\n\r\nIn 2050, arts education and mentorship programs will have created our next-gen artists and maker spaces. LA will be known as a destination for great public art in a unique natural setting. Riverfront neighborhoods will be strengthened and remain vital despite gentrification pressures. An archive of local cultural history will be available as an ongoing document of life and activities along the LA River.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
  who_benefit: "The benefits of The LA River Public Art Project will extend to local residents, regional Los Angeles, the arts communities and the visitors we welcome to LA by supporting creativity and the arts through significant public art commissions and comprehensive public art programs. The creative play spirit in all of us will benefit from a dynamic, intergenerational outdoor art environment. \r\n\r\nThe Cultural Master Plan will contribute to the revitalization of the LA River zone by leveraging substantial public and private investment to strengthen the arts community, river neighborhoods, local fabricators, and educators. A well curated program of arts and culture along the river will enhance the public realm, and fuel our creative and innovative communities. \r\n \r\nLocal river communities will benefit from a more vibrant arts and recreation zone, mentorship and arts education programs, and fabrication incentives in the industrial areas. It will deepen community ties to the riverfront. Regionally, the people Los Angeles benefit from a sustainable, urban resource. \r\n\r\nThe Cultural Master Plan will establish pilot programs in the public school art programs. A commitment to arts education and mentorship programs inspires success in our next-gen artists and makers. Riverfront neighborhoods will be strengthened and remain vital despite gentrification pressures. An archive of local cultural history will be available as an ongoing document of the cultural life and heritage along the LA River. \r\n\r\nThe arts education component will cultivate hands-on and fully integrated learning opportunities in K-12 through higher education programs, as advocated by the Kennedy Center and Cal Arts.  \r\n\r\nThe local workforce will benefit from an incentive program for locally sourced fabrication and production industries and workshops.\r\n\r\nCulturally, local communities will benefit from direct and nearby access to open-air art experiences and intergenerational activities. Emerging and established artists will benefit from opportunities for outdoor art commissions and events. Local artists will benefit from tie-ins to curated art programs, and increased regional awareness of local arts programs.\r\n"

  evaluate: "Art is essential in creating intergenerational, creative, and vibrant play and parks.\r\n\r\nThe primary focus of the LA River Public Art Project is ensure the inclusion of art and culture to enhance the quality and vibrancy of unfolding public spaces of the LA River, so that it will not only serve the local communities, but be a cultural magnet for all of Los Angeles – and the world.   \r\n\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the project will impact the LA2050 Play Metrics in the following ways: \r\n\r\nThe project will facilitate access to open space and park facilities within ¼ mile of residential communities.\r\n\r\nIt will expand afterschool programs to include art and culture, attracting more children and boosting enrollment.\r\n\r\nIncreased participation and visitation to the river will provide more eyes on the parks and trails to discourage crime.\r\n\r\nIncreased positive and productive activities along the river will increase safety in adjacent neighborhoods.\r\n\r\nPrioritize sites within ¼ mile of existing neighborhoods for intergenerational cultural programming.\r\n\r\nImprove the vibrancy of the existing and proposed parks, trails and open spaces with art installations and site specific environments.\r\n\r\nTransform learning and play environments with intergenerational features.\r\n\r\nEstablish art and cultural spaces, installations and events for informal opportunities for play.\r\n\r\nIncrease opportunities for neighborhood events such as block parties, maker events and performances to strengthen social networks. \r\n\r\nCreate opportunities for intellectual stimulation and idea generation triggered by art and culture.  \r\n\r\nCreate greater opportunities for play to reduce stress, and improve physical and mental health.\r\n"
  two_lessons: "Our team brings professional experience to issues within the Cultural Master Plan. The first example cites a project where we developed an intergenerational art and play environment in a museum setting. The second project describes the depth of public planning, design, and project management experience specifically anchored within the Los Angeles area.    \r\n\r\nERW Design designed the gallery and exhibition space for Made in California:NOW, a year-long installation at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art(LACMA). Hailed in a LA Times editorial as “an ingenious effort to make art more accessible…“ the installation was visited by over 100,000 people. \r\n\r\nDesigned for an all-ages audience, the art installations were contemporary, playful, sophisticated. Contemporary and emerging LA artists were invited to develop pieces with the directive that the audience could “…touch, play, and ‘do something’ with the art…”  Children were treated maturely, adults had a chance to play, achieving a truly intergenerational environment.     \r\n\r\nThough the exhibit space and content were atypical for the museum, strong curatorial direction coupled with institutional leadership led to the success of realizing the exhibit. \r\n\r\nEsther Margulies led the team at MLA to develop design and project management of the Metro Goldline Eastside Access Phase II.  The project provided valuable experience in developing cohesive corridor wide planning and design, in collaboration with multiple facets of the East Los Angeles business, residential and education communities. The design phase of this project was guided by periodic meetings and discussions with the project Community Advisory Committee.  This group acted as a sounding board for preliminary proposals and served as a communications conduit to the larger community and elected officials.  Some of the prime objectives of the Phase II project included improved awareness of the light rail system,  increased civic pride and increased visibility and awareness of the diverse cultures along the route.  Design proposals include a cohesive system of identity elements and way finding signage incorporating local cultural themes.  The way finding system establishes a framework for corridor wide consistency which can be scaled and customized as the transit line is further expanded.\r\n\r\n"
  achievable_goal: "Based on our Implementation Plan detailed in our response to Question 5, the following outline is a timetable to achieve implementation, with final delivery of the Cultural Master Plan, in a 12 month project schedule.  Taking into account key activities, activity resources and activity durations, as well as project sequencing, we have established deliverables and milestones keyed to specific project phases to manage timely completion of the project.  This project schedule and related work will serve as the baseline against which time performance is measured.  \r\n\r\nPHASE 1 | September, 2014\r\nKickoff with project goals and objectives identified; review and summarize previous and current projects and initiatives; research precedents\r\n\r\nPHASE 2A | September-October, 2014\r\nStakeholder and Community Advisory Committee, develop specific meeting schedules, agendas and goals; obtain participation commitments, and Public Agency coordination. Conduct initial meetings.\r\n\r\nPHASE 2B | October 2014-February 2015\r\nStudy potential sites and overall systems with associated rough order of magnitude project costs. Meet with stakeholders for an iterative cycle review process.\r\n\r\nPHASE 2C  | November 2014–March, 2015\r\nCoordinate with public agencies and organizations to establish principles integration. Identify workforce, fabrication and operations needs, resources, and opportunities with future private development. Establish points of intersection for K-12 through higher education levels, cultural arts institutions, foundations, and public agencies. \r\n\r\nPHASE 3 | March-June 2015\r\nWe will develop guidelines for opportunity site identification, and overall arts and culture options and prototype sites.  \r\nThe completed Cultural Master Plan will include recommendations for: a) Arts and Culture Education, b) Arts and Culture Fabrication and Workforce Development c) Arts and Culture Operations. It will also include funding and implementation Policy and Resources, recommendations on Policy Development and implementation, recommended sources of funding, and recommended institutional support.\r\n\r\nPHASE 4 | June-July, 2015\r\nDraft of Cultural Master Plan and circulation to key stakeholders\r\n\r\nPHASE 5 | August, 2015\r\nFinal circulation and presentation\r\n"
  major_challenges: "The most challenging issue facing all river projects, including the proposed Cultural Master Plan, is coordination between public agencies and their interface with each other and private interests. The need for public stewardship has been raised at numerous planning workshops and sessions, and is the next level of resolution required for successful implementation of LA River projects.\r\n\r\nAll too often, the tendency for single-issue infrastructure planning and development prevents dynamic solutions. The present opportunity at the LA River calls for invigorating cross-platform strategic thinking to generate multi-purpose and multi-dimensional projects. \r\n\r\nWe strongly believe that one of the most successful strategies for successful implementation of the Cultural Master Plan is securing a ‘seat at the table’ at the formative stages of development. Our proposal has received broad interest and support from a number of community based organizations.\r\n“It’s a great idea for LA2050, and yes, finding intersections would be great for the NELA Riverfront area.” (George Villanueva, Director, Northeast Los Angeles Riverfront Collaborative)  \r\n\r\nTo assure implementation of the Cultural Master Plan, we will need a commitment and buy-in from public agencies such as the City River Office, the Department of Cultural Affairs, and the Department of Parks and Recreation. Buy-in could take the form of a funded curation office within the city structure.\r\n"
  competition: "We are not aware of other organizations or teams working on a cultural Master Plan for the LA River. In fact, the development of this idea stemmed from a realizing that there was little or no discussion of a cultural component in any of the multitude of proposed projects for the LA River. \r\n\r\nWe applaud the many efforts for singular art activities along the river, but to date there has not been a concerted effort to define and curate ongoing cohesive art planning directly relate the site.  \r\n\r\nThe 2007 Los Angeles River Master Plan advocated the development of ‘a River Arts Program that reflects and celebrates the history of the River and the diverse cultures of its surrounding neighborhoods.’  The plan recognized the importance of local arts and culture in the revitalization of the river.  The Master Plan sketched out an initial framework for the administration of a multi-jurisdictional program and for the development of guidelines for arts and cultural project along the length of the river.  We look forward to engaging the river communities instrumental in moving the River forward as a public space and build upon the efforts of NELA, LRRC, FOLAR, Northeast Trees, MRCA, and Neighborhood Councils. \r\n       \t\r\n\r\nIn numerous studies of significant public spaces, it is recognized that arts and cultural ingredients are key to socially and economically sustainable public spaces.  Recent cultural planning documents have been created for the Seattle Waterfront District, the City of Lyon, France, and the City of Saint Paul, Minnesota. Similar to the proposed LA River Cultural Master Plan, these documents address issues related to multiple programmatic platforms, short and long term strategies, opportunity sites, cost and maintenance requirements, and critical coordination requirements with parallel infrastructure projects. \r\n"
  cost: "In our professional experience with projects of similar scope, timeline and deliverables, we estimate the Cultural Master Plan budget to be approximately $100,000. The project budget was established based on hourly rates for key staff and personnel as well as reimbursable expenses directly related to the project.  \r\n\r\nWhile we have gone to great measures to establish a comprehensive and realistic project budget, should additional funding become required due to unforeseen circumstances, we have identified potential sources of additional funding.  We would seek funding through the following resources should it be required:\r\n\r\n1) Sappi Ideas that Matter Grant (http://www.na.sappi.com/ideasthatmatterNA/index.html)\r\n2) ArtPlace America Grant (http://www.artplaceamerica.org/)\r\n"
  budget: "The following is the estimated budget for the Cultural Master Plan, keyed to the Implementation phases described in Question 5.\r\n\r\nWe estimate the Cultural Master Plan to be delivered for $100,000. The cost of services and deliverables is allocated in the following manner:\r\n\r\nPhase 1 Kickoff Phase: 10% of budget \r\nPhase 2A Stakeholder and Advisory groups formed: 10% of budget\r\nPhase 2B Site studies and programs identified: iterative process 25% of budget\r\nPhase 2C Coordinate with agencies and organizatons: 25% budget\r\nPhase 3 Guidelines, options, and prototypes: 10% of budget\r\nPhase 4 Draft Cultural Master Plan: 10% budget\r\nPhase 5 Final circulation and Presentation: 10% budget\r\n\r\nThe cost of each phase of the project has been established based on our experience with similar projects of similar scope and timelines.  The basis of the budget allocations, as discussed previously, is the hourly rates for key personnel, staff, and reimbursable expenses directly related to the project.\r\n"

What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  A vibrant and dynamic synthesis of recreation, restored habitats, and curated
  art sites will transform the LA River zone into a globally significant and
  vital urban oasis. Through creative, multidimensional planning and
  infrastructure, and the inclusion of nature, play, and art, the LA River will
  be a model of urban revitalization and creative play. 
   
   From Griffith Park to Downtown Los Angeles the LA River provides a diverse range of active and passive recreation with trails, pocket parks, kayaking and opportunities for recreation. We propose to include combinations of activities and art and expand and enhance our play at the river. 
   
   We aspire to high quality and rewarding opportunities for play. Play can be simple, but can challenge and build our bodies, minds, spirits and communities. Play involves and encourages us to be curious, social and healthy. Play is an essential element of the education of our children. Arts and culture experience and education are essential to 21st Century success. 
   “Arts learning experiences play a vital role in developing students’ capacities for critical thinking, creativity, imagination and innovation. These capacities are increasingly recognized as core skills and competencies that all students need as part of a high-quality and complete 21st-century education….one that includes learning in and through the arts…”2 --The National Task Force on the Arts in Education
   
   An inclusionary approach to park and open space planning, as envisioned in the Cultural Master Plan, will avoid segmentation, compartmentalization, and single purpose definitions of nature, art and play. We can transform habitat restoration and traditional recreation into an environment that makes us brighter, healthier and economically successful. A well developed plan for integration of art and cultural programming into public and private revitalization will ensure that we stimulate curiosity, bring forward the unique qualities of the river communities and create resources to inspire our creative community and attract world class tourism.
   
   In 2050, arts education and mentorship programs will have created our next-gen artists and maker spaces. LA will be known as a destination for great public art in a unique natural setting. Riverfront neighborhoods will be strengthened and remain vital despite gentrification pressures. An archive of local cultural history will be available as an ongoing document of life and activities along the LA River.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The benefits of The LA River Public Art Project will extend to local
  residents, regional Los Angeles, the arts communities and the visitors we
  welcome to LA by supporting creativity and the arts through significant public
  art commissions and comprehensive public art programs. The creative play
  spirit in all of us will benefit from a dynamic, intergenerational outdoor art
  environment. 
   
   The Cultural Master Plan will contribute to the revitalization of the LA River zone by leveraging substantial public and private investment to strengthen the arts community, river neighborhoods, local fabricators, and educators. A well curated program of arts and culture along the river will enhance the public realm, and fuel our creative and innovative communities. 
    
   Local river communities will benefit from a more vibrant arts and recreation zone, mentorship and arts education programs, and fabrication incentives in the industrial areas. It will deepen community ties to the riverfront. Regionally, the people Los Angeles benefit from a sustainable, urban resource. 
   
   The Cultural Master Plan will establish pilot programs in the public school art programs. A commitment to arts education and mentorship programs inspires success in our next-gen artists and makers. Riverfront neighborhoods will be strengthened and remain vital despite gentrification pressures. An archive of local cultural history will be available as an ongoing document of the cultural life and heritage along the LA River. 
   
   The arts education component will cultivate hands-on and fully integrated learning opportunities in K-12 through higher education programs, as advocated by the Kennedy Center and Cal Arts. 
   
   The local workforce will benefit from an incentive program for locally sourced fabrication and production industries and workshops.
   
   Culturally, local communities will benefit from direct and nearby access to open-air art experiences and intergenerational activities.

    answer: "A vibrant and dynamic synthesis of recreation, restored habitats, and curated art sites will transform the LA River zone into a globally significant and vital urban oasis. Through creative, multidimensional planning and infrastructure, and the inclusion of nature, play, and art, the LA River will be a model of urban revitalization and creative play. \r\n\r\nFrom Griffith Park to Downtown Los Angeles the LA River provides a diverse range of active and passive recreation with trails, pocket parks, kayaking and opportunities for recreation. We propose to include combinations of activities and art and expand and enhance our play at the river.    \r\n\r\nWe aspire to high quality and rewarding opportunities for play. Play can be simple, but can challenge and build our bodies, minds, spirits and communities. Play involves and encourages us to be curious, social and healthy. Play is an essential element of the education of our children. Arts and culture experience and education are essential to 21st Century success. \r\n“Arts learning experiences play a vital role in developing students’ capacities for critical thinking, creativity, imagination and innovation. These capacities are increasingly recognized as core skills and competencies that all students need as part of a high-quality and complete 21st-century education….one that includes learning in and through the arts…”2 --The National Task Force on the Arts in Education\r\n\r\nAn inclusionary approach to park and open space planning, as envisioned in the Cultural Master Plan, will avoid segmentation, compartmentalization, and single purpose definitions of nature, art and play. We can transform habitat restoration and traditional recreation into an environment that makes us brighter, healthier and economically successful. A well developed plan for integration of art and cultural programming into public and private revitalization will ensure that we stimulate curiosity, bring forward the unique qualities of the river communities and create resources to inspire our creative community and attract world class tourism.\r\n\r\nIn 2050, arts education and mentorship programs will have created our next-gen artists and maker spaces. LA will be known as a destination for great public art in a unique natural setting. Riverfront neighborhoods will be strengthened and remain vital despite gentrification pressures. An archive of local cultural history will be available as an ongoing document of life and activities along the LA River.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    answer: "Our team brings professional experience to issues within the Cultural Master Plan. The first example cites a project where we developed an intergenerational art and play environment in a museum setting. The second project describes the depth of public planning, design, and project management experience specifically anchored within the Los Angeles area.    \r\n\r\nERW Design designed the gallery and exhibition space for Made in California:NOW, a year-long installation at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art(LACMA). Hailed in a LA Times editorial as “an ingenious effort to make art more accessible…“ the installation was visited by over 100,000 people. \r\n\r\nDesigned for an all-ages audience, the art installations were contemporary, playful, sophisticated. Contemporary and emerging LA artists were invited to develop pieces with the directive that the audience could “…touch, play, and ‘do something’ with the art…”  Children were treated maturely, adults had a chance to play, achieving a truly intergenerational environment.     \r\n\r\nThough the exhibit space and content were atypical for the museum, strong curatorial direction coupled with institutional leadership led to the success of realizing the exhibit. \r\n\r\nEsther Margulies led the team at MLA to develop design and project management of the Metro Goldline Eastside Access Phase II.  The project provided valuable experience in developing cohesive corridor wide planning and design, in collaboration with multiple facets of the East Los Angeles business, residential and education communities. The design phase of this project was guided by periodic meetings and discussions with the project Community Advisory Committee.  This group acted as a sounding board for preliminary proposals and served as a communications conduit to the larger community and elected officials.  Some of the prime objectives of the Phase II project included improved awareness of the light rail system,  increased civic pride and increased visibility and awareness of the diverse cultures along the route.  Design proposals include a cohesive system of identity elements and way finding signage incorporating local cultural themes.  The way finding system establishes a framework for corridor wide consistency which can be scaled and customized as the transit line is further expanded.\r\n\r\n"

  - name: major_challenges

    explanation: ''
    answer: "The most challenging issue facing all river projects, including the proposed Cultural Master Plan, is coordination between public agencies and their interface with each other and private interests. The need for public stewardship has been raised at numerous planning workshops and sessions, and is the next level of resolution required for successful implementation of LA River projects.\r\n\r\nAll too often, the tendency for single-issue infrastructure planning and development prevents dynamic solutions. The present opportunity at the LA River calls for invigorating cross-platform strategic thinking to generate multi-purpose and multi-dimensional projects. \r\n\r\nWe strongly believe that one of the most successful strategies for successful implementation of the Cultural Master Plan is securing a ‘seat at the table’ at the formative stages of development. Our proposal has received broad interest and support from a number of community based organizations.\r\n“It’s a great idea for LA2050, and yes, finding intersections would be great for the NELA Riverfront area.” (George Villanueva, Director, Northeast Los Angeles Riverfront Collaborative)  \r\n\r\nTo assure implementation of the Cultural Master Plan, we will need a commitment and buy-in from public agencies such as the City River Office, the Department of Cultural Affairs, and the Department of Parks and Recreation. Buy-in could take the form of a funded curation office within the city structure.\r\n"

    answer: "We are not aware of other organizations or teams working on a cultural Master Plan for the LA River. In fact, the development of this idea stemmed from a realizing that there was little or no discussion of a cultural component in any of the multitude of proposed projects for the LA River. \r\n\r\nWe applaud the many efforts for singular art activities along the river, but to date there has not been a concerted effort to define and curate ongoing cohesive art planning directly relate the site.  \r\n\r\nThe 2007 Los Angeles River Master Plan advocated the development of ‘a River Arts Program that reflects and celebrates the history of the River and the diverse cultures of its surrounding neighborhoods.’  The plan recognized the importance of local arts and culture in the revitalization of the river.  The Master Plan sketched out an initial framework for the administration of a multi-jurisdictional program and for the development of guidelines for arts and cultural project along the length of the river.  We look forward to engaging the river communities instrumental in moving the River forward as a public space and build upon the efforts of NELA, LRRC, FOLAR, Northeast Trees, MRCA, and Neighborhood Councils. \r\n       \t\r\n\r\nIn numerous studies of significant public spaces, it is recognized that arts and cultural ingredients are key to socially and economically sustainable public spaces.  Recent cultural planning documents have been created for the Seattle Waterfront District, the City of Lyon, France, and the City of Saint Paul, Minnesota. Similar to the proposed LA River Cultural Master Plan, these documents address issues related to multiple programmatic platforms, short and long term strategies, opportunity sites, cost and maintenance requirements, and critical coordination requirements with parallel infrastructure projects. \r\n"
