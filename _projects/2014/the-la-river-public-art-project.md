  Keyed to Recommendation 5.16 of the 2007 LA River Revitalization Master Plan,
  the Cultural Master Plan will be a framework and guidelines for strategic
  sites for short term, temporary and permanent arts installations, community
  mentorship programs, and fabrication resources. It will serve as a prototype
  for the entire waterway linking communities to the river.
   
   PHASE 1|The kickoff phase will identify project goals and objectives and refine project scope and schedule. We will review and summarize all projects and initiatives related to Arts, Culture, River Revitalization, within the ARBOR area. 
   
   PHASE 2A|We will develop a Stakeholder and Community Advisory Committee, develop meeting schedules, agendas and goals. We will obtain participation commitments for Public Agency coordination, including initial meetings with USACE, City of LA, Burbank, and Glendale, and LA County. 
   
   PHASE 2B|We will study potential public and private sites and overall systems such as: bridges, overpasses, pocket parks, property frontage, viewsheds, river access points, wayfinding, and empty and underused lots for temporary, short term and permanent arts and culture integration, Recommendations will include rough order of magnitude project costs and time frames. Meet with CAC, Stakeholders, Organizations and Agencies to obtain feedback iterative cycle.
   
   PHASE 2C|We will coordinate with public agencies and organizations to establish principles of integration with ongoing River projects. 
   We will establish potential project costs, time frames and partner organizations for each site
   
   We will identify workforce, fabrication and operations needs and resources in river adjacent communities. We will identify opportunities for coordination with future private development.We will develop education and mentorship programs with K-12, higher education levels, cultural arts institutions, foundations, and public agencies.
   PHASE 3|We will develop curation guidelines for opportunity sites and overall arts and culture options and prototypes. 
   Phase 4|Draft Cultural Master Plan and circulation to key Stakeholders 
   PHASE 5|Final Report and Circulation
   The completed Cultural Master Plan will include recommendations for: Arts and Culture Education, Arts and Culture Fabrication and Workforce Development and Arts and Culture Operations.

What is your idea/project in more detail?: >-
  A vibrant and dynamic synthesis of recreation, restored habitats, and curated
  art sites will transform the LA River zone into a globally significant and
  vital urban oasis. Through creative, multidimensional planning and
  infrastructure, and the inclusion of nature, play, and art, the LA River will
  be a model of urban revitalization and creative play. 
   
   From Griffith Park to Downtown Los Angeles the LA River provides a diverse range of active and passive recreation with trails, pocket parks, kayaking and opportunities for recreation. We propose to include combinations of activities and art and expand and enhance our play at the river. 
   
   We aspire to high quality and rewarding opportunities for play. Play can be simple, but can challenge and build our bodies, minds, spirits and communities. Play involves and encourages us to be curious, social and healthy. Play is an essential element of the education of our children. Arts and culture experience and education are essential to 21st Century success. 
   “Arts learning experiences play a vital role in developing students’ capacities for critical thinking, creativity, imagination and innovation. These capacities are increasingly recognized as core skills and competencies that all students need as part of a high-quality and complete 21st-century education….one that includes learning in and through the arts…”2 --The National Task Force on the Arts in Education
   
   An inclusionary approach to park and open space planning, as envisioned in the Cultural Master Plan, will avoid segmentation, compartmentalization, and single purpose definitions of nature, art and play. We can transform habitat restoration and traditional recreation into an environment that makes us brighter, healthier and economically successful. A well developed plan for integration of art and cultural programming into public and private revitalization will ensure that we stimulate curiosity, bring forward the unique qualities of the river communities and create resources to inspire our creative community and attract world class tourism.
   
   In 2050, arts education and mentorship programs will have created our next-gen artists and maker spaces. LA will be known as a destination for great public art in a unique natural setting. Riverfront neighborhoods will be strengthened and remain vital despite gentrification pressures. An archive of local cultural history will be available as an ongoing document of life and activities along the LA River.
What will you do to implement this idea/project?: >-
  The benefits of The LA River Public Art Project will extend to local
  residents, regional Los Angeles, the arts communities and the visitors we
  welcome to LA by supporting creativity and the arts through significant public
  art commissions and comprehensive public art programs. The creative play
  spirit in all of us will benefit from a dynamic, intergenerational outdoor art
  environment. 
   
   The Cultural Master Plan will contribute to the revitalization of the LA River zone by leveraging substantial public and private investment to strengthen the arts community, river neighborhoods, local fabricators, and educators. A well curated program of arts and culture along the river will enhance the public realm, and fuel our creative and innovative communities. 
    
   Local river communities will benefit from a more vibrant arts and recreation zone, mentorship and arts education programs, and fabrication incentives in the industrial areas. It will deepen community ties to the riverfront. Regionally, the people Los Angeles benefit from a sustainable, urban resource. 
   
   The Cultural Master Plan will establish pilot programs in the public school art programs. A commitment to arts education and mentorship programs inspires success in our next-gen artists and makers. Riverfront neighborhoods will be strengthened and remain vital despite gentrification pressures. An archive of local cultural history will be available as an ongoing document of the cultural life and heritage along the LA River. 
   
   The arts education component will cultivate hands-on and fully integrated learning opportunities in K-12 through higher education programs, as advocated by the Kennedy Center and Cal Arts. 
   
   The local workforce will benefit from an incentive program for locally sourced fabrication and production industries and workshops.
   
   Culturally, local communities will benefit from direct and nearby access to open-air art experiences and intergenerational activities. Emerging and established artists will benefit from opportunities for outdoor art commissions and events. Local artists will benefit from tie-ins to curated art programs, and increased regional awareness of local arts programs.
