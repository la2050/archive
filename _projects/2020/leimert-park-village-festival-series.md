title: Leimert Park Village Festival Series
project_summary: >
  Leimert Park Village celebrates more African derived festival traditions than
  maybe any other community in the region. Mostly self-financed, these festivals
  have contributed to the vitality  and reputation of Leimert Park as a
  resilient center of Black art and culture.  This grant will curate   an
  international festival series, and produce Los Angeles Carnival  as the Series
  highlight. The Leimert Park Festival Series will be marketed to help  brand
  Leimert Park as the destination of choice for art and culture from  the
  African Diaspora.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Amplified creative activity and community building in Leimert Park have
  resulted in its  re-discovery by the wider community.  Exciting projects such
  as renovation of the Historic Vision Theater,    a Metro Station and
  innovative projects like Destination Crenshaw have caught the eye of 
  developers, creating a sense of shifting ground  beneath   the community. 
  Stability and identity have always been tied  to arts,  festivals and events
  in the Village.  For decades this has given the community a sense of
  ownership, fellowship and a way to maintain traditions.  Businesses and
  festivals now feel under threat of displacement by encroaching developments
  and have no support systems. The time is now to build resilience by investing
  in the natural assets of the community.  Festivals are a strong community
  asset. Curating them into a series will attract sponsors, create partnerships
  and transform this cultural asset into an economic one that also sustains the
  community's essential character.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  This project is a continuation of our organization’s mission, working with the
  community to transform Leimert Park Village from blight to prosperity.  In
  tandem with community leaders, International Eye has been deeply involved in
  advocacy and community building since 2010. Supported by California Arts
  Council, DCA and other funders, it has emerged as the strongest producer of
  outdoor programming in the Village.   In 2014 Leimert Park leaders formed a
  revitalization Task Force and developed 'Vision 2020.'  Within this Vision,
  International Eye LA has been supporting producers while also producing
  various grant-funded festivals and events, usually transforming desolate
  streets into exciting event venues.  Curating LPV festivals into a Series is a
  natural outcome of our objectives and brings cohesion to everyone’s work. Our
  organization's mission is to transform communities through arts, culture and
  humanities. This project embodies its mission and validates its very
  existence.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Our vision for success includes:

  1. Curating and presenting Leimert Park Festival Series and producing LA
  Carnival between July, 2020 - July, 2021.

  2. Collaborating with 50% -75% of Leimert Park independent festival producers.

  3. Including youth participants in the organization and implementation of the
  Series.

  4. Establishing a formal entity such as a ‘Producers Alliance,’ to support 
  independent festival producers in Leimert Park.

  5. Establishing a robust brand presence for the Festival Series, including
  online and traditional marketing, a robust website, an annual calendar and a
  community engagement strategy.


  Quantitative outcome will be evaluated by documenting if there has been
  increased festival attendance,  new collaborations, increased production
  capacity, expanded marketing reach, economic growth. 


  Qualitative evaluation will be measured by anecdotal responses of any change
  in levels of enjoyment, personal impressions of the events and whether
  attendees will recommend friends or return to festivals in the series. 
  Evaluation will also include whether strategies for long term development are
  being developed or considered.


  Evaluation tools will include survey forms, anecdotal responses, headcounts
  and logging number of repeat visitors throughout the Series. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '20000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '100000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Leimert Park is a unique, culturally rich community of authentic black arts
  and culture.  It embodies the  African Diaspora from Africa to the Caribbean,
  Europe and the Americas. However, years of shifting demographics and blight
  resulted in a 2014 L. A. Times article partly characterizing the Village as ‘a
  ghost town of broken windows and empty storefronts.’  Leimert Park Vision
  2020, the Vision Theater, a Metro Station and a profusion of  festivals are
  revitalizing the Village. These   celebrations anchor a community rooted in
  African derived cultures and traditions. Curating a Festival Series provides
  structure, marketability  and  a way to support, market and re-imagine Leimert
  Park Village as a safe and exciting destination.
