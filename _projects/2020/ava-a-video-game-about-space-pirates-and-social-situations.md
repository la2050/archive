title: 'Ava: A video game about space pirates and social situations'
project_summary: >-
  Our premier game series, Ava, is a space pirate-themed adventure game that
  breaks down social interactions through interactive dialogue and emotional
  systems, encourages self-advocacy, and reminds autistic youth that they belong
  with characters that represent and understand them. With the help of the
  MyLA2050 Grants Challenge, we'll be able to finish developing Ava and run
  subsidized pilots of our game with schools and autism service providers in the
  Greater LA area who need it most.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - San Gabriel Valley
  - South LA
  - Westside
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Autistic youth are told they don’t belong, that social/emotional skills will
  always be a struggle for them. They’re told that their identity is an insult
  (e.g. ‘autistic’ as a slur), that they’re broken and need to be fixed. They’re
  5x as likely to be bullied and 10x as likely to die by suicide compared to
  neurotypical peers. We believe there are two root causes of this issue: the
  lack of positive, nuanced representation of autistic characters in media and
  the focus that digital autism products hold on changing behavior, rather than
  empowering autistic youth to embrace who they are. Autistic youth are also 2
  times as likely to play video games. While this is in part due to the
  structured and objective design of games, there’s another underlying reason:
  video games make us feel safe. They give us a space to understand and interact
  with human experiences without fear of judgement or rejection.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  As CEO, I have a background in neuroscience research and a deeply personal
  connection to autism–I’m autistic. I started this company because of the
  mental health challenges that I faced growing up on the spectrum. My team and
  I are determined to create a future in which neurodivergent youth never have
  to go through what I did. Our games are built by and for the autism community,
  based on autism community feedback, and deliver social emotional learning and
  support through a medium that autistic youth already enjoy. 

  My co-founders’ backgrounds span game development, visual art, and business,
  including experience in software development and business analytics at other
  startups. All co-founders have worked full-time on Social Cipher for over a
  year now. We’ve also brought on a narrative writer from Riot Games, an
  animator, a sound designer, and two autistic neurodiversity consultants (all
  part-time). Our advisors include a Rock Band product executive and a former
  Ask/dictionary.com CEO. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  We currently measure our impact through feedback and engagement in our
  playtesting groups. We’re now working with educator partners to quantify how
  Ava might help increase self-confidence, self-advocacy, and feelings of
  belonging. We also track our impact by qualitative personal stories of players
  touched by our characters, narrative, and gameplay. 


  Overall, it's our mission to give young people everywhere the power to build
  social-emotional skills through play. Success would mean giving these youth
  positive representation of characters like themselves and pride in their
  identity; a sense of belonging and community; and increased social-emotional
  competencies like self-efficacy and relationship building.We imagine future
  episodes and products helping neurodivergent people as they enter the
  workforce and beyond, venturing across the autism spectrum, and even providing
  game-based social-emotional learning for the general population. We imagine
  utilizing AI in-game to gain a better understanding of communities typically
  underrepresented in autism research. In the short term, though, we recognize
  that a video game alone cannot “solve” social skills for autistic youth – nor
  should it. Rather, we aim to give these young people an environment where they
  can fail safely, build confidence, and know that they’re not alone.   
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '1000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '3000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Our focus groups and target pilot schools  are mainly charter schools in the
  greater LA area that serve about 70-90% students of color because we’ve seen
  such a huge need for our product here. According to interviews with educators
  and counselors in communities like these, counselors are overwhelmed and
  outnumbered by the sheer number of students in need of their services and
  social-emotional skills development. We’ve gotten feedback from professionals
  in these environments that Ava could be useful in modeling behavior and as
  supplemental learning (or “cooldown time”) for students with conditions other
  than  autism, such as ADHD, PTSD, and anxiety.
