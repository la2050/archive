title: LA Eco-Village Community Hub
project_summary: >-
  The LA Eco-Village Community Hub will be a welcoming and vibrant place for LA
  residents to learn how to live healthier, more resilient, and less
  environmentally impactful lives.  By transforming a former auto repair shop
  into a community venue, surrounded by a demonstration urban farm, the LA
  Eco-Village (LAEV) will build on its nearly 30 year history and extend its
  outreach capacity. Programs will include, film screenings, educational tours,
  food growing classes, a food coop, and expert workshops on all aspects of
  resilient living.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  The potential disasters facing LA communities are increasing. Now is the time
  to build community capacity and resilience – especially in the most vulnerable
  areas. The LAEV Community Hub will be located in a mostly immigrant
  neighborhood with multiple stressors that limit ability to recover from
  disasters, including a poverty rate of 42%. Our partners at the Bresee
  Foundation serve vulnerable families in the 100th percentile for lack of
  insurance and the 99th percentile for lack of home ownership. The Hub will be
  within walking distance of 8 public schools, which are under-resourced and
  have limited garden/farm learning opportunities. Educating these school
  children, and connecting with their families, will be at the heart of the
  outreach program, enabled by this grant. Using food and culture as the
  foundations of community connection, we will draw local and county residents
  to the Community Hub, creating a deep and sustained movement toward greater
  community resilience.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Building on almost 3 decade’s experience, demonstrating higher quality, lower
  impact urban living patterns, LAEV plans to increase the availability of its
  resources for local community benefit. The Cooperative Resources and Services
  Project (CRSP), LAEV’s founding organization, owns the converted auto-repair
  shop property outright and is committed to utilizing it as a community
  resource.  This project will be the latest in a long line of successful
  ventures to emerge from LAEV and CRSP, including LA County Bicycle Coalition,
  Cafecito Organico, LA Permaculture Guild, and CicLAvia.

  LAEV members produce a considerable amount of food on our residential
  properties and manage our learning garden in collaboration with LAUSD. CRSP
  holds regular tours of LAEV for schools, colleges, and members of the public.
  As a community we practice disaster preparedness and plan to share these
  skills at the Hub. We anticipate partnering with our Rampart Village
  Neighborhood Council in this effort.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: "In the short term we aim to maximize opportunities for community contact and knowledge sharing in our local area. We will track our progress with the following metrics (annual targets in brackets):  \n*\tSchool student attendance of developmentally appropriate educational tours – K-12 and urban farming classes (2000)\n*\tNumber of free public talks by experts on resilience provided - with accommodation of languages other than English (25)\n*\tAttendance of free public talks on resilience (1000)\n*\tWebsite and social media posts, referencing resilience, access to fresh food, and water conservation\n*\tOnline resilience dashboard hits\n\nAdditional metrics are:\n*\tUrban farm food production\n*\tOrganic waste from food consumed and produced on-site\n*\tOn-site compost production\n*\tFood coop produce at the Hub\n*\tWater use reduction from conservation and advanced urban farming methods\n\nA survey of the community will be conducted with questions on whether residents feel more prepared to handle a large-scale disaster as a result of what they have learned at the Hub.\nWe want to see concrete steps taken by local residents to increase resilience for the long term. This could include organizing and developing disaster preparedness plans, creating new community farms, accessing and expanding the food coop, or investing in community solar and greywater systems. Above all we want to increase social cohesion and we want the Hub to be widely seen as the essential focal point for community resilience, over the long term."
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '3000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '15000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  We want schools to create/expand their own urban farm programs and we want
  residents to start growing their own food. Our water conservation workshops
  will result in reduced water use. These effects, and many others, will
  ultimately reduce the community’s environmental impact.

  The Hub is intended to serve all county residents and will be a model for
  other areas emulate. Being centrally situated, within walking distance of red
  and purple metro line stops, we encourage car-free journeys to connect with
  us. For those unable to make the journey, the Hub website and resilience
  dashboard will facilitate remote engagement. LAEV has an established online
  presence and we are part of the Global Eco-Village Network – our impact is
  international.
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': "LAEV has many on-going community partnerships. This project will build on existing relationships with the following:\n*\tUrban Soil/Tierra Urbana: The cooperative of LAEV residents will collaborate through educational tours, public talks, gardening workshops, and farm volunteering. \n*\tBeverly-Vermont Community Land Trust: The land trust will ensure the demonstration farm is a compliment to the Bimini Place Learning Garden, which it oversees.\n*\tBresee Foundation: Our partners at this vital local youth center will develop opportunities for children and young people to engage with the Hub, including liaising with local schools, such as Virgil Middle School and Central City Value.\n"
