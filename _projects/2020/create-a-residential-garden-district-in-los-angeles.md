title: Create a Residential Garden District in Los Angeles
project_summary: >-
  We will select 15 homes on a residential street to install professional
  gardens and rainwater harvesting systems on their front yards, back yards, and
  available rooftops. We will train and hire a green team of gardeners to become
  a fleet of hyper-localized specialists, rotated between gardening trades, and
  paired in groups to learn from each other. For their participation, residents
  would receive a crop share as a part of the arrangement. This will serve as a
  model for creating jobs, food and a resilient society.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - South LA
  - Westside
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Even before COVID-19 struck, Los Angeles was searching for solutions in all
  directions. Air quality was causing asthma in youth across the city. Access to
  healthy food looked more like deserts and institutionalized food
  manufacturing, causing a false sense of scarcity.  Food security had meant
  nutrient-depleted agricultural fields, rendering it useless to decide between
  organic or not because the food still lacked what your body needs. Healthcare
  access meant preventive services that weren't enough because nutrition was
  consistently ignored as medicine, itself. Joblessness alleviation was viewed
  through traditional workplace standards, excluding most non-transitional
  laborers. Local water was a billion gallons of water shipped to LA each day,
  yet we could collect and reuse that much rainwater. 


  In our proposal, hiring a green force of gardeners to create food on
  volunteered front yards will address these concerns, creating economic
  prosperity for each party involved.  
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  The organization began because the founder wanted fresh, dependable food for
  his incoming daughter, and understood the delicate nature of the food system.
  He first began gardening in college in 2002 as a stress reliever, and began
  Crop Swap LA in 2018. Drawing the attention of other community gardeners in
  person and online, the organization of volunteers has built one backyard
  garden, harvested tons of fruit from residents' trees for community benefit
  and opened the West Adams Farmers Market as a community staple for food
  options. The membership boast numerous resiliency skills like growing
  nutrient-rich food, composting, rain water harvesting, seed libraries,
  landscaping, rooftop garden construction, aeroponics, hydroponics,
  preservation, and much more. Getting the attention of TIME Magazine and the
  Mayor of LA, all of this has come together with no budget. We are asking for
  your support to trigger our momentum and turn this dream into a reality. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  We will install front yard gardens, rain water harvesting systems, and
  composting for 7 low-income ($35k/y) residential families along a single
  street. Each garden will be professionally designed and managed by urban
  farmers for high-productivity and efficiency. 


  Our goals are:

  - To grow healthy food locally (3,500 lbs of food per household per year)

  - To create 4 green jobs along the way (FT, salaried, subsidized by farmers
  market sales) 


  Envision lovers strolling down this street and passing by a Crop Swap LA
  gardener, Kris, who is a recently hired reentry citizen and single parent.
  This is her full time job now, maintaining front yard gardens, harvesting the
  bounty from them, and transporting them to the market. The lovers also say
  hello to a neighbor who is tending her own front yard garden. She shares how
  energetic she's been since working in the yard. She's also grateful to earn a
  percentage of the revenue that Crop Swap LA makes, so doesn't mind their
  gardeners passing through to keep it up.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '150'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '1500'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  The impact begins with the 4 full time green employed gardeners and their
  families, and extends to the 7 residential families in low income
  neighborhoods who will receive them. Assuming two apartment buildings
  participate, and 5 single family residents, this could amount to 65+ people.
  Indirectly, whoever purchases nutrient-grown food will be eating the
  healthiest food in the city. This will be available at farmers markets, mobile
  food trucks, and direct to home. It's also known that front yard gardens that
  use rainwater catchment and onsite composting can significantly improve air
  quality. A study in Santa Barbara suggests CA could reach 8% of its greenhouse
  gas reduction goals by installing front yard gardens, helping neighbors
  nearby.

  Tree People (advising role: orchard installations)
  City Plants (advising role: seedlings)
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Access to the LA2050 community
  - Host public events or gatherings
  - 'Capacity, including staff'
  - Strategy assistance and implementation
  - 'Political influence on policies that could improve gardening '
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.:
  - 'Partnerships Lined Up include:'
  - Erin Riley with Hope Gardens (vegetable and native garden installations)
  - Mike Garcia with Enviroscape (rainwater catchment installations)
  - Crop Swap LA (maintenance and distribution)
  - Chrysalis (part time labor and reentry support)
  - Tree People (orchard installations)
  - City Plants (seedlings)
Which metrics will your submission impact?:
  - Access to healthy food
  - Water-use efficiency
  - Resilient communities
Are there any other LA2050 goal categories that your proposal will impact?:
  - LA is the healthiest place to CONNECT
Has your proposal changed due to COVID-19?: >
  Everyone will be required to wear masks, gloves, and to evaluate themselves as
  to whether they are healthy enough to assist in garden installations. Only
  minimal staff/volunteers are to be present for installations, and 
  interactions with the home residents will remain scarce. Other activities have
  minimized but are still moving forward: fruit picking with gloves and masks,
  and the West Adams Farmers Market continues to run with approval from the city
  having visited to observe our containment tactics.
