  New Village will welcome 100 high-need girls of color from underserved
  neighborhoods in LA County, help them pursue a better future through
  interest-driven education and internships, and support their social-emotional
  needs with intensive, personalized services. In a caring community, each

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - South LA
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  For teenage girls who struggle with attendance or school failure, and whose
  personal lives are marked by trauma and personal challenges, appropriate
  education choices are limited. Traditional schools can’t or won’t meet their
  extensive needs. California’s “alternative” schools — mostly continuation
  schools and opportunity schools — typically offer little live classroom
  instruction and even less counseling, social work or other needed resources.


  New Village offers a better alternative. We accept all girls (14 to 21) from
  LA County, but we specifically recruit girls who have dropped out or are
  failing in traditional schools, and/or face significant challenges. These are
  girls who are pregnant or parenting, court-involved, homeless and/or
  immigrants with low English fluency. They are dealing with trauma, abuse and
  poverty, incarcerated or addicted parents, special education needs and mental
  health issues. They are virtually all girls of color from underserved
  neighborhoods. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  New Village is part of the Big Picture Learning network, chartered by LAUSD
  and accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. Our
  exceptional principal and staff bring lived experience and compassion to their
  roles. We support each student’s individual needs, provide a rigorous A-G
  curriculum that qualifies graduates for admission to four-year colleges,
  prioritize the development of strong social-emotional skills, and prepare
  students for employment through workplace readiness training and mentored
  internships. 


  Our Board secures donations of more than $1 million annually to provide
  classes at the California Science Center; a makerspace; arts education;
  college/career preparation; wellness programming; a school social worker,
  psychologist, internship coordinator, college/career counsellor; student
  transportation; and summer school. Our partners provide free child care,
  medical services, mental health counseling, gardening/nutrition workshops and
  meditation training.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Our vision of success is to achieve consistent enrollment of 100 students and
  help each one commit to her education through interest-based, student-driven
  learning and social-emotional supports that will provide a path to college,
  vocational training or gainful employment after graduation. Success will be
  measured by increased enrollment and attendance, academic achievement,
  internship and A-G course completion, and graduation and matriculation rates. 


  Our measurable grant objectives for 2020-21 are:


  1. Average daily attendance will be at least 75%.


  2. At least 75% of students will become work-certified and 70% will complete
  an internship.


  3. Senior class graduation rate will be at least 85%.


  4. At least 90% of the graduates will achieve an A-G diploma (excludes
  homeless and foster youth who are exempt by State laws).


  5. At least 80% of graduates will enroll in a four- or two-year college.


  Senior class graduation rate is calculated by dividing the number of 12th
  graders who graduate by the number who began the school year. We exclude those
  who defer graduation or those who transfer to another school. 


  In the long-term, the grant will result in more young women of color enrolling
  in college and working in meaningful jobs, especially in the fields of
  science, technology and social justice. These resilient young women will
  understand the value of networking, the power of mentoring, and the
  stabilizing impact of wellness on individual and community mental health. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '100'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '500'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  New Village is demonstrating how lasting change is possible when students have
  access to an exceptional educational program, needed social supports and
  game-changing opportunities. We continue to achieve senior class graduation
  rates and college-going success which we believe are without parallel among
  schools that serve similarly at-risk students.


  More than 220 girls have graduated from New Village since 2009. In 2019, we
  had 19 graduates, a 90% senior class graduation rate and 95% of graduates
  received an A-G diploma. Our alumnae can be found at Cal Poly Pomona, Mills
  College, Southern University, three UC campuses, four CSU campuses and three
  city colleges. Four alumnae graduated in 2019 from UCLA, UC Berkeley and
  Howard University.
