title: CostsBeyondTuition.org
project_summary: >-
  CostsBeyondTuition.org will use the LA2050 grant for two purposes:

  a) Matching Grant (50%) - In order to drive micro philanthropists and
  incentivize them to submit donations to our college students, we will use 50%
  of the grant as a matching donation, courtesy of LA2050. This part of the
  grant is restricted to Program Services.

  b) Operating Expenses (50%) - As we scale the organization, we will enhance
  the website, fulfillment model, and our marketing efforts. Half of the grant
  will be allocated as unrestricted funds to scale the organization.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Applying a proven model or solution to a new issue or sector (e.g, using a job
  recruiting software or strategy to match clients to supportive housing sites,
  applying demonstrated strategies from advocating for college affordability to
  advocating for housing affordability and homelessness, etc.)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Sixteen years after graduating with an Associates degree, I decided to finish
  my BS degree. At school, I met a young student: Leslie. One day, I asked
  Leslie about the online homework. She said she hadn’t done it because she
  couldn’t afford the $98 fee to access the portal. In disbelief, I realized
  that college students continue to struggle to cover costs beyond tuition just
  like I once did. I thought to myself how to help Leslie without giving her any
  money. I decided to create an organization that helps college students by
  supplying them with the specific items they need. In less than a week, Leslie
  received 7 items she requested, thanks to 5 generous donors. This immediate
  success led me to believe in this unique platform and the impact it will have
  on college students. To ensure integrity, our team will vet requests, purchase
  items, and ship them directly to students. College students will have a simple
  way to get resources and donors can trust donations will be used as intended.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  I am uniquely suited for this organization for the following reasons: I too
  struggled during college. Most of the time I only had $5 (or less) to eat
  during school, and in many cases I was not able to purchase books because they
  were beyond my budget. I have a personal connection to CostsBeyondTuition,org
  because I see myself in the students’ stories. CostsBeyondTuition.org is
  similar to DonorsChoose, a very successful nonprofit organization helping
  public school teachers get resources they need. DonorsChoose developed a
  fulfillment system that rivals Amazon’s by successfully delivering funded
  items directly to teachers. César Bocanegra spent 12 years as the COO of
  DonorsChoose and is now a Board Member of CostsBeyondTution.org. With his help
  and recommendations, I have been developing the logistical part of the
  organization to ensure CostsBeyondTuition.org becomes as successful as
  DonorsChoose.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  At CostsBeyondTutition.org we will define and measure success by us achieving
  the following before June 30, 2021:

  * 100 college students will have one or more of their requests funded.

  * 500 individual micro philanthropists will have donated to one of our
  students.

  * $50,000 in micro donations will have been raised.

  * $100,000 in grants from foundations or corporations will be secured.

  Our platform will be able to track all these metrics on a daily basis. And
  although these metrics will be easy to track and measure, we’re more excited
  about the stories that our students will provide to donors once they receive
  the resources/items they need. Our platform will capture thank-you messages
  from our students to our donors and make them visible to the public to
  reinforce the transparency and integrity of our model. Our vision is that the
  MY LA2050 grant will propel our organization and provide us with the right
  foundation to achieve our mission of closing the inequality gap and encourage
  college students that are struggling financially to continue pursuing their
  higher education.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '100'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '500'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Our project will have a lasting impact on the most marginalized college
  students, who are often first-generation college students. The lasting impact
  of CostsBeyondTuition.org includes higher graduation rates amongst our low
  income students, thanks to the items and resources they will receive through
  us. This impact in turn will translate into financial stability and will
  encourage our college graduates to pay it forward and donate to future student
  generations. Our headquarters are in Los Angeles and we expect the majority of
  our students to be pursuing their education in the L.A. County which will have
  a positive impact on our local economy and the future of our city.
