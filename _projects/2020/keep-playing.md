title: '"Keep Playing"'
project_summary: >-
  This grant will support and strengthen existing HL-LA programs and launch our
  “Keep Playing“ initiative aimed at retaining students in our current programs
  and continuing to serve them over longer periods of time through high school
  and beyond. This includes keeping middle school students engaged with Harlem
  Lacrosse’s year-round programming and creating new pathways for alumni of our
  middle school programs to stay involved and engage directly with HL-LA mentors
  and coaches.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to PLAY
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
  - 'Compton, Inglewood'
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  In LA, a student’s access to high-quality athletic and extracurricular
  activities is almost exclusively dictated by zip code. While lacrosse is the
  fastest growing sport in America, its growth has barely penetrated the
  invisible boundaries between affluent, mostly white suburbs and low-income,
  urban neighborhoods. HL-LA seeks to leverage the power of the lacrosse
  community to focus on growth by bringing the sport to parks and schools that
  would otherwise never be exposed to the game. HL-LA provides all participants
  with their first experience in lacrosse - often their first experience with
  any sport. The student-athletes who comprise HL-LA’s programs are asked to
  overcome obstacles like poverty, housing and food insecurity, and trauma with
  fewer programs and tools at their disposal than their more affluent peers.
  HL-LA levels the playing field by ensuring all participants can be part of a
  team, compete, and have fun while learning valuable life lessons.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Students in low-income urban schools face many challenges and HL-LA’s unique
  model is particularly well-suited to meet those specific needs by providing
  opportunities, relationships, and experiences to put youth on personal
  pathways to success. Program Directors are professional coaches with years of
  experience in trauma-informed coaching, urban education, and lacrosse. They
  are embedded full-time into partner schools; this school-based model
  transcends the typical recreational sports program by providing daily
  wrap-around programming. Our programs are free, and include mentoring, study
  halls, and tutoring as well as year-round lacrosse instruction, practices,
  games, tournaments, and camps.  The results are deep and meaningful
  relationships between our PD’s and their players, higher engagement, and
  trust. Harlem Lacrosse players access many opportunities beyond the field,
  like career counseling, college and HS admissions assistance, and academic
  support to help them meet their goals.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  At Harlem Lacrosse – Los Angeles, we often witness transformations.  We watch
  as a shy 6th grader evolves into a vocal leader and team captain; we celebrate
  as a nervous beginner overflows with confidence and joy after making her first
  catch. But in our daily programming we also focus on the small wins.


  Whether it’s a goal reached or a goal scored, we believe that all participants
  served by HL-LA will be changed by our program, and that our greatest impact
  occurs when we serve students over a longer period of time. Participants learn
  about grit and self-advocacy.  They make great strides in their fitness and
  nutrition. Students learn how to Aim High and set S.M.A.R.T goals, achieve
  better grades. And most importantly, they are inspired to keep playing.


  HL-LA uses multiple tools to evaluate our effectiveness as an organization. To
  evaluate social-emotional learning we use Hello Insight surveys. We also track
  academic performance as measured by grades in core classes and physical
  fitness as measured by the PACER test. To evaluate the depth of participation
  we look at a few key metrics; hours of participation per year per participant,
  annual rates of attendance, and year over year retention.


  Each year we compile an annual impact report. Some key findings from 2019
  were: increases in GPA and attendance, fewer suspensions, and impressive
  independent school and college acceptances. The most recent report can be
  found here: https://www.harlemlacrosse.org/impact
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '250'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '1200'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Harlem Lacrosse uses the power of play to break the cycle of generational
  poverty. We provide high-quality sports, academic support, and enrichment
  experiences after-school, on weekends, and throughout the summer. It is during
  these critical times that many underserved children fall behind their peers
  from more affluent areas, widening the achievement gap. 


  We believe that a successful progression through adolescence into adulthood is
  tied to the student’s beliefs about their own future. Harlem Lacrosse inspires
  children to Aim High: planning for a bright tomorrow while working hard on the
  field and in the classroom today. Our lacrosse programming builds confidence,
  teamwork, and perseverance.
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  Harlem Lacrosse is not submitting a collaborative proposal, but our work would
  not be possible without the important contributions of our program partners
  and our local advisory board. Harlem Lacrosse works alongside the staff at
  Inner City Education Foundation (ICEF) Schools and Walton Middle School and
  the Compton Unified School District. Harlem Lacrosse - Los Angeles is
  incredibly grateful for partnerships with local high schools and colleges,
  lacrosse leagues, corporate partners, and the dedicated work of nearly 50
  volunteers who all contribute to meaningful experiences for our players.
