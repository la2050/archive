title: Flowproject.la Neighborhood Resiliency Garden (NRG)
project_summary: >-
  Neighborhood Resiliency Gardens (NRG) provide opportunities for STEAM
  education and a canvas for public art. In collaboration with the Marine
  Science Magnet at San Pedro High School Olguin Campus, Our first NRG will
  provide a project-based learning curriculum integrating science, technology,
  and the arts. Using the Resilience Lab’s WEDEW, our NRG will provide renewable
  energy, water and biochar for an off-the-grid source of water & energy,
  enhanced food production, self-reliance, climate adaptation and community
  relief when a disaster strikes.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South Bay
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Los Angeles recognized the need to invest in our city’s resiliency in its
  Resilience and Sustainability Plans. Our goal is to provide elements to
  catalyze their recommended “Neighborhood Resilience Hubs” and facilitate
  social & environmental resiliency along with disaster preparedness &
  recovery. 


  Our NRG uses atmospheric water technology and alternative energy systems to
  provide basic resources at San Pedro High and its neighborhood after a
  disaster, plus environmental education. WEDEWs (“Wood To Energy Deployable
  Emergency Water”) can produce 300+ gallons of water a day using renewable
  energy sources, technology that was harnessed under a CEC grant to support
  areas in Malibu after the Woolsey fire with local micro-grid supplied
  electricity and water. 


  Communities surrounding the school will have access to a sustainable water
  supply and renewable energy, vital resources in the event of a natural
  disaster. We believe an NRG is an investment in a community’s own resilience.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Unycyn Civic Arts develops projects promoting “the art of being civic”. We aim
  to align visions that bring beauty and environmental wellness into the world.
  Flowproject.la is our platform for programs & projects uniting art &
  technology focused on water and civic art. 


  We’ve formed relationships with organizations like RiverLA, AltaSea at the
  Port of LA, and the Resilience Lab to promote water resiliency, community
  growth, jobs in the green and blue economy, and STEAM education. 


  Working with the Resilience Lab’s WEDEW technology, the NRG at San Pedro High
  School will serve as a model and proof of concept that can be implemented in
  school sites across LA County to engage and educate students of all ages. With
  our partners, we hope to provide every neighborhood with an NRG that serves as
  a hub for community self-reliance in the event of large-scale disasters, as
  well as cultivating and sustaining more resilient and healthy communities on a
  daily basis.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Placing an NRG at schools, often gathering places in civic emergencies, is a
  strategic choice. Within a 1 mile radius of San Pedro High are 2 other schools
  and 3 housing projects which could also benefit from this resiliency hub for
  the high school’s 1000 students, their families, and the surrounding
  neighborhood.


  During the WEDEW assembly, AltaSea will host a community open house to educate
  participants, including local Boys and Girls Clubs on the machine, disaster
  prep and resiliency. Success of this component will be measured by event
  attendance. We’re expecting 400+ students of all ages.
   
  This NRG will be a demonstration site to educate the community on climate
  adaptation. Working with San Pedro High’s Marine and Environmental Science
  programs, success will be measured in the number of plants grown, energy and
  water stored, and biochar produced to be used in the garden. The WEDEW (2018
  XPrize winner for Water Abundance) housed in a recycled shipping container,
  dehydrates green waste to produce 25kWh of clean, renewable energy, 300+
  gallons of water a day, and biochar (a soil amendment), while sequestering
  CO2. These metrics will be used to measure the NRG’s efficiency. Quarterly
  surveys will gauge student engagement and interest.


  The WEDEWs will serve as canvases for water themed murals to provide inspiring
  public art.


  Ultimately, successful NRGs will provide communities with access to clean
  water, electricity, and increase access to healthy food in the event of a
  disaster.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '1200'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '75000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: "Neighborhood Resiliency Garden hubs provide tools for LA communities to use in case of natural and manmade disasters, plus healthy spaces to be enjoyed by people on a daily basis.\_\n\nThese gardens provide local food to promote healthy eating, community bonding, and green jobs. Using the WEDEW to recycle green waste into clean water, energy, and biochar, sequesters carbon emissions as well as repurposes waste into important resources.\_\n\_\nWith each container also a canvas for public art, plus educational programming associated with the activation and maintenance of the gardens, NRGs will inspire students of all ages.\n\nEasily scalable, NRGs have the potential to create a network of healthy and sustainable green spaces throughout LA county."
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  Unycyn Civic Arts will administer the Neighborhood Resiliency Garden project.


  San Pedro High School’s Olguin Campus will provide the location for the WEDEW
  and productive use for the biochar, including STEM education programming, and
  long-term maintenance of the WEDEW.


  The SkySource Resilience Lab will provide the WEDEW components and assemble
  them using a repurposed shipping container at AltaSea.


  AltaSea will provide the space for assembly, recycled shipping container and
  community outreach, including an Open House during the building process.


  Beautify Earth will coordinate with artists and the community to paint the
  shipping container with water resiliency themed murals approved by the school.
