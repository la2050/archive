  Destination College+ (DC+) is an inspiring, information-packed day-long
  college conference designed to inspire and empower low-income students to
  enroll in post-secondary institutions and complete a college degree. Featuring
  grade-specific workshops and a College Fair for high school students and their
  parents, as well as a Career Fair and career readiness workshops for
  post-secondary students, DC+ brings together the full continuum of the pathway
  to college, post-secondary academic achievement, and career readiness.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - San Gabriel Valley
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South LA
  - Westside
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Across LAUSD, thousands of students lack adequate information, resources and
  counseling to help them get into and succeed in college. As a result, LAUSD
  college-readiness rates are low, with just 47% of 2018 graduates having
  completed the required coursework for college admission. The rates remain even
  lower for low-income, ethnically diverse, and first-generation college
  students. Despite the benefits of higher education, only about 67% of students
  from low-income households enroll in college nationally, and merely 11% earn
  bachelor’s degrees. 


  Students from low-income backgrounds, particularly those who are the first in
  their family, struggle to meet the complex requirements necessary to gain
  access to college and to persist in earning a college degree. DC+ fosters a
  college-going and college-succeeding mindset among low-income students by
  providing them with a multi-faceted view of what to expect at college, how to
  prepare to get there, and how to succeed in college and career.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  In its 24th year, DC+’s enhancement and expansion is essential to further
  bridging the college access and success gap for 600-800 students who will
  attend. For many high schoolers, it will be the first time they visit a
  college and the content they learn in workshops along with exposure to 70-80
  colleges galvanizes their college-going plans. For college students, the
  college fair and professional development workshops help them take important
  steps toward workforce readiness and increase college persistence. Since 1977,
  we have empowered LA youth to access and succeed in college. Today, more than
  2,600 first-generation and lower-income students go through our life-changing
  college access and success programs each year. We have a long history of
  demonstrated impact. Last year, 90% of our seniors graduated high school, with
  100% of graduates accepted to college; 88% of our college students continued
  to persist, with our most recent cohort achieving a 75% six-year graduation
  rate.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  DC+ is our most important program event aimed at making college going and
  college graduation a reality for students who are most economically
  vulnerable. In the short-term we hope to inspire high school students see
  college as a desirable goal that is within their reach. For college students,
  we aim to guide them toward persistence, graduation and meaningful career
  entry. Education is a lever for economic opportunity and our end goal is about
  creating pathways out of poverty through education.


  Our definition of success for DC+ is two-fold. Among high schoolers we aim to
  empower students to have greater self-advocacy, more positive attitudes
  towards going to college, and a greater understanding of where to receive help
  to attend college. Among college students we aim to empower students to have
  more positive attitudes towards a post-college career, and a greater
  understanding of where to obtain help to complete college, find employment or
  go to graduate school.


  The success of DC+ is measured through post-event surveys that demonstrate the
  following outcomes:

  Among high school students—90% report a more positive attitude toward going to
  college; 90% report knowing where and how to get help to go to college and how
  to get into college.

  Among college students—90% report feeling inspired to work towards
  college-level employment or a graduate degree; 80% report knowing where to get
  help completing college; and 75% report they are better equipped for the job
  market.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '1500'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '1000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  The impact of DC+ extends far beyond the student and parent attendees,
  positively affecting the broader community. It aligns with and strengthens
  county-wide efforts to increase high school graduation rates, 2-and 4-year
  college matriculation rates, and college persistence and graduation rates,
  particularly within communities of color. Last year, 78% of student
  participants were Latino/a, 14% Black/African American, and 10% Asian
  American. In addition, it engages and connects students, who are the future
  workforce, with volunteers, mentors, and professionals from a broad
  cross-section of industries, while providing these individuals with the
  opportunity to share their skills, expertise and time with the next
  generation.
