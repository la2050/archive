title: Exploring Careers to Drive Girls' College Success
project_summary: >-
  This grant will support career exposure programs that are integral to MOSTe’s
  overall college readiness and success work. Specifically, a grant will fully
  fund our annual career fair and three outings to workplaces in LA, where
  students will learn from inspiring women leaders and businesses in the
  community. These career readiness and exposure programs help motivate students
  to set college-going goals and give them high aspirations to work toward,
  improving college graduation outcomes and giving students a pathway to
  success.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - San Gabriel Valley
  - South LA
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >
  Our programming begins in 7th grade and continues through college graduation
  with mentoring, scholarship, and college success intervention aimed at getting
  100% of participants to and through college with financial support. Career
  exposure can be a powerful tool in conjunction with our college preparation
  work, motivating students and giving them agency to design their own pathways
  to success. 


  MOSTe is distinct in our work to empower women to be the next generation of
  leaders in LA communities. The young women in our programs are largely
  first-generation women of color and they are poised to lead change. We
  envision a future where those who have historically been left out of
  decision-making can usher in a new era of a more inclusive LA that serves us
  all. The young women in our programs win scholarships and graduate from elite
  schools, earn advanced degrees, mentor and lead as professional women in the
  community—and exposure to inspiring career opportunities helps them get
  there. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Our approach is based on 30 years of experience, academic data on intervention
  effectiveness, and ongoing program effectiveness monitoring. We’re proud to
  have 100% of our 2019 high school graduates enrolled in college with
  substantial financial aid. Since the class of 2009, over 75% of our students
  completed a degree within 4-6 years, with 21% still persisting. For comparable
  groups, analysis of Pell Institute’s 6-year graduation rates for low-income
  students found just 21.4% finished a degree within six years, and only 11% if
  they were also first-generation students like ours. 


  Over 30 years of serving our girls in close integration with the LA community,
  we have developed a network to offer inspiring career exposure programming
  tailored to our students. We have built strong relationships with major
  entertainment, law, business, and social change organizations, and with grant
  support we can leverage these valuable connections to benefit the promising
  young leaders in our programs. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Our career readiness projects are part of our comprehensive program to support
  students through college graduation and put them on an upward trajectory that
  carries on throughout their lives. All our programs are designed to support
  the long-term goals of MOSTe: to ensure that each of the young women we serve
  earns a college degree. Our organization’s overall target long-term outcome is
  to have 100% of our college-aged program participants enrolled in college.
  Shorter-term outcomes related to this grant are 80% program participation
  among eligible students, an increase in career awareness among participants to
  60%, and that 30% participants report enthusiasm for at least one
  college-to-career pathway.  


  Career exposure in a supportive environment helps students draft a roadmap
  toward college graduation, inspiring them to discover new interests, pursue
  valuable summer internships, fine-tune their college choices, and direct their
  efforts toward desired academic programs. In career fairs and workplace visits
  students meet inspiring women who are leaders in our community, ask questions,
  practice self-advocacy, and build relationships while developing professional
  behavior skills—all things that help them to grow confidence in themselves and
  motivate them to put in the hard work necessary to achieve their educational
  goals.

Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  From a MOSTe graduate: “My older sister had been in the program since she was
  in middle school and I saw the amazing results she was getting, including
  being the first our family to graduate from high school and college. I knew I
  wanted to follow in her footsteps and have MOSTe guide me through high school
  and college. From workshops to colleges visits, I am grateful for what this
  organization has given to me. It is because of the tips MOSTe leaders and
  mentors gave me that I was accepted to UC Davis. Not only was I accepted but I
  was prepared. Once my first year of college was coming to an end, MOSTe gave
  me a variety of options I could do during summer. I landed an interview with
  Warner Bros and began my internship when I returned to LA!”
