title: Civy - Civic Engagement Platform
project_summary: >-
  Our project is to improve civic engagement in LA County. By implementing our
  platform the LA government can efficiently share civic projects among its
  residents, and residents can provide feedback in confidence or vote on the
  projects thereby empowering the engagement of the diverse population of LA.
  Our platform also fosters education for residents and enable them to make
  informed feedback. Our platform is simple to use and very mobile.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
  - 'We can work with any county, city or municipality'
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Currently, residents are not given an easy way to participate in civic
  discussion, and traditional methods, such as town halls, lead to low
  participation. On the other hand, feedback received from residents (largely
  aggregated by other social media platforms) is often unusable by governments.
  I learnt these facts by partaking in a city's public outreach process, by
  consulting many mayors and city managers, and by understanding the pain-points
  of city's working tirelessly behind-the-scenes to serve their residents. Civy
  enables a direct dialog between  cities, and its' residents. Civy strives to
  engage with the 'silent majority', those people who are keen to participate
  but withhold on open-dialogue platforms such as Twitter or Facebook. Civy can
  also be used as a tool to communicate efficiently and effectively with LA's
  residents. Civy can convey important-factual information during events
  impacting LA, such as the current public health crisis, or the upcoming 2028
  LA Olympics. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  We are passionate about improving city and government services, & we have the
  collective experiences to design and deliver. I started Civy after working
  with cities and governments on governance-education for city officials
  undertaking major projects. I learnt about the myriad of challenges the city
  officials face in order to improve services to the residents. Public funding
  priorities aside, the cities are inundated with data which ends up causing
  more work and reduce productivity. And residents feel like they just aren't
  being heard so they give up communicating with the cities; these are the
  'silent majority'. The constant barrage of social media messages, media
  searching for facts in a state of urgency, often end up publishing the wrong
  facts, putting the city officials on the back-step. Civy's mission is to
  address all the above by working with LA and its residents, its think-tanks,
  its universities, to improve civic participation and creating a direct dialog.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  The current models for meaningful and high-impact civic engagement
  (town-halls, disparate social media campaigns) have led to low participation
  rates (estimated between 5%-7% of eligible resident population), despite
  majority of people being active on social media (86% +). Our vision is to not
  only increase engagement to above 80%, but to also diversify the demographics
  that participates in civic discussion (young, middle, older, all income
  levels, & major US languages). Our goals are to:


  1. Increase participation rate from the current 5% to our target of 80%.

  2. Increase diversity of resident participation from English speaking,
  upper-middle-class, well-educated to all ethnic groups, income, & ed levels.
  We aim to increase the diversity & inclusion ratio from the current 15% to our
  target of 80%.

  3. Enable residents of all neighborhoods to participate in public affairs.
  100% of feedback is visually display (map) by zip codes & demographics. This
  will educate & enable public supervision of public funding priorities,
  eliminating current bias which skews twds wealthier areas with the “loudest
  voice”. The platform enables cities to ask the public for feedback; feedback
  remains confidential.

  4. Support the civic education of all residents to participate in their govt,
  lifting education to above 60%.

  5. Enable city to create & control its own narrative with custom
  preferences/reports. Civy adds value to city’s social media accts, increasing
  productivity of operations w/o adding additional work. Civy can reduce tech
  staff effort of scraping social media data by 2-3 days a week, allowing more
  time spent analyzing & strategic insight making. Civy complies with the Data
  Privacy guidelines, does not sell to 3rd parties. City owns the data.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '8000000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '2300000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  The current state of civic participation is low. Our public outreach platform
  can change the that. Once Civy is implemented, our services can continue to be
  used by Los Angeles and its residents. With Civy, the community will become
  more involved in the decision-making process, as well as feel empowered to be
  a part of civic discussion. Civy can be used not only to inform residents of
  current and upcoming projects, it can also serve as a platform to educate
  residents. Civy will create a direct dialog between cities and its residents,
  leading to on-going increased and diverse civic participation. Furthermore,
  Civy can inform residents during all kinds of events impacting LA's residents,
  such as public health crises, and LA Olympics 2024.
