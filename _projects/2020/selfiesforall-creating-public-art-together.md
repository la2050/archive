title: '#SelfiesforAll: Creating Public Art Together'
project_summary: >-
  We will create small-scale public murals, or “selfie spots,” in 3
  neighborhoods - the Byzantine-Latino Quarter, Watts, and El Sereno - to
  attract locals and visitors and serve as cultural place-making icons. Each art
  piece will be designed and executed by local artists with community volunteers
  of all ages, and will celebrate the multigenerational bonds and unique local
  culture of its neighborhood. The selfie spots will bring new visitors and
  economic activity to each neighborhood, and connect friends and family of all
  ages to play and share.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to PLAY
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - South LA
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  The project’s three communities each have a unique culture to celebrate and
  share, as well as economic, social, and public image challenges to address,
  particularly as communities that may be unfairly stereotyped as dangerous,
  unattractive, or without a rich cultural life.


  This project will strengthen local intergenerational ties and stimulate or
  strengthen relationships between age-specific groups, such as senior centers,
  after-school programs, youth groups, and civic or business groups, among
  others. It will create community enhancing public art, which is proven to have
  a variety of civic and economic benefits (see #12 below). And, it will attract
  visitors to the three neighborhoods, where they will be likely to explore
  other community touchpoints and contribute to the local economy. Visitors will
  share on social media via a posted selfie in front of the murals, thereby
  reinforcing a positive image of the neighborhoods, encouraging other visitors,
  and improving perceptions.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  LANI’s work empowers local stakeholders by engaging them in planning
  improvements designed to enhance public safety and health, spur economic
  development, foster local pride, and improve communal quality of life. This
  project is important to us because it provides an opportunity to advance all
  these goals in each of the project neighborhoods. It also gives us the chance
  to deepen our relationships in these neighborhoods so we can continue to
  partner with stakeholders on other improvements going forward.


  We are uniquely suited to accomplish this project because LANI understands
  that community members are the experts on the needs, desires, challenges, and
  highlights of their own neighborhoods. We have earned a national reputation as
  a skilled, reliable project manager of publicly funded improvements, playing a
  critical role in the revitalization of Los Angeles communities. LANI places
  equity as a core value in our projects, which helps us create trust and
  shepherd projects to success.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Our vision is that in each of the neighborhoods, community members of all ages
  collaborate with artists to design selfie spot murals that celebrate local
  culture, create opportunity for intergenerational play, attract visitors, and
  raise each community’s public profile. Specific metrics for success include:


  * Local artists enthusiastic about executing the project with community input
  are recruited.

  * Community-based organizations (CBOs), businesses, local officials, and
  residents help to secure locations for the murals, as well as give input on
  design, solicit donations of materials, and commit to the murals’ upkeep for
  at least 24 months.

  * Community groups provide access to and communication with target participant
  demographics to design and create the murals (ie, preschools, afterschool
  programs, senior centers, service groups, business groups, arts collectives,
  neighborhood councils).

  * Participants in the project represent all age demographics of the
  neighborhoods, and the project stimulates ongoing collaboration between
  agencies that serve various age demographics.

  * Completed selfie spot murals celebrate the character of each neighborhood,
  promote local intergenerational ties, and serve as anchors for placemaking.

  * A public celebration to unveil the murals is held in each neighborhood.

  * Selfie spot murals attract new visitors to their location, creating positive
  economic and public relations impact.

  * Selfie spot murals are shared and identified on social media by locals and
  non-locals.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '150'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '100000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Public murals build social and economic equity and engage people of all ages
  in a creative civic project. Murals create a sense of place and result in
  increased foot traffic while adding vibrancy, culture, and a perception of
  safety. Recent years have seen a rise in “selfie spots” - small scale murals
  that serve as backdrops for personal photography meant to be shared online -
  which have been effective in drawing visitors to new neighborhoods. A selfie
  spot mural that includes multigenerational togetherness in its theme will
  provide local people of all ages with creative opportunities as each mural is
  designed and painted, and once completed, as families and friends gather there
  to snap photos and share a fun, timely cultural experience.
