title: Fighting Social Inequality For College Students
project_summary: >
  A LA2050 grant will support the internship program at the Center for the
  Political Future, in which college students are placed in unpaid political
  internships throughout the Los Angeles area.  Many college students cannot
  accept unpaid internships due to their financial limitations, which ultimately
  impacts their future job prospects after graduation. Funding students at an
  unpaid internship produces social justice allowing everyone to take advantage
  of opportunities while in school in order to better prepare them for a
  successful career.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CREATE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >
  College internships are a vital part of every college students’ experience. 
  These internships, which are overwhelmingly unpaid in the political sphere,
  help prepare students to obtain gainful employment after college. It has
  become abundantly clear that only a particular segment of college students can
  take advantage of these opportunities, such as those students who can afford
  to do an unpaid internship.  Part of the mission at the Center for the
  Political Future is to prepare future leaders with valuable experience. 
  However, these opportunities exclude students who must earn income while at
  school to help defer their costs.  This is a perfect example of social
  inequality within society.  College students from all backgrounds should be
  given the opportunity to gain valuable career experience while in college and
  should not be limited by their financial situation.  A grant through LA2050
  will give all college students the opportunity to create their future.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >
  The Center for the Political Future is uniquely suited to take on this
  mission.  For over 50 years, the Center (formerly the Unruh Institute of
  Politics), has placed thousands of college students in unpaid internships. 
  The Center works with over 200 internship providers in Los Angeles to put
  students into internships during the fall and spring semesters as well as the
  summer.  On average, the Center places 30 to 40 students per semester during
  the academic year and 20 to 30 during the summer.  The Center has a dedicated
  staff that works with students to place them in internships of their interest
  but also to ensure we meet the needs of the internship providers.  Students
  not only complete their required time at their internship but also complete
  professionalization workshops and academic requirements. The intra-structure
  within the Center ensures that students can be placed in internships while
  learning about life after college in the workforce.   
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >+
  In the short term, success will be seen by an increase in the number of
  student interns, who would not have participated in our program without the
  funding support.  Our plan is to survey all those students who speak to us
  about whether financial support is required in order for them to accept and
  determine how many students were directly impacted by the funding.  In the
  long term, success will be viewed by those very same numbers but also through
  the interns who choose to contribute toward funding for future college interns
  in need of financial support to participate in our program.  Success will also
  be viewed in both the short and long terms by examining whether our internship
  providers will contribute funds to support our interns.  To date, we have
  never asked our internship providers for financial support.  The LA2050
  funding may very well be the seed money to start a perennial fund.  All of the
  data we collect will be held at the Center and used for evaluating the
  effectiveness of the funding provided to our students.  


Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '20'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '200'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >
  The broader implications of this proposal comes down to two words – social
  justice.  Universities have worked diligently at providing resources to
  families with financial challenges so they can send their children to college
  for an education that they dearly deserve.  However, paying for tuition, books
  and room/board are not the only costs.  In many cases, students are also
  required to work a job in order to support their dreams.  Funding students to
  participate in unpaid internships allow those students to work on their career
  path, rather than just a minimum-wage job to make ends meet.  LA2050 will
  assist at leveling the playing field so that after school, all college
  graduates can achieve their goals.
