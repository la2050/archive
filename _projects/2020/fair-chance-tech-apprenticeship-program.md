title: Fair Chance Tech Apprenticeship Program
project_summary: >-
  We were recently included in a federal grant from the U.S. Department of Labor
  to facilitate apprenticeships for formerly incarcerated job seekers throughout
  the nation. As an L.A-based company, we would like to focus part of our
  program efforts here in L.A. County through creating a model-based system of
  apprenticeships in positions that pay a living wage and provide a path to
  escaping poverty. We have partnered with the LA Mayor’s Office of Reentry in
  the past, as well as 50+ local organizations, and feel a strong connection to
  our home base.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CREATE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >
  The formerly incarcerated population has the highest rate of unemployment of
  any job seeking community at nearly 30%. Additionally, without stable
  employment, the rate of recidivism is nearly 80% in the first 1-3 years after
  release. However, when they have a stable job, that percentage flips (less
  than 20% are re-arrested of the employed population). Employment has been
  called the “silver bullet” for eradicating recidivism; good jobs for this
  population means safer neighborhoods, emptier jails and prisons, and positive
  ripple effects in communities most susceptible to violence.

  In the interests of diversity and inclusion, companies are searching for new
  talent sources to fill millions of open jobs, and the formerly incarcerated
  candidate pool is a key source of overlooked talent. This apprenticeship
  program hopes to facilitate implementation of fair chance hiring policies
  through placing specifically trained and therefore high value candidates in
  hard-to-fill jobs. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Since our public launch in 2017 through Silicon Valley’s preeminent tech
  incubator, Y Combinator, 70 Million Jobs’ community has grown to support more
  than 11 million formerly incarcerated men and women, and has facilitated
  employment for thousands, nationwide. We have worked with some of the
  country’s largest employers, including Berkshire Hathaway, Uber, Perdue,
  Denny’s, MOD Pizza and many others. Given our connection to and having
  graduated from Silicon Valley’s preeminent tech incubator, Y Combinator, we
  are in a unique position to place technically trained candidates with criminal
  histories in the most difficult to access industry landscapes.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  Through our Federal DOL grant, we’re tasked with creating approximately 500
  apprenticeship opportunities. Through the LA2050 partnership, we would
  collaborate with the LA2050 team to evaluate opportunities for new
  apprenticeship programs in Los Angeles County, and create approximately 50-100
  apprenticeship opportunities over the next year in the following industries:
  IT and cyber security related occupations (35-70), skilled worker occupations
  (10-20), and supervisory/management roles (5-10). Our focus is on positions
  that pay a living wage and provide a path to escaping poverty. 


  Our long-term vision of success would be to share our experience and potential
  apprenticeship model-based programs with other industry employers in the area,
  along with the heretofore unavailable but also invaluable data regarding
  employment outcomes for this at-risk population (what kind of jobs are best,
  how much are they being paid, percentage of employment advancement, wage
  history, retention rates, etc.); to provide subject matter experts (SMEs) when
  requested to inform industry-aligned curriculum development and/or
  modification; and to participate on state and national conference panels to
  show the positive impact of the apprenticeship model, Fair Chance Hiring, and
  encourage industry partners to adopt the program.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '100'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '10000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >
  In the last 4 years of facilitating fair chance hiring for corporate employers
  throughout the nation, we have discovered that once a company successfully
  hires someone with a criminal background, they will open up 30%-50% more
  positions to this workforce. If we engage 5 large employers in the area
  through our apprenticeship program, this could potentially affect the creation
  of 10,000+ job opportunities opened to the formerly incarcerated population in
  Los Angeles. 

  Perhaps less "tangibly," the effect on families/communities most impacted by
  the criminal justice system will experience the positive ripple effects of
  this kind of job creation: reduced recidivism, violence and incarceration
  costs, and increased positive community role models.
