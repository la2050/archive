title: Novelly Leadership Academy
project_summary: >-
  We released Novelly, our mobile reading app that doubles as civics education
  for 8th-10th grade students. We use relatable and engaging young adult (YA)
  fiction as the foundation for civic discussion with youth on social issues.
  We're expanding the Novelly Leadership Academy, an online 8-week training for
  students who want to conduct workshops with their peers using the Novelly app
  in their schools and communities. In the 2020-2021 academic year, we will
  train 100 high school students who will reach 2,000 youth across Los Angeles
  County.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  To solve the most complex and pressing issues of the 21st century, young
  people need the skills, knowledge, and motivation to not only identify issues
  in their communities but also to solve them through civic action. However,
  only nine states and the District of Columbia require one year of U.S.
  government or civics. State civics curricula are heavy on knowledge and facts
  but light on building skills and agency for civic engagement. And it shows -
  23% of 8th graders in the United States are proficient in civics and this is
  even lower among low-income and minority youth. This creates a civic
  engagement gap where youth become less visible and less heard as citizens than
  other demographics and therefore easier to ignore by their decision-makers,
  resulting in long-term and far-reaching effects on equity in communities. in
  the United States.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Our staff is equipped to create high-quality civic education experiences for
  youth. I (CEO) have worked for 6 years in youth development and have extensive
  classroom experience teaching YA for social change with students. Janae
  Phillips (Director of Education) was the Education Director at the Harry
  Potter Alliance, the original non-profit using literature to civically empower
  youth. Amanda Beadlescomb (Director of Content and Communications) has
  uniquely worked in the world of publishing, branding, marketing, and startups.
  Abhishek Bhaduri (Product Manager) is a digital product manager at Capital
  One. Our Youth Designers are made up of 5 middle and high school students who
  work with us for the academic year who test and inform our app, curriculum,
  and programming. Our assets are our community: Our app users include 300
  teachers and students in the LA. Our social media following includes 1,120
  Instagram followers. Our community of educators includes 800 newsletter
  subscribers.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Our vision for success is that 100 students in Los Angeles County are
  empowered to deliver Novelly workshops using the Novelly reading app and
  facilitation guide with their peers. They will become confident in their
  ability to facilitate and moderate high-quality civic discussions. These
  students will reach at least 2,000 students in their schools and communities
  through these workshops.


  We will use the following metrics:

  Program Completion Rate - 80% of students complete the program.

  Pre & Post-Survey Results - 75% of students see an average increase in their
  Likert Scale scores for the following areas: dialogue, values, social justice,
  and storytelling. They should be able to identify with the following
  statements: (1) “I feel confident in my understanding of civic dialogue and my
  ability to facilitate it.” (2) “I feel confident identifying my values and the
  values of others, and how they inform our beliefs.” (3) “I understand the
  systems of privilege and oppression.” (4) “I feel confident in my storytelling
  abilities.”

  Starting a Workshop - 50% of students start a workshop within 6 months of
  completing the program

  Starting a Novelly Chapter - 20% of student start a Novelly Chapter within 12
  months of completing the program
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '300'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '8000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Civic education and engagement among teenagers are associated with a wide
  range of positive outcomes. According to the UCLA Center for Health Policy
  Research, adolescents who are civically engaged are more likely to have better
  health, better grades, graduate high school and attend college. Although a
  complex array of factors influence high school graduation rates, civic
  education is strongly associated with high school completion, translating into
  $376,000 more earned income over their lifetimes. Beyond the benefits to
  individual youth, there is the far-reaching and long-term positive impact on
  the vibrancy, responsiveness, and equity within their communities.
