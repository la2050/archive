title: The LA Healthy Building Alliance
project_summary: >-
  USGBC-LA is launching a Healthy Building Alliance for the L.A. Region to
  create a commitment that building owners, tenants, & individuals can make to
  provide healthy, resilient space to live, work, & play. It entails 5 simple
  principles around building & occupant health: Indoor Air Quality, Inspire
  Movement, Access to Nature, Green Cleaning, & Water Testing. The goal: create
  commitment, generate valuable data, & provide resources to support the journey
  for all Angelenos to experience healthy environments.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South LA
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >
  Property owners generally want to provide healthy spaces, especially when they
  see the data on increased long-term asset value, but the current rating
  systems & engagement process are too complicated & expensive to produce scaled
  impact. The COVID-19 crisis highlights the need for better monitoring systems,
  improved air quality, & to provide healthier, more resilient spaces. There is
  also a dramatic need for data around indoor air & local water quality,
  especially in multi-family buildings in DACs to build the case to channel
  funding to these communities. Greater evidence links poorly constructed,
  maintained & located housing to many health conditions, including asthma, lead
  poisoning & mental health issues, as well as more ER visits &
  hospitalizations. Healthier buildings focus more on energy efficiency & water
  conservation, lowering utility bills. Families who struggle to make rent, move
  frequently or experience homelessness, face a much greater risk of adverse
  health outcomes. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >
  USGBC-LA has a proven reputation for excellence, impact, environmental
  behavior & cultural change, through outreach, education, program management, &
  community-based projects: Health & Wellness training helps LA lead in healthy
  building certifications, there is a huge gap in affordable & market-rate
  multi-family housing; Green Janitor Education Program certifies janitorial
  workers in office buildings in principles of green cleaning, energy
  efficiency, & water conservation (1,400+ empowered grads, & with buildings
  show a 5.6% average energy reduction); we facilitate sustainability &
  resilience training/workshops across LA helping small businesses build
  capacity, identify no/low cost ways to save energy & water; provide
  benchmarking support for building owners to help comply with the City’s EBEWE
  ordinance; assist homeowners with sustainable rebuilding post-wildfires; &
  promote sustainability in under-served communities through annual Legacy
  Project granted to local community groups.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  Ultimate success for the Healthy Building Alliance is to provide healthy
  spaces for all Angelenos to live, work, & play in. We need to create a low
  barrier to entry experience for people to learn about their spaces: current
  condition, how they impact personal health, and how to improve them. Our
  project is data driven by an underlying principle that once people have access
  to data & an understanding of what it means, they will work to improve the
  results, especially when it involves the health of themselves & their
  families. Our project will collect data through Tenant Surveys, Indoor Air
  Quality Sensors, & Water Testing. Success will be determined by incremental
  improvements against the baseline. While all types of spaces can make a
  commitment to health through the Alliance, we will start with affordable
  housing to shine a light at the heart of the equity issue in the built
  environment. There’s a need for data on these buildings to demonstrate that
  often poorly built and maintained multi-family properties need increased
  investment, and we will provide a toolkit for owners, operators, and
  developers to improve tenant heath through building systems, maintenance, and
  materials. Success for us through this funding will be to launch the program;
  produce successful pilots with a minimum of 5 properties in DAC’s in LA
  County, with at least one specifically in South LA, East LA, & the Eastern San
  Fernando Valley; release of a toolkit for participants going forward; & the
  program experiencing organic growth during this timeframe. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '750'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '15000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >
  The program goal is to create a local movement around providing healthy space
  and raise awareness around how the health of our spaces impacts us all
  personally. Direct impact - 5 pilot projects at avg 50 units = 250 units at
  avg 3 family members per unit = 750 people directly impacted. USGBC-LA will
  target large affordable housing owner operators at 1,000+ units = 5,000 units
  and 15,000 occupants indirect impact. This program will help parents provide a
  healthier environment for their children, reducing financial costs, & burden
  to the family & healthcare providers. The deliverables will become a toolkit
  to better the health of the tenant population, potentially as part of
  financing requirements for affordable housing across the region.
