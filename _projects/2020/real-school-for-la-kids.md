title: REAL SCHOOL for LA Kids
project_summary: >
  REAL (Relate, Engage, and Learn) SCHOOL for LA Kids will codify and amplify a
  consistent, Whole Child approach for teachers of all grade levels TK-12. By
  codifying the constructivist approach and building a teacher leadership
  training program, we can reach more students and help unite public charter
  schools and LAUSD. This plan builds on LA 2050’s vision of a brighter future,
  with every one of our youngest Angelenos seen, heard, nurtured, understood,
  and challenged to become a creative, analytical thinker and a socially
  responsible innovator.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - San Fernando Valley
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Larchmont Charter School and City Charter Schools will codify a framework to
  incentivize and empower ALL teachers to address ALL students as the whole
  individuals that they are. Training and support will enable a generation of
  teachers to deliver these educational principles to thousands of students in
  their daily work.


  Traditional educational models (such as rigid “no excuses” and direct
  instruction) fail to address the Whole Child*, particularly social-emotional
  learning needs. Further, very few schools attend to critical diversity,
  equity, and inclusion work, despite the fact that cultural competency is an
  essential skill for students preparing for an increasingly global and
  integrated society. Traditional teacher training does not emphasize how to
  develop student cultural competency, critical thinking, or social-emotional
  skills. Success is defined as a series of test scores, leaving out
  non-cognitive growth measures that also need to be developed.

Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >+
  Both of our schools were founded to bring this model to our students, and both
  schools are among the top-performing public schools in California. Our school
  communities are intentionally inclusive: we put relationships first and
  develop social-emotional competencies to build a strong, safe, and supportive
  space for all students, staff, and families. When we fail to invest in
  professional development in these areas, and we only define success as narrow
  measures of academic achievement, we disincentivize our schools and teachers
  from developing students as whole, anti-racist, anti-biased,
  socially-emotionally competent people, who can think critically and solve
  problems in their communities.  We will create a Community of Practice for
  educators (an active community to build relationships with and learn from
  fellow educators) in the grant timeframe, from July 2020 to July 2021 as
  government policies allow.

  We are professional educators and our proposal offers the tools for
  leadership.


Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  We plan to use the following metrics to measure success:

  -Participation

  -Execution of Innovation Projects at each partner site

  -Executing workshops, symposia, and publications

  -Teacher assessments

  -Development of 3-Year Strategic Plan for the Community of Practice Hub and
  its goals

  -Satisfaction and impact surveys for Symposiasts and Community of Practice
  participants

  -Surveys of parents, students and recent graduates of Larchmont Charter School
  and City Charter Schools on SEL-related outcomes.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '200'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '10000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >
  Each trained teacher (200) will reach approximately 50 students. Thousands
  (10,000+) of students will benefit! Our framework draws from The Common Ground
  Collaborative to develop the collective capacity of our teachers to implement
  four inclusive community-building practices: maintain safe and inclusive
  classroom culture that supports academic risk-taking for all students;
  establish a safe and inclusive community through systematic, daily use of
  SEL-focused community-building practices; develop teacher and student cultural
  competency in the “Ready for Rigor” framework (Zaretta Hammond) through
  multicultural curriculum; ensure inclusion of marginalized individuals and
  reduce punitive measures by implementing restorative practices. 
   
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  Both Larchmont and City Charters operate relationship-and-diversity-centered,
  educational models. They have previously partnered to expand access to this
  model in the educational field and their collaboration has won support from
  the Walton Family Foundation and others. Much work lies ahead.  Leaders Amy
  Held, Executive Director, Larchmont Charter School, and Valerie Braimah,
  Executive Director, City Charter Schools plan to divide the work of this
  project equally between themselves and their respective staffs. They plan for
  a 50-50 split of the financial resources and the workload. Theirs is a
  successful, tested collaboration with important, wide-reaching results. 
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Host public events or gatherings
  - Communications support
  - 'Office space for meetings, events, or for staff'
  - 'Capacity, including staff'
  - Strategy assistance and implementation
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.:
  - Larchmont Charter School
  - City Charter Schools
Which metrics will your submission impact?:
  - Arts education
  - Student proficiency in English & Language Arts
  - Proficiency in STEM
Are there any other LA2050 goal categories that your proposal will impact?:
  - LA is the best place to CREATE
  - LA is the best place to PLAY
