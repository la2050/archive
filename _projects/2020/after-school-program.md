Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - San Fernando Valley
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >
  New Directions for Youth currently services the San Fernando Valley. Based on
  the census report, 14.3% of the population lives below the poverty line. Of
  the youth residing in the San Fernando Valley, 19% live below the poverty
  line. New Directions for Youth works with LAUSD to provide wraparound services
  and a safe haven for the at -risk youth in the San Fernando Valley. We provide
  pick up and drop off services to help keep youth engaged and off the streets
  after school. NDY staff keep in regular contact with LAUSD staff regarding
  academic progress of students enrolled in its after- school programs.  

  New Directions for Youth recognizes the need for family engagement in order to
  further ensure the success of our youth. We provide parenting classes, as well
  as family, group and individual counseling services for our clients free of
  charge. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >
  The after-school program at NDY has been operating for 45+ years in the San
  Fernando Valley.  In 2019 New Directions for Youth was able to open its doors
  to the Paul Krikorian Health and Recreation Center with the generous donations
  of LA City and private donors.  Within the Health and Recreation Center NDY
  was also able to secure a state-of-the-art music recording studio donated by
  SubPop Records. This project gave New Directions the opportunity to expand its
  after- school program and include fitness, music, music recording, dance and
  wellness into the curriculum.  

  These additional services were imperative to the needs of the population NDY
  services, as most fitness centers in the area require a fee for membership
  which the low-income population cannot afford. NDY believes in the potential
  of the population it serves and aims to go above and beyond to provide the
  best service and opportunities to enrich the lives of our youth. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  The impact of this project will be more underserved youth graduating from high
  school. Higher employability for the youth.  

  NDY continues to have a major impact on gang reduction in the San Fernando
  Valley.  NDY also partners with the Mayor’s Office of Gang Reduction, Youth
  Development (GRYD) to ensure at-risk youth in the San Fernando Valley stay out
  of gangs and off the street.  98% of youth participating in the NDY Gang
  Prevention Program no longer show significant risk of gang involvement after
  one year.

  NDY staff collects attendance records for all activities in addition to
  managing case files and writing case notes.  This information will document
  the number of students and parents served in each activity.  

  NDY staff also documents the clients’ knowledge and understanding of their
  accomplishments through client satisfaction surveys, pre and post testing. 
  The process evaluation data and benchmarks will be reviewed regularly by the
  Executive Director to determine how NDY programs are progressing and to ensure
  that appropriate progress toward achievement of program objectives is on track
  toward successful program outcomes within the one year timeframe.   

  The summative evaluation will collect all process evaluation data and provide
  a measurement of how effectively NDY programs meet their identified goals and
  objectives at the end of one year.  This evaluation will also state to what
  extent the program had an effect on the outcomes.  
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '650'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '3000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >
  NDY will continue to provide opportunities for youth to participate in healthy
  activities during after school programs.  This will directly impact 250 youth
  in a one year timeframe and 80% of youth who will participate in the after
  school program will receive 100 hours of positive youth development and
  fitness activities in one year. 

  NDY will continue to provide individual, group, family therapy and parenting
