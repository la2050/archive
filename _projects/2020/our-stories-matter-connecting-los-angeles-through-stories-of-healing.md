title: 'Our Stories Matter: Connecting Los Angeles through Stories of Healing'
project_summary: >-

  TILA seeks support to produce Season 2 of its podcast, Our Stories Matter, a
  narrative-building project centering the lived experiences of activists and
  healers. This project will include additional in-person and virtual
  initiatives that can be easily adapted if social distancing continues. These
  include community events, live podcast taping and storytelling slam
  competition; podcast storyteller-led workshops on healing and artistic
  practices; and educational webinars on trauma, healing-centered care, and
  resilience-building practices.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >
  Our Stories Matter addresses the need for social and emotional connectedness
  by sharing stories of healing, resilience, and trauma survivorship. Angelinos
  can be part of a collective support system and healing process through
  “community care,” instead of society’s emphasis on “self-help.” By centering
  marginalized voices, the podcast supports the co-creation of
  counter-narratives that empower the storyteller and the audience while
  fostering social and emotional connection. 


  The podcast also responds to the need for more inclusive and accessible arts
  programming. The storytellers featured on the podcast represent diverse
  backgrounds, identities, and experiences while bringing varying types of
  healing through the arts, such as painting, breathing, poetry, writing, dance,
  and music. Each podcast episode will include transcription and Spanish
  language translation. As a digital means, the podcast allows people with
  difficulty getting to physical spaces to access the content remotely. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >
  Since 2015, TILA has provided education on trauma-informed practices to over
  4,200 people by partnering with over 30 community-based organizations. TILA
  offers diverse programming that emphasizes community care practices and builds
  connection between community members and service providers within LA County.
  Its diverse network is poised to successfully share its podcast.


  In 2019, TILA co-hosted an event where 35 storytellers shared their lived
  experiences of homelessness, incarceration, and trafficking. The podcast
  emerged from this event and from the desire to share diverse methods of
  healing, beyond traditional forms of therapy which are often inaccessible to
  marginalized communities.


  As an established LA-based grassroots organization with a history of community
  engagement, education, and collaboration, TILA is uniquely suited to foster
  connection between members of its network and beyond through the podcast. TILA
  already recorded Season 1 and has the infrastructure to continue.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  The goal of this project is to bolster intergenerational social and emotional
  connection through an inclusive “community care” model for healing built on
  community engagement. Healing stories, events, and workshops will center on
  LA-based artists and activists as a way of engaging with LA arts and culture. 


  TILA will track the number of listeners per episode, the number of podcast
  subscribers, and podcast shares via social media to determine its success in
  reaching audiences. Listener demographics (age, gender, and location) will
  also help measure the podcast’s reach. Further, TILA will create an online
  survey that measures listeners’ satisfaction with the podcast, perceptions of
  social and emotional connection, disability access and inclusion, and
  engagement with LA arts and culture. These questionnaires will also be
  distributed at community events and will include questions on satisfaction
  with each event. If social distancing continues, TILA will adapt all events to
  be virtual and will continue measuring through the online survey. 


  For community events, TILA will measure the number of event attendees, the
  number of zip codes represented, the age of attendees to examine
  intergenerational participation, and the number of newsletter sign-ups to
  measure community interest in trauma-informed programming.


  The online version will remain accessible on TILA’s website after the first
  episode of Season 2 airs. A paper version will be available for in-person
  events, which will allow TILA to report the data collected in aggregate
  (combining the data obtained from podcast listeners and resource fair
  participants) as well as by form of engagement. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '2250'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '375'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >
  As seen through the ACEs study (Felitti, 1998), trauma can be passed down
  through generations with negative impacts on the health of trauma survivors.
  Social and emotional connection can foster healing, thereby mitigating the
  transmission of intergenerational trauma. The podcast and its in-person and
  virtual events will therefore positively impact not only current Angelenos but
  generations to come. 


  It is difficult to fully measure the extent to which the podcast and in-person
  events will increase social and emotional connection. While TILA will measure
  feeling states through self-reporting questionnaires, it is challenging to
  assess the intangibles of social and emotional connectedness, such as empathy,
  kindness, generosity, and love.
