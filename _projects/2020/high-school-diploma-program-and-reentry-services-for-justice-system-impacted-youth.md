Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Westside
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Los Angeles County’s juvenile justice system is the largest in the nation,
  with over 6,000 youth incarcerated or on probation on any given day.
  Justice-involved youth come largely from communities with high concentrations
  of poverty, violence, and gang activity. Upon release, youth return to their
  neighborhoods with few resources to help them successfully reintegrate into
  society. Over 70% of youth who come to New Earth have been involved with the
  juvenile justice system, over 50% are still on probation, and nearly 75% have
  dropped out or been expelled from traditional schools. Most students arrive
  with some high school credits from one or more schools, and/or credits from
  juvenile court schools. Still, literacy levels can be quite low. New Earth’s
  trauma-informed wrap-around model provides a space where students can earn
  their high school diploma in a safe and caring environment, while also
  receiving case management, mentorship, job training, and mental health
  support. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  New Earth is leading the way for juvenile justice in Los Angeles. For over 16
  years, New Earth has provided creative arts education for youth in juvenile
  detention. In 2015, New Earth opened the first and only youth reentry center
  in LA County to provide wrap-around services and full reentry support. Today,
  New Earth is the only organization actively providing programming both inside
  the county’s juvenile detention facilities, as well as community-based reentry
  services upon release. New Earth also partners with the Culver City PD to
  divert minors prior to arrest, effectively preventing them from ever entering
  the justice system.


  New Earth’s track record of serving youth in LA County is unrivaled, serving
  as many as 1500 youth each year. The revolving doors of incarceration can be
  hard to escape, but New Earth is committed to reducing youth recidivism rates.
  At least 93% of youth served by New Earth remain free from re-incarceration
  (compared to the county average of just 30%).
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: "New Earth provides vital access to trauma-informed individualized educational programming for system-impacted (foster care, juvenile justice, and/or homeless) youth. New Earth’s program design allows for independent study and individualized education plans, in conjunction with necessary wrap-around reentry services to set youth on a path to succeed and thrive. \n\nSuccess of New Earth’s program is based upon the following metrics: \n*\tAt least 80 youth will participate in New Earth’s charter high school program during the grant period, accessing educational support + clinical case management and wrap-around reentry services \n*\tAt least 60 young people ages 13-18 will be diverted to New Earth’s after school diversion programs preventing them from EVER entering the juvenile justice system\n*\tAt least 125 incarcerated youth will participate in New Earth’s arts and education programming in juvenile detention\n*\t85%+ of seniors will graduate with their High School Diploma\n*\t95%+ of youth served will report that New Earth’s programs made a positive impact on their lives, evidenced by improved reading and writing skills and enhanced self-confidence and life skills\n*\t99%+ of youth who participate in New Earth’s post-release programs will successfully transition back into the community, as evidenced by obtaining a high school diploma or employment\n*\t93%+ of youth served will remain free from re-incarceration "
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '80'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '300'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  System-impacted youth know how to let their resilience carry them through
  trying times, but still may face more barriers to success than traditional
  students. New Earth’s programs encourage young people to take ownership of
  their learning experience, exposing youth to skills that increase success in
  academics, social settings, and professional careers. 

  Jaylin, a high school graduate who initially enrolled in New Earth’s programs
  while incarcerated, shares, “I was at-risk of being homeless and about to turn
  to crime to make ends meet. I had been going in and out of jail, which
  impacted my family in a big way. New Earth’s program changed my life. It
  helped prepare me for the future and see that there is something I’m working
  toward in life.”
