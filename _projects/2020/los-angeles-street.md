  This grant will support an artistic residency that will transform currently
  vacant properties in the LA Fashion District into shared community assets. The
  HDD dancemobile (a yellow convertible mustang) will move with artists between
  7th and 12th streets on Los Angeles Blvd, establishing a pop-up performance
  venue and discovery space for exhibits, performances, workshops, and other
  activities curated by HDD, with participation by a diverse mixture of
  community stakeholders.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  The LA Fashion District, where our office is located, is the historical center
  of the garment industry. While the area’s manufacturing spaces still employ a
  large number of immigrants from South America, many of the buildings that
  formerly housed showrooms and boutiques are vacant or falling into disrepair.
  Especially now, amidst the economic downturn of coronavirus, we are
  anticipating a massive decline in consumer activity. This district has been in
  a state of flux; on one side, bordered by Skid Row, one of the nation’s
  largest populations of people experiencing homelessness, and on the other
  side, a recently revitalized, bustling retail district. Between its two ends,
  the Fashion District is a conglomerate of artists and immigrants -- and this
  interplay is unique in the City. Our placemaking project intends to catalyze
  the spirit of the area, honor its historical roots, inspire hope, and inform
  community building practices as the area experiences further development.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Founded in 1985, HDD continues to redefine the relationship between audience,
  art and site-specific spaces. HDD has developed a participatory and
  transparent practice in which each project is generated in collaboration with
  the community it serves. All rehearsals and engagement activities take place
  onsite and culminate in performances tailored to foster community bonds. From
  its inception, HDD has made accessibility and inclusion core components of its
  mission. HDD promotes access and cultural equity by focusing on engagement and
  building partnerships across sectors to strengthen neighborhoods. HDD’s youth
  arts education programs, established in 2013, have served over 10,000 youth
  and families at over 25 schools and community centers throughout the City,
  with an emphasis on low-income communities. At its home in the Bendix
  Building, the company regularly hosts salons and artist gatherings in its
  space, bringing community members together to explore opportunities for
  collaboration.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  The overarching objective of Los Angeles Street is to empower the local
  community to collectively drive and improve the livability of the LA Fashion
  District and to honor and preserve its unique “maker” culture with impending
  new development. While we intend that arts and culture opportunities will
  ultimately attract more businesses and residents to the area, stimulating
  local economic development, we also hope to amplify the voices of the LA
  Fashion District’s residents and businesses. Through celebrating the history
  of the neighborhood and highlighting its vibrancy, we will equip them with the
  tools to express themselves and value their worth. In the short term, that may
  look like outreach to grow their individual businesses, in the long term that
  may look like empowered community stakeholders making informed decisions about
  new tenants that will honor and enrich the neighborhood’s culture.


  Critical to meeting these objectives is building stronger relationships
  between residents, workers, artists, business owners, property owners, and the
  local and public organizations operating in the LA Fashion District. We
  believe that the collective expression of ideas, histories, and feelings
  through dance and movement can bring people together and lead to profound
  conversations. By facilitating workshops in an industrial space with historic
  roots in the community, we recognize the cultural assets of the neighborhood
  and aim to support positive self-identification, inclusivity, and respect for
  diverse cultures. 


  To measure the impact of our placemaking project, HDD will retain an
  evaluation consultant that will measure an increase in livability and
  congeniality resulting from participating in our program. Additionally, we
  will utilize a mixed-methods approach to gathering data, using both
  qualitative and quantitative tools. Throughout the residency, we will move to
  answer the questions: “What’s alive?”; “What’s buried?”; “What’s current?”;
  “What’s forgotten?”; and most importantly, “How can we help the community be
  inspired?”; Our success will partially be measured by our ability to
  collectively answer these questions and bring an understanding of Los Angeles
  street to the rest of Los Angeles. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '100'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '1000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  HDD sees our creative work and practice as a tool of social justice, learning,
  and meaningful civic engagement. The intended beneficiaries of Los Angeles
  Street are the residents, workers, business owners, and property owners in the
  LA Fashion District. 48.6% of people are Hispanic/Latino and 12.2% are Black
  or African American; 54% are families with children; more than half of the
  population lives on household incomes of less than $40,000 and more than 600
  people are experiencing homelessness. With confirmed partner Urban Voices, we
  will bring music and movement therapy directly to individuals marginalized by
  homelessness. We will also work with Ninth Street Elementary, a local school,
  to produce a series of Teaching Artist-led workshops. 
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  HDD will work with the LA Fashion District Business Improvement District
  (BID); local businesses and property owners; SLATE-Z; local and State
  government; Ninth Street Elementary; and other local nonprofit partners to
  ensure that the unique “maker” culture of the existing community can remain
  and residents are not displaced. These relationships developed when we moved
  our headquarters in the Bendix Building in the Fashion District four years
  ago. To introduce ourselves to the community, we visited local shops with a
  boombox and danced in them. The owners, workers, and patrons not only accepted
  and appreciated this effort, but they danced with us. We are proud to have a
  number of Statements of Support from businesses and property owners who are
  excited to participate in Los Angeles Street.
