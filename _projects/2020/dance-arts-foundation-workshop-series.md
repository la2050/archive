title: Dance Arts Foundation Workshop Series
project_summary: >-
  Dance Arts Foundation is requesting support for a one-week, dance-based
  Workshop Series geared toward the young, professional-track dancers of Los
  Angeles and offered at no cost to participating dancers. The Series will offer
  specialized Master Classes and related educational experiences that will not
  only provide exceptional dance coaching, but also aid in bridging the gap
  between training at a local dance Studio and reaching higher-level education
  at a pre-professional dance Conservatory/University or professional dance
  Company.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  We are committed to providing young, adept dancers access to specialized
  educational experiences that heighten their chances of achieving a
  professional career in dance, regardless of the financial position of said
  dancers’ families. The Workshop Series we request support for highlights the
  core of these endeavors. The dancers we serve typically train at local dance
  Studios, but aspire to build their pre-professional and professional careers
  in dance. Making this advancement, however, can be a confusing, not to mention
  expensive, undertaking for dancers and families. Because our Workshop classes
  will be instructed by Master Teachers with connections to esteemed
  Universities, pre-professional Conservatories, and professional Companies
  throughout the US, the experience will aid in bridging the gap between local
  dance Studios and higher-level institutions. The coaching, mentorship, and
  exposure participating dancers will receive are bound to yield ample
  opportunity for growth and success.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Founder/President, Conny Mathot, possesses profound proficiency in the field
  of dance education, and therefore, ensures a high level of expertise is upheld
  throughout the Organization. Conny graduated College with a Bachelor of Arts
  in Dance (Teaching Major) and has spent numerous years teaching in private
  Studios, constructing and implementing instructional Programs at the
  University level, teaching Master Classes, and judging/operating Competitions.
  She was also recognized by the state of CA, via an award presented by Assembly
  Member Adrin Nazarian, for her commitment to sharing the joy and benefits of
  dance to individuals of all ages. The Master Teachers Conny appoints are
  hand-selected for their years of elite training, education, experience, and
  notable respect as professional dancers and/or dance educators. The Dance Arts
  Foundation Team possesses the passion and mastery required to educate,
  inspire, and connect young dancers to comparably successful futures in the art
  form.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: |2-
     Through our Workshop Series, and with the support of this grant, we seek to provide social-emotional, creative, constructive, and extensively valuable experiences for young dancers, both in the short-term and long-term. In the short-term, we strive to unite various dancers from throughout LA, allowing young, like-minded individuals to build relationships with and gain inspiration from one another, while simultaneously receiving coaching from Master Teachers in a uniquely intimate and nurturing environment. For the long-term, we trust the Workshop Series will help build the futures of participating dancers by granting them the opportunity to make lasting connections with Master Teachers closely affiliated with the Nation’s leading dance Conservatories, Universities, and Companies. In turn, the Master Teachers will have the opportunity to recruit these ambitious, able dancers for such higher-level places of education and work.
     In monitoring the artistic and developmental outcomes of our participants, the observable dance-related growth they achieve by way of our Workshop Series will provide clear insight into the effectiveness of our work. Our Master Teachers will work with participants on a daily basis, over the course of one full week, and thus, continually assess dancers’ progress and utilize their expertise in the field of dance education to encourage increased levels of individually-appropriate development throughout the course of the Workshop Series. In monitoring the overall response from our Program, we will utilize formal interviews and emailed questionnaires, through which Program participants, and Dance Studio Directors/Teachers affiliated with these participants, will be offered the opportunity to share their viewpoints regarding the strengths of our Program, as well as potential areas for growth.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '470'
