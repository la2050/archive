title: Skirball Puppet Festival
project_summary: >-
  The Skirball Puppet Festival is a daylong profusion of puppet theater serving
  over 2000 participants from Greater Los Angeles. Interactive performances,
  roaming marionettes and pageant puppets, live music, and puppet-making
  workshops take place across the Skirball’s indoor and outdoor stages and
  courtyards. Skirball Puppet Festival engages multiple generations with
  puppetry arts and immersive storytelling, while sharing immigrant stories and
  the value of caring for one another—a welcome celebration following the
  virus-imposed isolation.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  The Greater Los Angeles area is one of the most culturally diverse communities
  in the United States, as first-generation immigrants comprise over 35% of our
  population. There is a great need for public, accessible cultural offerings
  that reflect the area’s ethnic, cultural, and religious diversity. With free
  and plentiful parking, and accessibility via major freeways and public
  transportation, the Skirball and the Festival attract culturally,
  generationally, and economically diverse audiences. A rich mix of languages
  can be experienced at our stages and courtyards. The Festival advances the art
  of puppetry by employing puppeteers and giving a broad stage to this beloved
  yet less recognized art form. It features puppet making and a visitor
  performance space, enhancing the message that each of us has artistic
  capability and stories to tell. The Festival is an anecdote to the quarantines
  and closures caused by the coronavirus that will be embraced by a diverse
  gathering of Angelenos. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >
  The Skirball has a 24 year history of presenting day-long festivals that
  encourage creativity and foster empathy, self-esteem and civic engagement
  through performance, storytelling, and art making. The Festival provides an
  opportunity for families and people of all ages to learn together, experience
  stories both familiar and new, and to understand the conflicts and challenges
  of a complex world as told through the craft of puppetry. 


  The Skirball’s connection to the puppet arts began in 2007 with the creation
  of Noah’s Ark at the Skirball™, which features over 300 bunraku (full-body)
  puppets and animal sculptures. For its first Puppet Festival in 2012, the
  Skirball reached out to Los Angeles Guild of Puppetry (LAGP) and the
  partnership has continued every year. LAGP brings expertise in puppet arts and
  the Skirball brings a gorgeous venue and experience presenting large-scale
  public events. In 2018 the Skirball welcomed CalArts School of Theater as an
  additional partner. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  The success of the Skirball Puppet Festival will be measured by:

  The number of responses to the Call for Puppetry Acts and their geographic
  distribution

  The number and quality of puppet artists engaged and hired

  The number and quality of acts representing diverse cultural traditions

  The number of new works commissioned by/premiered at the Festival

  The number of Puppet Festival attendees

  The number of volunteers engaged with the Festival

  The number of staff engaged with the Festival

  The number of vendors hired

  Outreach and marketing activities conducted

  The number and quality of media coverage, previews, and reviews received

  The percent of favorable performance ratings received from attendees via
  surveys

  Anecdotal audience feedback indicating increased exposure to diverse cultures
  and increased appreciation of puppet traditions from around the world.


  The Skirball and its partners envision a capacity crowd of 2,000, including 50
  artists, 80 staff, 25 adult and teen volunteers, 8 vendors and their staff,
  plus the audience. A successful Festival will serve multi-generational
  families from across diverse cultural communities, enjoying puppet making and
  performing with their puppets. The Skirball Puppet Festival will showcase
  expertise in puppetry, emerging puppeteer artists; and experienced
  storytelling that embraces welcome, equality, and celebration. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '2000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '500'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  The Festival—a welcome anecdote to recent isolation—affirms a core Skirball
  belief that through shared arts and cultural experiences we can better see
  what is common among us rather than the differences that separate us. The
  selected puppeteers bring stories to life—from traditional folk tales to
  reenactments of moments in history—inspiring conversation and shared
  experience around universally accessible stories. The Puppet Festival also
  offers opportunities for visitors to explore puppet making and storytelling
  for themselves. A community performance space encourages visitors to “perform”
  with their puppets for other visitors. Many will have new stories to tell from
  the pandemic turmoil, and the need to share them.
