Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Nearly 80% of the homeowners we speak with that are interested in building a
  backyard home, want to do so to generate additional income that will help
  offset their high housing costs as well as provide funds for home maintenance
  and building wealth.  So, a backyard home is a big deal to them, and every one
  of them wants the process of building it to be simple. Yet, they don't know
  how to get their projects done right, on time, and on budget. That's why we
  offer education that walks them through every step of the process,  as well
  as  feasibility studies  so they can make informed decisions.  We help
  homeowners get clear on what they want and map out a strategy to achieve their
  goals, so they can turn their dreams into reality.  
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >
  This work is important to us because every person has the right to a decent
  permanent home that is within their means. Also, backyard homes provide
  homeowners with the opportunity to do well (decrease their housing cost,
  invest in home maintenance, and increase their net worth) by doing good
  (increase the affordable housing stock and house a person without a permanent
  home).  


  We are uniquely suited to take this on because we have successfully
  implemented a framework that shows homeowners what type and size backyard home
  is best for them based on their unique circumstances, provides them with
  answers to questions they should be asking, as well as a roadmap that helps
  ensure they do the right steps in the right order. Also, as the Best-Selling
  Author of Remodel Success: Home Remodeling Done Right, On Time and On Budget,
  the founder of Renovation Planners brings an interesting perspective to
  educating homeowners, as well as a track record of helping them achieve
  project success. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  Success for our project will be defined by homeowners' actions as a result of
  learning and transformation, as well as social engagement.  It will be
  measured by the following metrics:

  - Number of homeowners educated about backyard homes 

  - Number of homeowners provided with an individualized feasibility study

  - Number of homeowners provided with an individualized backyard home strategy 

  - Number of backyard homes built 

  - Number of backyard homes rented 

  - Number of homeowners able to remain in their homes  

  - Number of tenants housed 

  - Duration of homeowner/tenant matches 

  - Improved financial stability of homeowner 

  - Improved housing stability of tenant

  - Homeowner and tenant satisfaction and achievement of personal goals

  - Project awareness illuminating our audience

  - Number of homeowners interacting with our content

  - Effectiveness of our marketing across platforms (social media, public
  relations, advertising, outreach, etc.)

  - What homeowners and tenants think and feel about our project
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '200'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '33'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Our program will educate 200 homeowners living paycheck to paycheck on how a
  backyard home can help them  secure their financial futures.  Our goal is to
  become their trusted partner and during the grant year usher 33 homeowners
  through the process of actually building and renting one as a strategy to not
  only address their affordability challenges, but those of their renters. This
  program will positively impact the financial stability of these homeowners,
  along with the housing stability of their prospective tenants. The framework
  that we’ve created to leverage learning and transformation so homeowners
  actually take action, and not just consume content, has the potential to
  become a national model for supporting housing affordability.
