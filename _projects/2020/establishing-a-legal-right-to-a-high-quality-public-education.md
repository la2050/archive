title: Establishing a legal right to a high quality public education
project_summary: >-
  Creating a legal right to a high quality public education either by passing an
  LAUSD policy to establish a legal right to a high quality public education for
  the children of Los Angeles in 2021; or by establishing a constitutional right
  to a high quality public education for the children of California via a 2022
  ballot initiative. An LA2050 grant would support legal drafting, public
  opinion testing, coalition building, and community organizing.

In what stage of innovation is this project?: Research (initial work to identify and understand the problem)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >
  In theory, the purpose of public education is to serve students. However,
  students cannot vote, their parents cannot afford lobbyists, and they have no
  formal power to impact laws and policies that mandate them to attend school
  and govern how their schools operate -- despite the fact that those laws and
  policies often directly impact the trajectory of their lives.


  The relegation of student interests to the sidelines of education policymaking
  isn’t an esoteric issue. While a generation ago California’s public education
  system was considered a national model, California is now the least educated
  state in America. According to the US Census, California ranks last in the
  percentage of residents with a high school diploma. California ranks 37th in
  educational quality according to US News and World Report. And the average
  LAUSD student has less than a 50% chance to graduate with qualifications to
  even apply to a public university. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  The focus of my work over the past two decades has not been on a particular
  policy, school model, or ideology. It has been on unrigging the education
  bureaucracy for students. I launched a First 5 universal preschool program in
  Los Angeles. I founded Parent Revolution and passed California's parent
  trigger law to empower low income parents at the grassroots level to advocate
  for the interests of their children. I helped launch the Vergara civil rights
  litigation to establish constitutional rights for low income children and
  children of color via impact litigation. And I've been organizing around this
  theory of change for the past 4 years. Kids Coalition exists specifically to
  reorient the incentive structures of public education to serve the interests
  of students. Kids Coalition can't do this alone. This movement cannot succeed
  without parents, students, educators, and civil rights advocates leading. But
  Kids Coalition is uniquely designed to help organize this theory of change.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  The Corona Virus pandemic will ebb and flow. In 12 to 18 months there will be
  a vaccine. And eventually we will begin to physically, economically, and
  existentially recover. When that happens, society will be faced with a stark
  choice: to rebuild our institutions to loosely resemble the status quo ante,
  or to reimagine them to serve the children of this brave new world. Passing a
  legal right to a high quality public education would not embrace any single
  policy, school model, or ideology. Instead it would establish a new North Star
  to reject the false choices of the past and guide the rebuilding of our future
  institutions to put students first. 


  We are in the midst of a global calamity. Rising to this challenge will define
  a generation. No “good” that comes from this or any other disaster can ever
  justify any carnage in any way. But President Obama's Race to the Top
  initiative driving the first wave of progressive kids-first reform in the wake
  of the Great Recession wasn’t an historical anomaly. The Great Depression laid
  the groundwork for the New Deal. Windows for transformational change often
  follow moments of social and economic upheaval. 


  I would define success as being positioned to seize this moment and empower
  parents, students, and educators to fundamentally put the interests of all
  students first when the time comes to send our children back to school and
  rebuild our educational institutions. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '600000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '720000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Establishing a “kids first” constitutional right would empower parents to
  legally challenge: school calendars or schedules that inhibit the
  developmental needs of students; laws that elevate seniority above quality in
  the management of educators; school attendance boundaries that force kids to
  attend failing schools; laws that fund district bureaucracies at the expense
  of kids in the classroom; policies that inhibit access to art education; and
  laws that restrict the right of parents to choose the best public school for
  their children. This isn’t about changing any single law or embracing any
  single ideology. As with other civil rights, it is designed to evolve over
  time as society’s understanding of what it means to put kids first evolves.
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  This project is not being submitted as a formal collaboration but many partner
  organizations are engaged already. Kirkland & Ellis is doing the drafting and
  legal analysis pro bono, and has committed to representing public school
  parents pro bono after passage to enforce the right for their children. Emma
  Bloomberg's organization has already done preliminary polling with encouraging
  results and has committed to fund additional focus groups and polling as an
  in-kind donation. And I am working with multiple partner organizations to
  build grassroots support including at various stages of development: La
  Comadre, Students for Education Reform, CCSA, The Economic Mobility
  Collaborative, Allies for Educational Equity, LAUSD school board allies, PTA,
  TFA, Ed Trust, USC Center EDGE.
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Access to the LA2050 community
  - Host public events or gatherings
  - Communications support
  - 'Office space for meetings, events, or for staff'
  - 'Capacity, including staff'
