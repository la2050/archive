title: 'Knowing is Half the Battle: How Well are We Preparing Students for Careers?'
project_summary: >-
  A number of students graduate high school each year without an active
  understanding of possible career paths and/or how to best pursue them.  Still,
  high impact career readiness programs, such as work-based learning and
  industry-recognized credentialing, touch only a small portion of students.  We
  will conduct a formal gap analysis that enables policymakers, foundations,
  labor organizations, employers, and the broader community to understand the
  extent of the need, creating urgency to develop solutions and secure
  investments to close it.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Research (initial work to identify and understand the problem)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  A number of students graduate high school every year without a basic
  understanding of the career paths available to them and/or how to pursue
  them.  The impact includes disengaged students that can't "connect the dots"
  between their academic studies and future careers, confusion about which major
  to pursue if moving on to higher education, and an inability to land a quality
  job after high school graduation if not.  A joint UCLA and Claremont study
  found that 1 in 3 LAUSD students will not go on to higher education, and only
  1 in 4 will earn a college degree in 6 years.  


  While schools, nonprofits, and employers provide high impact career readiness
  programs, such as Career and Technical Education and work-based learning, our
  hypothesis is that the number of students participating relative to the
  overall student population is low.  A formal assessment will enable
  stakeholders to understand the extent of that gap, creating urgency to develop
  solutions and secure investments to close it.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Critical to a strong economy is a strong workforce, yet data consistently
  confirms skill gaps for high quality occupations, while students graduate
  without the basic skills to pursue them.  Defining the roots of this challenge
  in our K-12 system, where career readiness programs are limited, will create
  urgency to act.  With a cross-sector membership of regional leaders, we can
  secure the introductions and credibility to ensure participation from K-12
  leaders, labor, and business.  This network will also provide the distribution
  system for the report, and a basis for organizing a path forward.


  The Coalition has a strong record leading regional partnerships, while
  publishing thought leadership respected by top leaders.  For example, the
  Coalition partnered with the LA Mayor's Office in 2015 to bring together
  private and public sector talent to reform the City’s operational business
  systems, and with the McKinsey Global Institute in 2019 to publish a tool kit
  to close LA's housing gap.  
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Our long-term vision of success is all students graduating from high school
  demonstrating a foundational level of career readiness to ultimately pursue
  high quality jobs in demand by our region's employers.  First, we have to
  understand the extent of the gap in workforce readiness programming in our
  schools.  To that end, we ultimately define success of this project as a
  heightened awareness and urgency to close the gap by key stakeholder groups. 
  This will be measured by:


  -The number of networks with which the final report is shared, e.g. school
  districts, foundation networks such as SCG, employer networks such as Chambers
  of Commerce, nonprofit networks; where possible, track the number of views 

  -The number of op-eds and media mentions 

  -Target at least 10 organizations with a high volume of website traffic to
  share the report

  -Number of live and post-recording webinar views


  We are committed to highlighting these statistics in our annual report and to
  our formal briefings to our board.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '1000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '500000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Several stakeholder groups will be impacted by this gap analysis.  In addition
  to creating a shared understanding of how well our region is delivering
  programming to K-12 students, it will:

  -Educate elected officials on where policy and funding changes are needed.

  -Provide employers with a strong talent pipeline.

  -Enable nonprofits that deliver impactful programs to make the case to funders
  for expansion.

  -Enable grant makers to understand the extent of the challenge and commit to
  funding solutions.

  -Ultimately provide more students with the opportunity to pursue a high
  quality career path.


  With 1.6 million students in the region, at least 500,000 could be indirectly
  impacted by the actions stakeholders above take over the next 5-10 years.
