title: Community STEPS
project_summary: >-
  The vision of Community STEPS (Strategic dialogue That’s Empowered by Public
  Safety) is to bring law enforcement and the community together to create a
  safe space for dialogue and exercise. We walk together in the Jackie Tatum
  Harvard Park neighborhood to connect, discuss issues and work toward solutions
  while getting exercise. The program includes healthy activities for all ages
  as well as wellness events to include health information booths and blood
  pressure screenings.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to PLAY
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  The diverse neighborhoods of Harvard Park and South Park are
  disproportionately at risk for cardiovascular diseases through increased
  incidence of obesity, high blood pressure, and diabetes. Research supports
  that actions to reduce violence and the fear of violence can play a key role
  in helping individuals gain access to healthy foods and increase physical
  activity. If people believe their neighborhoods are unsafe, children are less
  likely to play outside, and adults are warier about taking part in physical
  activities. Residents who perceive their neighborhoods as dangerous have
  significantly higher body mass index’s than those who consider their
  communities safe. Studies found that higher levels of crime reduce walking or
  physical activity, especially among women and young children. Conversely,
  those who live in areas with more trust tend to have higher levels of
  activity. Making parks a safer and more welcoming place will help increase
  healthy life expectancy, a 2030 goal of AHA.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Ensuring equitable health for all has been a long-standing guiding value for
  the AHA. Our mission can’t be achieved through benefiting only some segments
  of society, and to equitably improve health requires addressing non-clinical
  determinants of health, such as environments. We also have a history of
  building coalitions to improve the health of communities. We sit at the
  intersection of health, science and business. We have been able to assist LAPD
  and LA Parks and Recreation in forming a creative solution that addresses
  neighborhoods’ needs. In addition to healthy cooking and nutrition education,
  we have been able to bring a host of resources such as the Los Angeles
  Department of Public Services to enroll families in SNAP benefits, offer a
  mobile library, health insurance options and more. As a rising global
  authority in health and wellbeing, we will continue to use our brand and
  numerous volunteers to speak up for those with no voice and fight for health
  equity.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: "Our goal is to foster ongoing dialogue with additional community stakeholders to inspire and support neighborhood innovation and ownership. There is a strong desire in Harvard Park, as well as in adjacent neighborhoods, to bring the community together. The Community Safety Partnership launched there just over three years ago and continues to see improvements in safety where residents can live out their full potential. \n\nBy continuing our partnership with the Community Safety Partnership in Harvard Park, we will define success by:\n*\tEnsuring community members feel safer to walk in their community. A goal of the 77th Division of the LAPD is to reduce crime by 15%.\n*\tIncreasing the amount of time per day and week that participants are physically active. We’ll distribute fitness trackers and leverage existing AHA programs that allow for tracking mobility.\n*\tA reduction in blood pressure and other health metrics.\n*\tAllowing law enforcement officers to better to get to know and understand the communities in which they serve. Another goal of the 77th Division is to strengthen the community-police partnership and build morale through leadership.\n\nThese measures will be comprehensive of both Harvard Park which is entering its third program year, and the expansion into South Park."
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '5000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '500000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Since the Community Safety Partnership began, Harvard Park has seen a
  significant increase in park usage and a drop in incidents of violence and
  homicide. “Our mission here was to come in and do something that’s never been
  done before to this level and really give the park back to the community and
  make them feel safe and comfortable enough to enjoy the park, walk your dog,”
  said CSP officer Les Bodiford. “I’m not Officer Bodiford here. I’m Les,
  Officer Les.”


  We anticipate 5,000 people will participate in our activities between the two
  parks. This will benefit both council districts, population 500,000, by
  increasing health, safety, and a sense of unity in the communities.
