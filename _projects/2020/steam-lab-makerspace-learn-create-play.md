title: 'STEAM Lab Makerspace: Learn, Create, Play!'
project_summary: >-
  2BCF will install its signature program, STEAM Lab Makerspace (SLM), in 20
  low/moderate income elementary, middle and high schools in Los Angeles that
  have been wait-listed since 2017, benefitting over 13,000 diverse,
  under-served students.  Installed with upcycled materials and original
  curriculum, each SLM is a career-readiness incubator of ideas - a “student
  think tank” where students can build STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering,
  Art, Math)-related skills to understand how things work, experiment, redesign
  and invent projects.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South LA
  - Westside
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  There are sustained, documented inequities in Science, Technology,
  Engineering, Art and Mathematics (STEAM) education throughout the US.
  Minorities and economically disadvantaged students are less prepared in STEAM
  coursework, leaving them less informed about science and technology, less
  prepared for the workforce, more likely to wind up with lower social and
  economic mobility, and experience a diminished quality of life. This "under
  educating" of a substantial number of local students negatively impacts LA's
  viability as a strong employment market.  According to US Dept. of Labor, over
  50% of today's jobs require some degree of technology skills, which experts
  say will increase to 77% in the next decade.  Yet, LA has the nation's 5th
  largest job skills gap, primarily in technology. For  disadvantaged students
  preparing for the future,  SLMs level the playing field by providing the space
  and resources with which to learn, innovate, experiment and build employable
  skills.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Since its founding in 2004 as T4T.org, Two Bit Circus Foundation has been
  committed to two over-arching goals:  1) providing critically-needed STEAM
  resources to under-served schools and their educators; and, 2) presenting
  STEAM principles, grounded in Project Based Learning, in an
  environmentally-sustainable and playful manner that nurtures innovation,
  creativity and critical thinking.  Over the years, the SLM has emerged as
  2BCF's most popular program.  Since 2015, 2BCF has provided 173 STEAM Lab
  Makerspaces to PreK-12 schools throughout Los Angeles and Orange Counties, as
  well as two in Tennessee.  These unique educational spaces come with upcycled
  materials, a range of tools, and original, innovative PBL-based curriculum
  that is both grade-specific and aligned with State-approved STEAM-related
  standards.  Through its SLM program, 2BCF has introduced over 200,000 preK-12
  students, well over half of them from diverse, low/moderate income families,
  to STEAM/STEM.  
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  Pre-then-post surveys are 2BCF's primary form of evaluation, measuring
  expectations against results.  The pre-survey is conducted before the SLM is
  in place, and the post-survey at the end of the academic year, giving 2BCF
  staff the opportunity to take appropriate corrective action. The positive
  impact of the SLM on student attitudes toward STEM is evident in some of the
  student responses, for example:


  What I learn in science class doesn't have much to do with the real world.

  Pre  -  58% Strongly agree

  Post - 15% Strongly agree


  I believe I am going to fail science this year.

  Pre  -  52% Strongly agree

  Post - 10% Strongly agree


  2BCF's vision of success is that up to 13,000 students each year from these 20
  schools will become increasingly proficient at STEAM/STEM, continue their
  education and have meaningful careers.  
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '13030'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '26060'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  SLMs provide STEM/STEAM resources for preK-12 students as they prepare for
  future education and an increasingly tech-heavy workplace.  This is
  particularly critical for the nearly 500,000 non-white LAUSD students who live
  at or below the poverty line, and, for the most part, attend under-served
  schools. Without outside active support, these schools struggle to provide
  educational resources for their STEM/STEAM classes and professional
  development for their teachers.  A solid STEM education that fosters critical
  thinking and creativity benefits all students and their families to come; it
  benefits our local businesses who look to our graduates for their workforce;
  and, it benefits our city as a place where businesses want to relocate.
