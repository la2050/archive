project_summary: >-
  The grant will support the implementation of a brand new outreach initiative
  and development of a Mobile Library (van) equipped with books, technological

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - San Gabriel Valley
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Altadena Libraries serve approximately 53,000 people within its vicinity.
  While Altadena has affluent areas, there is a disparity in income among the
  residents, particularly between East and West Altadena where the population
  concentration is highest. Altadena’s median household income is $88,236; the
  per capita income is $41,372 falling under the CARE income limits for a family
  of four. Altadena’s income disparity is larger than both Los Angeles county
  and the nation as a whole. 85% of local public-school students are considered
  socioeconomically disadvantaged, and schools across our community have closed.
  These inequalities and loss of learning and literacy resources threaten to
  widen income, opportunity, and quality of life disparities in our area. The
  Altadena Libraries are committed to helping students and their families who do
  not have equal opportunity to technology, literacy, and other learning
  resources through outreach projects, such as a Mobile Library.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Altadena Library District is an independent special district in Los Angeles
  County in the unincorporated community of Altadena, where there are no
  municipal or civic buildings for the community that offer a focal point for
  services. The Altadena Libraries are two of the only public places for access
  to technology, free educational materials and programming, and community
  building. In addition to thousands of visits by library patrons, the Library
  hosts over 300 community educational programs and events each year, with
  attendance of over 10,000, and actively looks for more ways to reach out to
  the community and provide library services beyond our physical walls. With a
  proven history of service to San Gabriel Valley, Altadena Library District is
  an excellent choice for investing capital for projects to LEARN, CREATE, PLAY,
  CONNECT, AND LIVE.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  A successful mobile library program would include a robust schedule of
  outreach events across all Census Tracts in our community, prioritizing
  opportunities on the west side of Altadena. Equipped with technology and
  materials in the vehicle, these events would build cohesion between community
  members around engaging activities in their neighborhoods, offer regular hours
  for Wi-Fi access in areas in need, increase library card signups and
  circulation of educational materials through mobile check-outs, and facilitate
  a spirit of service through volunteer opportunities, all operated out of a
  modified van.


  To capture both quantitative and qualitative measures of the success of our
  efforts, a key feature to be built into the technology available in the
  vehicle will be an engaging, interactive digital survey for all community
  members who use our mobile library to fill out. Another key indicator of
  success will be our library card statistics; people with library cards are
  then granted access to not only our physical but also our digital resources.
  Signing up for a library indicates an investment in community, especially in
  our community where the Altadena Libraries are key community hubs.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '31000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '53000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Altadena lacks structured communication systems and a City Hall. The Library
  absorbs traffic that a local government would address; thus, we can connect
  our community directly with key services and build civic engagement. A mobile
  library brings people key services directly and library cards, which plug them
  into our information-sharing network. Using heat maps, we can focus the
  efforts of our mobile library on areas without library cards, extending our
  reach. This would engage more people into conversations that our libraries
  conduct to gather resident data then used to guide decision-making in our
  libraries and our Altadena Town Council, which shares Altadena’s needs with LA
  County directly, impacting our entire service population.
