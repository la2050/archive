title: Los Angeles Disability Employment Initiative
project_summary: >-
  Our Disability Employment Initiative will bring public, private and nonprofit
  sectors together to enable people with disabilities to gain the skills and
  jobs they need to succeed.


  We will ensure that the ABILITIES of Angelenos with disabilities are included
  in Los Angeles employment initiatives, especially those helping the city
  recover from COVID-19.


  Our annual Los Angeles Lab for disabled entertainment professionals and other
  key work will reduce stigmas that limit employment for people with
  disabilities.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CREATE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  The COVID-19 pandemic caused an unprecedented public health crisis, decimating
  the economy. Even before the pandemic, Californians with disabilities were
  being dropped from the workforce. People with disabilities – 25% of adults in
  Los Angeles – are not included in traditional diversity employment
  initiatives, especially in the entertainment industry, LA’s third-largest
  industry. As the workforce rebuilds post-COVID-19, it is vital that people
  with disabilities are included in all initiatives, especially in film, TV, and
  media, where new hires and authentic and successful media portrayals will
  equip all viewers with high expectations for people with disabilities.


  The need is clear for our Disability Employment Initiative: 65,161 students
  with disabilities and 600,000 working-age people with disabilities live in Los
  Angeles. But only 62% of students with disabilities graduate high school,
  compared to 82% without a disability. Just 1-in-3 has a job, but studies show
  70% want to work.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  RespectAbility expands disability employment nationally and creates systems
  change with a multitiered approach that includes advocacy, education, and
  training.  We co-chair a task force of 120+ disability organizations. Locally
  we partner with UNITE-LA and the City of Los Angeles Department on Disability
  to provide expertise, convene stakeholders to foster innovative employment
  opportunities, and provide opportunities for entertainment professionals with
  disabilities to work in Hollywood studios (our Summer Lab). We are strongly
  positioned to succeed due to key partnerships and extensive networks in the
  entertainment industry, including our board members and dozens of other active
  volunteers. 


  We increase hiring initiatives of people with disabilities by working with
  studios including NBCUniversal, The Walt Disney Company and Netflix. We
  collaborate with other inclusion organizations, including the Geena Davis
  Institute on Gender in Media and GLAAD on LGBTQ equity. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: "We define success by increasing equitable hiring of people with disabilities and accurate representation on- and off-screen and by fighting stigmas that limit their employment opportunities. We will measure our success by:\n\n1.\tEnsuring the post COVID-19 economic recovery embraces the abilities of people with disabilities by running at least 4 convenings of an “Employment First” task force with the Los Angeles Dept. on Disability, along with ongoing advisory efforts.\n\n2.\tConducting at least 4 disability inclusion trainings for LA organizations engaged in rebuilding the local economy through employment and/or entrepreneurship.\n\n3.\tRunning a Summer Lab for Entertainment Professionals, which will:\n*\tTrain a minimum of 25 participants (virtually in 2020).\n*\tPlace a minimum of 15 graduates into competitive, integrated employment in studios and production companies within first year after graduation.\n*\tEnsure a minimum of 100 entertainment executives meet participants, increasing equitable hiring of people with disabilities on and off screen.\n\n4.\tThrough our year-long activities, we will:\n*\tTrain a minimum of 5 studios/production companies on disability inclusion.\n*\tAdvise on a minimum of 10 television shows, films or other media productions for more diverse and successful representations of characters with disabilities.\n*\tCreate and distribute the second Hollywood Disability Inclusion Toolkit."
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '425'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '600000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Our task force and trainings will ensure better employment outcomes for many
  of the 600,000 working-age Angelenos with disabilities, during and after the
  COVID-19 recovery. 300 employers and partners will participate in disability
  equity trainings. A minimum of 25 entertainment professionals with
  disabilities mentored in our Lab and 100 entertainment executives who
  participate in RespectAbility trainings will increase visibility of successful
  people with disabilities on screen and behind the camera. This will change
  perceptions of employability of people with disabilities, ensuring they are
  not forgotten in solutions to the COVID-19 economic crisis, or later. LA can
  become a model disability-employer and replicated around the country.
