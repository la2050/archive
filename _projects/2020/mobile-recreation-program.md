title: Mobile Recreation Program
project_summary: >-
  The City of Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks (RAP) will launch a
  Mobile Recreation Program bringing a variety of outdoor activities to
  communities in need. Mobile Recreation vans will provide themed programs
  ranging from Olympic and Paralympic sports to skateboarding and creative
  activities, enhancing the lives of the youth and adults that participate. The
  program will commence at four LAUSD elementary schools through the Community
  School Parks (CSP) Program and supplement RAP’s after-school programs.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to PLAY
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
  - LAUSD - currently four locations and working on adding more.
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Applying a proven model or solution to a new issue or sector (e.g, using a job
  recruiting software or strategy to match clients to supportive housing sites,
  applying demonstrated strategies from advocating for college affordability to
  advocating for housing affordability and homelessness, etc.)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  The City of Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks (RAP) launched a
  Community School Parks (CSP) program, in coordination with the Los Angeles
  Unified School District (LAUSD). Four elementary schools in high park need
  areas were opened on weekends to allow the public to utilize the playground
  area. 


  RAP would like to implement a Mobile Recreation Program to bring themed
  activities to the CSP sites. These vans will introduce youth to traditional
  and non-traditional Olympic and Paralympic Sports, such as badminton, field
  hockey, judo, soccer, or wheelchair basketball/tennis. Other themes may
  include a van stocked with scooters and skateboarding equipment, a van
  focusing on teaching dance to youth, or an Ecology van. 


  Adding a Mobile Recreation Program to the CSP sites will bring structured
  programs to empty school grounds and create access to recreational and social
  activities that will encourage children and families to remain healthy and
  active.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  The first goal in RAP’s 2018-2022 Strategic Plan is to “Provide Safe and
  Accessible Parks” because the lack of park access, particularly in low-income
  communities, contributes to disparities in health outcomes throughout the
  City. This includes ensuring every Angeleno has walkable access to a park
  regardless of race, ethnicity, or socio-economic status by increasing access
  to open space for Angelenos living in the highest park-need areas, through the
  CSP program. RAP strives to offer quality programs that reflect our
  community’s needs and interests and promote healthy, active lives. 


  RAP currently has two mobile vehicles that travel to schools, community
  events, and parks. These specialized vehicles are the models that we can refer
  to as they have been successful in bringing programs to youth and families
  that are not able to venture far from home. One is an Oceanography vehicle,
  and the other is a Mobile Ranger Station to bring wildlife, Jr. Ranger, and
  naturalist programs to youth.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: "Success for the Mobile Recreation Program will be defined by the increase in attendance and repeat participation at the current CSP sites, as well as healthy active youth.  Success can be measured by comparing attendance currently at CSP sites with days that the Mobile Recreation vehicle is on site.  Attendance will be monitored by the Mobile Recreation staff for each site and date they visit by tracking the number of people, gender, and whether they are youth or adults.  Dedicated staff will rotate between sites on weekends to monitor the Mobile Recreation Program and visually assess the amount of attendance, interaction, and the success of the program, as well as get feedback from people in attendance.  \t\n\nThe popularity of the program can also be measured by the addition of new CSP sites, which will provide more access to open space and recreational activities.  The success of this program will assist in illustrating the importance and need to continue to utilize open space at schools throughout the city, as well as the benefits of greening schoolyards.\n\nRAP’s Strategic Plan 2018-2022 goal to Provide Safe and Accessible Parks includes a metric to increase access to playgrounds and open space for 200,000 Angelenos living in the highest park-need areas, through the CSP program. Success of the Mobile Recreation Program will encourage additional LAUSD schools to join the CSP program, which will advance RAP’s 10-Minute Walk goals."
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '1000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '5000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  RAP envisions an accessible park system for all residents and is committed to
  equity by specifically focusing its resources to close disparities in park
  access and park program participation. According to the Trust for Public Land,
  39% of residents in the City of Los Angeles do not live within a ten minute
  walk or ½ mile from a park. CSP sites are in communities that do not have a
  park within a 10-minute walk from their home. Opening LAUSD playgrounds on
  weekends is the first step in creating much needed access to open spaces in
  the communities that are lacking this feature. Providing a Mobile Recreation
  program at these sites will bring access to equipment, supplies, and
  instructors that is much needed in these communities.
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  RAP has a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Los Angeles Unified
  School District  (LAUSD) to utilize their sites during non-school days and/or
  hours, which will be the main locations for the Mobile Recreation Program.
  LAUSD will also assist with marketing the program to students and their
  families. 
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Access to the LA2050 community
  - Host public events or gatherings
  - Communications support
  - 'Capacity, including staff'
  - Strategy assistance and implementation
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.: Los Angeles Unified School District
Which metrics will your submission impact?:
  - Obesity
  - Youth sports participation
  - Access to open space and park facilities
Are there any other LA2050 goal categories that your proposal will impact?: []
Has your proposal changed due to COVID-19?: >
  In response to the current situation involving COVID-19, RAP will need to make
  modifications to the Mobile Recreation Program proposal. The most significant
  modification will be the location of the program; instead of mobile recreation
  utilizing LAUSD schools on the weekends and after-school, this summer they
  will visit LA city parks that are not offering Summer 2020 Youth Programs. 
  Approximately 30 sites will participate with the mobile programs this summer. 
  High contact sports and activities will be substituted for activities that
  allow for social distancing and stable groups such as field hockey, tennis,
  and track & field.

  Children will be placed into stable groups with a 1:8 instructor to child
  ratio. The groups will take regular sanitizing breaks throughout the program. 
  During the summer, the mobile activities will take place outdoors where drills
  and activities will be adapted to maintain a minimum distance of six feet
  between participants.  Individual pieces of equipment will be utilized by
  participants and all equipment will be sanitized before and after each group;
  proper personal protective equipment (PPE – facial coverings, gloves, and
  safety goggles) will be used by staff and participants.  All activities will
  comply with the County Public Health guidelines and align with the Centers for
  Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  These modifications will provide a fun
  and safe environment for all participants.
