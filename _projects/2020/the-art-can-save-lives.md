title: The Art Can Save Lives
project_summary: >-
  To bring awareness to the healing and recovery that can happen when
  individuals affected by violence and abuse are provided with access to
  nontraditional therapy forms to include art, music, writing, and dance. To
  help transform lives through creative movement, to break the stigmas
  associated with being a victim of circumstance. We plan to do this through
  street art programs, music awareness concerts and other creative ventures that
  could lead to a sustainable income after healing.

What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  We are responding to the need for mental health services and providing a
  solution to the lack of access that many Los Angeles victims' needs.  The
  context of this project is to bring together survivors, loved ones, allies and
  victims to know that we are in this together and can heal together.  Healing
  and live vibrantly discovering a healthy relationship is what we hope to
  accomplish. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  We are uniquely suited to take on this project because we have been on the
  frontlines of LA reaching victims and working with our target population to
  provide these services and have the trained and qualified staff to serve the
  population that needs the help the most. This project is important to our
  organization because people deserved to be loved, know love and know what
  self-love is, but also how to create a safe mental space to appreciate and
  express themselves. 

  Creative Arts Therapy is still a highly untapped resource and we are the first
  nonprofit to provide all modalities (dance, art, music, drama and
  writing/poetry) in one place at little to no cost for the communities we
  serve.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Success for this project will be defined by the number of individuals who
  commit to reducing the number of violence and abuse cases across LA  through
  our outreach and teaching efforts.  By breaking the stigma surrounding mental
  health services and making mental health services affordable regardless of
  ability to pay.

  Using a creative outlet to express repressed emotions and then start from
  those feelings to undertake the healing process has been proven to be less
  invasive and provide a safer environment for. Through access to creative arts
  therapy, a wider range of population will be able to approach mental health.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '10000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '100000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  The population we are choosing to serve is one that is often overlooked
  because it's not talked about or discussed, we want to open the gates to the
  impact of what benefits healing can provide and how to recover.  By addressing
  the recovery of trauma we are providing an outlet to create healthy and
  vibrant relationships which in turn leads to higher self-esteem and personal
  development. Creative arts therapy provides a safe way to explore themselves
  and their emotions as they rebuild their life and purpose after trauma, while
  connecting with other individuals with similar life experiences.
