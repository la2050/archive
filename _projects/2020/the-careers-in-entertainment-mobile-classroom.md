Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South LA
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >+
  There is a persistent and significant lack of diversity and
  representation—both on and off screen— in the global entertainment industry.
  Through access, opportunity, and inclusion, Careers in Entertainment (CIE)
  aims to create a fundamental shift in this under-representation by
  diversifying the industry and amplifying the career pipeline for young people
  & families from overlooked communities. 


  CIE seeks to change the narrative by identifying and mentoring this next
  generation of content creators and creating  a network of inspired and trained
  professionals who share a vision of inclusion through action, with a long-term
  goal to enable a self-sustaining cycle of employment opportunities in the
  entertainment sector. 


  The Mobile classroom allows us to directly educate and empower
  underrepresented young people (special focus on homeless, foster &
  “opportunity youth”) and their families to learn, and gain skills in the short
  & long term. 

Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  This project is important to the work of our organization because central to
  CIE is the premise that every young person, regardless of life circumstances,
  should have an opportunity to realize their dreams—and be given access to the
  resources necessary to fulfill them, including ancillary supports for their
  parents. CIE founded by the Will & Jada Smith Family Foundation is uniquely
  suited to take this on given our ability to partner with production companies,
  studios, networks, unions and other ancillary entertainment business all in an
  attempt to help create opportunities for someone seeking a career in
  entertainment. 


  Economic opportunities await those who are given “access” and are willing to
  create new ones for themselves. The “Cycle of Poverty” is broken when people
  have access to Living wage employment opportunities and can think
  strategically about the life narrative they want to create.  We endeavor to
  encourage and empower.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: "We will define and measure success by:\n*\tPurchasing a customized mobile classroom vehicle\n*\tProviding participating youth with hands-on experience and learning in their local entertainment industry \n*\tProviding  an access point into the entertainment industry for up to 1,000 or more young people from traditionally underserved communities across LA county \n*\tUpdating the CIE \"Dream Big Curriculum\" (broken into 7 areas: Mental, Emotional, Physical, Social (family and community), Educational, Professional, Financial).\n*\tWorking collectively with  industry partners to identify potential internship, apprenticeship or employment opportunities \n\nOur vision for success for this project is we are playing a role in addressing the challenges for people living in underserved communities.  We understand the issues are nuanced but we aim to inspire the pursuit of sensible and sustainable solutions. Simply put: Careers in Entertainment wants to help young people and their families change their own lives through their own efforts.   \n"
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '1500'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '5000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Los Angeles County represents the best type of challenge in American life: How
  do we work together to make our shared city better? It is beautiful,
  strategically located, diverse, and possesses a level of civic pride that can
  serve as a catalyst for positive change if given the opportunity to express
  itself through concerted action.  This initial investment can play a long term
  role in allowing for more inclusion in the LA- Region's Creative economy which
  accounts for nearly1 in 6 jobs and billions in annual revenues ripe for both
  future  entrepreneurs and job seekers with the requisite skill sets. It is an
  equity imperative for all of us where ever we can to create career pathways
  that allow for access, opportunity and inclusion.
