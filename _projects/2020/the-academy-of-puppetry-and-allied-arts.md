title: The Academy of Puppetry and Allied Arts
project_summary: >-
  With funding from LA 2050 we intend to establish the Academy of Puppetry and
  Allied Arts which will provide lifelong learning through the many entry points
  that puppetry offers, with a specific focus on school age K-12 groups.
  Included in this program are musical & literary resources directly from our
  archives, programs and classes that explore puppetry through the intersection
  of art and technology, as well as professional mentors available to advise
  students in our theater’s storefront, a hub dedicated to direct engagement
  with the community.

What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Bob Baker’s origin story begins with the first puppet show he saw at six-years
  old; yet the forces that shaped Bob Baker’s life-long dedication to puppetry
  did not stop with the curtain call. Rather, credit belongs to the adults,
  teachers, and mentors that gave Bob the resources to foster his curiosity and
  build a legacy that has entertained Angelenos for over half a century. The
  closure of our shows due to Covid-19 forced us to think about the impact we
  have on our audiences outside of the runtime of our shows. We want to play a
  deeper role in our community, pivoting our organizational focus from
  presentation to participation. Working with educators to develop curriculum
  around the various entry-points that puppetry has to offer, we also hope to
  break socio-economic obstacles to quality arts education, often expensive or
  exclusive to certain communities. We hope to become a long-lasting influence
  on students, just as those early adults were to the formation of Bob Baker’s
  calling. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  From designing Disneyland’s storefronts to creating interactive children's
  museum exhibits as a new nonprofit, The Bob Baker Marionette Theater has
  played a multitude of roles. These experiences, along with our original shows,
  not only give us an oral tradition of artistic expertise and vital-resources
  for cultural safeguarding, but also highlight an ability to adapt to changing
  circumstances. We believe that this fluidity will be necessary in working with
  educators to find what is most needed for their classrooms. Already, our
  partnership with Zappos Kids has sponsored thousands of children from
  low-income and Title I schools, providing an inaugural theatrical experience
  to children that might have otherwise never received one. We recognize that
  each artistic experience is a valuable & rare use of funding, and for this
  reason we want the impact of seeing a BBMT show to last as long as possible,
  manifesting itself in the many creative paths that come from puppetry and the
  allied arts.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  We hope that the larger impact for this project is that the core principles
  and entry points of puppetry are recognized and utilized as a valuable and
  accessible educational tool for educators and all of the visitors to our
  Theater. We believe that through the inclusion of technical and interpersonal
  instruction in our Academy of Puppetry & Allied arts we can better foster both
  the entrepreneurial and employable skills of Los Angeles youth, in addition to
  making the building blocks of puppetry (mechanics, engineering, storytelling,
  fabrication, performance) available to all. 


  During the process of creating materials to send to schools for pre and
  post-show activities we plan to have an ongoing dialogue with teachers and
  students groups. Surveys will be sent to teachers and groups we have hosted in
  the past to use as research prior to the creation of new materials, and the
  Theater will also conduct post-show surveys with teachers and aides on site to
  gage their immediate response to the show as it relates to preparatory
  materials. In addition to these conversations and surveys, we plan to conduct
  long-term studies on repeat attendees both in formal school settings and more
  casual family outings. By monitoring long-term engagement with the Theater and
  our Academy program, we hope to collect valuable data on how lifelong
  engagement with the arts can contribute to overall graduation rates, community
  engagement, and career choice. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '9000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '40000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >
  The broader impact of this work will be to instill in students an
  interdisciplinary understanding of soft and hard skills, offering hands-on
  technical knowledge, while also placing this training in a social context. We
  believe that sparking a child’s curiosity in STEM content goes hand-in-hand
  with the ability to teach empathy and explore social issues, tasks for which
  puppets, as externalized beings, are well equipped to do. In practicing this
  holistic pedagogy, we hope to meet the needs of schools with lower graduation
  rates, building long-term relationships with the students and educators that
  come through our program. By 2050, we hope to have gathered enough data to
  further defend the necessity of arts in STEM education.
