Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CREATE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Currently, there exist no other local media networks in operation for Los
  Angeles and most local sites are not optimized or are too small to be able to
  generate income from digital ads if they tried to go about it on their own.


  The team at Los Angeleno has been working quietly since our April 2019 launch
  to partner with local media organizations to start to create a network. In
  doing so, we have uncovered significant needs that news organizations do not
  have funds, resources or expertise to address. 


  These needs are: the distribution of news and critical information locally,
  optimizing their digital presence and ensuring they can stay in operation. 


  We want to build further on the start of our local ad network framework to
  support a healthier ecosystem for local news and media organizations to tap
  into digital advertising income, among other potential sources.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  We started working on LosAngeleno.com at the end of 2018, when our local media
  found itself in an especially precarious position: it was unclear what was
  happening with the rapdily decreasing distribution of entities like LA Weekly
  and LAist. Moreover, there were very few sites operated locally that were
  optimized for how we read and share news and local information online.


  My background is as a digital-first publisher and my partner comes from an
  exclusively digital production background for Fortune 500 companies. We have
  throughout our careers led news sites, built many websites as well as having a
  thorough understanding of the challenging advertising ecosystem publishers
  face, especially at the local level, which has seen a mass diversion of
  financial support to platforms like Google and Facebook.


  With Los Angeles having many micro news deserts and our region being
  geographically large to cover, we recognize the need to partner to make sure
  Los Angeles-based media can survive.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  There are a few ways we will be able to measure our success:

  1. Participation: Getting more local publishers involved. (# of particpants)

  2. Increasing our reach: By optimizing sites, we will look to see an increase
  overall in digital news readership. (# of pageviews across the network)

  3. Revenue: We want to help provide new revenue streams for local publishers
  so they can keep the lights on. ($ generated that goes directly to funding
  journalism)

Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  The potential impact of this project is massive in ensuring that local news
  reach as many residents as possible, meaning our citizens are informed. That
  will guide how they decide to vote, what matters to them, how they can become
  civically engaged.

  Across our network, we will look to reach in some way shape or form all
  residents in the Greater Los Angeles area.
