title: Community Arts Programming & Outreach (CAPO) Project
project_summary: >-
  JGD-USA’s Community Arts Programming & Outreach (CAPO) Project is a
  high-quality, innovative reenetry and diversion program for youth who have
  been engaged in the justice system. An extension of its existing music
  programs, the goal of the CAPO is to create arts opportunities that foster the
  positive socio-emotional, behavioral, and decision-making tools to help youth
  fight recidivism and prepare them for successful employment.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to PLAY
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  According to a report from the Children’s Defense Fund – California published
  in December, 2019, Los Angeles County is home to the largest probation
  department in the world and maintains one of the highest rates of youth
  incarceration in the nation.  Justice-involved youth often have an array of
  identities and needs, yet are less likely than others to access the tools and
  skills critical for their success as they return to their community and
  prepare to enter adulthood. As a result, many of them do not successfully
  complete their probation, do not complete their education, develop mental
  health issues, engage in substance abuse, struggle with unemployment, and have
  a high recidivism rate.  JGD-USA understands that arts programs are a critical
  intervention that address trauma for youth who are incarcerated, and a
  foundational strategy for successful reentry.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >
  Arts education programs in prisons have emerged as a powerful tool to support
  inmates in developing the skills that will benefit them both during and
  post-incarceration.  While programming like this is still rare in, the
  California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation sees arts and cultural
  programming as a key tenet to that last word in their title: rehabilitation. 


  JGD-USA understands that arts programs are a critical intervention that
  address trauma for youth who are incarcerated, and a foundational strategy for
  successful reentry. For the past ten years, JGD-USA has provided impactful,
  rehabilitative songwriting workshops designed to promote healing,
  socio-emotional development and the skills that will support their successful
  return to civilian life. Since it was founded, JGD-USA has provided
  songwriting workshops and donated hundreds of guitars to justice-involved
  clients in over 137 federal and state prisons, county jail, youth camps and
  detention/reentry facilities.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: "Success factors for CAPO include:\n*\tIndividual Impact – including but not limited to self-esteem, self-confidence, critical thinking, feelings of safety and interest in completing their education \n*\tReduced Recidivism – percentage of youth who do not return to juvenile hall and/or complete probation during the program period\n*\tPreparation for employment – percentage of youth who are interested in, and secure, a creative economy career\n\nJDG-USA’s current evaluation tools include participant journals, individual writing and group exercises, pre- and post satisfaction/knowledge survey evaluations and facilitator notes.  Information from all of these sources are part of the review of participant progress and discussion of their goals. The sophistication and depth of assessment criteria grows in tandem with the growth of the participant and participants are expected to extend the assessment of their own work to include a holistic examination of their creative process. In becoming independent thinkers, they develop the ability to reflect on their own work, and the work of others, in a collaborative and as part of an interdependent whole, using the skills of communication and critical thinking. \n\nAdditionally, JGD-USA surveys its partners and appropriate stakeholders, in order to query any behavioral changes they might take note of in the participants, which covers areas such as violence, communication abilities and attitude issues.\n"
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '100'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '10000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >
  For many, CAPO is first opportunity they've had to express themselves in a
  creative way. The benefits span from societal to individual impact. The skills
  and tools gained are an essential component of youths’ aftercare program. 
  With a positive outlook toward future learning experiences, the goal is that
  youth seek to complete their education, a critical factor for reentry and
  reducing recidivism rates for juvenile offenders.


  Learning about the myriad career paths in the music industry, and acquiring
  the skills to step into these jobs, prepares youth for employment.  Coupled
  with mentor support, participants are in the unique position to gain a
  toe-hold in an industry for which they have developed a passion.
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >
  AIYN and JGD-USA have partnered for the past five years to bring music
  programs to youth in juvenile justice facilities.  While this work has been
  impactful, youth in these programs have expressed a deep desire to continue
  their art-learning experiences beyond their detention. 

  AIYN and JGD-USA are expanding their existing relationship to close these gaps
  to better these youth for successful return to their families and communities.


  JGD-USA will be responsible for the development and delivery of CAPO
  art-learning activities, and daily operation of the program.  Leveraging its
  relationships with juvenile reentry resources, AIYN will be the primary
  connector between system-engaged youth with CAPO.
