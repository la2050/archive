title: Arts2Work LA
project_summary: >-
  The Alliance seeks funding to pilot Arts2Work LA, a new creative workforce
  program for those most often marginalized from opportunity. It includes the
  very first federally-registered Apprenticeship Program in Media Arts,
  Mentorship + Equity/Inclusion training for employers, and access to new
  subsidies and grants available only through Registered Apprenticeship. We
  intend to pilot the Arts2Work LA program with 12 creative, low-income young
  people, showcasing this revolutionary blueprint and new model of reform for
  the digital generation.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CREATE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Arts2Work is a jobs program for storytellers; we are building a world where
  #oscarssowhite is a thing of the past, and the power of the #metoo movement
  has led to a new generation of women leaders in media. There is no reason that
  construction workers get paid real wages and benefits while they learn on the
  job, and creative work in the media industry is based on internships designed
  for those who can afford to work for free. Digital content producers and
  editors are in high demand while companies and institutions are making new
  commitments to diversity in front of and behind the camera -- with little
  experience in actually achieving a diverse, inclusive workforce. There is
  growing awareness of the dearth of young producers and editors of color in
  Hollywood, as well as other marginalized groups across the industry. The need
  for mentored training for low-income creative workers as well as support for
  employers in this critical reshaping of the industry has never been greater. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  The Alliance has been a leading media industry member organization for 40
  years. Since its founding in California, The Alliance has worked to raise the
  profile and influence of the media arts field on behalf of independent
  producers, community media organizations, universities, and creative
  institutions. Arts2Work is mission-critical for The Alliance; it is one of the
  core new ways we are providing access to innovation, collaboration and
  cultural impact. We are uniquely suited to deliver this program because we
  built it from an idea, we hold relationships across the industry that can
  serve Los Angeles, and we believe in its potential to be a new model of
  systemic change. Our partners in LA are ready – from West LA College to Better
  Youth to Venice Arts and Ghetto Film School, our certified training centers
  are ready and working. Coronavirus has decimated our industry, and Arts2Work
  can help build us back with federal workforce investments and incentives for
  industry partners.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Our vision for success for Arts2Work LA includes building a strong foundation
  for a bold new ecosystem where low-income youth, black and brown artists,
  women, LGBTQ & disabled communities have equal access to sustainable, living
  wage careers in the media industry. 


  The key indicators of success of Arts2Work LA will be revealed in
  creative/technical skills development, certification and living wage job
  placement for Apprentices, and response to Equity/Inclusion + Mentorship
  training for Employers. We will be measuring participation and assessing the
  outcomes 

  both during and beyond the grant period -- because impact takes time to
  measure. We will work with local partners to track quantitative measurements
  reflecting a changing creative culture. A sample of these metrics include:
   
  * Number of Apprentices & Employers engaged 

  * Number of New Apprentice applications

  * Number of Apprentices Adobe-certified

  * Number of Apprentices staying out of prison

  * Number of Apprentices growing their bank accounts

  * Number of Apprentices going to college

  * Number of Apprentices starting creative businesses 

  * Number of Employers promoting Registered Apprentices

  * Number of Employers providing on-the-job Training

  * Number of Employers embedding Apprenticeship into annual reporting and
  profit models


  The biggest impact we can have is to create the conditions in Los Angeles
  where those most often excluded have new and lasting access to living wage
  creative careers. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '525'

  Arts2Work is a systems-change initiative. More than a jobs program for
  under-represented, above-the-line creative workers, Arts2Work is designed to
  empower innovation and equity in business, creative entrepreneurship &
  community resilience. Through Arts2Work, Los Angeles media employers are now
  eligible for federal and state workforce and Registered Apprenticeship funding
  and incentives that have never before been available to them to build their
  businesses and invest in their communities. Arts2Work Alumni become part of a
  network that includes lifelong learning, grants for creative projects,
  mentorship, and entrepreneurship training. Beyond the grant period, Arts2Work
  can support LA with a sustainable, inclusive model of creative change.
