title: Creating Positive Multigenerational Change through LA’s High Schoolers
project_summary: >-
  Our proven model is transforming the high school experience. We have developed
  project-learning where students engage with real-world scenarios and roles,
  discovering their skills, passions, and career opportunities. This culminates
  in our seniors creating year-long explorations to answer the question, “how
  will you use your college degree and career to make a Positive
  Multigenerational Change?” and presenting their plans in powerful community
  exhibitions. This purpose-exploration is preparing our students for success in
  college and in life.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - South LA
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  A college education remains one of the best ways to positively impact your
  life trajectory. And yet, in a community as vibrant as LA, only 30% of people
  have college degrees. And your family’s income level dramatically impacts your
  likelihood of getting to and through college. We’re here to change that.


  We are preparing our students for success in school and life by providing a
  high-quality college prep education that meets their individual needs and
  empowering them to discover their purpose and create a plan to make Positive
  Multigenerational Change. And we are seeing results. Our alumni are persisting
  through college at unprecedented rates. A longitudinal study by USC Rossier
  researchers shows that our first two graduating classes from 2016 and 2017 are
  tracking at 67% and 69% college persistence. This is notably higher than
  district and charter peers. Our alumni are already on their way to closing the
  college attainment gap and making LA and our world a better place.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Co-founded by USC Rossier, we intentionally focus on high schools and have
  built deep expertise in what makes high schools great and effective for
  students. Our schools provide a best-in-class college-prep education and build
  a strong community where everyone has a sense of belonging. Students are part
  of a 4-year advisory cohort, and parents have 16+ 1:1 meetings with advisors.
  Last year, 100% of our 211 seniors were accepted to college, earning 1,000+
  college acceptances and $10.8 million in scholarships.


  Innovation is at our core. Every year, we convene a cross-collaborative
  Innovation Team composed of leaders, teachers, and administrators in our
  network who pilot and test new and revised practices.


  Ednovate students are consistently outperforming their district and statewide
  peers in state assessments and ACT testing. With 100% of our students taking
  the ACT, they outperform the district average, with 44% receiving a composite
  score of 21+, compared to a district average of 32%.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  We are helping our students discover their purpose and interests and preparing
  them to close the college attainment gap. We are focused on providing students
  across LA the opportunity to get to and through college and on stable career
  paths, where they can then create their Positive Multigenerational Change. 


  Our innovative, whole-child report card helps students grow in their
  intellectual curiosity, kindness to self and others, and their happiness and
  fulfillment. Students, teachers, and parents understand these six Annual
  College Readiness Indicators (ACRIs) and are aware of what they need to work
  on to reach proficiency. Our goal is for 70% of students to meet ACRIs:

  - Mastery - passing all classes with a C- or above

  - College Rigor - minimum annual ACT score targets

  - Self-regulation - Caring and Accountable conversations

  - PMC Hours - minimum of 10 passion-exploration or volunteer hours

  - Critical Thinking - PMC Journeys and performance task scores

  - Presence - attendance 


  Success on this project look like:

  - 100% of students graduate from high school

  - 100% of students complete a full A-G approved course work making them
  eligible to apply to any CSU or UC

  - 100% of seniors are accepted into a 4-year college or university with a 73%
  initial Estimated College Completion rate and with those not in college on a
  stable career path. We define a stable career path as a career that provides
  long-term support with opportunities for upward mobility and full benefits
  package.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '1455'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '3272'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Across our four LA schools, 96% of students identify as African American or
  Latinx, and 85% qualify for free/reduced-price lunch. This project impacts
  1,455 students and 3,272 family members.


  One of our students faced significant challenges with domestic violence,
  addiction, and homelessness. With the support of his Ednovate community, he is
  working on his senior Capstone to create a system that produces clean,
  renewable energy, and he will graduate this spring with honors and attend
  college this fall. His older brother re-enrolled in high school to earn his
  degree so they can attend college together and his parents are celebrating
  their sobriety. When students thrive, their families also thrive. This is
  Positive Multigenerational Change.
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  Ednovate began working with Transcend in 2017 through the Transcend-NewSchools
  Venture Fund Collaborative. Together, we reimagined our learning environments
  based on input from students, teachers and families, research, and future
  trends. We conducted hundreds of empathy interviews and worked to reimagine
  what was possible at a school that was already doing great things for
  students.


  Ednovate and Transcend continued working together to create and run an
  Innovation Team to test and pilot concepts; revise and refine practices; and
  create a two-year principal fellowship model. We are excited to continue
  partnering with Transcend to create a high school model that ensures academic
  readiness and that our graduates are ready to create Positive
  Multigenerational Change.
