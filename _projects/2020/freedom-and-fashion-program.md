project_summary: >-
  In partnership with two Los Angeles County transitional homes, we respectfully
  request support for our program which provides vital job skills, training, and
  professional and personal coaching to survivors of various injustices. Our
  participants transform their experiences that society would otherwise deem
  tragic into something beautiful. Our innovative approach helps them heal from
  the trauma of past abuse (sex trafficking, domestic violence,, homelessness,
  etc.).

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >
  We are responding to 2 major issues which often intersect:  human trafficking
  and domestic violence. When a person is trafficked by a person in the home,
  domestic violence also occurs. UNICEF USA confirms domestic violence in any
  home can very well become a 'push factor' that causes someone to become
  vulnerable to trafficking. Major hubs of slavery and abuse are centered in Los
  Angeles. 


  By combining creative job training with coaching methodology, our programs
  strengthen the right hemisphere of the brain which enables our students to
  create a new vision & accomplish aggressive goals. Fashion & beauty has proven
  to be a successful medium when engaging in life transforming lessons with
  survivors, regardless if they desire it as a career path or not.


  Though physical safety is crucial, studies show that one cannot thrive until
  freedom is experienced in the mind. This grant will fill this void by acting
  as a pillar of support & as a platform for these young women, artists, and
  leaders. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >
  Our organizational history, experience, and diverse professional team of
  leaders makes our nonprofit uniquely suited to successfully achieve our
  program goals. Since 2008, our priority has been to champion, defend, and
  empower survivors of sex trafficking and other injustices.

  In 2013, we incorporated direct impact programs designed to unlock each
  student’s gifts, talents, and expression through fashion and beauty. Our data
  and feedback proves our students break unhealthy cycles and create a new
  vision for their lives.


  Our Executive Director, Laverne Delgado, has spent many years working in the
  fashion & personal coaching industry. Beyond this, she is a domestic violence
  survivor herself. With her unique past and training, she created a program
  that yields successful results and enables transformation.  Additionally, our
  Board and volunteers are composed of highly skilled professionals (designers,
  creative directors, celebrity makeup artists, etc.) that are dedicated to our
  students.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  Our vision of success for the program encompasses transforming survivors'
  lives, taking each of them from a place of discouragement and brokenness to a
  reality of confidence and inspiration. Since its inception, Freedom and
  Fashion has collected data as well as audio, video and written testimonies to
  evaluate the impact of its fashion and empowerment-centric mentorship programs
  in improving participants’ mental health and wellbeing. We plan to continue
  conducting diagnostic assessments of each participant, including annual
  surveys, session pre and post- evaluations, and partner questionnaires. The
  primary goals of the program include helping survivors enhance their health
  and well-being, building their advocacy and leadership skills to further their
  education, and helping them gain professional skills and experience that
  enable them to obtain an entry level position in the fashion industry. Freedom
  and Fashion plans to produce the following specific positive outcomes with
  objectively verifiable results:


  90% of participants will report increased connectedness with the community,
  reduced loneliness, and a renewed sense of purpose.

  90% of participants will become advocates for survivors of various injustices.

  80% of program graduates will hold the skills that enable them to obtain an
  entry level position in the fashion industry.

  80% of program graduates will hold a professional portfolio that supports them
  professionally.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '200'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '3000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >
  Our program will not only provide vital workshops to 200 Los Angeles
  survivors, but will more broadly impact participants' abilities to become
  community leaders, advocates, and raise awareness around abuse. Our
  organization primarily serves women ages 16-60 breaking free from
  life-controlling situations. Our youth come from low-income households, in
  which many have substance abuse issues, histories of being commercially
  exploited, or criminal records. Beyond the grant period, graduates stay
  involved to mentor and help lead programming. These advocacy opportunities
  heighten awareness of current social issues, foster collaboration and
  celebrate our survivors’ stories of overcoming, inspiring 600 community
  members.
