title: 'Live Better: Helping Low-Income Seniors Not Only Survive, But Thrive'
project_summary: >-
  VIC provides 308K+ nutritious meals annually to low-income San Fernando Valley
  seniors (97% of clients) at 19 locations, including 4 ViC senior centers. For
  those unable to prepare meals due to illness, homebound seniors (44%), those
  looking for a social experience, our programs fight not only food insecurity,
  but isolation and loneliness, which can have detrimental, even fatal
  consequences. A grant will help seniors thrive by providing nutritionally
  balanced meals, socialization (post-COVID19), case management, transportation,
  and more.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - San Fernando Valley
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  ‘The Golden State is getting grayer and we need to be ready for the major
  population changes headed our way’ (Gov. Newsom press release, 6/10/19).
  ‘Fast-forward to 2030. Imagine a LA County with almost 3 M residents over age
  60, up from 1.4 M today. One in 4 neighbors will be older’ (LA Co. SENIORS
  COUNT! Survey). San Fernando Valley (SFV) in Service Planning Area 2
  (SPA2)—the most populous of LA County’s 8 SPAs—has 200,444 residents age 60+
  (2017 Am. Community Survey). SPA2 embraces 40 communities (10 are incorporated
  cities), including low-income communities with pockets of poverty, high levels
  of homelessness/gang violence & paucity of services for a growing, diverse
  senior population. As Baby Boomers reach their golden years, the time to begin
  strengthening communities by expanding senior services & wellness activities
  is now. COVID-19 necessitated we immediately shift from senior center-based
  meal offerings, to 100% food delivery, to not jeopardize vulnerable seniors’
  lives.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Celebrating 56+ years of providing services to seniors age 60+, VIC oversees
  the operation and management of 4 multipurpose community centers for older
  adults in Sherman Oaks, Van Nuys, Pacoima and Northridge. Centers, partially
  funded by City of LA Department of Aging (LADOA), are attractive, safe places
  that provide evidence-based social, educational, fitness & recreational
  opportunities. Our ‘Nutrition Meal Services−Healthy Sustenance’ program
  provides 308K+ nutritionally balanced meals annually via Home Delivered Meals
  to home-bound seniors (44% of clients); at our ViC Centers/Meal Sites; and
  through Meals On Wheels (no age requirement). In addition to hot nutritious
  food, ViC provides vital transportation to access meals and care; case
  management to prevent homelessness and mental illness; health &
  wellness/prevention activities; social engagement; recreational events. Our
  track record of impact has earned us the Daily News “Readers’ BEST Nonprofit
  Choice” for the past 4 years.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  ViC’s hot meal offering opens the door to accessing services. Breaking bread
  at a table with neighbors becomes a window through which to learn about
  diverse cultures and dissolve prejudices.


  To make LA the healthiest place to live, ViC aims to improve older adult
  well-being by expanding our proven programs aimed at helping more seniors to
  live better and thrive by: 

  1) preventing food insecurity; 

  2) removing barriers to accessing care; 

  3) preventing mental illness/homelessness; 

  4) preventing health decline exacerbated by social isolation & loneliness;

  5) fostering acceptance & respect in our diverse LA communities in Greater
  SFV;

  6) reducing our waiting list to 0–so every senior receives services.


  Ultimately we are reducing healthcare costs; assisting families caring for a
  senior; dissolving prejudice/discrimination as seniors representing a
  diversity of cultures break bread together.


  ViC measures results and evaluates all services. Our funders (e.g., LA Dept.
  of Aging) require we measure units of service for programs, which are entered
  into the city’s system. We track statistics/trends, which enable us to
  fine-tune services to meet demand.   


  We envision a day when one in 4 of LA’s residents will be seniors who are
  healthy, engaged socially, accessing services they need, and aging in place.
  Through our programs, seniors will lead the way in promoting tolerance,
  dissolving prejudices, in a model community representing LA’s diverse
  cultures.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '1000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '2000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  As our world changes and society ages, ViC is called to new, creative ways to
  express our values in the world, respond to these challenging times and make
  our services even more relevant. Our values are inclusiveness, justice and
  respect for diversity. “The growth in the older adult population [2010—2017]
  is significantly higher than that of [LA’s] general population” (2017 Am.
  Community Survey). We’re exploring new ways to expand care for
  seniors/caregivers at our Centers; creatively build capacity of Senior Centers
  to provide programs to a changing generation of seniors; continue building
  bridges within our community to foster peace, harmony and unity, as seniors
  break bread together, nourish their bodies & spirits, and break down walls. 
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  VIC has 265 volunteers & a vast network of collaborative partners: 1) food
  providers/caterers supply nutritious meals daily; 2) numerous nonprofit human
  service organizations & govt agencies comprise our Continuum of Care who refer
  seniors; 3) nonprofits/individuals who partner in provision of evidence-based
  programs (eg, A Matter of Balance, UCLA Memory Training, Arthritis Fdn’s
  Exercise Program & Walk with Ease Program); 4) funders like City of LA Dept.
  of Aging, LA Rec & Parks who make possible our 4 Centers—safe places providing
  nutrition, social, education, fitness, and recreation; 5) other partners: LA
