title: Every Child & Family Off the Streets
project_summary: >-
  This project will connect families experiencing homelessness to housing and
  will inspire Angelenos to help get every family off the streets of Los
  Angeles. Activities will connect families to housing and services. It will aim
  to encourage Angelenos to volunteer and become active participants in the
  fight to end homelessness. We believe that together we can transform lives and
  help make LA the best place to connect, live, and raise a family.

  URM is responding to the 58,936 people experiencing homelessness in LA County,
  8,799 of which are family members. Los Angeles now has the largest homeless
  population in the Country, with numbers increasing annually. 


  In addition, COVID-19 is having a devastating impact on the homeless
  population. URM is on the frontlines of the response – operating a team of
  frontline responders. We have in place a emergency measures to ensure access
  to medical care, compassionate support, and quarantine services during these
  challenging times. Staff are working overtime – overwhelmed by the scope of
  this situation.


  We want to inspire Angelenos to take action and provide opportunities for
  people to get involved with being part of COVID-19 recovery and the solution
  to homelessness in Los Angeles. By 2050, we want there to be no child or
  family living on the streets of Los Angeles. Strategies for achieving this
  include CONNECTING families to housing and CONNECTING Angelenos to
  volunteerism. 

Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >
  URM is the only shelter on Skid Row that serves families. 


  URM maintains a commitment to never turn away a woman, child or family.  


  Leading the fight on Skid Row against COVID-19, URM is keeping its doors open,
  providing access to medical care in partnership with the LA Health Department,
  and increasing meals service by 33% to keep up with the increasing needs of
  the community and the economic fallout as jobs, homes, livelihoods are lost. 


  URM’s new Angeles House Facility will provide transitional housing to 80+
  families by 2021

  URM was the first rescue mission on Skid Row to open its doors to women in the
  1980s, expanding to include families in the 1990s. Each year, more than 450
  families are connected to housing and services.


  URM opened Hope Gardens Family Center in 2007, a transitional housing facility
  which has helped end homelessness for more than 1,300 families.
