title: 'CicLAvia: Open Streets bring Healthier Connections'
project_summary: >-
  An LA2050 grant will support a large-scale polling activation during
  CicLAvia-Heart of LA on 10/11/20 featuring workshops and a voting opportunity
  that explores using open streets and public spaces to foster community under
  any circumstances. CicLAvia will share the outcomes with city officials and
  stakeholders to make these ideas reality.


  Currently we are all experiencing isolation and anxiety to combat Covid-19.
  When this difficult time ends, CicLAvia will lead in rebuilding joy around
  public gatherings with our signature open street events.

    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects

What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Historically, everyday Angelinos have been left out of planning of their
  communities resulting in dangerous civic infrastructure that costs lives.
  Recently, Covid-19 has ended community gatherings causing isolation and
  anxiety, pushing ALL Angelenos to see their neighborhoods as places to
  exercise and play locally. However, not all neighborhoods have equitable
  opportunities to do so. 


  Since launching in 2010, CicLAvia has grown into an unparalleled
  community-building experience creating a unifying social fabric, connecting
  people to each other through a spirit of play. CicLAvia is now positioned to
  become the cities’ largest community organizing tool to joyfully bring people
  together and make LA streets safer for all.


  Our 10/11/20 event will gather people from zip codes across LA. This project
  will give voice to a diversity of residents in how they want to live and play
  in their own neighborhoods while producing timely and measurable data to share
  with high level decision makers. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  CicLAvia began as a grassroots initiative in 2008, led by a group of
  passionate individuals who recognized that open street events could address a
  variety of needs in Los Angeles. Inspired by Bogotá’s weekly ciclovía,
  CicLAvia temporarily closes streets to car traffic and opens them to Angelenos
  to use as a public park. Free for all to participate, CicLAvia connects
  communities and people to each other across an expansive city, creating a fun
  and safe place to bike, walk, roll, and dance through Los Angeles.


  Since October 2010, CicLAvia has produced 35 high quality and impactful
  car-free street events and has become a recognized leader in the global open
  streets movement championing a more equitable, healthy, joyful and connected
  Los Angeles. CicLAvia events have opened over 200 miles of LA streets to 1.6+
  million people catalyzing personal and collective change, inspiring a shared
  passion for Los Angeles while cultivating shared responsibility in creating
  the region’s future.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: "CicLAvia’s goal is to shape a new narrative for a more inclusive and sustainable LA – one that works with all Angelenos to improve the quality of life in our region. Project success will be marked by community residents in greater LA once again feeling confident about connecting safely with each other in public gatherings. It will also mean residents having a voice in the planning of their neighborhoods resulting in more safe, accessible and inclusive public spaces that promote health, community wellbeing, and sustainability for all.\n\nWith the support of LA2050, we can introduce a large-scale public polling activation at our Heart of LA event. This event is expected to be one of the best-attended of the year, providing the largest opportunity to engage the greatest number of Angelenos. We hope to achieve the following outcomes with this project:\n\n*\tEngage thousands of LA County residents in a conversation about safer streets in a fun yet meaningful way, measured by attendance at outreach events, event day workshop participants and votes cast.\n*\tCollect measurable data around how neighborhood residents want to use their streets to strengthen community as evidenced by online and activation poll results.\n*\tShare actionable results with decision makers from LADOT, Mayor’s Office and key local stakeholders along with non-profits and community groups working on this issue to aid their efforts in making use of streets and public spaces more equitable in Los Angeles."
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '7000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '50000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  CicLAvia has become a beloved institution in Los Angeles, and many mark their
  calendars for our open street events. We expect approximately 50,000 people to
  attend CicLAvia—Heart of LA and engage in an experiential education in
  creating healthier communities while enjoying a day of fun. This large-scale
  polling activation will offer a more direct opportunity for many of them to be
  active participants in their built and social environments. The follow-up
  report will impact Angelenos across the county when shared with
  decision-makers and community residents alike. More empowered residents
  combined with measurable data will equip civic leaders with the tools to work
  harder to enact dramatic changes and improve the quality of life for all.
