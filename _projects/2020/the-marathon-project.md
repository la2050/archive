title: THE MARATHON PROJECT
project_summary: >-
  Whereas active participation in sports is universally accepted to successfully
  extend human life; the establishment of this annual “Marathon Project” for the
  marginalized Ethiopian, other African & African-American communities in/around
  LA, will not only accomplish in improving the physical, mental and emotional
  health/wellness of these targeted communities; but will also demonstrate what
  productive residents are able to achieve by fighting obesity, diabetes and
  other diseases, thereby enhancing the overall quality of life in Los Angeles.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to PLAY
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - South LA
  - Westside
  - South Bay
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  The context of my “Marathon Project” is very clear.  Whereas sports in general
  has been universally recognized as a unifier of communities, nations & the
  world; it has also been proven as a guarantor of physical, mental & emotional
  health/wellness. Even though black people have historically achieved
  excellence in a variety of sports for decades everywhere; the marginalized
  Ethiopian, other African & African-American communities who have long
  established themselves in Los Angeles, have unfortunately been left behind in
  their youth & adult sports participation levels. Disabling facts showing lack
  of participation in healthy/active lifestyles have led to alarming levels of
  obesity, diabetes and other diseases, but my project can contribute toward
  ameliorating this scourge. There is a strong need to encourage these
  marginalized communities to participate in a newly established marathon
  running program, which plans to diligently train them to successfully complete
  the Los Angeles Marathon. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Whereas two of the missions of the Ethiopian Community in Los Angeles as an
  all-inclusive organization are its commitment to address social issues &
  collaboratively work with other community organizations toward these ends;
  this "Marathon Project" is uniquely suited to our organization for the
  following reasons:

  (a) Ethiopia/Ethiopians have long established their prowess and legacy in
  marathon running, making this project spearheaded by our organization all the
  more significant to our work & establishing Los Angeles as the best city to
  "Play" and "Live";

  (b) Collaborating to lead "The Marathon Program" is our preeminent member Iyob
  Tessema, recognized by LA Mayor, LA City Council & California State Senate for
  his 25 years of pioneering marathoning work (25+ years of marathon
  ambassadorship & community activism, successfully completed 68 marathons/85
  half marathons), along with his  & his esteemed Sports Consulting Group, makes
  this project the preeminently quintessential project.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  This project is envisioned to elevate the marginalized Ethiopian, other
  African and African-American communities from abysmal levels of unhealthy
  lifestyles, by successfully establishing and maintaining an annual "Marathon
  Running Program." This project will provide an accessible opportunity for
  youth/adults in these communities to train for & successfully participate in
  the annual Los Angeles Marathon. The immediate goal is to secure a winning
  grant of $100K from this grant challenge in the 'Play" category, and to
  establish the structure & management of a 26-week running program from
  September 2020 through March 2021. This program aims to register,
  train/prepare, and enable 50-100 members aged 16 and above, to complete the
  2021 LA Marathon race, free of charge. The long term goal of this project also
  purports to meaningfully contribute to measurable health and wellness
  improvements within these affected communities, and will collaborate in
  various efforts to fight obesity, diabetes, mental health and other diseases. 
  Outcomes will be tracked through the various means/ways used to disseminate
  information throughout these communities, recruitment and registration of
  participants committed to a myriad of activities, as well as traditionally
  keeping attendance, depth of participation records (e.g. types & hours of
  participation per member, before/after program lifestyle changes, etc).  If
  project is renewed, it will also be possible to track retention levels over
  multiple years.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '100'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '3000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  In addition to the directly specific, and life enhancing  impact this project
  is going to have on the marathon participants themselves, the broader impact
  will be felt throughout the indirect beneficiaries of all three target
  communities: Ethiopian, other African & African American communities.
  Moreover, through this active life style choice, the overall health & wellness
  improvements of the directly & indirectly served population in all three
  communities can be measured by assessing the one year time period of
  statistical outcomes recorded in the fight against various mental, diabetes,
  obesity, high blood pressure & other related illness levels in the city of Los
  Angeles for a 1 year period (before & after effects).
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  The Marathon Project is indeed a collaborative proposal, unilaterally
  spearheaded by Iyob Tessema & his organization: LA ENDURANCE SPORTING GROUP.
  Reporting to the Ethiopian Community in Los Angeles (ECLA), he is tasked with
  comprehensively planning, directing, and otherwise managing all three phases
  of this project: Introductory, Implementation & Conclusion. ECLA will assist
  with any/all collaborative efforts with other African and African-American
  Communities, but Iyob & his group are solely responsible for building and
  maintaining newly formed relationships, and in all mutually beneficial work
  efforts. Needless to say, Iyob & his group will also act as trainers, coaches,
  mentors & guidance counselors to the 50-100 directly preparing, and ultimately
  participating in the 2021 LA Marathon.
