title: FAIR Plan for Los Angeles
project_summary: >-
  Los Angeles is tasked with adding 456,000 new homes by the end of the decade.
  Where will those homes go? Planning for those homes means creating a plan
  based on fairness, equity, and environmental sustainability. Abundant
  Housing's FAIR Plan is the first of its kind, and will create the conditions
  for job-creating home construction where we need it the most--near
  high-opportunity, job-rich, and transit-served areas. Abundant Housing is
  proposing to do outreach and education on the FAIR plan as a part of the
  Housing Element process.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >
  Under California state law, Los Angeles is tasked with adding 456,000 new
  homes by the end of the decade. L.A. has just begun its housing element update
  to plan for how to build these homes. This plan will help create homes and
  jobs that we desperately need in the post-COVID19 economy.


  Abundant Housing supports a housing element plan that equitably achieves
  L.A.’s housing production target. 


  One of the first steps towards that goal will be deciding how to allocate
  housing targets across L.A.’s neighborhoods. Abundant Housing recommends
  allocating most of the housing target to wealthy, high-opportunity
  neighborhoods, and to neighborhoods with good access to transit and jobs. We
  support this approach because it will:

  1. Reduce displacement and address housing segregation

  2. Make housing more affordable in high-demand areas

  3. Allow more people to live near transit and jobs

  4. Protect the environment from suburban sprawl


  This is why Abundant Housing is proposing the FAIR Plan.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Abundant Housing LA began in 2016 after a group of Los Angeles residents,
  including social justice activists, academics, and environmental advocates,
  noticed that there was an absence of a strong pro-housing voice on L.A.
  housing issues to address these problems.


  They formed a group of people who would stand up for housing and spread the
  word on the benefits of more housing, and build a concerted, grassroots
  movement in prosperous cities across the country to bring attention to
  exclusionary zoning.


  In November 2019, Abundant Housing LA achieved its biggest victory yet, an
  increase in the Regional Housing Needs Assessment from 430,000 to over 1.34
  million for SoCal, and the concentration of that housing in areas with jobs,
  transit, and high-cost areas. We are uniquely suited to build on this housing
  success, and use our knowledge to achieve a similar plan at the City level.


  Abundant Housing LA does not accept donations from housing developers or their
  land use consultants.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  The primary measure of success for this project is achievement of the FAIR
  Plan allocation in L.A.'s Housing Element Update, which will be finalized in
  2021. 


  Success for the FAIR Plan, long-term, will be measured by:


  Job and economic growth at the end of the COVID-19 crisis

  Lower rents

  Less tenant displacement

  Less income and racial segregation

  A stronger regional economy

  Greater access to jobs, transit, and economic opportunity

  Lower climate emissions and better environmental quality
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '5000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '456000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >
  - Ending exclusionary zoning by adding housing in high-opportunity
  neighborhoods will reduce income and racial segregation, provide residents
  with more housing options, and reduce displacement as expensive areas satisfy
  more of the city’s total demand for housing.

  - Adding housing in highly desirable neighborhoods will lower rents throughout
  Los Angeles. This means that residents will have more disposable income, which
  is good for Los Angeles’ small businesses and the local economy.

  - More homes near jobs and transit allows more Angelenos to get to work
  without driving long distances.

  - Denser infill housing near jobs and transit also shifts development away
  from environmentally-sensitive areas, which helps preserve green space.
