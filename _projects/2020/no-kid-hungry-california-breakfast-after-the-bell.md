title: No Kid Hungry California - Breakfast After The Bell
project_summary: >-
  California is 28th in the country for the number of children who are eligible,
  but not receiving school breakfast. More than half the state’s breakfast need
  is in the LA Area, which includes dense urban poverty and isolated regions
  with food deserts. We are currently partnering with schools in LA County to
  expand access and participation for breakfast by implementing “Breakfast After
  the Bell" and making breakfast a part of the school day. Our goal is to
  increase breakfast participation over the next year in 20-30 schools
  throughout LA County.

  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  1.7 million children in California are growing up in families that struggle to
  put enough food on the table. Food is one of the most significant social
  determinants of who will have good health and who will suffer from disease and
  inequities. By connecting kids to healthy food, we can start improving health
  outcomes today and the adults they become in the future. Meals provided
  through federal nutrition programs—like free and reduced-price school
  breakfast and lunch—are healthy and dependable sources of nutrition for kids
  facing hunger. When schools fully harness federal child nutrition programs,
  they can serve as nutrition hubs. Breakfast fuels the momentum for ending
  childhood hunger. Traditional school breakfast is served in the cafeteria
  before the start of the school day. A late bus, conflicting family work
  schedules, and the stigma of being the ‘poor kid’ keep millions of children
  from a healthy morning meal. Only 39% of eligible kids are eating breakfast at
  school in California.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Breakfast After the Bell feeds more kids. Nine years of school breakfast work
  has taught us a lot. We’ve crafted a set of practical, successful tools and
  approaches that work in all kinds of communities. Our No Kid Hungry breakfast
  strategy can be customized to meet the unique needs of districts, schools, and
  students everywhere. We plan and execute our work based on a measurable,
  data-driven approach. 


  Making breakfast available as part of the school day eliminates the barriers
  and dramatically increases participation in the program. There are 3 versions
  of the program: 1) Breakfast in the Classroom where breakfast is delivered and
  eaten in the classroom. Participation rates avg 88%. 2) Second Chance
  Breakfast where students eat breakfast during a break in the morning, often
  between 1st and 2nd period. Participation rates avg 70%. 3) Grab and Go where
  students pick up breakfasts from the mobile service carts on the way to class.
  Participation rates avg 63%.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: "As a means of assessing our progress toward that goal, we utilize school-level data from the California Department of Education to track average daily participation rate increases. Last year, through our efforts in the Oakland Unified School District, we tracked average daily participation rates pre and post Breakfast After the Bell Implementation across seven schools we supported, which resulted in an average daily student participation increase of 138%. While percentage increases vary based on initial participation, the models chosen to implement and the efficacy of the implementation process, our experience across the country and in California demonstrate these increases are achievable. \n\nIn addition to tracking participation rates, we use secondary outputs to track our overall progress to goals related to our specific strategies including:\n*\tNumber of schools implementing or committed to implementing Breakfast After the Bell models\n*\tNumber of school decision-makers targeted and engaged in conversations toward the goal of breakfast expansion and the strength of those relationships to yield future impact\n*\tNumber of school and political champions cultivated.\n*\tNumber of Breakfast Champion touch-points created throughout the year through both media and peer-to-peer tactics.  \n\nAs an organization, we have a uniform reporting structure documenting program participation data: In November, we will have finalized data on participation from the previous school year; In March, we will have preliminary data on the first 3-4 months of the current school year; and in July we will have 7-9 months of the previous school year data. These data points will be used to evaluate and adjust program strategies and to direct planning for each school year. \n\nOver the school year, we worked with schools across Southern California and the Greater Los Angeles Region to help them get started on their own of Breakfast After the Bell programs. Here is an example of \"success\" and how Breakfast After the Bell impacted a high school in Rialto: \n\nLast school year, No Kid Hungry gave Eisenhower High School in Rialto, California a $26,000 grant to start a Breakfast in the Classroom program. Our Breakfast Navigators were on hand to provide technical help and resources. Before Eisenhower started the program, kids could only get breakfast before school started in the cafeteria, and only 400 students were eating breakfast at school. Today over 2,000 students are starting their day with school breakfast, 400% increase. "
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '4500'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: ''
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  “Breakfast After the Bell” is a cornerstone of No Kid Hungry’s approach to
  ending childhood hunger. We know this model increases breakfast participation
  rates, reduces stigma, and has countless other benefits for kids at risk of
  hunger. A new research report That came out in January 2020 shows that serving
  breakfast as part of the school day also has the potential to significantly
  reduce chronic absenteeism in schools, which currently affects more than 8
  million students each year. The original research, conducted on behalf of No
  Kid Hungry by researchers at the UCSB, found that serving breakfast as part of
  the school day can reduce chronic absenteeism by an average of 6 percentage
  points.
