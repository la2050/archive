title: Safe Pods for Youth
project_summary: >-
  Using existing and ready-to-move in housing provided by PodShare’s co-living
  model, Safe Pods for Youth offers a low-cost and immediate solution to the
  youth homelessness crisis. Building off of SPY’s Host Home Program, which
  invites community volunteers to serve as short-term hosts for young people
  experiencing homelessness, Safe Pods for Youth galvanizes community sponsors
  to fund short-term pods for $28 a night. While living in pods, youth will work
  with SPY to find employment, enroll in school, and locate permanent housing.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Westside
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Applying a proven model or solution to a new issue or sector (e.g, using a job
  recruiting software or strategy to match clients to supportive housing sites,
  applying demonstrated strategies from advocating for college affordability to
  advocating for housing affordability and homelessness, etc.)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  SPY was founded to address youth homelessness. Annually, 10,000 youth, ages
  18-24, experience homelessness in Los Angeles; roughly 4,000 can be found
  sleeping on the streets on any given night. The risk of homelessness increases
  for youth of color, LGBTQ youth, and youth with a history of system
  involvement (i.e foster care, juvenile justice system). Without housing it is
  difficult to maintain employment, stay in school, or focus on long-term goals.
  Housing is the solution to homelessness yet to afford an apartment in Los
  Angeles ($1,340), Angelenos need to earn $53,600 annually. A typical renter in
  Los Angeles brings home $44,000 per year. Responding to the need for immediate
  and affordable housing, Safe Pods for Youth transitions homeless youth from
  the streets into permanent housing by activating community sponsors to fund
  short-term co-living pods through PodShare. Youth will work with SPY to find
  employment, enroll in school, and locate permanent housing. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  SPY is an experienced youth service provider with a demonstrated history of
  success. Since 2011, SPY has helped youth obtain temporary housing as they
  search for and secure permanent housing. In 2016, the LA Homeless Services
  Authority (LAHSA) recognized SPY’s ability to provide services to homeless
  youth and we became the lead youth agency in West Los Angeles. In 2019, SPY
  exited 129 individual youth from the streets and served  1,536 youth with our
  supportive services. 


  Over the last 3 years, SPY has launched 4 youth housing programs, including
  our Host Home Program in 2017--the first in Los Angeles. Now publicly funded
  by LAHSA, agencies throughout LA County refer to SPY for technical assistance
  with implementing this innovative and grassroots Host Home program. 100% of
  the youth who participate in our Host Home Program exit into permanent housing
  within 3-6 months. SPY has previously used PodShare pods to provide respite
  housing for youth enrolled in our Host Home Program. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  There are two primary drivers of success for this project: the number of youth
  safely transitioned from the streets and into permanent housing and the number
  of community members or organizations activated to fund future pods for youth.
  With the seed funding provided by the LA2050 Challenge we propose to
  transition 34 individual youth, ages 18-25 into permanent housing. Success
  will be measured by program outputs and youth outcomes. Program outputs
  include youth recruitment numbers, program enrollment, and program completion
  rates (3-6 months). Long-term program outcomes include increased youth
  employment, increased school enrollment, decreased food insecurity, and youth
  exits into permanent housing (Metric: Housing Access/Affordability &
  Homelessness). 


  As part of this project we will empower community members, organizations, or
  corporate partners to become part of the solution to reducing homelessness in
  Los Angeles by 2050. Recognizing that not all Angelenos have the space or
  capacity to provide Host Homes for a homeless and/or at-risk youth, we propose
  to engage corporate sponsors (through their giving schemes) and community
  organizations through their capacity to leverage and mobilize community
  resources so that all Angelenos can serve as community hosts and participate
  in SPY and PodShare’s commitment to ending youth homelessness. Our goal is to
  activate 12 community sponsors (individual, corporate partners, community
  organizations) throughout the 12-month grant period.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '46'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '100'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Safe Pods for Youth encourages a community-driven movement based on corporate
  and non-profit collaboration and the growing co-living model, to
  compassionately yet quickly move youth off of the street. This project focuses
  on moving youth into PodShare’s Westwood site but with 6 PodShare facilities
  throughout LA, there is ample room to scale up quickly. Our goal is to inspire
  additional service providers and property owners to maximize an existing
  inventory of housing to house youth. Safe Pods for Youth provides a tangible
  way for Angelenos to become part of the solution to youth homelessness. The
  ability to quickly house homeless individuals has become paramount amid the
  COVID-19 outbreak and this project is primed to support this effort. 
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  Offering affordable co-living spaces that are fully-furnished, communal, and
  rented on a month-to-month basis, PodShare will provide SPY youth with
  short-term housing and amenities (pods) from its Westwood location for periods
  of up to 3 months. Equally committed to making Los Angeles the best place to
  live, PodShare will work collaboratively with SPY, offering a below market
  rate to ensure that the maximum number of youth are able to transition from
  street-based living to this bridge housing option. To assist program
  recruitment and enrollment, PodShare will work with SPY staff to coordinate
  facility tours for interested youth and sponsors. Additionally, PodShare will
  support project advertising and tap into their networks to promote sponsorship
  opportunities.  
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Access to the LA2050 community
  - Host public events or gatherings
  - Communications support
  - 'Office space for meetings, events, or for staff'
