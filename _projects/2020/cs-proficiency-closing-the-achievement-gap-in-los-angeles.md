title: 'CS Proficiency: Closing the Achievement Gap in Los Angeles'
project_summary: >-
  Coding builds computational thinking and problem solving skills that are
  critical in STEM learning across subject areas yet there is no common standard
  for measuring K-6 coding proficiency. 9 Dots seeks a $100,000 grant to support
  our Get Coding program and close the achievement gap with significant CS
  learning outcomes for underserved students, while developing and applying more
  meaningful definitions and measurements for proficiency, including mastery of
  core coding concepts, difficulty levels, and underlying problem solving
  processes.

  - CUSD
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  An early foundation in CS and coding is a “new basic” skill set “necessary for
  economic opportunity and social mobility” (CS for All, 2016) but coding is
  increasingly recognized for its ability to develop student problem solving
  skills, applicable across STEM domains. Researchers at UC Davis have concluded
  that K-12 CS education can help address California’s achievement gap in math
  (Cheng, 2016). This gap is especially significant for students of color in Los
  Angeles (LAUSD) and Compton Unified (CUSD) schools, where only 20% & 17% of
  African American 6th grade students met the 2018 SBA Math standards.


  9 Dots is dedicated to CS education equity for low income students, girls, and
  students of color. This means going beyond CS “exposure” to close both the
  access and the achievement gap for underrepresented students by demonstrating
  meaningful student outcomes. California adopted K-12 CS standards in 2018, but
  there are still no standardized K-6  CS proficiency measures (Code.org, 2017).
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  9 Dots’ Get Coding program serves 22 LAUSD and CUSD Title I schools with K-6
  CS education, from unplugged activities to an introduction to JavaScript and
  other professional coding languages. Our original, standards aligned
  curriculum is accessible via our online Platform which is designed to capture
  basic student proficiency, interest, and motivation data, delivering key
  learning insights into every classroom.


  9 Dots also conducts formal research. Funded by the National Science
  Foundation and in collaboration with UCLA, our current project is “Programming
  as a Context for Making Problem Solving Visible: An Equity Focused K-5
  Research Practice Partnership.” Classroom observations and interviews have
  revealed the central role of problem solving in how teachers conceptualize and
  value coding. In response to our findings, 9 Dots has begun to
  “operationalize” the problem solving process more explicitly, developing
  curriculum challenge “tags” associated with core coding concepts and skills.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  9 Dots currently measures proficiency by tracking students’ successful
  completion of challenges in our curriculum and in our Level Up Challenge
  assessments, with a 75% rating considered proficient. Our goal is to define
  and measure our proficiency score to better represent learning achievements in
  terms of a) specific attainments of coding skills with defined difficulty
  levels, but also b) measurable demonstration of the computational and problem
  solving skills set out in each lesson’s scope & sequence and applicable across
  STEM domains. 


  By tagging each coding challenge for specific concepts, difficulty level, and
  problem solving strategy, we will have the capacity to run complex proficiency
  analyses on student completion data and gain profound insights into what our
  students are learning. Core coding concepts include Loops, Functions,
  Conditionals, and Sequencing. Difficulty measures include coding skill
  complexity but also the approach the student is required to take, i.e. is the
  problem highly scaffolded or is it open ended, requiring students to apply
  what they have learned to create their own solution. Problem solving processes
  necessary to complete each challenge may include Pattern Recognition,
  Abstracting, Decomposing, Refactoring, and Debugging.


  Our vision for success is one where every student in Los Angeles has access to
  a transformative CS education with measurable outcomes. We envision rigorous
  and joyful coding classrooms where students who have previously fallen behind
  or felt they did not belong in a STEM class are engaged; can demonstrate
  achievements that extend across subjects; and become creative and fearless
  learners who can persevere when facing difficult problems.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '8320'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '10420'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  9 Dots’ project will provide a model for a more rigorous definition of K-6 CS
  proficiency. Our hope is to increase understanding of not only how to measure
  proficiency in a meaningful way but what to measure in order to capture
  progress towards cognitive skills development that can help close the STEM
  achievement gap for underrepresented students.


  The first of the Standards for Mathematical Practice, “Make sense of problems
  and persevere in solving them” is highly aligned with learning outcomes
  associated with debugging. Capturing and extracting student debugging and
  problem solving proficiency at our partner schools will allow us to initiate
  longitudinal explorations of possible correlations with SBA Math problem
  solving area performance.
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  9 Dots is not submitting this grant in collaboration with another organization
  or entity, however we have strong district partnerships with LAUSD and CUSD,
  and we are currently working in 22 Title I schools, with 11 in each respective
  district. This year, we are completing a three-year district level partnership
  with CUSD and are in talks for growing the K-6 pathways and/or contracting
  with additional CUSD schools.  We were recently selected by LAUSD (the largest
  school district in the country) as one of only 61 approved “Partners for
  Student Success” contractors and are the only approved organization on the
  bench dedicated to CS education.
