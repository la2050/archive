title: Tuition-Free Digital Arts Education
project_summary: >-
  The LA2050 Challenge funds will go directly toward the tuition costs of our
  inaugural cohort of 40 students. They will receive a tuition-free, 3-year
  education in digital arts using our proven curriculum from working
  professionals in the entertainment industry. In addition, they will receive
  wraparound services to promote retention among low-income or underserved
  students to ensure they complete the program, including counseling,
  soft-skills training, transportation, and other assistance.

What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Talent is equally distributed; opportunity is not. While LA is the center of
  the entertainment industry and boasts a $100B+ creative economy, talented
  youth from low-income or underserved communities—here in our own backyards—do
  not have access to career pathways in this industry. The mission of Emile Cohl
  Arts Academy is to provide these youth with a tuition-free education focused
  on pathways into industry jobs.


  Since 1984, Emile Cohl France has pioneered a digital arts curriculum which
  has produced award-winning alumni including Oscars, Annies, and others. The
  school purchased a campus in South LA currently undergoing renovation, and
  will open with an inaugural cohort of 40 students. Our mandate is to
  prioritize local students, youth of color, underserved youth, opportunity
  youth, and others. With a proven curriculum, strong ties to the industry, and
  a full gamut of student services, our goal is to give talented youth a strong
  chance to make it in the industry.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  The inaugural cohort will serve as proof-of-concept. The first 40 graduates
  will allow us to showcase that it's possible to provide talented, underserved
  youth with a tuition-free education of the highest quality, provide them the
  services they need to break cycles of generational poverty, and serve as an
  onramp to fulfilling careers as animators, designers, special effects artists,
  and others. In particular, we're looking to provide opportunity youth with a
  chance to validate our model and serve as an example to other creative
  industries with high education costs.


  We are uniquely suited to this because we combine the curriculum, resources,
  and alumni of a respected 30-year institution with an entrepreneurial staff
  looking to prove this innovative model. In the last three years, we've built
  the program from scratch, building relationships with the studios, alliances
  with organizations serving local youth, and cultivating donors to fund the
  first three cohorts.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  At heart, the program is designed as an innovative solution to connect
  employers to local talent, and provide opportunities otherwise unattainable to
  local talent. Our success will be measured in accordance to each of these
  stakeholders.


  For students, success will be measured through the following primary KPIs:
  number of applications received, number of students entering the program,
  retention rate (at least 80%), job placement rate, and average salary at
  placement. 


  For employers, success will be measured through the following primary KPIs:
  number of applicants submitted for employment, number of applicants hired,
  reduction in time-to-hire, reduction in applicants hired from abroad.
  Ultimately, for studios our success will be measured by the diversity of
  voices, styles, and perspectives of their creatives, who will make unique
  contributions to the industry.


  Ultimately, we seek to replicate our successes in France with local LA and
  California youth. Our ideal paradigm is Sidney Kombo, a 2002 graduate and the
  first to receive a tuition-free education. Since completing the program,
  Sidney has worked on Planet of the Apes, Gravity, and most recently served as
  the creator of Marvel's Thanos for the movie franchise. He is currently senior
  animator at Weta (Peter Jackson's animation company in NZ).


  If we can offer the same opportunity to talented, underserved youth here in
  LA, individuals who can remain here in their communities and elevate these
  communities through their economic prosperity, then we've achieved our vision.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '40'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '1000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  By offering tuition-free education to local, underserved youth, we seek to
  elevate local economies by breaking cycles of generational poverty and
  injecting capital and prosperity into local communities. We envision this as a
  virtuous cycle: youth who might otherwise not have pathways into these
  highly-paid jobs in LA's creative economy are given the opportunity to thrive
  in the industry. Their prosperity benefits their families, whose future
  generations now have onramps into the middle class. Their prosperity in turn
  elevates the local community, whose members now have networks that include
  professionals in the entertainment industry. As more and more people benefit,
  the impact grows exponentially to reach more and more talented youth.
