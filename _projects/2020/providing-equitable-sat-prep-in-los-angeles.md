title: Providing Equitable SAT Prep in Los Angeles
project_summary: >-
  CollegeSpring will provide free school-day SAT preparation to Los Angeles high
  school juniors from low-income backgrounds. CollegeSpring accomplishes this
  mission by 1) training high school teachers to provide SAT instruction during
  the school day and 2) managing the logistical work that prevents schools from
  offering test prep in-house. By bringing test prep directly into the
  classroom, where all students are, CollegeSpring encourages all students to
  consider college as a viable option for their futures.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - South LA
  - Westside
  - >-
    LAUSD (please select only if you have a district-wide partnership or
    project)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  College entrance exams are a key obstacle many young Angelenos face when
  applying to college. While students from higher-income households have access
  to private tutoring, college counseling, and test preparation outside of
  school, most students from low-income households do not. This fact gives
  students with more financial resources a clear advantage when preparing for
  college entrance exams. Ninety percent of CollegeSpring students in Los
  Angeles qualify for free or reduced-price lunch, and only 28% of graduates
  from Los Angeles public high schools enroll at four-year colleges and
  universities. Over 100,000 juniors in Los Angeles County need test prep each
  year. When only some students have access to adequate preparation, the test
  fails to fulfill its primary purpose—to fairly and accurately reflect all
  students’ ability to succeed in college. Equitable test preparation at a
  system level can help transform Los Angeles into a city where all students
  fulfill their college potential.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  CollegeSpring is the only national nonprofit focused exclusively on inclusive,
  equitable SAT preparation, and we also have deep, longstanding relationships
  with many Los Angeles schools, principals, and teachers. Our Test Confidence
  curriculum is produced specifically for the needs of the student community we
  serve, offering both the academic and the social-emotional skills students
  need to succeed on the exam and get into college.


  Our people--former teachers, curriculum specialists, doctorates, and data
  nerds--are passionate about education. CollegeSpring’s leadership has deep
  experience in education, college access, and nonprofit leadership. Their
  vision for CollegeSpring’s strategy as the only national nonprofit that
  provides SAT prep through trained classroom teachers, coupled with their
  expertise in college admissions and standardized testing, makes them
  particularly well suited to this project.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  CollegeSpring has a direct impact on students’ test scores, their confidence,
  and their broader academic performance. CollegeSpring measures program success
  and outcomes in four areas. Each is keyed to our core program goals, the
  students we serve, and the teachers who make it happen. During Academic Year
  2020-21, CollegeSpring will:

  1) Serve 2,700 students in Southern California.

  2) Increase students’ scores by an average 100 points from their baseline
  score to their official SAT score. 

  3) Help at least 85% of students who complete the program meet all three
  benchmark metrics included in our measure of Test Confidence: a higher SAT
  score, increased knowledge about the test, and increased motivation and
  confidence to prepare for college. 

  4) Achieve at least an 85% satisfaction rate from teachers with the training
  they receive before implementing our curriculum and the coaching they receive
  during it.


  These goals ensure that our program is working for individual students, that
  it is helping them achieve test scores that raise their college eligibility,
  and that it is working for school partners who administer our program. 


  These goals also speak to our mission to help teachers and schools create a
  college-going culture. SAT preparation is at the heart of our mission because
  higher scores increase students’ chances of gaining admission to college,
  getting financial aid, and achieving their educational and career goals.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '2700'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '3200'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  CollegeSpring’s vision, and our ultimate goal as an organization, is to prove
  that it is possible to provide test preparation during the school day to all
  students. We want to make this an expectation nationally--not just a privilege
  for the lucky few students with access to test prep--because college
  graduation correlates with higher incomes, happiness, and civic participation.
  We already work with many Los Angeles high schools, and we are working to
  scale our program across the metropolitan area. Los Angeles has the potential
  to be a visionary city leading the way for the rest of the nation by showing
  how their public school system is committed to helping all students graduate
  from high school college eligible and college ready.
