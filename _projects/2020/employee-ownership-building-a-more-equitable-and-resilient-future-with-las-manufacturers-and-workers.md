  Employee Ownership: Building a More Equitable and Resilient Future with LA’s
  Manufacturers and Workers
project_summary: >-
  Project Equity will leverage employee ownership (EO) to preserve local
  ownership of manufacturing firms and increase economic security for low- and
  middle-income (LMI) workers. Through outreach to firms and their networks, we
  will raise awareness of and counsel manufacturers on EO transitions—the sale
  of a firm to its employees—to provide retiring owners and those considering
  closure due to COVID-19 with an exit option that averts job losses, transfers
  assets to LMI workers, and embeds greater economic resilience and equity into
  LA’s future.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CREATE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - East LA
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South LA
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  At the start of 2020, thousands of LA manufacturing jobs were at risk from
  baby boomer owners retiring without succession plans and closing their firms.
  Today, COVID-19 has made preserving LA’s manufacturing firms even more urgent
  by highlighting the nation's vulnerability to global supply chain shocks and
  the importance of domestic manufacturing. The crisis has also brought into
  sharp focus the injustices in our economy and the critical need to build more
  economically resilient and equitable communities. 


  EO presents a unique opportunity to not only keep LA’s manufacturers open for
  business, but also create a stronger future for LA: 1) EO transitions preserve
  businesses/jobs by providing owners who lack exit/succession options with a
  viable buyer—their employees, 2) EO firms are more recession-resistant with
  fewer layoffs and faster post-recession growth, and 3) EO produces more
  economically secure workers, who report 33% higher wages, better benefits, and
  92% higher net worth.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Project Equity (PE) is a national leader in the movement to harness employee
  ownership to maintain thriving local business communities, honor selling
  owners’ legacies, and address income and wealth inequality. Headquartered in
  the San Francisco Bay Area and with a team in Los Angeles, Project Equity
  works with partners throughout California—including LA County and the cities
  of Los Angeles, Long Beach, Berkeley, San Francisco, Santa Clara, and
  Fremont—and the country to raise awareness about employee ownership as an exit
  strategy for business owners, and as an important approach for increasing
  employee engagement and wellbeing. We also provide hands-on consulting to
  support companies that want to transition to EO and to new employee-owners to
  ensure that they, and their businesses, thrive after the transition. We have
  counseled hundreds of California businesses on EO transitions; those that
  transitioned generate demonstrable financial benefits for their workers. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  To date, PE has leveraged employee ownership as a succession strategy for baby
  boomer business owners retiring in the next 2-5 years. Today, COVID-19 has
  created an urgent need to prevent manufacturing closures due to owners seeking
  immediate exits, including aging owners who have weathered past recessions and
  are less inclined to endure another. PE’s long-term vision is to strengthen
  LA’s manufacturing sector and enhance community resilience by unleashing the
  power of EO to retain long-term local ownership of manufacturing businesses
  and increase future economic security for LMI and of color manufacturing
  workers as employee-owners. 


  PE will measure progress towards this vision by these outcomes:


  1. Elevating LA manufacturing sector’s awareness of EO, indicated by the
  number of firm owners and industry stakeholders (e.g., industry groups,
  business advisors) reached through our awareness raising/outreach. Target:
  4,000 owners; 250 stakeholders.


  2. Increasing LA manufacturing sector’s demand for/uptake of EO, indicated by:

  a. Number of consultations calls with manufacturing firms. Target: 80

  b. Number of feasibility studies for manufacturing firms. Each feasibility
  study takes 90-120 days. Target: 2-4

  c. Number of manufacturing firm EO transitions commenced. Each transition
  takes 9-12 months. Target: 1-3 firms; 40-300 workers 


  3. By building a pipeline of firms considering EO, creating future business
  ownership opportunities for 600 additional LMI and of color workers in
  additional firm(s) that may transition after the grant ends.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '370'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '4600'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  PE's advancement of EO can:


  Create a blueprint for LA economic development policy and investment that
  retains jobs and valuable businesses at risk due to owner retirement and
  COVID-19.


  Embed—within manufacturers and key small business support organizations and
  networks—an economic development strategy that builds in greater economic
  resiliency, equity, and recession-resistance.


  Preserve local tax revenues and anchor more money locally (every manufacturing
  dollar spent adds $2.74 to the economy).


  Increase financial security for frontline workers through higher wages, job
  stability, worker empowerment, and asset building.


  Help protect LA’s natural resources by including residents (workers) in
  company decisions with environmental impact.
