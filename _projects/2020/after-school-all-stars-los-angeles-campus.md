  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >
  CampUS & We Are Ready address serious needs in the community by preparing
  students for success in high school and beyond. While national graduation
  rates rise, youth of color are still notably absent from college & the
  workplace. Our students are in demographic groups most likely to drop out, or
  leave school unprepared for the workforce. An issue in our community is youth
  disconnection (students who are not enrolled in school or are unemployed). A
  report finds that 11% of white youth ages 16-24 are disconnected, while rates
  among African American youth are 22.5% & Hispanic youth are 18.5% (Burd-Sharps
  & Lewis, 2012). Our programs help students transition to high school while
  making connections between academic and professional success, college
  planning, career exploration, and mentoring. We Are Ready allows for early
  intervention by targeting middle-schoolers & strives to inspire students for
  the rigors of high school & CampUS provides that hands-on experience at the
  end of the year. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  For the past ten years, CampUS has created a worthwhile and memorable
  experience for our students entering high school. What makes the team at
  ASAS-LA unique is that staff members typically come from the neighborhoods
  where we serve our students. This allows a familiarity between students and
  staff that breaks down barriers are creates a trusting and meaningful
  relationship. Additionally, most CampUS participants return as junior and
  regular camp counselors. This shows that our students are committed to our
  programs and their communities by giving back as mentors. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Our vision for our All-Stars is that they grow up safe and healthy, graduate
  high school and go on to college, find careers they love and give back to
  their communities. We achieve this by identifying and fueling our students’
  individual passions and by tailoring their interests to academic support,
  enrichment, and health and fitness activities. With CampUS, we create a
  week-long exceptional opportunity where students enter high school with a
  strong foundation that will allow them to succeed.

  We measure success against outcomes using three primary data sources: pre and
  post student surveys; school and district data sharing; and participation
  tracking through Cityspan. We measure our progress toward these goals by
  examining the following outputs and outcomes. Last school year, 88% of
  participants in the We Are Ready program improved their goal orientation,
  increasing their development of both immediate and long-term life goals.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '140'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '6100'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Students who attend CampUS will have an impact on the future of the city by
  taking the skills they have learned to role model to their peers, act as
  mentors for younger students, and enter into college or the workforce better
  prepared than before. As mentioned, our students come from neighborhoods that
  pose challenges for them on many levels from food insecurity, to lack of
  access to technology, and areas that may have a high incidence of violence.
  Our students time and time again report that they are appreciative of the work
  of ASAS-LA because of the programs and also because of our caring staff who
  are dedicated to their success. Having programs like ASAS-LA ensure that the
  future of Los Angeles will be as bright as our students.
