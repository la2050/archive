title: Convergence LA 2050
project_summary: >-
  Convergence will build an online community around the LA 2050 goals of LEARN,
  CREATE, PLAY, CONNECT, and LIVE.  We will host virtual summits centered around
  each individual goal to organically build community initiatives.  We will use
  technology to give Angelenos a method to integrate these initiatives into
  their daily lives.  We’ll end the year with a live festival celebration of Los
  Angeles culture at a local park featuring local artists, small businesses,
  food-trucks, and cross-generational activities.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CREATE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Applying a proven model or solution to a new issue or sector (e.g, using a job
  recruiting software or strategy to match clients to supportive housing sites,
  applying demonstrated strategies from advocating for college affordability to
  advocating for housing affordability and homelessness, etc.)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  The recent pandemic is leading all industries to digitize day-to-day
  operations and initiatives.  Displaced artistic and entrepreneurial Angelenos
  need a place to converge and reevaluate their capabilities and the needs of
  the city.  Los Angeles must create a container to filter through the needs of
  individual Angelenos, corporate initiatives, and the LA2050 vision.  There is
  an opportunity to build a thriving business around this need.  Through this
  program we will recruit our own team of young Angeleno creatives and tech
  developers dedicated to the vision of making LA better.  We will develop
  product management systems that are scalable so we can duplicate this process
  within each goal.  Our agency will utilize virtual summits to give Angelenos a
  voice in the vision while inviting small businesses and corporations to
  participate as exhibitors and sponsors.  The digital convergence will lead to
  a live festival celebration where all participants can connect. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  We are brand development and growth strategists.  We developed this unique
  ability from joining grassroots festival organizations and contributing to
  their growth from in home operations to major corporations.  Our passion for
  underground music and live events placed us in the unique position of growing
  brands organically pre-social media.  We've toured internationally building
  production and operations teams for festival departments in multiple markets. 
  We've also taken event brands from the club to the festival level by utilizing
  organic reach, SEO, and social media to advance revenue growth. We combine a
  human first approach with an expertise in digital transformations to leverage
  programming, optimize processes, and advance results in cause based marketing
  initiatives.  This knack for brand growth, operations strategy, and talent
  fulfillment lead our projects to success based on data and results.  We will
  be applying this methodology and our network to this initiative.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  We will use marketing analysis, participation, and profitability as measures
  for this program’s success.  We are setting a goal of increasing your current
  digital footprint by at 25%.  Based on our previous community successes we are
  setting our virtual summit attendance goals at 250 participants at each of the
  6 virtual summits in Q1 and Q3.  That is 3,000 virtual summit attendees.  We
  aim to produce a festival with the same amount of attendees. Our attendance
  goal is 3,000 virtual and 3,000 in person. 


  We will also use profitability as a metric for success.  All grant money will
  be allocated towards marketing and increasing the program’s digital
  footprint.  Our business development team will launch the virtual summits and
  festival with a mixture of free and paid tiers in order to develop a
  regenerative business model for the program.  We will leverage the
  relationship with the city, the purpose of the campaign, and the inner city
  location of Hollenbeck Park to entice partners to invest in the vision.  Our
  business development team is setting a goal of $100,000 raised in partnership
  support and for Converge LA 2050.
