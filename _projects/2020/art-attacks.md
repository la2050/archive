title: Art Attacks
project_summary: >-
  Creative Acts’ Art Attacks program teaches incarcerated young people the value
  of their voice and the importance of participating in civic engagement through
  voting, and connecting with and finding leadership roles in organizations that
  are affecting change in their communities. We use community drawn art, spoken
  word poetry and other artistic endeavors to engage and inspire incarcerated
  youth to change their narratives about who they are and the impact they have.
  Our pilot program showed an 86% rise in voting for participants and
  facilitated deep connections between our incarcerated youth and the
  organization March for Our Lives.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >
  When introducing AB 2477 in 2017, ensuring that people incarcerated in jails
  and juvenile detention facilities in California can exercise their right to
  vote, Asm Shirley Weber emphasized, “Civic participation can be a critical
  component of re-entry and has been linked to reduced recidivism.” In response,
  Creative Acts piloted the ‘Art Attacks’ program in all County Juvenile
  Facilities (Children’s Prisons). Our students come from communities of color,
  backgrounds of low socio-economic status, and lives defined by gangs and
  institutionalization. Our goal was to show them the power of their vote and
  connect them to leaders in civic engagement so that their organizations can
  benefit from the input and participation of the most systems impacted people
  in their communities. 86% of our participants voted in the May 2018 elections.
  Expanding the program now will help increase those numbers among the most
  impacted communities in both local and national elections at this crucial
  time. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >
  Creative Acts founder Sabra Williams created The Actors’ Gang Prison Project
  in 2005, and has over 15 years of experience teaching adults and youth behind
  bars. In addition, the Art Attacks program employs teaching artists who are
  experienced working with incarcerated youth as well as alumni who have a
  shared experience of incarceration with our students.The program’s
  multi-disciplinary arts-based approach offers us the greatest opportunity to
  meaningfully engage young people. We created this approach because of an
  understanding of the power of the Arts to create a safe space to heal trauma
  and to engender deep, non-direct learning. This understanding evolved from
  fifteen years of bringing arts programming into prison and reentry settings,
  backed up by research and evidence, documented by mental health professionals
  and nationally renowned researchers. Our experience with this type of
  programming makes us uniquely qualified to engage in this work. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  The immediate goals of Art Attacks are to increase voter turnout among
  incarcerated and formerly incarcerated young people, connect systems impacted
  people to organizations whose work directly affects their communities and help
  them gain leadership roles in these organizations, connect systems impacted
  youth with alumni of the program to facilitate dialogue in these communities,
  and amplify the voices of these too-long ignored populations. Through the LA
  County Probation department we were able to track voting records of our
  students in our pilot program and will strive to continue to do so. We also
  hope to work with Probation to employ a mental health expert who can compile
  an impact report of the program. And finally, we always create in and out
  surveys for our students. Because our students are minors, their records are
  expunged upon release and we are unable to track them through Probation
  long-term. However, we have a strong alumni community that we intend to build
  upon moving forward and together with the partnership with March For Our
  Lives, we have the best chance of being able to continue our relationship with
  our alumni and develop teaching artists from the pool of young activists and
  systems-impacted youth for a long-term impact. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '650'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '3000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >+
  Our Education system is not built to support children dealing with extreme
  violence & trauma so we lock them up. But given creative ways to learn these
  young people start to realize their power and importance. Over 95% of them
  will return to become our neighbors. We ask what kind of neighbors do we want?
  Hardened traumatized young people who only know how to act from anger or young
  people coming back who are on the road to healing & able to make valuable
  change in their communities by civic participation? They can be our future
  leaders. They can participate in creating a more inclusive, connected Los
  Angeles that does not discard people because of what they have suffered &
  includes them in decisions that will change our culture and city.

Has your proposal changed due to COVID-19?: >
  Creative Acts is prepared to bring our Art Attacks program into juvenile camps
  virtually, if necessary, due to Covid-19 virus concerns. We are in talks with
  Los Angeles County Probation to use virtual technology such as Zoom to run
  classes that closely mirror the face to face program. Like many educators, we
  will need to revise our curriculum accordingly, but the core programming will
  stay the same: using activities and lessons rooted in the arts to help
  students find their voice, harness its power, and use it to become not only
  civically engaged members of their community, but also leaders in
  organizations that are tackling issues that directly affect systems impacted
  communities, such as our partners, March for Our Lives. In addition,
  programming online may provide the advantage of bringing March for Our Lives
  speakers into the class virtually who would otherwise be unable to enter the
  camps because they are under 18. We hope having communication with peers who
  have found leadership roles in their communities will inspire even more voter
  turnout and civic engagement from our students. In the unlikely event that
  virtual classes are not possible, Creative Acts is prepared to take the
  program to the same population outside of the youth facilities through local
  community centers and community-based organizations.
