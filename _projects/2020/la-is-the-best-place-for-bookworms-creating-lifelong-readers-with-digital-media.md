  LA is the Best Place for Bookworms! Creating Lifelong Readers With Digital
  Media
project_summary: >-
  We want to engage the next generation of LA readers. 


  We’ll take the free podcast to 3-5 public schools or libraries every month. At
  least half of the tapings will be in front of a live audience, which will be
  invited to participate on the show by talking about their favorite book. We
  will focus on local authors who are available for book signings, and we’ll
  invite local public officials and influencers to be celebrity readers.


  Curriculum will be developed for episodes, also available for free. Episodes
  will be branded LA2050 episodes.

What is the need you’re responding to?: >
  We lose readers in middle school. 


  More than half of 9-year-olds read every day - this according to the 2007
  National Education Association report. By the time they turn 13, less than a
  third of kids are daily readers. The reading numbers fall off a cliff by the
  time kids get to high school. 


  The key is creating a love for reading and a habit of reading at that most
  crucial time: middle school. 


  Book Club for Kids reinforces the importance of tween reading and fosters a
  love of literature that will carry over to high school and beyond.  


  Our podcast is designed to interact with educational systems to maximize our
  impact. Teachers and librarians incorporate the podcast into their own lesson
  plans or tap into our curriculum. 


  Our podcast offers a smarter way to use a smartphone, melding literature with
  a tween's favorite device.


  By taping episodes before live audiences at public schools and libraries, Los
  Angeles actively demonstrates that "LA is the Best Place for Bookworms!"
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >
  The podcast began in 2015 in Washington, DC. Creator Kitty Felde moved the
  show home to her native Southern California in 2020. We want to play a central
  role in LA's literary life.


  Book Club for Kids has received the California Library Association’s
  Technology Award and the DC Mayor’s Award for Excellence in the Humanities.
  The program was named one of the top ten podcasts for kids in the world by The
  Times of London and rated “excellent” by Common Sense Media.
   
  We’ve taped live shows at the National Archives and book festivals from
  Maryland to Colorado to California. 


  Our celebrity readers have included the former US Secretary of Education, a
  Laker, a Dodger, members of Congress, a governor, a mayor, a spy, an FBI
  agent, and numerous LA actors.


  We offer free learning resources at our website: curriculum, reading tips, and
  an extensive recommended reading list.


  Kitty Felde is a veteran public radio journalist who first created Book Club
  for Kids for her talk show on KPCC.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  We can measure success in a number of ways: 


  - The number of patrons who join us at their local library for live events

  - The number of LA2050 episode downloads

  - The increase in sign-ups for free reading tips newsetters

  - The number of press mentions


  But our larger purpose is to inspire that lifelong love of reading. It’s a
  tough metric to measure.


  To help us with data, we have partnered a pair of professors from the College
  of Education and Integrative Studies at Cal Poly Pomona. These researchers
  will study how the podcast can influence reading habits. Their methods will
  include both surveys and focus groups. The research will be published as part
  of “LA is the Best Place for Bookworms! Creating Lifelong Readers With Digital
  Media”! final report and distributed widely in the press and academic media.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '1800'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '420000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Los Angeles has always been a city of readers. And writers. Has technology
  changed that forever? What happens to LA if its future citizens are poor
  readers? 


  Using technology for good is Book Club for Kids' way of creating lifelong
  readers. 


  In addition, talking about a book together connects us, creating community. It
  allows us to talk about what's on our minds, inspired by what we've read.


  NOTE: To further explain the impact of “LA is the Best Place for Bookworms!
  Creating Lifelong Readers With Digital Media,” we estimate 300 young readers
  will directly participate in podcast tapings with another Angelenos; 1800 in
  the audience at live events. Additionally, we estimate the number of downloads
  of LA2050 podcast episodes to top 420,000.
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  Access Books has been building school libraries in Southern California for
  decades. They are assisting us to identify public schools that would like us
  to record on campus with their students. We will be providing books to
  students and school libraries.


  The LA Public Library (LAPL) has approved Book Club for Kids to tape episodes
  at branches across the city under their “performer” program. They’ve also
  distributed Book Club for Kids bookmarks and will distribute a new LA2020 “LA
  is the Best Place for Bookworms!” bookmark. LAPL also helped publicize our
  recent taping at the Studio City branch on its website, on social media, and
  with printed materials.
