title: 'Celebrating Diversity, Inclusion, and Culture Through the Eyes of Angelenos'
project_summary: >-
  Noun Project believes that visual language has the power to shape, reinforce,
  and change our perceptions about the world. We will hire local photographers
  to build a new collection of photos representing the diversity, inclusivity,
  and culture of the city we love, and partner with an arts non-profit to
  provide photography mentorship to 30+ students. The photos will be made
  available for anyone to use for free under a Creative Commons license, so that
  images representing a more inclusive world can be shared from the classroom to
  the boardroom.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CREATE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Applying a proven model or solution to a new issue or sector (e.g, using a job
  recruiting software or strategy to match clients to supportive housing sites,
  applying demonstrated strategies from advocating for college affordability to
  advocating for housing affordability and homelessness, etc.)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  We believe visual language has the power to shape, reinforce, and change our
  perceptions, and that representation is a fundamental part of equality.
  Despite recent steps we’ve taken as a society to champion equality, many
  visual representations still support outdated stereotypes. We want to utilize
  photography to give a visual voice to people who’ve traditionally been
  underrepresented and build a collection of photos that are beautiful,
  authentic, inclusive, and diverse. 


  With people from over 140 countries speaking 224 languages, 73% of residents
  identifying as POC and 50% women, LA is one of the most diverse cities in the
  world and a leader in diversity, inclusion, and cultural initiatives. We want
  to hire local photographers to document and highlight the authentic beauty of
  our communities. The final collection will be free under a Creative Commons
  license, ensuring it spreads far and wide, from the classroom to the
  boardroom, setting a new precedent for visual representation. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Noun Project launched in 2011 with a mission to build a global visual
  language. Since then, our community of creators has built the most extensive
  and diverse collection of iconography ever created. With over 6 million users,
  our platform is used and loved by people all over the world. 
      
  As a leader in visual communication, we have a responsibility to champion more
  equal and accurate representation. To create more representation and inclusion
  in iconography, we’ve spearheaded initiatives like the Redefining Women icon
  collection, writing guidelines for depicting race in iconography, and
  enforcing strict curatorial rules. Guided by the same vision and principles we
  were founded on, we are now challenging outdated stereotypes in photography. 
      
  As an LA-based company, it’s important that we support the local creative
  community while sharing with the world what makes LA an inclusive, innovative,
  and vibrant city.

Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '1000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '6000000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  This project will directly impact LA’s creative community by supporting local
  photographers and students. By highlighting some of the incredible people in
  our communities and organizations working in the areas of immigration, gender
  equity, education, and more, we will be amplifying a powerful message about
  Los Angeles, diversity and inclusion. 


  The publicly released photo collection will have a positive social impact and
  set a new precedent for more equal and accurate representation in visual
  media. Most poignantly stated by researcher George Gerbner: “Representation in
  the fictional world signifies social existence; absence means symbolic
  annihilation.”
