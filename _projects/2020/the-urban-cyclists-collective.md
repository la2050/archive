title: The Urban Cyclists Collective
project_summary: >-
  The Urban Cycling Collective is a project that aims to increase urban cycling
  ridership in South LA through bike/trike & equipment giveaways, bike safety
  training, marshaling rides, and establishing new bicycle clubs in surrounding
  neighborhoods. Based in Watts, ESRBC has been cultivating bike culture and
  steering youth & their families away from drugs and gang activity for over 10+
  years. We intend to scale our program in Watts in addition to 4 communities
  surrounding our neighborhoods: Compton, Lynwood, Florence-Firestone, and
  Willowbrook.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to PLAY
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  The Urban Cyclists Collective project was created in response to the poor
  physical & mental health and low ridership plaguing South LA. In LA County’s
  Service Planning Area 6, which houses our project area, physical & mental
  health is in poor condition. Several stressful triggers leave little room for
  residents to cope with depression and anxiety in a healthy way. Also, with few
  options to exercise, residents find it difficult to manage health indicators
  like weight, BMI, heart rate, and blood pressure. Even though a lot of work
  has been done to bring healthier food choices into our area, lack of exercise
  still remains a problem for youth & their families. ESRBC believes group bike
  rides is the solution to these issues. Riding helps lower the chance of
  depression & anxiety; encourages weight loss & decreases BMI; and positively
  manages heart rate, blood pressure, and other health indicators. Increasing
  ridership in our area by 250 people will ignite a change in lifestyle and
  health.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  East Side Riders Bicycle Club has been leading bicycle rides in the Watts and
  surrounding community since 2008. Birthed from the need for alternative social
  & community engagement among heavy gang violence and substance abuse, the
  organization has become a fixture in creating positive ways for residents
  within the community to build the type of community they want to have. Our
  organization is a change agent. It is fueled by connectedness in an area that
  is historically divisive. It is sustained by the hope of a safer community for
  families to live and grow together.

  We believe it is healthy to stay connected to each other and our community as
  we ride. Our goal is to expand what we currently do to the neighborhoods and
  cities surrounding Watts. Expanding our love for cycling and deepening our
  connections with our neighbors builds stronger relationships as we serve each
  other and our section of Los Angeles County. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: "We envision our neighborhoods and the surrounding communities as interconnected places where youth and their families can live healthy lives biking. The goals to get there are: \n1. Recruit 250 participants ages 10 to 80 from the 5 communities.\n2. Give 50 bikes/trikes and equipment to participants in each community: Watts, Compton, Lynwood, Willowbrook, and Florence-Firestone.\n3. Hold month bike-related workshops, including bike safety, how to marshal a ride, and establishing a successful bicycle club.\n4. Collected the initial and subsequent physical health data: weight, BMI, blood pressure, resting rate and chest, waist, & hip circumference. Surveys regarding miles traveled and ride destinations, in addition to questions regarding mental health.\nWe are aiming for the following project outcomes:\nA.\t250 new urban bi-/tricyclists in our part of South LA County.\nB.\t4 new active bicycle clubs in South LA\nC.\tA riding average of 7 miles/week per person.\nD.\tAn average of 10 lbs weight loss per person\nE.\tAn average decrease of 2 BMI points\nF.\tDecrease in 5 inches of chests, hips, and waists\nG.\tAll participants’ blood pressure in a healthy range\nH.\t25% decrease in chronic depression, anxiety, and feelings of isolation\nI.\t50% increase of daily ridership."
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '250'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '3750'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  The Urban Cycling Collective is designed to create exercise options for
  residents. We know from our 10+ years of experience that bike riding keeps
  individuals healthy & happy, strengthens our connections to neighbors, and
  deepens our roots in our community.  Our intention is to attract all ages, all
  race, and all cultures to this cycling program. We also aim to train residents
  to incorporate exercise into their daily lives: school, grocery store, paying
  bills at local utility, senior center, etc. Our hope is that these 250 people
  will influence their social circle. A 2018 article in the Financial Times
  stated humans devote two-thirds of our deepest connections and social time
  with 15 people. We are hoping to influence 250x15= 3,750 people.
