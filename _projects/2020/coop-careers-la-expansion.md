title: COOP Careers LA Expansion
project_summary: >-
  COOP’s flagship program is a unique digital apprenticeship: peer cohorts of 16
  motivated, underemployed grads meet nightly for 16 weeks (200 hours) to learn
  technical skills, build community, and jumpstart careers in digital marketing
  and data analytics. Each cohort is led by a team of four cohort captains,
  near-peer program alumni who serve as coaches, and mentors on top of busy jobs
  at local ad agencies and tech companies. In parallel, COOP helps these same
  employers meet and hire an increasing number of diverse, qualified
  candidates.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CREATE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >
  Nationwide, nearly half of recent college grads (ages 21-27) are unemployed or
  underemployed, and the rates are even higher for black college grads (Vox).
  With almost 400,000 Black and Latinx college graduates (NCES) entering the
  workforce every year, this underemployment crisis only stands to grow. This is
  a recipe to deepen national trends of downward mobility and wealth inequality
  for people of color (WaPo). 


  Furthermore, informal relationships dominate our labor market. Referred
  candidates are nine times as likely to get hired (LinkedIn), and currently
  only 30% of employee referrals go to people of color (Payscale). 


  We have learned that a Bachelor’s degree is necessary, but not sufficient. We
  need connections and referrals as much as skills. Ultimately, a labor market
  powered by relationships will reinforce the status quo. We believe that by
  cultivating social networks and closing the referral gap, we can make a
  significant impact on the underemployment epidemic.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  COOP was founded in 2014 and is dedicated to closing the social capital gap-
  the deficit between high-income individuals’ reported interpersonal
  relationships with mentors and low-income individuals’ relationships (The 74
  Million)-  by training diverse, low-income, and first-generation college
  grads. Across NYC and the Bay Area, we’ve launched over 90 cohorts, welcoming
  1,000+ alumni in our first five years. 80% of alumni overcome underemployment
  within one year, earning an average of $45,000 after 12 months and almost
  $60,000 after three years. These outcomes demonstrate how COOP is fueling
  upward mobility and fulfilling the promise of higher education for the
  students we serve.


  We have grown at a rate of almost 90% annually, while still achieving stellar
  outcomes. Google, LinkedIn, and the Christensen Institute have recognized us
  as a best-in-class program, and according to an independent analysis, “Every
  $1 invested in COOP creates a permanent $9 wage increase.” (Arbor Brothers)
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  The past five years have proven that COOP deserves to be a vital part of the
  conversation surrounding upward mobility in America, and over the next several
  years we are determined to show that our work can grow across the country. Our
  aspiration is to launch 10,000 careers in the digital economy in our first
  decade, realizing 10x growth in the next four years. In order to achieve these
  lofty ambitions, COOP seeks $100,000 to expand our flagship program to Los
  Angeles, and to serve 160 local residents for upwardly mobile careers across
  2020 and 2021. See below for our goals and outcomes for this project:


  Goal 1: Recruit and train 160 underemployed/underrepresented grads in our
  flagship program

  -93% completion (149 alumni)

  -100% of students will receive a industry certification and present industry
  projects 


  Goal 2: Connect at least 80% (120 alumni) to full-time, salaried positions
  that require their degree

  -60% of alumni secure full-time, salaried positions within six months, 80%
  within 12 months, and 80% of alumni maintain job retention over 24, 36, and 48
  months

  -$45,000 median income after 12 months


  Goal 3: Train and support 40+ alumni leaders in our expanded cohort captain
  and alumni specialist model

  -Over 95% of captains are retained 10 weeks after the program cycle begins.

  -90%+ of COOPers are satisfied with their Cohort Captain.

  -9+ net promoter score for alumni leaders

  -Career promotion/advancement and wage gains for our Captains against our
  other Alumni. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '160'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '300'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Our labor market and society are dominated by informal relationships and
  people doing favors for one another. That is social capital in action, and we
  seek to utilize that “favor economy” for a part of society left behind as our
  economy has grown and now is being threatened with potential recession.


  We seek to shift the systems and narratives that say that skills are the
  pathway to prosperity, and instead one that shows how relationships can propel
  upward mobility. A common idiom is that “who you know matters as much as what
  you know,” but we have designed our systems to say otherwise. We hope to
  redesign and construct our higher education and labor market, so that they
  actively focus on building the “who you know” portion of the equation.
