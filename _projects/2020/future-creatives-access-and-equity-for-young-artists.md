title: Future Creatives – Access and Equity for Young Artists
project_summary: >-
  We will provide increased access to Ryman Arts’ high quality art education and
  college and career support to underserved youth in Los Angeles County to
  reduce barriers and increase creative career pathway opportunities.  Community
  outreach efforts will increase Latinx student participation in Ryman Arts to
  more accurately reflect overall LA demographics. Ryman Arts will introduce
  students to diverse creative leaders at behind the scenes career tours to
  provide guidance for young artists to have successful futures in the LA
  creative economy.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Applying a proven model or solution to a new issue or sector (e.g, using a job
  recruiting software or strategy to match clients to supportive housing sites,
  applying demonstrated strategies from advocating for college affordability to
  advocating for housing affordability and homelessness, etc.)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Research shows that students who engage in the arts have higher rates of
  academic achievement, high school graduation, and college matriculation (2017
  Otis Report). There is limited funding for the arts and inadequate access to
  arts education for our youth. Despite small improvements in public funding,
  the gap keeps growing for vulnerable students with fewer community resources.
  As a result, fewer teens are prepared for college and many of our students do
  not see people like themselves in the big creative industries, and don’t
  visualize themselves there. Paradoxically, the creative industries in LA
  produce $203.2 billion annually and provide 1 in 7 jobs (2020 Otis). While our
  current student demographic is very diverse, Latinx students are particularly
  underrepresented. We are committed to creating more access for underserved
  communities so that students will not miss out on building art skills,
  learning about creative careers, and 15% of creative industry jobs available
  in the County.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Since 1990, Ryman Arts has empowered 34,000 high school students, filling the
  gap of high quality arts education programs in under-resourced communities.
  Ryman Arts serves approximately 600 students through its core program and
  1,500 more through outreach efforts, annually – with students coming from over
  190 zip codes. This free, 1½-year-long, out-of-school program integrates
  rigorous fine arts instruction, college and career counseling for talented
  youth who are most deprived of arts education opportunities. Ryman Arts
  conducts outreach each year and is familiar with strategies and partnerships
  that will assist us in creating more access to the program. Additionally,
  Ryman Arts has established strong partnerships with creative businesses,
  cultural institutions, and community partners and is in a unique position to
  execute this project.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  Ryman Arts will serve 1,500+ students through outreach activities and 600
  students through our core program. Our goal is to create a more equitable
  future for underserved youth by providing access to a high quality arts
  education, in-depth behind the scenes career tours, and college and career
  guidance.


  Our outreach goal is to increase the number of Latinx students enrolled in
  Ryman Arts from the average of 25% to an incremental goal of 35% in ‘20-’21, 
  to decrease the discrepancy between Ryman Arts student body and the Los
  Angeles student population. We will increase participation in community
  festivals/events that have significant Latinx population and economic need,
  produce applications in English and Spanish, provide online resources, and
  send mailings to educators. 


  Additionally, we will provide behind the scenes tours at 10 creative
  businesses for groups of selected Ryman Arts students to increase their
  awareness of the wide range of careers. Each tour will include a Q&A with a
  designer or creative leader of color at that firm who will share advice and
  their career path. By meeting and conversing with artistic leaders, young
  people from diverse backgrounds can visualize themselves in a variety of
  creative fields and learn how they can navigate a career pathway for
  themselves. Potential Ryman Arts alumni speakers, include: Devin Crane (Ryman
  ‘96), Production Designer for Space Jam 2, Warner Bros and Adrianna Arambula
  (Ryman ’04), Creative Director at Justice Design Group. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '2100'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '10120'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Ryman Arts’ impact extends far beyond the studios where our students receive
  instruction. Upon graduating from Ryman Arts, students will have honed their
  creative and critical thinking, time management, self-discipline, and other
  life skills that are transferable to any chosen degree or vocation. Over 95%
  of Ryman Arts students go on to higher education—many are the first in their
  families – and approximately 1/3 of Ryman Arts alumni work in the creative
  fields. Our program supports our community by equipping Southern California’s
  youth with the abilities they need to develop strong artistic, academic, and
  life skills in order to reach their full potential and positively contribute
  to their own futures and the future of society.
