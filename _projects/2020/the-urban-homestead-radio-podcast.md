title: The Urban Homestead Radio Podcast
project_summary: >
  In three short years, with over 65,000 individual episodes downloaded, the
  response to the Urban Homestead Radio Podcast has already been tremendous. 
  All grant support and organizational assistance will go to resource a deeper,
  richer production; and a more reliable, frequent, and interactive show.


  Episodes feature garden and homesteading deep dives, interviews with
  luminaries of sustainability, and our seasonal garden and urban homesteading
  updates with tips and tricks our listeners can use to improve their
  sustainability and health.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - San Gabriel Valley
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  The Urban Homestead receives letters and emails from around the world
  detailing the struggles and insights toward a truly sustainable human presence
  on the earth in the 21st Century.  


  Changing individual habits and bringing these systems and workflows into
  people's lives can be a daunting task even for the truly committed.  This is
  especially true when the information is so spread out, and true expertise and
  authority are hard to come by.  People want to know where to start. 
  Everything from how to develop residential resource conservation, to what to
  grow and how to grow it, soil and seeds, as well as farm animal health, and
  garden monetization.


  People have to consume to survive, so how to be conscious about it becomes
  paramount.  Conservation is something everyone can engage in.   We live in a
  disposable society that is realizing we must each reduce our individual impact
  while lowering the impact of society at large.  And LA is perfectly positioned
  to become a global leader.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Despite its small size, the Urban Homestead project is a fully functioning
  urban farm in every way and it supplies our families with over 7,000 pounds of
  organic produce annually.  90% of our vegetarian diet comes from the garden so
  we eat on almost $2.00 per day per person.


  We are living off the land “directly” — supplying our diet, and “indirectly” —
  we sell the excess harvest to local establishments and individuals through a
  customized CSA program.


  Having found food security in our own backyard, we were emboldened to take
  further steps. We began powering our home with alternative energies and
  fueling our car with home-brewed bio-diesel.


  Along with new technologies, we also embraced the simple living of past
  generations: we keep farm animals for egg production and manure, cultivate
  honeybees, use secondhand goods to decrease our consumption of earth’s
  nonrenewable resources, as well as continually cultivating and mastering vital
  heritage techniques and skills.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Our vision for success is a major increase in audience on our way to
  developing a robust multimedia platform and brand focused on sustainability. 
  An increase in listeners means an overall amplification of the sustainably
  aware community.  Our explicit goal for the show is to see a minimum of
  500,000 individual episode downloads by the end of 2021.  That success would
  allow our production to pursue a regionally syndicated live call in radio
  program.  


  We want to help Los Angeles become the working example of the sustainable
  transformation in mainstream American life.  We support a robust economy of
  true essentials and the rise in awareness of the impact of human presence on
  the earth.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '5'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '500000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >
  Partners see this show as a flagship audio broadcast.  Our infrastructure is
  already complete.  The first thing a grant would cover is the time and
  attention for a team of 5 needed to develop episode materials well, and
  produce and release high quality video and audio episodes more frequently and
  reliably.  The show plans to release two 30min episodes each month, along with
  shorter supplemental media. 


  We have explicit goals of 500K - 1mil downloads in 18 months.  Marked growth
  on our Youtube channel with the launch of the podcast episode video releases. 
  That impact would justify the production of a live and syndicated radio
  show.  
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  Pasadena Media is a non-profit organization that facilitates, promotes and
  produces public service television programming on behalf of Pasadena’s four
  public and community access channels.


  Late last year Pasadena Media opened Studio B, a turnkey state-of-the-art
  podcasting studio.  Exec. Producer of the Urban Homestead Radio Podcast, David
  Lawrence, is a community television producer at Pasadena Media and host of tv
  series Museum Rat on the Arroyo Channel.  David has already been trained and
  certified in the studio.


  For three years, the Dervaes’ siblings who run TUH have hosted the show while
  wearing all the production hats.  Because the information is so valuable, and
  given in such a loving simple tone from a renowned authority, the show already
  sees thousands of downloads each week.
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Access to the LA2050 community
  - Communications support
  - Strategy assistance and implementation
