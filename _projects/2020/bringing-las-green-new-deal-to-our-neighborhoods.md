title: Bringing LA's Green New Deal to Our Neighborhoods
project_summary: >-
  With COVID-19, growing awareness of the role that the environment plays in
  pandemics, and more appreciation for the role of government and the importance
  of community, we have an opportunity to leverage this moment and help LA work
  toward sustainability. We will conduct outreach throughout the neighborhood
  council (NC) system, educating people about the parallels between this crisis
  and the climate crisis, and provide NCs with the tools to identify and
  implement the changes we can and must make in order to be more resilient and
  sustainable.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South LA
  - Westside
  - South Bay
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  I have been thrown by COVID-19. Having trouble focusing. Off my game.
  Realizing that most of my messages a couple weeks ago (about renewable energy,
  EVs, stormwater capture, the urban tree canopy, air pollution, etc.) sound
  tone deaf in the face of such an immediate crisis. And yet…there are so many
  parallels. The NCSA has always focused on public health, disadvantaged
  communities, and resilience. And we have always recognized the value of both
  government and communities in problem-solving and have strengthened that
  relationship, including with our work to help NCs support and implement LA’s
  GND (the original focus of this proposal). And the more I learn about how we
  got to this crisis, the more I learn that it is the practices of human beings,
  the forces of industrialization, and the encroachment into nature that
  contribute to pandemics. I am, once again, reminded that we live in an
  ecosystem, and that when we disrupt it, we do so at our peril. We do not want
  to miss this opportunity.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Bringing NCs, communities, nonprofits, and other government together to
  advance sustainability and resilience is what we do. Although the City has not
  permitted NCs to convene during this period, they are stepping up to serve
  their communities. As an alliance of 57 NCs from across the city, the NCSA is
  well positioned to leverage our network to conduct community outreach and help
  educate people about the interdependence and vulnerability of our ecosystems
  and the added risks that disadvantaged communities face in this crisis. As an
  organization that helps connect government to people, we have been cultivating
  a sense of working together, with government, toward one goal (LA’s GND), and
  helping people feel that they are a part of the solution and contributing to
  something bigger than themselves. As we are all in the COVID-19 crisis
  together, we are also all in the climate crisis together.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: "•\tThe NCSA will partner with the City and/or SCAQMD to encourage sustained telecommuting to keep our air cleaner (in the form of either messaging, incentives, legislation, etc.)\n*\t10 NCs will support the telecommuting effort (via, e.g., community impact statements)\n*\tThe City will open up select streets to pedestrians and cyclists during the shelter-in-place order\n*\tNCs, the Mayor’s Office of Resilience, and the Department of Neighborhood Empowerment (DONE) will share a clear understanding of the role of NCs in a crisis\n*\t5 NCs will support home or community gardening (with either outreach/education, funds for community gardens, events, etc.)\n*\t10 NCs will communicate to their constituents about the connection between the coronavirus and our ecosystem, and parallels to the climate crisis\n*\tThe NCSA will partner with the Office of Climate Emergency Mobilization on messaging about the coronavirus\n*\tThe NCSA will disseminate monthly messaging about the elevated risks to communities with poor air quality associated with some viruses\n*\tContent that will help people make the connections between the coronavirus and the climate crisis will be integrated into LA’s GND NC Toolkit (currently in development by the Mayor’s Office of Sustainability and DONE, with the assistance of the NCSA network)\n*\t5 NCs will join the NCSA\n*\t5 NCs will establish sustainability committees\nThe above will be determined through communication with NCs and our City partners, typically verified via the internet. \n\n"
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '300'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '4000000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  We work directly with about 300 people in the NC system across the city; a
  much larger number of people engage with us more passively or less frequently
  (through events, our email newsletter, social media, neighborhood council
  presentations, and the emails sent by DONE (to approximately 20,000 people).
  The population of the city of LA is roughly 4 million residents; because we
  engaged NCs throughout the city and we focus on City policy, we think that is
  the appropriate number to identify. The City of LA is in many respects a
  leader in the fight to address the climate crisis, so we hope our impact is
  broader.
