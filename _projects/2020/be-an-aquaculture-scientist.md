title: Be an Aquaculture Scientist
project_summary: >-
  The underrepresentation of minority students in ocean-related STEM fields is a
  disadvantage for the US and its growing STEM workforce needs. AltaSea and
  Sharefest have joined to facilitate job creation building opportunities and
  encouragement for Sharefest youth to lead positive change.  Where the Port
  once provided a large supply of well-paying jobs, economic forces have
  rendered the surrounding community impoverished. This partnership aims to
  provide workforce development in sustainable aquafarming within the Port of
  Los Angeles.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CREATE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
  - South Bay
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >
  Responsible aquaculture stands out as a solution to help meet many of today’s
  worldwide food security needs and, at the same time, alleviate the current
  stress on our oceans and resources caused by climate change, species and
  habitat destruction. Mollusk and kelp aquafarms will be created within the
  urban Port of Los Angeles (POLA) as we seek to make hands-on aquaculture job
  training available by addressing food security and providing a path of upward
  mobility for impoverished youth – largely Latinx.


  Our targeted students are those attending LAUSD middle schools where Sharefest
  works closely with youth to help them realize social equity and inclusion
  through education opportunities leading to career options and financial
  security. With a clear understanding of the necessity and value of exposing
  minority to STEM education opportunities, this multi-faceted project will
  build on proven education programming that reaches minority students. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >
  AltaSea utilizes its cross-sector of scientific and educational partnerships
  to train a workforce for sustainable careers. We rely on scientific experts to
  generate the most relevant data in such growing fields as aquaculture and
  robotics. Our credentialed educators introduce STEM concepts associated with
  the aquafarming of animals and plants and hands-on training spent at the
  farm.  


  Sharefest serves youth who are impoverished; affected by gang violence; and,
  may have one or more incarcerated parents or may have justice system
  involvement themselves. These students need guidance and shown a productive
  path. There is evidence that aquaculture can help learners of all
  socioeconomic backgrounds understand difficult concepts in STEM. A survey of
  60 students participating in an aquaculture program found they appreciated
  gaining practical skills through aquaculture learning and found STEM easier to
  understand upon program completion. (Wingenbach et al., 1999). 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  Both organizations have measures to defining success. In the short term,
  AltaSea collects surveys at the beginning and at the end of the program
  gathering material effectiveness presented and identifying areas of
  improvement. Through Sharefest’s youth tracking system, students’ overall
  progress is continuously followed monitoring credits earned, school absences,
  GPA, and college matriculation. Elaborate assessment tools to include the
  Measuring Mobility Toolkit is administered at the beginning and at the end of
  each year. 


  Long term accomplishments include the following:  youth discover abilities
  they did not know they possess and realize they are capable of achieving
  anything in life through hard work and determination; under-served students
  realize what they are learning in the classroom has ‘real world’ significance
  and opportunities for a ‘better life’ abound on shore and at sea; and,
  students make an emotional connection to learning through exploring the ocean
  and develop a love for the ocean and for life-long learning. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '50'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '8000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  AltaSea's urban setting, cross-sector partnerships, physical assets and
  self-sustaining business model position us to demonstrate and maximize the
  game-changing impact of ocean science on education, business, and economic
  development. Responsible aquaculture stands out as a solution to help meet
  needs on many levels, such as, national food security and workforce
  development. There is currently a limited amount of STEM learning environments
  and resources focused on aquaculture though the US is the second largest
  importer of seafood products and grows only 5% of the seafood we consume. The
  aquaculture demonstration site will support a Blue Economy workforce pathway
  creating local jobs necessary to farming bivalves and kelp. 
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >
  The youth that Sharefest serves are students who face high barriers including
  personal and systemic negative self-image. Sharefest’s role will be best
  served as the liaison between AltaSea and the students. This will include
  co-teaching the workshops, maintaining a rapport with each student identifying
  individual needs and motivating each to see themselves as scientists. 


  Our Underwater Robotics instructor is a retired science and engineering
  California credentialed high school teacher who also leads a local underwater
  robotic competitive team. He has previously taught the course and he wrote the
  NGSS approved curriculum. Cabrillo Marine Aquarium educators wrote our NGSS
  approved aquaculture curriculum, teaches our aquaculture workshops and serve
  as mentors in the aquatic nursery lab.
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Access to the LA2050 community
  - Communications support
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.: Sharefest Inc.
Which metrics will your submission impact?:
  - Employment in the tech industries
  - Income inequality
  - Global cultural and economic influence (“soft power”)
Are there any other LA2050 goal categories that your proposal will impact?:
  - LA is the best place to LEARN
Has your proposal changed due to COVID-19?: ''
