title: L.A. Works Take Action Initiative
project_summary: >-
  L.A. Works Take Action Initiative empowers volunteers to tackle major issues
  facing L.A.: Homelessness, Climate Change, and Equity in Education. At monthly
  bootcamps, volunteers first hear from our nonprofit collaborators who provide
  background and framing of the issues; get trained by an L.A. Works project
  leader in grassroots advocacy tactics; then conduct a hands-on action like
  making phone bank calls, presenting a two-minute support or opposition speech,
  or going live with a social media campaign.

What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  While the 25,000 volunteers who participate in L.A. Works' programs annually
  are diverse in age, experience, skills, and background, they share a
  dedication to serving the greater good. More than 25% of our volunteers have
  participated in our programming across multiple years. After each project, the
  most engaged volunteers often express a desire to do something to prevent the
  inequities and challenges that make such volunteer work necessary. With Take
  Action, we ask: What if active, compassionate volunteers were empowered with
  the specific information and tools needed to advocate for lasting changes in
  policy on these issues? Guided by experts in the field, volunteers are
  becoming our strongest advocates to drive solution-oriented approaches. In
  light of COVID19, L.A. Works has pivoted its bootcamps to a virtual format. We
  have found that these virtual volunteer opportunities are an excellent way to
  engage homebound volunteers, with enrollment in our April 5th bootcamp
  quadrupling.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  With nearly 30 years of experience in volunteer mobilization, recruitment, and
  management, L.A. Works knows how to engage volunteers to make an impact. With
  a database of 50,000 active Angelenos, we work with every demographic in every
  geographic area of the city. Over the years, we have developed and fine-tuned
  a sustainable volunteer program model called Signature Projects, which are
  monthly volunteer sessions led by volunteers who are specially trained by L.A.
  Works to serve as Project Leaders. These Project Leaders, who commit to at
  least six months of leadership to an ongoing volunteer experience, learn how
  to manage all aspects of their volunteer project. These leaders ensure that
  the episodic volunteers who participate at their monthly or bi-weekly projects
  have a positive experience and the work being completed provides value to the
  nonprofit organization served. This is a proven model and is the framework for
  the Take Action bootcamps, whether held online or in person.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  We plan to launch Take Action Initiatives in three different areas – Climate
  Change, Homelessness and Equity in Education – each cohort to run monthly for
  six sessions from July to December 2020, then again from January to June 2021,
  for a total of 36 bootcamps. Each bootcamp session will train at least 30
  volunteers, with a different topic, speaker, and action. Volunteers who attend
  all six sessions in one topic will get a special certificate as a Super
  Advocate to be recognized in social media. Over the course of the year, we
  will be able to mobilize at least 1,080 volunteer advocates who will be
  educated and empowered to continue to take action to address root causes of
  their issue. These bootcamps will happen virtually if in-person is not an
  option.


  The main measure of success will be in the organization and engagement of 36
  bootcamps over one year with at least 6 volunteer leaders who will train at
  least 1,080 volunteer advocates. Our second measure of success will be the
  actions taken by our trained volunteer advocates after their bootcamps. Each
  participant in a bootcamp will be given an invitation to a Slack channel
  dedicated to their topic, moderated by an L.A. Works staff member. Each Slack
  channel will be a way for volunteers to build a community around their topic
  as they share advice, setbacks and successes. It will also allow L.A. Works to
  follow participants work as they work to change broader institutional systems
  to help address their issue.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '1080'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '10800'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Our goal with Take Action is to empower everyday Angelenos with the knowledge
  and expertise to be able to affect major issues on the grassroots level. Each
  volunteer will leave with the potential to affect city policy by sharing,
  educating, and informing a circle of at least ten individuals close to them,
  changing hearts and minds in order to mobilize and enact change. With hundreds
  of volunteers trained, that potential grows exponentially. Together, they
  could affect millions of lives in the aggregate: those who find homes off of
  the streets; those who will be able to breathe clean air; and those who will
  have access to a better education.
