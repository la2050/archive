title: The LA 101 Guide to Local Government and Civic Engagement
project_summary: >-
  LA 101 is an interactive guide and campaign to help you understand how local
  government really works, and how you can make a difference with your friends
  and neighbors. It will cover major local elected and appointed officials and
  what they do, city and county departments and how they impact your life, the
  fundamentals of advocacy and organizing, and more. Our goal is for every
  Angeleno to have the knowledge, tools, and confidence they need to become
  active in their communities and advocate for an LA that is fair and
  flourishing for everyone.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  LA County is home to the largest, most powerful local government in the U.S.
  by far. We have more people than 42 states and a larger budget than over 180
  nations. The County and City of LA have immense influence over nearly every
  aspect of our daily lives, and yet few Angelenos know the name of their local
  representatives, much less what they do. That leaves influence over local
  government to a small minority of insiders and special interest groups. That’s
  the bad news.


  The good news is that there has been a groundswell of interest in politics and
  activism since 2016, and LA is on the cusp of a once-in-a-generation
  opportunity to transform from one of America’s least civically engaged metro
  areas to one of the most. Tens of thousands of Angelenos are invested in
  national politics for the first time, but remain overwhelmed by the prospect
  of getting involved locally. The LA 101 guide will help convert that energy
  into powerful local organizing to transform our city.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  LA’s electeds and policies should reflect the people they serve, and LA 101
  can help make that happen. The project is led by experienced local advocates
  with a track record of reaching, teaching, and mobilizing Angelenos at the
  grassroots and grasstops levels.


  Since 2016, LA Forward has published impactful guides on local issues and
  elections that have reached well over 100,000 people. We’ve hosted dozens of
  civic education events and in-person LA 101 workshops. And in March 2020, we
  helped form and lead the Healthy LA Coalition of over 250+ local groups
  responding to the COVID-19 crisis and advocating for pressing policies needed
  to protect Angelenos.


  As a partner, Inclusive Action for the City (formerly LURN) brings people
  together to build strong, local economies through advocacy and transformative
  economic development initiatives. They have been a leading voice for economic
  justice since 2008, and a leader in the successful citywide effort to legalize
  and protect street vending.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  The goal of LA 101 is to support the people of LA in taking control of the
  systems and policies that shape their lives. In the short term, that means
  providing resources that lower barriers to entry for those who want to take
  their first steps into local activism and civic engagement. 


  In the medium to long term, our vision is for LA to transform from one of the
  nation’s least civically engaged places to one of its most. That means higher
  voter turnout and participation in local elections, and high levels of
  participation in the workings of City Council and county government, in
  community groups and neighborhood councils, mutual aid networks, and more. 


  We will measure how many people see and meaningfully engage with the guide, as
  well as those who attend workshops and events. It’s vital to us that those
  engaging with LA 101 mirror LA’s incredible diversity, and we will work with
  our partners to make sure the guide is reaching and resonating with
  communities across LA — especially those that are unable to vote in elections
  and participate through other avenues.


  The ultimate definition of success is the extent to which the LA 101 guide can
  increase civic engagement: how many people are commenting on pending policies,
  calling elected officials or meeting with their staffs, volunteering with
  advocacy groups, and voting and getting their friends to vote. We will survey
  workshop and online participants about their behavior to see how it changes
  based on their contact with LA 101.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '50000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '500000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  We expect the LA 101 campaign to have a lasting impact on local policies,
  civic engagement, and the future of the region. By illuminating the workings
  of the city and county, the LA 101 guide and workshops will pave the way for
  greater public involvement. When Angelenos learn effective ways to voice their
  views, they gain the confidence and know-how to do the crucial civic work of
  calling elected officials, showing up to council hearings, meeting with
  government staffers, joining neighborhood councils, and participating in local
  elections. Ultimately, the result we are working toward is a local government
  that is dramatically more representative of — and responsive to — the people
  it serves.
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >
  LA 101 is a true partnership between LA Forward and Inclusive Action. The
  concept was developed collaboratively, and our plan calls for a near-even
  split in creating content, recruiting partners, organizing events, and
  spreading the word.


  While certain core tasks will be shared by both organizations, we will focus
  on areas where we bring unique expertise. For example, Inclusive Action will
  draw on its experience working alongside low-income communities of color to
  ensure that the LA 101 guide reaches — and is informed by and speaks to —
  communities who have historically been shut out of local politics. LA Forward
  will apply its experience creating and distributing beautifully-designed voter
  guides and other educational materials that have reached hundreds of thousands
  of Angelenos.
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Access to the LA2050 community
  - Host public events or gatherings
  - Communications support
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.: Inclusive Action for the City
Which metrics will your submission impact?:
  - Government responsiveness to residents’ needs
  - Neighborhood council participation
  - Voting rates
Are there any other LA2050 goal categories that your proposal will impact?:
  - LA is the best place to LEARN
  - LA is the healthiest place to LIVE
Has your proposal changed due to COVID-19?: >
  The pandemic has highlighted the fragility of our social safety net and the
  critical role that local government can play in protecting the health and
  well-being of our communities. It’s never been more important to provide
  regular Angelenos with resources and tools to advocate for policies that
  ensure a just and equitable recovery.


  As two leading members in the Healthy LA coalition — a network of more than
  320 local organizations uniting to propose concrete solutions to the many
  hardships caused by the pandemic — we’ve been on the frontlines pushing for
  policies to protect vulnerable Angelenos. We’ve learned so much about
  effective organizing and advocacy over the last three months, and we’re
  committed to sharing it as widely as possible through LA 101. 


  Our initial proposal relied largely on digital materials and distribution, so
  we don’t anticipate major changes. One exception is converting the community
  workshops we were planning for 2021 into Zoom meetings. Even if in-person
  meetings are permitted, we’re increasing our plans for digital events after
  seeing how they broaden the range of people who can participate and allow for
  easy recording and distribution. 


  We’re also planning to include additional training on how to organize in a
  socially distanced world. And we’re exploring ways to speed up the public
  launch of the LA 101 guide to help equip LA’s diverse communities to
  participate in the crucial deliberations around how our region navigates and
  emerges from this crisis.
