title: Food Recovery Program
project_summary: >-
  Global Green would like support for the expansion of its Food Recovery Program
  in Los Angeles. In 2019, Global Green, in partnership with City of Santa
  Monica, Postmates and TetraTech, piloted a food rescue system to eradicate
  food insecurity and combat climate displacement, water usage, and greenhouse
  gas emissions in Los Angeles. Global Green would like to finalize this pilot
  program and expand this comprehensive food rescue system that provides a
  sustainable solution to both hunger and environmental challenges.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  According to the California Food Policy Advocates, "Across California, 4.7
  million adults and 2 million children live in low-income households affected
  by food insecurity. Food insecurity means having limited, uncertain, or
  inconsistent access to the quality and quantity of food that is necessary to
  live a healthy life. Having sustained access to enough food is tied to
  positive social, physical, and mental health outcomes." Los Angeles is one of
  the largest concentrations of food-insecure populations - over 2 million
  Angelenos face food insecurity, translating to 1 out of 5 individuals in the
  county. The high costs of housing and transportation, coupled with a 20%
  poverty rate, have contributed to these hunger statistics. The implications
  are far-reaching: an increase in disease, adverse health, and growing medical
  costs. Our project provides a sustainable solution to hunger by tackling
  systemic inefficiencies in food waste through food donation, diversion, and
  conversion. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  This project is important to the work of Global Green because it aligns with
  our mission, which includes creating green cities and businesses and improving
  livability. Global Green has been working in Los Angeles since we launched in
  1994. It is a place where we love to work, and a place where we are known,
  trusted and connected. In addition to our long-term involvement, Global Green
  is uniquely suited to take on this food recovery program because through our
  pilot program, we are testing solutions to each of the barriers to urban food
  waste rescue so that the program can be scaled throughout the City of Los
  Angeles this next year and ultimately, replicated by many other communities.  
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  - Develop a semi-automated analytical framework that tracks interactions
  between restaurants and non-profits, demographic information, and greenhouse
  gas reductions.

  - Divert 1,000,000 lbs. of food from partner restaurants to local food banks,
  equaling 90,000 meals (feedingamerica.org). This is measured by the food banks
  with the food scales they are provided. 

  - At least 20% recovery of total food waste per establishment to feed 5,000
  people in Year 1, and double reach through the LA2050 community. This is
  measured by the food waste audits that are conducted by TetraTech and Global
  Green. 

  - Recruit a total of 50 Los Angeles based restaurants for the Food Recovery
  Program. Outreach and education of compliance requirements to at least 300
  restaurants in Year 1

  - Reduce 233,000 tons of Greenhouse Gas Equivalents by diverting food from
  landfill. This is measured by our formula that converts food weight to
  greenhouse gas tons. 

  - Add 5 food banks in Year 1. Current food bank partner is Upward Bound House,
  and we are in communication with Safe Place for Youth, St. Joseph Center Food
  Pantry, and Westside Food Bank

  - Prototype and test new revenue models consisting of a surcharge revenue
  model to fund maintenance and scale of the food waste rescue system to create
  ongoing program sustainability
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '5000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '4000000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Global Green's Food Recovery Program circularizes the urban food system and
  generates value from food waste to meet the needs of our underserved
  communities and populations. At least 5000 people will be fed by the food
  donated from the restaurants to the food banks, which will indirectly impact
  the population of Los Angeles due to the greenhouse gases (GHG) reduced by
  diverting food from the landfill. This program applies AB1826 and SB 1383,
  which require commercial establishments to divert food waste to composting and
  donation. This program contributes to the legislations' goals to reduce
  statewide GHG emissions below 2013 levels by 2030, reduce organics disposal by
  50% by 2020, and recover 20% of edible food for human consumption by 2025.
