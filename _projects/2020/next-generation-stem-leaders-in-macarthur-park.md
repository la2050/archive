title: Next Generation STEM Leaders in MacArthur Park
project_summary: >-
  Despite a thriving tech field in Los Angeles, low-income students of color
  face barriers to entering STEM career pathways due to limited learning
  opportunities. By using culturally relevant project-based learning that
  fosters critical thinking, collaboration, and resilience, we will cultivate
  the next generation of STEM leaders. Our project formalizes a STEM pipeline
  from elementary through high school to expose our students early and often to
  hands-on learning opportunities and develop core technology, math, and science
  competencies.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Hispanic and Latino communities are sorely underrepresented in high-tech
  industries, making up only 7% of the nation’s STEM workers. When Latino
  students have an interest in STEM education, they often face barriers to
  getting consistent access to these opportunities, like underresourced schools,
  a lack of role models, or learning materials that don’t reflect their lived
  experiences or language. This problem hits home for our students: 96% of our
  students are eligible for free/reduced price meals and 95% are Latino. The
  current crisis has highlighted serious issues in technology access, further
  removing STEM as an accessible pathway. Equipping students with foundational
  21st Century skills and core STEM competencies is critical for college and
  career success. By creating a K – 12 pipeline for students, we introduce
  technology and core STEM concepts early and often, while problem-based
  learning fuses community applications and a cultural lens to build the next
  generation of STEM leaders.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  We are uniquely suited for this work because of our experience with the
  population and the programming. We serve low-income students of color who
  can’t always access STEM opportunities or find role models from their
  communities. Our Director of STEM has over 10 years of teaching experience,
  plus an emphasis on project-based learning, and initiated a pilot of this
  project at three of our schools last year.


  Last year, we focused on increasing math and science proficiency, raising
  proficiency by 10% across our network. We focus on STEM programming that
  highlights practical applications and invites interdisciplinary connections by
  teaching coding in Spanish, using project-based learning to provide tech
  solutions to real community problems, or linking discussions of identity and
  community to STEM lessons. By strengthening students’ autonomy, interest, and
  capacity to continue in science and math fields, our project strengthens
  engagement and breaks down barriers to STEM success.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Our goal for this project is to increase students’ STEM proficiency and school
  engagement through expanded hands-on learning opportunities. When taken
  together, these also increase graduation and college matriculation rates by
  helping students learn to lead their own learning and opening up new
  postsecondary pathways.
   
  We will grow Project Lead The Way (PLTW) from 3 schools to 5, creating a
  continuous and aligned STEM pipeline from K – 12th grade. PLTW adheres to
  California English and Math standards and national Next Generation Science
  Standards. Its interdisciplinary focus invites students to master multiple
  content areas as they work together to explore how technology can provide an
  innovative solution for a real problem affecting their community. Our
  implementation of PLTW infuses technology into the classroom and helps student
  cultivate essential STEM and soft skills, like critical thinking,
  communication, and cooperation, that prepare them for college and beyond.


  To monitor progress toward our goal, we will track the numbers of teachers
  trained, students enrolled in PLTW courses, and PLTW courses offered. We will
  use student and staff feedback to measure satisfaction and enhance our
  program. Longer-term, we will look at gains in math and science proficiency
  for PLTW students at the end of the next school year through course grades or
  state test scores. We will also monitor high school graduation, college-ready
  graduation rates, and college matriculation rates.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '1200'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '2068'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  STEM jobs are projected to grow 70% faster than others, highlighting a need
  for the next generation to develop 21st century skills and STEM competencies.
  Given current representation, we know that increasing opportunity for our
  students to enter this sector would be a major step towards inclusivity and
  economic security for low-income Latino students across LA. Our proposal helps
  build a model for project-based learning that can be applied to schools across
  the city serving similar populations. When schools offer standards-aligned
  STEM education that spans grade levels, invites multi-subject connections, and
  creates tangible skills, we can better prepare students to enter into the STEM
  sector – creating a stronger, more diverse Los Angeles.
