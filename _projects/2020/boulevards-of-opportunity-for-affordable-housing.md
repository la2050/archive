title: Boulevards of Opportunity for Affordable Housing
project_summary: >-
  Our “Boulevards of Opportunity for Affordable Housing” project will promote
  policies enabling affordable multifamily housing in mixed-use developments
  with robust urban greening and bike/pedestrian improvements along commercial
  boulevards served by zero-emission bus rapid transit (BRT). We will reach out
  to advocates, cities, and agencies to create an implementation strategy, and
  find a city or Council of Governments willing to begin a process that would
  result in a model boulevard of opportunity, stage symposiums and publish a
  how-to manual.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - San Gabriel Valley
  - South LA
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
  - Gateway Cities
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  LA County needs thousands of affordable housing units near transit. But rather
  than displacing our neighbors and gentrifying communities, we should create
  verdant new neighborhoods on tree-lined “boulevards of opportunity” with
  moderate-density mixed-use development and housing affordable to people who
  are low and very-low income or homeless. LA is served by many boulevards that
  were once key contributors to local economies but are now marginalized, where
  properties are relatively inexpensive. Measure M set aside $2 billion to build
  bus rapid transit (BRT) along a dozen such corridors, providing an opportunity
  to revitalize them as appealing neighborhoods where transit riders can live.
  The Southern California Association of Governments once identified such
  boulevards as our most significant housing opportunity because they would
  allow us to meet our housing needs on just 2% of the region’s land. LA
  County’s affordable housing crisis compels renewed attention to this
  opportunity.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Move LA has successfully engaged civic leaders and organizations and formed
  coalitions to address countywide issues before, e.g. Measures R (‘08) and M
  (‘16) to provide $120 billion for transit, and Measure H (‘17) to provide $360
  million/year for housing and services for the homeless. Using boulevards of
  opportunity to address the affordable housing crisis marries our knowledge of
  transit and affordable housing policies and our familiarity with the tools of
  local government. Because funding will be needed to improve these boulevards,
  Move LA sponsored SB 961 (Sen. Allen), signed into law in 2018, to enable
  cities to create redevelopment-style districts along transit corridors. With
  our deep understanding of community development, our successful history
  working to build robust and durable coalitions, and our understanding of how
  to leverage public funds, we are uniquely positioned to show cities how to do
  it and create a model program for others to learn from. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  We will consider our work successful if our outreach to cities results in at
  least one city or Council of Governments (COG) expressing interest in a
  boulevard planning process that can become a model for other cities. Move LA
  Executive Director Denny Zane had this experience when he was mayor of Santa
  Monica in the 1980s and led the revitalization of the city’s derelict
  downtown, turning it into the very successful Third Street Promenade and
  earning the attention of cities across the U.S. We intend to begin work with
  cities, the COGs, the Southern California Association of Governments and LA
  Metro to identify the right boulevards, develop model land-use policies
  allowing mixed-use multifamily development in these places, and figure out how
  funding tools like SB 961, the state’s Cap & Trade program, and local and
  county funding can be leveraged to turn land along these boulevards into
  neighborhoods that are desirable, affordable, walkable, bikeable and green,
  and with easy access to high-quality BRT lines. In order to achieve success
  we’ll also engage community leaders and advocates, resiliency experts,
  academics, planners, and affordable and market-rate developers. We’ll stage 2
  symposiums to engage everyone in dialogue about the policy changes and
  strategies that will be required, and we’ll write a well-designed publication
  to share that identifies successful policies, tools and strategies for
  community development along these boulevards of opportunity.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '500'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '1200000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  There is a serious need in LA County for housing that is affordable to
  very-low, low and moderate-income families, and people who are homeless.
  "Boulevards of opportunity” can be part of the solution to this need by
  enabling multifamily housing development along commercial boulevards in
  verdant, transit-oriented neighborhoods where none now exist.  Ensuring
  affordable housing is included on commercial boulevards redesigned so we can
  travel on foot, bike or use transit will enable low-income people and other
  residents —and everyone who visits—to get to jobs, parks, to see the doctor,
  or visit family or friends without driving.  This will reduce air pollution
  and GHG emissions and help make our cities safer, more equitable and
  sustainable.
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  MLA is partnering with a company called UrbanFootprint, to provide graphic GIS
  mapping and evaluative services that can help determine the potential for
  housing and transit ridership using various development scenarios along
  boulevards of opportunity. UrbanFootprint was founded by two acclaimed
  industry professionals, Peter Calthorpe and Joe DiStefano to help cities and
  businesses tackle the biggest planning, mobility, and market challenges of the
  21st century. The State of California has partnered with UrbanFootprint to
  provide the software to more than 500 cities, counties, and regional agencies.

  We will use this software to facilitate community development assessments at
  our symposiums and reports to focus attention on two boulevards.
