title: Heal the Bay's River Report Card
project_summary: >-
  Heal the Bay’s River Report Card (RRC) protects the health of Angelenos who
  enjoy freshwater swimming and recreation areas by providing water quality
  information during the hot summer months. Funds will support the training of
  community college students in bacterial water quality monitoring, the
  development of state-of-the-art public notification tools, and a targeted
  outreach campaign for communities living near these sites. The RRC will also
  be used to identify water quality problems in the region and advocate for
  improvements.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >
  Heal the Bay’s River Report Card identifies health hazards caused by water
  pollution and provides job training in STEM fields for underserved college
  students. It also provides the public a much-needed service of water quality
  monitoring and notification at freshwater sites, which is not legally
  mandated. Before Heal the Bay started this program, there was very little
  monitoring by other agencies and the data collected was not designed to be
  protective of public health.


  The RRC should be easy-to-understand, consistent with the Beach Report Card,
  and widely used by the public. Additional data analysis and communications
  development are needed. By training students from Los Angeles Trade Technical
  College and Los Angeles Valley College, Heal the Bay is expanding data
  collection and monitoring while providing valuable real-world job skills.
  Improving the grading methodology and online presentation will help us
  advocate for infrastructure improvements and better public health protections
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >
  Since 1985, Heal the Bay has worked diligently to protect the health of
  millions of California beachgoers through its science, advocacy, education,
  stewardship, and public notification programs, including the innovative Beach
  Report Card and year-round beach cleanups. Building on the success of its
  water quality advocacy programs, Heal the Bay made a commitment to expand its
  work “up the watershed” to include waterbodies and tributaries which run
  through Los Angeles’ diverse landscapes and communities.


  In 2015, Heal the Bay began monitoring water quality in the Los Angeles River
  and freshwater areas (e.g., swimming holes) in the Santa Monica Mountains as a
  way to better protect the health of recreational water users, swimmers and
  kayakers and advocate for stricter water quality standards. Heal the Bay
  continues to offer critical water quality information through its River Report
  Card, which is available to the public, policymakers, health officials and
  media.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  Heal the Bay will advance public notification and awareness of water quality
  conditions in freshwater recreation and swimming areas throughout Los Angeles
  County by engaging and educating local community college students, communities
  near freshwater sites, and other stakeholders. Heal the Bay’s River Report
  Card will be updated through the development of a new website and app that
  promotes consistent and easy-to-understand messaging about water quality
  conditions.


  Successful project outcomes include:


  The annual hiring, training and employment of seven college students
  collecting weekly water quality samples in Malibu Creek State Park and the Los
  Angeles River during summer months;


  Diligent processing of water quality samples to determine levels of fecal
  indicator bacteria;


  The development of a new River Report Card website and mobile app;


  Timely posting of grades on the online River Report Card; and


  The engagement of local communities and stakeholders by giving talks,
  attending community events, giving oral testimony at  hearings, and educating
  the public about water quality and the importance of clean water.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '25'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '60000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >
  Heal the Bay’s work addresses multiple challenges impacting the region: water
  pollution, public health hazards caused by a lack of notification, and a
  shortage of opportunities for underrepresented groups seeking jobs in STEM
  fields. 


  Identifying water quality problems, including the sources of those problems,
  puts Heal the Bay in a unique position to alert the public and hold polluters
  accountable. Utilizing Heal the Bay data is an effective way to advance
  policy, promote environmental change, and protect human health. 


  Long-term partnerships with Los Angeles Trade Tech College and Los Angeles
  Valley College will result in robust monitoring and create a pipeline for
  those seeking job opportunities and training in the sciences.
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  Los Angeles Trade Technical College and Los Angeles Valley College will serve
  as project partners and subcontractors.  Students from partner schools will be
  hired and trained to carry out some of the objectives of this work (e.g.,
  monitoring and analysis).  Each student will receive payment for their work. 
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Access to the LA2050 community
  - Host public events or gatherings
  - Communications support
  - 'Capacity, including staff'
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.: >-
  Heal the Bay will continue to partner with Los Angeles Trade Tech College
  (LATTC) to meet the objectives of its River Report Card project.  LATTC is a
  public community college in Los Angeles, California. It offers academic
  courses towards 4-year colleges and vocational training programs. 
Which metrics will your submission impact?:
  - Water pollution
  - Local water
  - Resilient communities
Are there any other LA2050 goal categories that your proposal will impact?:
  - LA is the best place to PLAY
Has your proposal changed due to COVID-19?: ''
