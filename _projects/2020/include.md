project_summary: >-
  human-I-T provides low-income individuals & nonprofits with technology,
  internet, and digital literacy training. We collect used electronics from
  companies to refurbish and more people are provided with computers/laptops and
  the skills needed to use the technology effectively. We will provide Angelenos
  with the means to learn how to use the internet through digital literacy
  courses, provide them with a laptop and support in getting low-cost internet.

In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Despite California being the birthplace of the internet, substantial
  disparities persist in who does and does not have access to technology in the
  Golden State. This “digital divide” disproportionately affects low-income
  individuals and people of color. In Los Angeles County, 24% of the population
  does not have a computer with internet access at home. This means
  approximately 2.5 million people are cut off from tools for self-sufficiency.
  More recently, in light of the global pandemic, there is also a growing
  increase in remote learning. Still, 1 in 4 students do not have the proper
  access to the internet or home device to participate. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  human-I-T’s Include program is designed to help adult learners harness all of
  the opportunity that lives online. It is a self-paced, student-centered
  digital literacy class offered in English and Spanish. Because learners enter
  digital literacy training with different needs, goals, and motivations, the
  course allows each individual to choose which lessons to study, and how much
  time to devote to each topic. human-I-T works with community partners to
  create satellite sites (either live sites or remote hubs) where digital
  literacy classes can take place in a computer lab setting, or individuals can
  complete the course from the comfort of their own home. 


  human-I-T is the only nonprofit in Southern California that collects
  electronic waste from companies, refurbishes it, and redistributes it to low
  income households and community centers. Other organizations that take in
  e-waste either 1) break the devices down for commodities or 2) re purpose the
  device for resale on the market.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  e track several outputs to gauge the effectiveness of our programs, including
  the number of computers donated, households connected to the internet,
  individuals who have completed our digital literacy training program, and the
  pounds of e-waste diverted from landfills. We define success as educating
  1,400 individuals through our digital literacy program with the support of our
  satellite partners. Another measure in 2020 will be connecting 15,000
  households to free or low-cost internet. 


  Beyond the numbers, we use qualitative data to gauge the programs’ success
  through post-donation surveys to measure how each connection makes an impact
  on users’ lives. We collect data about how many households use the device to
  apply to college, find affordable housing, secure new jobs, establish
  permanent residency, increase their social network, and access social
  services. Success is achieved when over 95% of recipients use their connection
  in a way to deepen their presence in their community, whether through
  education, civic engagement, housing, or participation in grassroots
  organizing. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '1000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '4000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Through the #include program there are various ways that our city will change,
  but one of the most important ways will be at home. One in four students do
  not have the necessary hardware or internet to connect only, that means 1 in 4
  families does not have everything they need to connect online. Through
  #include, parents and older family members will learn the basics of using a
  computer and be able to access online resources they never had before. At the
  same time, children will be able to connect online without the need of going
  long distance or staying long hours in the library to do so. Families around
  LA County would be taking the future into their own hands and becoming
  self-sufficient.
