Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - San Gabriel Valley
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South LA
  - Westside
  - South Bay
  - Antelope Valley
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
  - Gateway Cities
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  LA's students are experts in the realities their neighborhoods and families
  face. They have ideas for civic improvement and the future. LASA responds to
  the need to provide foundational understandings of how the county works now
  and the need to have a county-wide discussion about the differences in lived
  experiences. LASA addresses both: by providing access to experts on LA's
  infrastructure from water to health and housing to politics and justice and by
  providing a space where high school juniors from across the county who would
  not otherwise meet each other discuss a collective future.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  This project is the central mission of LASA. LASA is uniquely suited to take
  this on because LASA has been doing this work since 2012. We build and evolve.
  The groups of high school juniors change year to year and graduate into a
  growing group of LASA alums. Yearly, we add new schools and cover new
  neighborhoods. We have a community of experts who work with us to guide the
  students. The issues we address and the experts we invite are constantly
  evaluated to be responsive to the moment while still addressing longer range
  infrastructural concerns. LASA is suited to build on this foundation and
  expand its impact.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  LASA's successes are measured in both short and longer term gains. Yearly
  successes are measured via student feedback. We look for reports on
  realizations and discoveries based on LASA participation, increased engagement
  in the areas they individually are most drawn to, and reflections on both the
  state of their neighborhoods and possibilities for the future. Longer term
  gains are measured in alumni feedback on choices for majors based on LASA
  experiences and career developments. Our vision for success is to see LASA
  graduates use the information they gained and the connections they forged to
  create a more equal, environmentally sustainable, and just LA.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '40'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '1300'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >
  The broader impact of LASA is inseparable from the specific aspects of the
  future our students choose to address. They have become environmental
  engineers and architects. They have decided to study environmental studies and
  engineering based on their experiences in LASA. With each class, we hear of
  those drawn to law enforcement, public health, and history. Our impact numbers
  described above are conservative. We have estimated each student impacts three
  others and our teacher partners impact their classrooms. The realities, we
  believe, are exponentially larger. While our mission is to serve LASA
  students, we also see their impact on the experts and institutions they visit
  based on their questions and concerns. 
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  USC, the Huntington Library, and LAPL are essential institutional partners.
  They act as home bases, as well as archival and personnel sources.


  Through our ties to USC, we draw academic and other partners into LASA's
  programs; we also bring collegiate and admissions counselors into direct
  dialogue with our students.


  The Los Angeles Public Library (LAPL) is our downtown home base, and students
  are made aware of that institution's young adult and tutoring programs - as
  well as their critical work in serving those experiencing homelessness.


  The Huntington is LASA's primary base of operations; we introduce students to
  that institution's mission, curatorial personnel and collections, and
  Huntington education/outreach programs are brought to LASA attention
  throughout any given year's work.
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - 'Office space for meetings, events, or for staff'
  - Strategy assistance and implementation
  - Access to the LA2050 community for topic-specific experts
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.:
  - University of Southern California
  - 'The Huntington Library, Art Museum, and Botanical Gardens'
  - Los Angeles Public Library
Which metrics will your submission impact?:
  - College matriculation
  - High school graduation rates
Are there any other LA2050 goal categories that your proposal will impact?:
  - LA is the best place to CREATE
  - LA is the best place to PLAY
  - LA is the best place to CONNECT
