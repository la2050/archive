Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CREATE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >
  There are approximately 650,000 Central Americans living in Los Angeles
  County. A first wave arrived here as refugees from a result of the civil wars
  in the 1980s.  Many of those initial refugees were given temporary protected
  status but the Trump Administration has threatened to deport those in TPS
  starting next year.  Further waves of immigrants came after natural disasters
  and more recently fleeing gang violence. Most arrive with little formal
  education and remain among the poorest ethnic groups in LA County.


  The Central America culture has traditionally supported entrepreneurism,
  although due to the hurdles to establishing businesses and accessing credit in
  the region, most are solopreneurs.


  Like many immigrants and their children born here, the best path up the
  economic ladder is to start your own business. The LACABI creates upward
  mobility for the Central American immigrants and their children by enabling
  them to create and expand their own international businesses.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >
  First, we have the know-how and capacity 


  Civic 180, through its International Business Accelerator program, has already
  worked with almost 40 LA companies to expand into global markets. We have
  recently created a bilingual online training course which will enable us to
  reach entrepreneurs at their homes on their schedules. 


  Second, we know Central America.


  The IBA already has established connections through its ScaleUp LA-LatAm
  initiative with business incubators and accelerators throughout Central
  America. The IBA staff working have fluent Spanish and the Civic180
  founder/CEO ran business programs at the US Embassy in El Salvador.


  Third, we know Los Angeles County.


  We have run in-person cohorts at Long Beach City College, LAX Coastal Chamber
  and USC Business School. We will be working closely with Loyola Marymount
  Business School with its Personal Initiative training program. Most
  importantly, a majority of our participants are women and minority founders.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: "Vision for success:\n\nWe are confident LACABI will be the catalyst to create a thriving small-business cluster for Central American community. The participants in this program, with their intimate knowledge of products available and tastes in both Los Angeles and Central America are in the best position to find these opportunities – from tech products to traditional ethnic food specialties.\n\nOur metrics for success will be:\n*\tNumber of participating companies (goal: 40)\n*\tNew sales created: $2 million\n*\tJobs created by participating companies (goal: 100 direct and estimated 250 indirect)\n"
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '100'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '250'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  The LACABI will provide needed job creation, as LA recovers from the COVID
  crash. The connections exist between those of Central American heritage in Los
  Angeles and families in the region. This project creates jobs by linking the
  two groups through trade. The typical multiplier used for job creation is 2.5
  for each new enterprise (We are assuming $50,000 in additional sales on
  average per company. Also, for service companies, the multiplier is that for
  every direct job created, it will generate 2.5 indirect jobs. This project
  will create a group of successful entrepreneurs who can branch out into other
  business opportunities and inspire others in the Central American community.  
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >
