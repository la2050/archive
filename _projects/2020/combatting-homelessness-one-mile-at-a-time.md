title: Combatting Homelessness One Mile at a Time
project_summary: >-
  We will increase our impact on the population experiencing homelessness in Los
  Angeles County in moving them toward self-sufficiency, by reconnecting them
  with their community and guiding them in obtaining sustainable employment. We
  provide workforce development opportunities that deepen existing abilities and
  provide new skills to our members, which increases their chances for
  employment and helps each reach his/her/their full potential. Our current
  success can easily be built upon with additional resources and funding.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >
  Homelessness has escalated into a full-blown crisis in Los Angeles County.
  According to the LA Homeless Services Authority, at least 60,000 people are
  currently homeless, three quarters of whom live on the streets. 


  We recruit members at partner facilities such as Union Rescue Mission on Skid
  Row, and The Salvation Army ARC facility in Santa Monica. Members commit to
  run three mornings a week at 5:30am, with our volunteer runners, as a team.
  After 30 days, members with 90% attendance earn the opportunity to move into
  our Next Steps Program, which provides workforce development in the form of
  financial literacy training, resume writing classes, interview skills
  workshops, and regular one on one case management support at office hours.
  Finally, we provide access to employment partnerships and housing resources.
  Our members gain independence in an environment that promotes accountability,
  compassion, and hope. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >
  Back on My Feet revolutionizes the way society approaches homelessness. Our
  unique running-based program demonstrates that if you first restore
  confidence, strength, and self-esteem, individuals are better equipped to
  tackle the road ahead and move toward jobs, homes and new lives. Running
  raises endorphins, teaches discipline, and offers accomplishments in the midst
  of bleak circumstances. 


  Members run alongside dedicated volunteers with diverse backgrounds.
  Regardless of age, race, or history, our team members bond and build a
  profound sense of community. Our consistent runs are transformative
  experiences for members, particularly those assimilating back into society
  after experiencing incarceration or street homelessness. 


  Since launching in LA in 2013, we have served more than 700 members, who have
  run a collective of 55,000 miles, and obtained more than 202 jobs and 167
  homes. Within six months of becoming Back on My Feet Alumni, 83% of members
  maintain their employment. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: "Long Term: \n\nSuccess is having Los Angeles shed the title of homeless capital of the country, and change stereotypes surrounding homelessness.\n\nShort Term:  \n\nExpand our programming to two new partner facilities. Our success will be measured by how many individuals cross the finish line in obtaining sustainable employment.\n\nWe take a holistic approach to getting our members back on their feet. This includes providing financial aid grants to members for expenses that have historically been barriers to securing employment or housing such as transportation to new jobs, security deposits, tuition, and work clothes. Additionally we can purchase a key ingredient for our program - running gear and race entries for our members. \n\nOther ways we track success:\n\n*\tNumber of new member sign ups\n*\tNumber of members in attendance per run\n*\tNumber of volunteers in attendance per run\n*\tTotal miles run per member and as a facility team\n*\tTracking pace of a mile run (This is key because it demonstrates to members the tangible results of their hard work.)\n*\tNumber of members in Next Steps programming\n*\tNumber of alumni members\n*\tMembers transitioned who secured work\n*\tMembers graduated from the program\n"
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '300'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: ''
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >
  Back on My Feet relies on more than 200 volunteers to create a safe community.
  We change community’s perception of homelessness by providing a hands on
  program where supporters can experience the immediate personal impact they
  make on lives of our most vulnerable community members. 


  Numbers of family members impacted by our work is immeasurable. Homelessness
  is an isolating experience, and many of our members have been secluded from
  family contacts for a multitude of reasons. Outcomes of our programming move
  our members closer to overcoming obstacles - legal, financial, and personal -
  and we witness countless members who reunite with family (including children),
  once they become financially, physically, and mentally healthy.
