title: Hollywood Food Coalition "Food Hub"
project_summary: >-
  The Hollywood Food Coalition has been addressing food insecurity for 33 years
  by providing hot, nutritious meals to the hungry and homeless every night of
  the year.  Our food recovery program now rescues more food then we can serve -
  up to 6,000 pounds a week - and we share this food with fellow social service
  agencies that need help with their own food programs.   We want to expand by
  building L.A.’s first “Food Hub”, designed to better connect excess food with
  hungry Angelenos in need.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Over 11% of the people living in Los Angeles county are food insecure.  Well
  over one million of our neighbors do not know where their next meal is coming
  from: this is the largest 'food insecure' population in the U.S.  Structural
  economic disparities push people into poverty. Wages have remained stagnant
  for decades, while the cost of housing, food, and medical care have
  skyrocketed.  The result is that the nation's western breadbasket sees many of
  its own citizens go to bed hungry.   To make matters worse, more than a third
  of the food in this country is thrown out.  This food ends up in landfills
  where it releases methane, a greenhouse gas 25 times more potent than carbon
  dioxide.   The fact that Los Angeles faces problems of both food waste and
  food insecurity is tragic, but it is a problem that can be solved: the HFC has
  created, and hopes to expand, mechanisms to address all aspects of the
  problem. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Solving the problems of food waste and food insecurity is what we have done
  since inception.  In l987 we started serving people in need sandwiches. 
  Within a few years we grew into a meal service agency that now serves over
  50,000 hot meals annually.  All our food is donated from grocery stores,
  restaurants, farmer’s markets, and TV/film productions.  We rescue up to 6,000
  pounds of food a week - in excess of our needs - and we share our surplus with
  fellow social service agencies that don’t have funds for their own meal
  programs.  We often hear from them that the food we provide helps their
  client's dig into the work of 'getting better'.  For battered women, at risk
  teens, recovering alcoholics, 'recovery' is not possible when you are hungry. 
  We possess the knowledge, the relationships, the volunteer base, and an
  understanding of the logistical challenges needed to create LA's first “Food
  Hub”: where food can be stored, repackaged, repurposed and ultimately shared
  throughout LA. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  We will measure success by how much food we collect and how much we
  distribute.  Our goal is to triple the amount of food we rescue and share to
  18,000 pounds a week by July 2021.  Securing a facility separate from our
  existing kitchen, with dramatically expanded storage space, will be a key
  first step towards the creation of our 'Food Hub.” Additionally, while we have
  over 40 available volunteers (“Pickup Artists”), as well as paid drivers, all
  poised every day to rescue food, we lack the organizational infrastructure to
  expand this program (which involves recruiting, training, and 'dispatching'
  food procurement and rescue teams, dealing with complexities of scheduling,
  etc.) .  Building our capacity requires us to professionalize our program by
  hiring our first Director of Food Procurement (who would also be tasked with
  the job of locating additional sources for food, and introducing these donors
  to our program). Finally, we lack a refrigerated truck, which dramatically
  limits our ability to travel 'far afield' to rescue and share food (for fear
  of food spoilage): adding such a vehicle to our 'fleet' would go a long way
  towards expanding the scope, scale, and thus the success, of our efforts.  Our
  vision of success is ambitious: success, for us, means that nobody goes hungry
  in the city of Los Angeles.  Success would mean replicating our 'hub' model,
  in community after community after community, until our entire city's food
  needs are met.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '5000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '10000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  We believe in building coalitions, first and foremost, and we believe food is
  a critical medium through which coalitions can be built.  We are invested in
  helping other Not For Profit organizations achieve their missions by ensuring
  that they are providing their clients with access to good food.  We see
  ourselves as integral to the re-construction of a badly tattered social safety
  net.  We believe that everyone in Los Angeles can lead a dignified, joyful
  life if they are well fed.  We believe that no food should end up in landfills
  and that food rescue is an integral part of a solution to the problem of
  global warming.  Bottom line: we believe that everyone should always have
  access to delicious, healthy food.
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  Partners not only play a role in our project, they are our project.  Our
  partners are our clients, the hundreds of donors who share food, and the raft
  of recipient organizations (20, approximately, as of this writing). 
  Restaurants, grocery stories, farmer’s markets: nobody wants to throw out
  food.   What potential donors lack is a reliable partner, an organization with
  a well run, well directed volunteer base who can be counted on to pick up food
  at the appropriate time and location, transport it to a facility for sorting,
  and then deliver it to one of a network of agencies who will make immediate
  use of it.  We are that solution.  This is what we have been doing for years,
  with a proven track record, and we are ready to go big.  We thank you for
  supporting the Hollywood Food Coalition.
