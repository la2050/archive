title: Community Practice
project_summary: >-
  The funds from LA2050 will support Community Practice, a donation based social
  emotional learning and mental health program. It includes weekly community
  engagements, webinars and online training, and publishes social-emotional
  learning resources. This art-based program serves to combat loneliness and
  create emotional literacy in a city that can feel isolated and disconnected,
  exacerbating the problems of bias, and mental health issues. Some topics we
  address are grief,emotional management, and conflict management.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - South LA
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >
  Our work destigmatizes mental health, and creates an accessible, affordable
  entrypoint for people to explore the benefits of becoming more aware of their
  thoughts and emotions to their daily life. We host group therapy & discussion,
  in person and online to ease the financial burden and leverage the strength of
  community in combating issues that make us feel isolated in our experience but
  can be more common than we expect, connecting over shared goals and
  experiences.


  Emotional Intelligence is a critical part of community mental health. But the
  ability to recognize our emotions and the emotions of others is not inherent,
  it must be modeled and learned. Whatsmore, is that this is a fundamental human
  necessity regardless of race, age, gender, or socio-economic status. 


  Los Angeles’ sprawl can add to feelings of isolation, and this sense of
  disconnectedness contributes to depression. Our Community Practice reminds us
  that we are all in this together and gives us tools to get through.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >
  Since 2010 Citizens Of Culture has done the work of bringing people together
  for intimate gatherings about the most important issues of our time. We have
  served as a contemporary platform for discourse on the matters of politics,
  relationships, art, entrepreneurship, and mental health. We have gathered a
  body of nearly 20,000 subscribers, and over 10,000 past event participants.


  Since 2016 we have engaged heavily in the practice of using arts and culture
  as a vehicle for socio-emotional learning and healing. We’ve hosted workshops
  on dealing with grief, racial trauma, sexual assault, and weekly group therapy
  gatherings with groups as diverse as incarcerated prison populations, to high
  scool teenagers. 


  Now, with our audience and network of teaching artists, and mental health
  professionals we are positioned to establish our work as a contributing force
  in the space of community health and healing arts.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  The success of the project will be measured by both qualitative and
  quantitative metrics. The first of which will be a count of individuals we are
  able to attract to the program, along with information we will be recording
  some demographic like culture, race, and socio-economic standing. Along with
  this we will also record psychographic information such as whether there was a
  preexisting interest in this kind of learning, and socio-political
  orientation. 


  With entry and exit surveys we will be able to check in with the learning that
  individuals take from our programs and how that correlates with the learning
  outcomes that we aspire to create with the design of our activities. Also, we
  must record the kind and degree of relief that our work produces in
  participants.


  Another key metric is the number and degree to which professional partners
  collaborate and support our work. It is important that our work is recognized
  to some degree by the academic and professional arenas to help shift the
  status quo, and share resources. Important questions to answer would be, at
  which stage do we begin gaining traction, what kind of industry specific
  marketing will be required to achieve this? What kind of established and
  emerging professionals take interest in our work? What research trajectories
  does it highlight.


  Another KPI is the interest the media takes in our work and story, and how
  that helps or hinders our marketing efforts, and ability to attract new
  participants.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '1000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '5000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >
  Whether the way we interact in traffic, at work, or in a global pandemic, we
  need soft skills to be able to maintain awareness of our thoughts and emotions
  and communicate with each other. We provide education & services that should
  have been taught in schools. It helps us give language to what we are going
  through, and understand the experiences of others.




  The impact of our work will de-stigmatize mental health services, make an
  accessible, affordable entry point to acquire mental health services, with
  particular interest to marginalized communities. Offer immediate relief to
  daily issues of loneliness, isolation, and long term benefit socio-emotional
  education and create a culture of open communication.
