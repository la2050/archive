title: Expanding Healthcare Access for All
project_summary: >-
  Saban Community Clinic (SCC) will soon open its new Family Health Center in
  Los Angeles. The Center will provide valuable, quality health care to
  thousands of families regardless of immigration status or ability to pay,
  including those who are living below the poverty line. The Clinic operates in
  a medically under-served area and will include medical, dental and behavioral
  health services, as well as nutrition counseling. The entire clinic will have
  a special focus on pediatric care to ensure local children are set on a
  healthier path.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >
  Health care should be a right, not a privilege.  The need for quality,
  affordable health care continues to grow in Los Angeles. In 2017, the SPA 4
  service area had the highest rate of childhood poverty in LA county. Poverty
  and poor health are inextricably linked. Parents in this area often have to
  choose between paying rent, buying groceries or getting health care. Over half
  a million people in SPA 4 struggle daily with economic distress and high rates
  of mental illness and chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension. 


  In addition to low income families, approximately 16,000 homeless people live
  or stay in SPA 4, which is the highest number in the County. In keeping with
  the area’s demographics, the vast majority of patients in need of health care
  access live at or near the federal poverty line, struggling to meet their
  basic needs. Without access to a community health center, many patients will
  fall through the cracks.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Founded as The Los Angeles Free Clinic in 1967, our organization has built a
  reputable history in providing health care services to low-income, medically
  deprived people. Renamed in 2013 as Saban Community Clinic (SCC), SCC is now a
  prominent health care resource for those hardest hit by poverty. Last year,
  SCC supplied over $9 million dollars in free health care services and helped
  nearly 21,500 patients. 


  To meet the growing need for health care access, SCC will open the Family
  Health Center at 137 N. Virgil Avenue in a designated medically under-served
  area. The Clinic will serve vulnerable patients, including undocumented
  families and people experiencing homelessness.


  In 2017, SCC earned PCMH Recognition at Level 3 (the highest) for all three
  sites from the National Committee for Quality Assurance. This is the gold
  standard of quality for Federally Qualified Healthcare Centers. 


  At SCC, we care deeply about helping our patients. With LA2050 support, we can
  help even more.

   
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  At the new Family Health Center, SCC will provide medical, dental and
  behavioral health services to more than 1400 patients by July 2021. By 2024,
  the Clinic will be at full capacity and able to serve at least 3,360
  additional patients each year. SCC anticipates being able to serve 1,300
  dental patients once at full staffing capacity. 


  This project will mean that - in the first year alone - over 1400 patients and
  their families will have improved access to the important health care services
  they need!  


  No patient will be turned away if they can't pay. The Center will give
  low-income, vulnerable children the chance to see a pediatrician who
  specializes in childhood health issues, a dentist with a caring approach to
  improving their oral health, and a counselor who can help support them in
  dealing with anxiety. These are just a few of the ways that the Center can
  help local families.  


  The new Family Health Center will produce a measurable, positive impact on the
  health and well-being of vulnerable children, their families and their
  community in this part of LA County.


  Finally, during the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis, SCC has also been playing
  its role to provide critically important medical services to its patients. The
  dedicated doctors, nurses, medical assistants and other staff have been
  working tirelessly to make sure the most vulnerable get the help that they
  need. Public health matters to us all!
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '1400'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '14000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >
  The Family Health Center has tremendous potential to improve community health.
  The site is in a low-income, high need area. Within SPA 4, about 30% of Latino
  adults report having no regular source of medical care. In the Center's zip
  code, over half the residents are Latino, and four out of every ten children
  live in low-income households. SCC’s Community Needs Assessment (2018) found
  that 16% of children in this area had never been to the dentist, and had an
  even greater need for mental health services. 


  Better health for one patient means better public health for their family,
  co-workers and community. The new Center answers the growing need for
  healthcare access, setting low-income families on the path to better health
  and well-being. 
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  Although SCC is not submitting a formal collaborative proposal, SCC is a
  trusted safety net provider within Service Planning Area 4 (SPA 4) of Los
  Angeles County. SCC has a long history of collaborating with other area health
  care providers, in part through its membership in the Community Clinic
  Association of Los Angeles County.  Additionally, SCC actively collaborates
  with other social service providers to link our patients to the services they
  need, including, but not limited to, legal services, food vouchers and
  transitional housing.
