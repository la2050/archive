title: City Year Inglewood USD Expansion
project_summary: >-
  This school year, City Year Los Angeles partnered for the first time with the
  Inglewood Unified School District (IUSD). Inglewood is prioritizing City Year
  as part of their turnaround strategy to help further the district’s mission to
  nurture, educate and graduate students who are self-responsible and
  self-disciplined. This grant would support City Year’s continued presence in
  its two IUSD pilot schools - Crozier Middle School and Woodworth-Monroe
  Academy - with a long-term plan to expand onto more Inglewood campuses.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - South LA
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  This school year, City Year Los Angeles (CYLA) began a partnership with IUSD.
  As mentioned above, Inglewood is prioritizing City Year as part of their
  turnaround strategy to help further the district’s mission to nurture, educate
  and graduate students who are self-responsible and self-disciplined. Thelma
  Melendez de Santa Ana, the former State Administrator for IUSD, stated the
  district is experiencing “declining student enrollment, changing demographics,
  challenging socioeconomic conditions for families, a drop in school funding,
  and the expansion of charter schools” but, IUSD’s “mission remains unchanged:
  providing effective educational experiences for every student in our care.”
  CYLA is an important part of helping IUSD maintain this mission. City Year’s
  “Whole School Whole Child” approach to student-success, with a strong focus on
  social-emotional learning, is uniquely equipped to support Inglewood Unified
  in its goals to improve student outcomes and enrollment.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  CYLA is uniquely positioned to work in partnership with IUSD as we have 13
  years of experience doing similar work in LAUSD. For over a decade, we have
  been implementing our Whole School Whole Child program in schools across Los
  Angeles. Through this program, CYLA has the ability to add capacity to
  under-resourced schools and help meet the holistic needs of all students by
  integrating academic and social-emotional supports throughout the school day.
  Our AmeriCorps members forge positive, caring relationships with students and
  help create an environment in which students can build on their strengths,
  take risks in their learning and feel connected to their school. Expansion
  into IUSD is deeply aligned with CYLA’s goals and priorities, as we seek to
  provide support to schools where students can benefit the most. Ultimately, we
  see potential to grow into more districts like IUSD that have the same level
  of need as LAUSD and also work collaboratively with us to ensure
  sustainability.  
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  CYLA measures success in terms of our students’ growth. City Year has
  determined the following objectives for 2020-21 school year:


  *Deploying two teams of AmeriCorps members, one to Crozier Middle School and
  one to Woodworth-Monroe Academy

  *Providing support to approximately 150 “focus list” students with at least 15
  hours of targeted intervention;

  *Offering support to focus list students through attendance monitoring, social
  emotional guidance, tutoring in English Language Arts and math, and
  after-school offerings; and

  *Ensuring that 50% of students City Year AmeriCorps members work with in math
  and English improve their “D” or “F” at least one grade level, maintain a “C”
  grade or higher in Math and English, or meet/exceed their expected growth on
  the Math and English Inventories.


  CYLA uses the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (HMH) Inventory exams to measure
  academic growth, and the Deveraux Student Strengths Assessment (DESSA), to
  measure students’ social emotional growth.


  In the long term, it is our goal to deepen our presence in the key communities
  we serve by filling out school “feeder patterns” - the series of schools a
  child will attend along his or her educational trajectory. It is our goal to
  continue expanding our services across IUSD, replicating the success we are
  seeing at Crozier Middle School and Woodworth-Monroe Academy.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '150'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '1034'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  City Year is contributing to a bolder vision of what public schools can and
  should be for all children: places of learning, exploration, and risk-taking,
  where data informs practices that promote student growth and achievement and
  where all students have access to positive relationships and personalized
  learning environments that encourage them to persevere through challenges and
  thrive. With this proposal we want to continue to bring these enhancements to
  our two Inglewood Unified School District campuses. Since 2007, City Year Los
  Angeles has partnered with teachers and schools in communities challenged by
  the persistent inequity in our education system to create learning
  environments where all students can reach their full potential.
