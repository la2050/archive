  The S.T.E.A.M. Collective is a collaboration between Hacker Fund and Road to

  Angeles County to harness their creativity and build technology and creative
  arts organizations that educate the disadvantaged, inspire the community,

  After serving technologists and artists working in the nonprofit sector for a
  collective ten years, we have learned that innovators want to focus on
  building and creating, not the paperwork nightmare that is oftentimes
  associated with launching and running a nonprofit organizations. We are
  addressing this administrative need by joining forces to reduce the overhead
  expenses preventing diverse engineers, designers, data scientists, and artists
  from serving the community effectively. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Both Hacker Fund and Road to Artdom are effective fiscal sponsors that have a
  track record of serving technologists and artists in LA County, respectively.
  Hacker Fund has helped launch Hack for LA programs, Artificial Intelligence
  LA, and the Compton Innovation Center, while Road to Artdom has helped launch
  Comedy Gives Back. This S.T.E.A.M. Collective is important to the work of both
  of our organizations because it represents a merger of two conductors of
  nonprofit incubation in Los Angeles county into one efficient engine of social
  entrepreneurship.

  We will measure success with the following metrics: 


  - Number of prototypes
