Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Immigrant families in Los Angeles are facing a unique set of challenges today.
  In the Pico-Union/Westlake area, where CARECEN (Central American Resource
  Center) is located, over a third live below the federal poverty line and 65%
  identify as Latino/a. Poor economic mobility combined with increased ICE
  raids, racial & gender discrimination, the termination of immigration relief
  programs, and the threat of privatized education has disrupted learning
  environments for immigrant students. In fact, a UCLA Civil Rights Project
  study found that 57.4% of teachers and school administrators reported
  increased absenteeism when students had concerns about immigration enforcement
  affecting them and their families. Living in a constant state of fear over
  legal status being revoked and possible deportation, leads to a downturn in
  academic performance for un/documented families. Providing this space gives
  immigrant families the tools to be educational advocates for themselves and
  their community.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  15 years ago parents from the surrounding community came to CARECEN to develop
  our Parent & Youth Center (PYC). The aim of the PYC is to provide a safe space
  that empowers and strengthens immigrant families when it comes to education.
  We provide resources about LAUSD policies that give parents the confidence to
  advocate for their child’s education . While our youth programming is designed
  to support the goals of students and provide leadership training to advocate
  for their community. The PYC provides the following programs and services: 

  Parent Leadership Development-Parents focus on leadership development and
  proactive organizing workshops.

  Youth Leadership Program-Youth undergo trainings focused on political
  consciousness and empowering students through modern skills and tools
  workshops.

  College Head Start- We provide academic counseling, college admission support,
  financial aid, and career mentoring for high school students.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  CARECEN aims to strengthen its capacity to recruit and develop parent and
  youth leaders, as well as execute effective social justice campaigns for
  educational equity and immigrant rights. Through our workshops, we support the
  development of community leaders in civic engagement and we move closer to our
  vision of empowering our communities to achieve personal and collective
  success. In addition, CARECEN provides comprehensive pre-collegiate services
  for high-school students looking to apply for university and college
  admission. The goal is to create a sustainable high school impact program
  where college readiness and graduation are the standard. We aim to achieve
  this by providing leadership and educational classes in our Parent and Youth
  Center that will accomplish the following: 


  *Ensure the immigrant and refugee student’s needs are being met in a
  comprehensive way so that barriers for educational attainment are addressed.


  *Provide parents and / or adult family members with the knowledge and skills
  to support their children’s educational success.


  *Provide students with the knowledge and skills in the areas of civic
  engagement and digital organizing.
   
  *Develop well-trained parents and students advocating for school communities
  and policies that advance educational equity for immigrants and refugees in
  LAUSD.


  *Monitor students’ academic progress so that they earn a high school diploma
  and gain admission to higher educational institution


  *Ensure access to academic support for students and their families.

   
  Measurable program objectives include: 


  *10-15 outreach / recruitment events will be scheduled every semester to
  introduce our programs to local schools, family resource centers, and
  community centers.


  *15-20 parents will participate in the Parent Leadership Program each cohort.

  a.Parent Leadership cohort members will participate in bi-weekly workshops
  that address language barriers, the LAUSD system and the academic needs of

  child’s education at the end of the program through a pre-post qualitative
  survey.


  *15-20 youth will participate in the Youth Leadership Program each cohort. 

  a.Youth Leadership cohort members will participate in workshops that cover
  art, activism, civic engagement and advocacy.

  b.90% of participants will show a greater understanding of community / digital
  organizing at the end of the program through a pre-post qualitative survey.


  *15-20 11th and 12th grade students will participate in our College Head Start
  Program each cohort. 

  a.College Head Start participants will be supported with college admissions
  application, scholarships, financial aid and build a comprehensive growth plan
  for their post-high school life.

  b.90% will understand the benefits and differences when applying to
  Universities, Community Colleges and Trade Schools.

  c.90% will be admitted to a University, Community College or Trade School.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '350'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '200'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  CARECEN's Parent and Youth Center (PYC) has reduced and eliminated several
  barriers hindering the educational achievement of immigrant. Working alongside
  empowered parents and youth has led to successful education campaigns that
  affect the lives of our members. Our PYC programming has the capacity to
  transform Pico-Union/Westlake into a community of knowledge and grassroots
  power. We only support a fraction of the 25,000 low-income, monolingual
  Spanish-speaking Latino immigrants from Central America that makeup nearly 65%
  of households, but we must focus on communal leadership that aims to change
  inadequate school and community conditions for all residents. Resulting in an
  empowered community that transcends poverty through education.
