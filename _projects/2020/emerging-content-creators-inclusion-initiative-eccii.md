Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Los Angeles is a key place for the art of filmmaking, being a strong force for
  economic growth within our state but often we find that people of color have
  less opportunities from entering the entertainment industry and navigating
  within it to tell their stories to actual career opportunities. It is
  imperative that we empower and strengthen emerging talent and professionals
  from underrepresented communities for the future in the industry. We provide
  people opportunities through scholarships, mentoring, and navigation through
  the various avenues within the industry.  Emerging writers to content creators
  and executive professionals have fresh ideas, ambition, and undeniable
  potential to start a change for themselves and multicultural representation.  


  NALIP acts as a stepping stone and encourages creatives to express their voice
  and develop as professionals. This call is to push for authentic and accurate
  representation on screen to mirror the diversity we see in our everyday lives.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  NALIP’s long history of programs and campaigns demonstrate our devotion to
  inspire diverse creatives to express themselves and triumph. We are one of the
  leading organizations who are prioritizing a latinx pipeline into the
  entertainment sphere. 

  The Emerging Content Creators Inclusion Initiative (ECCII) was created to
  strengthen the skills and knowledge of content creators and emerging
  professionals who are ready to become advantageous members in the
  entertainment industry. Our workshops, mentorships, and scholarships are
  geared toward guiding people down their chosen career paths in the
  entertainment fields. 

  NALIP as an organization is uniquely suited to take this on because this
  initiative has helped build connections, desired skills and knowledge for
  creatives and professionals to enter the entertainment workforce.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  NALIP seeks true, measurable success through all its programs, particularly
  for the Emerging Content Creators Inclusion Initiative, in evaluating the
  number of scholarships disbursed, events held throughout the year, industry
  mentors engaged and tracking of progress beyond the program.


  NALIP has offered hundreds over scholarships yearly to attend the NALIP Media
  Summit where the Emerging Content Creators Workshop takes place. In 2019,
  NALIP offered 200 scholarships to emerging creatives and professionals. During
  the workshop, scholarship recipients engaged in a mentorship session with
  engagement from up to 10 mentors from different fields of the industry.


  During the fall of NALIP’s Latino Media Fest, recipients attended insightful
  workshops with seasoned professionals at top talent agencies where they
  learned from seasoned professionals as well as break into intimate groups
  where they had more one-on-one mentorship sessions.


  In the winter, participants attended the Diverse Women in Media Forum, and
  engaged in an intimate setting for emerging and established Women of Color to
  network, receive mentorship and build community.


  Success is also measured by the number of participants NALIP tracks and
  supports past this program to ensure they succeed, including providing
  additional opportunities in the industry and recommendations. In the past 18
  months, NALIP has created a pipeline of talent and placed over 40 creatives
  and executives in positions throughout the entertainment industry.
