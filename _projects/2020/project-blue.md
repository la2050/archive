title: Project Blue
project_summary: >-
  Project Blue partners with outreach programs in South & East LA that enables
  kids to reach personal success through developing purpose, positive
  identities, resilience & character through safe after-school sports & STEM
  activities in areas with high gang activity. Each program is supported by LAPD
  officers who serve as coaches and positive mentors who inspire kids to
  envision a future they can strive for. This grant will support our current
  programs to provide enough resources for growth, and newly added programs we
  hope to support in 2020-21.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to PLAY
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - East LA
  - South LA
  - Watts
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Project Blue recognizes that in order for communities to feel safe and secure,
  residents need to trust the officers that serve them. Identifying this
  strained relationship, the LAPD launched the Community Safety Partnership
  (CSP) division in 2011, with a mission to foster relationships with residents
  in housing developments and to support community/youth programs that address
  and reduce violent crimes. Focusing on Watts and the East LA neighborhoods of
  Boyle Heights, Lincoln Heights and El Sereno, areas where gang
  activity/occurences of violent crime are some of the highest in LA County, our
  approach for positively transforming communities is based on involving youth
  as a conduit to inspire intergenerational and systemic change. Due to the lack
  of safe, organized after-school activities for kids residing in these
  communities, Project Blue supports officer-led outreach programs where
  officers and kids can engage together and actively forge relationships through
  coaching and mentoring.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Project Blue believes that police officers have unique skills and experience
  to partner with kids and communities to create positive and transformative
  relationships. By providing financial and organizational support, we actively
  facilitate the good work that police officers do in their communities to
  create and ensure safety and opportunity for children and their families in
  inner cities. Project Blue was created by LAPD officer Steve Robinson and
  entrepreneur Janet Crown, founders of Crown Robinson Family Philanthropy, who
  seek to create private-public partnerships that enable creative solutions to
  complex social issues. By creating program models like Project Blue, and with
  symbiotic partnerships like with the LAPD CSP division, officer-led programs
  can strive to develop the “whole child” and achieve the highest possible
  positive impact. We believe our approach will guide at-risk children through
  developmental challenges and build resilience, academic and athletic
  confidence.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  We emphasize continuous and measurable growth. We believe that by identifying
  goals, creating trackable metrics and collecting data, program leaders can
  identify areas where they are succeeding in achieving their goals and where
  they need to improve. We measure our success based on how each program
  implements and meets our goal to impact the “whole child” through our five
  pillars: (1) promoting resilience and understanding the ability to adapt to
  adversity, trauma and significant sources of stress; (2) encouraging academic
  achievement and emphasizing the importance of education and
  setting/maintaining goals; (3) facilitating parent/guardian engagement so that
  adults remain committed not only to the children in their care, but also to
  our holistic community-building approach; (4) positively engaging police
  officers in the community to make a deeper impact on all residents; and (5)
  educating both youth and parents/guardians on health, wellness and nutrition
  to promote a lifetime appreciation for making healthy choices and prioritizing
  their physical and mental well-being. We ensure that programs have the
  resources and tools to implement/measure each pillar, such as research-based
  resilience curricula, access to shared best practices, and more. We also
  collect and analyze data on positive police-community interactions, which
  demonstrates occurrences in the community that capture how residents measure
  their safety as a result of their interactions with officers in the program.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '1000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '5000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  According to the CDC, there are several approaches that can support
  communities in reducing youth violence, two of which are mentoring and
  after-school programs. Project Blue believes that utilizing these strategies
  as part of implementing our pillars with a “whole child” approach will
  positively impact communities and lower violent crime rates and gang activity
  throughout the city, particularly in Watts and East LA where we currently
  focus our efforts. Our experience with both the public and private sectors has
  guided our approach to investing in what we believe is most effective:
  long-term engagement in young people’s lives with partnerships that can create
  consistent and safe environments where kids can develop purpose and
  resilience.
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  We’re grateful to partner with the LAPD CSP division on our program model. As
  part of their mandate, officers assigned to the CSP are encouraged to work
  with existing local youth outreach programs or create their own, where there
  is a need or interest. Through these programs, officers can actively and
  directly build relationships with youth, and the community as a whole, through
  coaching and mentorship. However, due to funding constraints, CSP programs
  often struggle to provide enough resources for all participating youth, such
  as equipment, registration costs and academic supplies, which creates
  challenges for officers to focus on running the actual program. Through our
  partnership, we ensure each program receives the resources they need so they
  can create the biggest possible impact.
