  VAST Enrichment Program: Creating accessible pathways to classroom engagement
  for English Language Learners & Special Education students
project_summary: >-
  My LA2050 will allow US to expand our free VAST Enrichment Program for Special
  Education, ELL, and other marginalized students, increasing the breadth and
  depth of our impact. VAST nurtures under-represented voices with an inclusive,
  nontraditional curriculum of in-class theatre workshops that reduce barriers
  to participation for high-needs students, improve their language,
  communication, and teamwork skills, and boost classroom behavior. To amplify
  our impact, US will also provide on-campus professional development for
  partnering schools.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South LA
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  US strategically offers our VAST (Voices for Arts & Social Theatre) Enrichment
  Program at arts-poor Title 1 schools to provide equitable access to quality
  theatre-arts education & mentorship for marginalized students, particularly
  those learning English or receiving Special Education services. With 88% of
  LAUSD students experiencing 3+ traumatic events, over half suffer from PTSD,
  depression, and anxiety. Thankfully, art is a proven tool for healing trauma,
  instilling confidence, and fostering solidarity among diverse peers. Research
  reveals that students with arts education have increased compassion, improved
  school attendance & academic performance, and are 3x more likely to earn a BA.


  Yet just 25% of LAUSD students have access to theatre-arts education, and
  opportunities are even sparser for Special Ed and other high-needs students.
  Beyond arts education, VAST provides an inclusive environment and alternate
  learning pathways vital for students who struggle in mainstream classrooms.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  US has disrupted patterns of inequality for 27 years, partnering with 45+ LA
  County schools, community centers, and Probation facilities to fill the gap in
  arts education access for thousands of students. Our inclusive VAST model
  adapts to student/classroom needs with a curriculum aligned with Common Core
  ELA standards and state standards for English Language Writing and Visual &
  Performing Arts. Personalized mentoring, ensemble-building, and theatre
  exercises that utilize universal, non-verbal & visual storytelling help create
  a safe space for high-needs students to explore their creativity and develop
  21st Century learning/life skills—providing a gateway to learning often
  unavailable in traditional settings.


  As a leader in the field, US is also often asked to provide professional
  development services, cross-training hundreds of educators, Probation
  Officers, and professional teaching artists (TAs) on trauma-informed
  curricula, classroom-management strategies, and cultural empathy.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  With My LA2050’s support, VAST will double its impact. We will expand into a
  4th arts-poor school and grow our 13-week model into a year-long, 26-week
  residency in all sites —a 110% increase in workshops & 42% jump in
  participants— increasing arts education enrollment in LA and instilling
  lifelong socio-emotional & academic competencies in the city’s most vulnerable
  students. With hands-on, sequential learning activities, high-needs students
  will work effectively in small groups to create short theatre pieces based on
  their shared experiences. Led by 2 veteran TAs and 1-3 volunteer mentors
  working alongside the classroom teacher, VAST will:


  *Provide pathways to learning that accept & engage hard-to-reach students.

  *Promote 21st century learning skills and English proficiency.

  *Improve well-being, encouraging youth to develop creativity, connections,
  self-respect & empathy.

  *Increase hope, confidence & self-efficacy among withdrawn students. 

  *Improve classroom dynamics & campus culture.


  US evaluates VAST quantitatively & qualitatively with pre- & post-residency
  surveys, candid student reflections, and testimonials from TAs, faculty, and
  families. Helping make LA the best place to LEARN, the majority of VAST
  students will demonstrate measurable increases in one or more social skills
  (confidence, collaboration, communication) and abilities in line with Common
  Core ELA standards (editing, rewriting, sharing point of view).


  Additional on-campus teacher trainings will extend our impact beyond 2050.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '660'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '100000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  VAST addresses diverse learning styles, creating positive environments where
  students of all abilities can explore, reclaim their education, and succeed.
  VAST students recognize their intrinsic talent & self-worth and report feeling
  comfortable sharing their thoughts. With our presence on campus extended
  year-round, our ELL & Special Education students and classrooms will truly
  blossom, enriched with continuous arts engagement and mentorship.


  The 15+ teachers we will partner with through VAST in 2020-21 will go on to
  teach roughly 3,000 students during their careers, while the 250+ faculty &
  staff we might empower via on-site professional development will multiply our
  impact, benefitting entire campus communities and their future students.
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  While US does not have collaborative partners who receive funding from US for
  this project, we do work closely with our school site administrators and
  classroom teachers to effectively serve our VAST students. Our partnering
  LAUSD schools for this project include:


  David Starr Jordan High School

  San Fernando High School

  Hollenbeck Middle School*

  Markham Middle School


  All four LAUSD schools are Title 1, indicating a majority of students who live
  below the poverty line; US acts as the sole theatre-arts programming at each
  campus. We strategically offer our VAST Enrichment Program in classrooms that
  include a high proportion of special education and/or ELL students, as well as
  classrooms that exclusively serve these student populations.


  *New VAST site to be funded by this project
