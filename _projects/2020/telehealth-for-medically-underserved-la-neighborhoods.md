title: Telehealth for Medically Underserved LA Neighborhoods
project_summary: >-
  Clinica Romero is requesting urgent support at this unprecedented time to
  continue offering primary care services for underserved groups including
  low-income immigrant families and homeless individuals. As a community health
  provider, our clinics are on the front lines of the health emergency caused by
  the COVID-19 pandemic and are playing a key role in both prevention and
  diagnosis of the virus. Our goal is to provide care to our local community
  regardless of a patient's ability to pay.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Clínica Romero is located in Los Angeles County SPA 4 and serves the
  low-income, immigrant and homeless population in the area. According to the
  most recent Key Indicators of Health Report (2017), the LA County Department
  of Public Health identifies SPA 4 with the second highest incidence of poverty
  (24%) and reported household food insecurity (32%). Our two clinics are
  located in Pico Union and Boyle Heights – areas defined as having too few
  primary care providers. Through these sites, we provide services to an average
  of 12,000 patients annually, of whom 100% live in poverty, 45% are uninsured,
  and 7% are experiencing homelessness. Our primary objective is to provide
  screening, testing, diagnostic, and primary care services to underserved
  patients that are at high risk of contracting COVID-19. All of our patients
  are low-income and many are employed in service industry work that does not
  allow them to work from home during the LA County "Safer at Home" quarantine.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Clinica Romero serves a high number of immigrant patients that are often
  afraid to seek care due to the risk of utilizing government programs. Clinica
  Romero has provided care to immigrant families and individuals experiencing
  homelessness since its inception and is well trusted in the communities that
  we serve. Our goal is to ensure that our communities receive the information
  they need to protect themselves from contracting COVID-19 and appropriate care
  if they are sick. We also aim to educate individuals experiencing homelessness
  on COVID-19, and provide sanitation supplies, weekly opportunities for them to
  take showers on site, and medical care as needed.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >+
  If funded, Clinica Romero will utilize its Electronic Health Record system to
  track services for the duration of the grant, as well as health outcomes.
  Health outcome data includes diagnostic codes which allow us to track patient
  wellbeing related to their diagnosis. For example, we will be able to track
  the number of patients served, diagnoses categories for served patients,
  COVID-19 positive cases, and health outcomes for COVID-19 patients (type of
  follow up care needed and recovery). We will also track the number of patients
  who are able to receive telehealth services, medication delivery, and homeless
  individuals who received a shower/sanitation supplies.


  The broader impact to Los Angeles will be measured by: 


  Number of staff we were able to keep employed due to grant funding;

  Number of community members who were provided health education to prevent the
  spread of COVID-19 through remote services.


  Our vision of success includes maintaining and strengthening community
  resilience through ensuring that the most underserved residents in Los Angeles
  have access to medical and mental health care during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '350'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '12000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Clinica Romero is committed to improving access to high quality care for
  underserved patients in order to address community health issues with an
  equity lens. Through this goal, we aim to expand access to care and provide
  innovative programming in order to meet community need/demand, and improve
  patient care and health outcome measures during the Covid-19 pandemic. By
  ensuring that the most underserved receive the care that they need during this
  time, we aim to maintain and strengthen community and family resilience in Los
  Angeles. Through education, we will continue to organize underserved
  populations to self-advocate for much needed health care services well beyond
  the Covid-19 pandemic.

Has your proposal changed due to COVID-19?: >
  As a community health clinic, Clinica Romero is on the front lines of the
  health emergency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and is playing a key role in
  both prevention and diagnosis of the virus. Our original proposal included a
  response to COVID-19 and additional details are included here. Through funding
  received from the LA2050 challenge, we aim to:


  * Purchase equipment that will enable us to provide primary care and mental
  health services through telehealth (phone and video)

  * Provide remote (through phone calls and social media platforms) health
  education related to COVID-19 for high risk groups and educate underserved
  community members on how to access telehealth services available to them
  through our two clinic sites

  * Provide sanitation supplies to homeless patients visiting our site for
  weekly showers

  * Facilitate medication delivery for high risk patients through at-home drop
  off services 


  Clinica Romero maintains its doors open at its two clinic sites located in the
  neighborhoods of Pico-Union/Westlake and Boyle Heights in Los Angeles. Only
  essential medical visits are being scheduled for patients at this time to
  ensure that they receive the care and medication they need to remain healthy.
  All other patients are able to access care through telehealth services and are
  provided education on how to access their primary care or mental health
  provider via a phone call or a secure video conference."
