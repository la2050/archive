  SEWI places master’s level social work interns (MSW) in Los Angeles County;
  primarily schools and afterschool programs to provide mental health services,
  crisis intervention, group counseling, staff training and social and emotional

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Providing all students with a high-quality education and reducing the dropout
  rate require more than academic and economic resources. Students also require
  psychological resources, such as the belief that achievement is possible and
  the skills to persist in the face of challenge and failure. While many
  teachers know that social and emotional learning is important, schools have
  been primarily focused on teaching academic content such as math, science, and
  history and less intentional about supporting social and emotional skills that
  are important to learning and life success. Our MSW intern program complements
  school & after-school efforts to address mental health needs in
  under-resourced youth by providing wellness services to help youth thrive.
  SEWI also provides staff training and development to our partner sites on
  social & emotional programming to help staff better meet the ever changing
  needs of the youth at their organizations and support the work of the MSW
  interns.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  There is a growing body of research proving that social and emotional learning
  (SEL) is fundamental to academic success, and must be woven into the work of
  every teacher in every classroom and every after school and summer learning
  program, if we truly want to reduce high school dropout rates and prepare all
  our students for college and careers. SEWI understands that many schools are
  under-resourced and only have the capacity to meet the academic requirements.
  For many of the students that SEWI serves, they need someone that can help
  advocate for their learning and emotional needs. 50% of all lifetime cases of
  mental illness begin by the age of 14. (NAMI.org) Beyond short webinars or
  training, some teachers are ill prepared to provide social and emotional
  learning to their students at a meaningful level. SEWI has the resources,
  skills and proven outcomes to better engage students' social and emotional
  learning needs and in turn help to reduce dropout rates.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Our goal is for schools that partner with SEWI and implement the MSW intern
  program to have a steady decline in student drop out rates annually. To ensure
  our program is effective, we set requirements for our MSW interns to collect
  data in efforts to close service gaps and accurately fill the relevant needs
  in each community we serve.  We work with school counselors and teachers to
  gather program referrals for the most vulnerable youth. We make our services
  available to all youth that need it by eliminating the barriers of
  transportation and payment so all youth can thrive in their school
  environment. We measure and evaluate success through our client documentation
  system (Salesforce), weekly reporting, and regular assessment of client
  functioning and perception of progress and client satisfaction surveys.  In
  addition, SEWI will work with school personnel to gather data on absences,
  grades and dropout rates to adjust programming as necessary and meet the needs
  of individual students who may be struggling. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '300'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '1000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  We partner with schools to serve youth that are primarily low income and on
  free and or reduced lunch.  These young people often are unable to receive
  mental health service and additional school support. MSW interns run groups on
  topics ranging from friendship groups to coping with anxiety or depression.
  These groups offer youth the ability to connect with each other and create
  more inclusive and open school environments.“Youth who felt more connected to
  their school reported lower levels of depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation,
  social anxiety... as well as higher levels of self-esteem.”
  (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) We also help promote school wellness activities across
  campus to build a larger community of wellness and support.
