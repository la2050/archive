title: 'Everydae: digital tutoring for everyone'
project_summary: >-
  We are on a mission to increase college matriculation rates by increasing the
  number of students who a) take the SAT; b) improve their score; and c) go to
  college. We will accomplish this by working with our nonprofit partners and LA
  high schools to provide 1000+ low-income students free access to Everydae, a
  smart digital tutor, adapted to student needs and goals. By also working with
  teachers and providing them actionable data, we will help them create targeted
  interventions to increase STEM proficiency and graduation rates.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - ~20 low-income schools across LA
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Going to college matters: those with a bachelor’s degree earn an average of
  $625,000 more across their lifetimes, are also more likely to be employed,
  have health insurance, and report being happy.


  Unfortunately, students from disadvantaged backgrounds are much less likely to
  attend college. A primary reason is lower SAT scores. But low scores are just
  a symptom of a much larger problem: wealthier families have the resources and
  experience to provide a huge advantage to their children, particularly through
  expensive private tutoring and knowledge of how to navigate the path to
  college.


  At Everydae, we’re giving everyone in the world access to their own digital
  tutor. Students can ace the SAT and learn about college by completing highly
  engaging 10-minute mini-lessons from any device. And because no two students
  are alike, we create an individualized study journey that adapts to their
  needs and goals, so that all students can maximize their progress in the
  minimum amount of time.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >
  An important part of our mission at Everydae, is to create a system that we
  can replicate across low-income schools to increase the number of students who
  have access to college. Proving efficacy through an LA2050 grant, is the first
  step to opening the door to working with a broader range of nonprofits,
  communities and organizations. 
   
  We are also the exact right team for the job. We have over 17 years of test
  prep and tutoring experience and have helped 100,000+ students ace their exams
  and get accepted into college. Meanwhile, our CEO is an award-winning designer
  who knows how to create online experiences that will keep a teenager engaged
  and motivated.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  Our vision of success is an increase in the number of LA’s most disadvantaged
  students who see college as a possibility and have the tools to fulfill that
  aspiration. With our partners, we will realize this vision through Everydae’s
  platform generating an increase in SAT scores and students going to college.. 


  In line with LA2050 goals and metrics, we expect to increase:

  1) College matriculation for 10th and 11th grade students by significantly
  more than the annualized rate to achieve the 2050 target of 90% (.9%/year) by
  the end of the project;


  2) Proficiency in STEM by significantly more than annualized rate to achieve
  the 2050 target of 75% (1.2%/year) on both the math portions of the SAT and
  the Smarter Balanced Assessments;


  We will measure success in the following ways:

  - Improvement in SAT scores and STEM proficiency - measured by pre-post SAT
  scores and Smarter Balanced Assessments; 


  - An increase in the percentage of students who plan to enroll in college -
  via pre-post surveys;


  - Increased student engagement with SAT prep and planning for college - via a
  proprietary engagement score and surveys;


  - Student and teacher awareness of STEM learning needs related to SAT and
  college success - via pre-post surveys;


  - Use and impact of targeted interventions to address identified learning
  needs, recommended by Everydae based on analysis of student performance needs
  - via engagement data and surveys;


  - A willingness to continue/expand the program by teachers and nonprofit
  partners - via pre-post surveys.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '1000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '10000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >
  We believe that all students deserve access to the tools that can help make
  college a reality. By creating a program that can be replicated across
  communities, we expect to have a demonstrable impact, not only on the academic
  achievement gap, but also on the ability for Angelenos to create wealth and
  find employment over the long term.

  By working closely with our nonprofit distribution partners, (The LA Promise
  Fund and College Spring) we estimate that our study will directly impact the
  lives of 1,000+ students and their families across 20 low-income schools.


  By providing teacher training and aggregated performance data to schools, we
  believe an additional 10,000 people can be positively impacted over the next
  3-5 years
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  Our study is made possible because of our strong relationships with several
  nonprofits. 


  Our distribution partners are The LA Promise Fund and College Spring. Both
  organizations have agreed to help us distribute Everydae to LAUSD students and
  forge relationships with schools and educators.


  Meanwhile, 21PSTEM will be leading the evaluation and providing teachers with
  targeted data. 21PSTEM is a leading nonprofit expert in STEM education
  research and development. Their work throughout the US and Middle East (funded
  with over $57 million in support from the Dept of Education/IES, USAID,
  UNESCO, and private foundations) has impacted more than 30 universities, 400
  faculty, 500 secondary schools, 5000 teachers, and many thousands of students.
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Access to the LA2050 community
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.: 21PSTEM
