title: Regenerate California
project_summary: >-
  We have about 10 years to make meaningful progress to stop climate change by
  phasing out fossil fuels. Change starts at home, and we can catalyze progress
  across the world by positioning Los Angeles, then California, and then the
  nation to move to 100% clean energy. This grant will help us build a campaign
  to equitably phase out fossil fuel power plants by training 160 activists from
  frontline LA communities in the organizing and campaign skills needed to phase
  out LA’s fossil fuel power plants.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
  - South Bay
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
  - South East LA
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Applying a proven model or solution to a new issue or sector (e.g, using a job
  recruiting software or strategy to match clients to supportive housing sites,
  applying demonstrated strategies from advocating for college affordability to
  advocating for housing affordability and homelessness, etc.)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  The Regenerate California campaign will phase out polluting gas power plants
  in environmental justice communities and replace them with clean energy. Our
  campaign begins in Los Angeles County. Here, we will train 160 activists to
  win our campaign in this County and establish a model for California and the
  US. 


  Low-income communities of color are most impacted by fossil fuel pollution.
  They are often excluded from decision making-processes that result in more gas
  power plants being built in their communities. Close to 120 gas-fired power
  plants operate in environmental justice communities across California.


  Our grassroots-led coalition organizations will provide a training program to
  build a base of climate justice leaders in LA’s environmental justice
  communities, so they have the tools they need for self-determination. This
  project will expand our grassroots base and build power for an equitable
  phase-out of fossil fuels in LA and beyond.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Regenerate California builds on a long-standing partnership between our
  organizations. Together, we led the fight to move LA to commit to stopping new
  gas plant proposals and transitioning to 100% clean energy. Regenerate
  California puts frontline communities at the center of a new effort to phase
  out dirty gas plants and replace them with 100% clean energy. We aim to retire
  the existing gas fleet, starting with the dirtiest plants in LA’s
  environmental justice communities. 


  We know the utilities and the decision-makers, and we have won big and small
  energy campaigns. Together, our organizations combine powerful capacities in
  technical energy expertise, community organizing, movement building, policy
  advocacy, and communications. All of these are needed to win. 


  Our organizations represent 35,000 Californians living in communities of color
  that suffer the brunt of the fossil fuel economy. These communities must lead
  the movement for energy democracy and local control of power.

Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '160'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '10160000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Our project has a broad reach and great potential outcomes. An equitable
  transition from gas to clean energy is the key step to realize a 100% clean
  energy future in LA. Success here will offer a climate roadmap for others to
  follow, as when LA phased out coal power and converted to electric buses. By
  winning this campaign, we will make LA a healthier city and create a model for
  the state and nation.


  Regenerate California will prove that a community-led, grassroots campaign can
  achieve climate justice victories at scale. Perhaps most critically, our
  program is a durable investment in community capacity to build power for
  change in LA for years to come, for climate justice and for any other issue
  that arises in the community.
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  Each coalition member will bring its proven track record of successfully
  fighting gas plants and advocating for clean energy to co-develop curriculum
  and co-lead trainings with the coalition and their community leaders. Our 4
  trainings will emphasize the shared experience and leadership of various
  environmental justice leaders that lead campaigns to replace dirty gas plants
  with equitable and community-led clean solutions.


  Staff from each coalition member will participate in all 4 trainings.
  Collectively, the coalition will mobilize 160 LA County residents to
  participate in our trainings - 3 in LA and 1 in the Inland Valley. Community
  leaders from the Central Coast and from Inland Valley will participate in at
  least 2 of the trainings to enrich the knowledge of the LA County trainees.
