title: 'ProjectArt LA: A Solution for Budget Cuts'
project_summary: >-
  ProjectArt LA will provide the opportunity for young people in divested
  communities to express themselves creatively, overcome social barriers, and
  develop social skills so they can grow into thoughtful, empowered young
  adults. About two hundred students and teens will receive free visual arts
  classes taught after school hours by four local professional artists at Los
  Angeles Public Libraries. We will also host two art exhibitions featuring
  student and artist works that are free and open for the public to enjoy.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - South LA
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  ProjectArt LA vigorously responds to the need for quality, consistent,
  out-of-school arts education in LA’s highest need communities. In response to
  the lack of adequate arts learning opportunities in LA public schools, we take
  into account that schools with greater numbers of ESL learners, those who are
  eligible for free/reduced meals, and students of color disproportionately lack
  access. 


  Our mission is rooted in the belief that arts education is a critical tool for
  children to learn and develop. An essential part of STEAM, arts education has
  an inestimable impact on academic achievement and long-term outcomes that
  stretch beyond the class. 


  Inequity in arts and cultural engagement opportunities throughout LA
  aggravates the cycle of injustice in our disenfranchised communities.
  ProjectArt LA serves as the response to the lack of access to arts learning
  opportunities, filling the void by providing consistent art classes to
  children ages 4-18 in some of LA’s highest need communities.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  In today’s world, we are turning to our youth to build a more equitable and
  resilient future: to tackle everything from climate change to gun violence.
  ProjectArt presents an unprecedented opportunity to work with students to
  navigate these complex critical issues through self expression and art making.


  Change is only effective when it is led by and for those who are affected by a
  problem, and ProjectArt LA is a unifying force in this effort. We are uniquely
  suited to lead this initiative thanks to our long-standing partnerships with
  the Los Angeles Public Libraries (LAPL), collaborations with local groups, and
  phenomenal teaching artists. By partnering with LAPL, we can offer our
  enriching program free to students in their neighborhood libraries because
  overhead is low; just $500 supports one student for an entire school year. 


  We have served 500+ students over the course of three years. From increased
  self-esteem and improved social skills, our impact is proven year after year.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Our vision is to build the largest free art school in America without owning a
  single building. With this grant, we endeavor to impact the lives of even more
  children by expanding and enriching our proven model in LA’s most divested
  communities. 


  Success to ProjectArt LA means seeing students of all ages feel more
  confident, improve their art-making skills, and spend more time reading books.
  In the long-term, we hope to see more robust academic achievement and
  decreased drop-out rates. We want students to participate in our programs year
  after year.  


  ProjectArt LA leverages and utilizes technology to measure and track our
  outcomes by collecting attendance, student evaluations, images of student
  work, as well as librarian and resident artist feedback. Our exciting custom
  tracking app, ProjectArt Connects, allows us to internally record and track
  all data to then share with our supporters and communities. 


  In partnership with the GoldHirsh Foundation, ProjectArt expects to have
  accelerated outcomes in both social-emotional behaviors of our students as
  well as outcomes realized in our evaluations. Our latest data reveals telling
  information that this partnership will buttress even further. 


  For example, 2019 ProjectArt LA student evaluations revealed 95% of our
  high-need students learned more about art and artists due to our classes;  95%
  noticed improvements in their own art-making; 78% checked out books before and
  after class, and 89% felt more confident overall. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '200'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '400'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Today, ProjectArt LA students are taking on advanced art projects, learning
  art histories left out of the typical canon, and using creative
  problem-solving skills to challenge the status quo. They are being encouraged
  by mentors who believe in them and encourage a growth mindset where art is
  forgiving. They are checking out books and spending more time in their local
  library. Tomorrow, we hope to see better school attendance, higher GPAs, and
  decreased high school drop-out rates. ProjectArt LA believes in the power of
  creativity and the potential of every child. We are helping our children
  determine and sustain a more equitable future for themselves and communities
  by offering them a creative means to reflect and embrace their identities.
