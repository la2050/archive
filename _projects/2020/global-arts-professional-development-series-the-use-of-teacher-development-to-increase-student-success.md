  Global Arts Professional Development Series: The Use of Teacher Development to
  Increase Student Success
project_summary: >-
  We believe teachers who are constantly inspired to learn make the best
  educators, however, there is a severe lack of access to high-quality
  professional development for all educators. We are requesting $100,000 in
  funding for our Professional Development (PD) Program, which will provide free
  workshops for all. This program will consist of a series of workshops, held
  every other Friday afternoon throughout the academic year, as well as one
  5-day, Summer Seminario that will bring back our most effective presenters
  from the year’s workshop series.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  The purpose of the Professional Development Program is to provide a
  collaborative space that is centered around teaching and learning. We
  understand, firsthand, the impact a teacher can have on their students, and it
  is our objective to create an environment that recognizes and encourages
  teachers’ continual learning.


  The workshops will focus on educational psychology, musical excellence, and
  social justice, and will be led by world-class presenters from varying
  backgrounds. They will provide engaging and edifying material, as well as
  tangible tools that attendees can take into their classrooms and apply
  immediately.


  The major need we are responding to is the severe lack of resources put toward
  teacher development. PD for teachers is often an afterthought or only offered
  because it is a requirement. We want teachers to have a choice from a variety
  of workshops and we want them to see that we have the growth and development
  of their needs at the forefront of our mission.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Our team of educators has collectively over 30 years of teaching experience in
  educational programs in the Los Angeles area, and our time in the field has
  given us a unique perspective of how teachers can be better supported. We have
  seen how the effects of a positive and supportive environment affects learning
  and we believe that our expertise can help develop a strong backbone for other
  educators.


  Throughout our time in the field, we have built numerous curricula that have
  been implemented in multiple programs within LAUSD, reaching thousands of
  teachers and students. But, more importantly, we have met educators and
  specialists who have valuable stories to tell,  and beneficial tools to share
  with other educators; we feel that it is our responsibility to bring those
  people together so that we can all learn from them. We built Global Arts
  intentionally to ensure that educators are offered continual and impactful PD,
  and are presented by people that we know and trust in the field.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Our mission is to cultivate a community that is enjoyable, motivational, and
  time-effective so that attendees are inspired to return for multiple workshops
  and bring colleagues with them. Success for Global Arts’ Professional
  Development Workshop Program will be defined by the number and quality of
  workshops as well as the number of attendees per workshop. We will host 17
  high-quality professional workshops per academic year, and for our Pilot Year
  (beginning September 2020) we aim to have at least 30 attendees per session,
  making our annual attendance over 500. Additionally, we plan to have between
  50 and 75 attendees for our Summer Seminario.
   
  Data will be collected at the end of each workshop and the seminario through
  questionnaires. These will provide us with qualitative feedback about
  attendees’ perceived effectiveness of the workshop and their desire to return
  for future workshops. This feedback will allow us to improve upon the topics
  we present, the workshops that we host, as well as help us identify potential
  returning presenters. In addition, questionnaires will provide us with data on
  the number of attendees, attendee retention, how our number of attendees are
  growing, and how many attendees we can project to see the following year. Our
  long-term goal for measuring success will also include gathering statistics on
  the attendees effectiveness in their classrooms.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '500'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '100000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  We will establish an accessible, long-term PD program with the goal of
  improving the academic lives of the teachers and students of LAUSD. LAUSD is
  the 2nd largest school district in the nation, with 35,000 teachers and an
  average age of 45. Last year’s Teacher Strike opened the public’s eyes to the
  conditions in our school system; educators demanded development opportunities
  and conducive learning environments not only for their students, but for
  themselves and other educators. Unfortunately, nationwide, only 29% of
  teachers are highly satisfied by professional development offerings, and this
  concern trickles down as it directly affects students' learning shown by
  LAUSD’s low graduation rate of 77% and high dropout rate of 13.6%.
