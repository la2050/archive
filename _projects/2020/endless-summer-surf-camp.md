title: Endless Summer Surf Camp
project_summary: >-
  We aim to establish an annual summer surf camp for children experiencing
  residual trauma from the fire and children with developmental or physical
  disabilities. The 4-week long camp serves as surf therapy, allowing children
  to grow in their confidence and seek recovery from trauma. The camp will
  feature a final day showcasing environmental efforts to protect the beaches
  and ocean that makes this opportunity so special.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to PLAY
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Westside
  - Malibu
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Originally we started Endless Summer Surf Camp (2019) in response to the
  trauma inflicted upon our youth by the Woolsey Fire of 2018. We wanted to find
  a way for kids to connect with nature in a positive and healing manner, while
  providing a nurturing environment during the out-of-school summer months. The
  surf teachers who we work with specialize in teaching kids with autism and
  other special needs. We saw the benefits of their surf therapy for these
  children and sought to expand it to all who might need a boost of confidence
  and nature therapy. 


  This year, given the fear many kids might be experiencing right now with the
  coronavirus pandemic - we feel that hosting this camp will be more relevant
  than ever. The pandemic will likely heighten some of the trauma that children
  affected by the Woolsey Fire already suffer from. We hope that this camp will
  serve as a solace, something to look forward to during these difficult times. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Our goal as an organization is to create a resilient Malibu. Part of this
  resiliency comes in promoting the wellbeing of Malibu’s children. Many
  children suffered from the Woolsey Fire and may continue to experience the
  negative effects of this trauma, on top of current fears with the coronavirus
  pandemic.


  Malibu Foundation is uniquely suited to take on this project because we were
  built in Malibu, for Malibu. We have close connections with residents and feel
  that we have a strong understanding of community needs. We run multiple
  wellness programs (EMDR therapy, group therapy sessions, and a men's support
  group to name a few) and place mental health high in our list of priorities in
  building a resilient Malibu. We take data collection very seriously and are
  trained in the best practices of communicating with the individuals who we
  serve, in order to limit biases. We have a strong relationship with Mighty
  Underdogs - the surf instructors who would help administer the event. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  Last year we supported 120 kids through our 4-week camp. We received 100%
  positive feedback and many requests for an extension. We presented
  participants with pre and post-camp surveys and analyzed those results. Last
  summer, children, on average, reported an 83.3% decline in fear (metric on a
  scale of 1-10; instructors walked kids through the meaning of each #).
  Children, on average, also reported feeling 66.7% more confident in themselves
  and their abilities. Both children and their parents reported leaving the camp
  with a high level of enthusiasm, and a new therapeutic outlet.


  This summer, we plan to continue with this same level of reflection and data
  collection. We are working with Roots & Wings (the Institute of Social &
  Emotional Learning for the Prevention of Trauma) at the beginning of the
  summer to administer a communication training program with all of our
  instructors. This will allow instructors to better communicate with the
  children on how to reflect on their personal growth and will promote
  collection of data in an unbiased manner (addressing wellness and trauma
  recovery via pre and post program surveys). 


  We envision similar results to last summer's camp - with children growing in
  confidence and feeling some respite from the effects of trauma. We hope to
  expand the program to a greater number of participants and also incorporate an
  environmental education day to help children realize their place in protecting
  the ocean. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '200'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '400'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >+
  The ocean stimulates our physical, mental, spiritual, social and emotional
  well being. We bring the skill and build the necessary trust and then let the
  ocean do the rest. With this program, we hope to help children discover that
  they can achieve anything, including overcoming traumatic experiences. Helping
  children overcome adverse childhood experiences and trauma reduces the
  likelihood that these effects will carry over into adulthood. By inspiring
  this confidence in children, we hope they will not only find an easier road to
  trauma recovery but also gain confidence in their abilities as stewards of the
  environment. We hope to encourage a positive relationship with nature and spur
  our youth to action in protecting our oceans. 

'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  We are not submitting a collaborative proposal per se but we do have partners
  lined up to help us should we receive funding. We will hire surf instructors
  from Mighty Underdogs to administer the surf teaching. We will also hire a
  consultant from Roots & Wings to administer the program communication training
  at the beginning of the summer. Lifeguards and CPR trainers will be hired
  through LA County.

  - Host public events or gatherings
  - Communications support
