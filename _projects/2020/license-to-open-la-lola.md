Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CREATE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Since 2017, it has been difficult to mount legally-permitted, short-term
  events in the city of Los Angeles. There is no way to permit temporary indoor
  events, especially in under-utilized urban spaces, and the City’s proposed
  solutions do not quite address issues of cost and access. After the COVID-19
  pandemic and its economic fallout, what was difficult may soon become
  impossible.


  Without a process to permit temporary events, work is driven to neighboring
  cities that allow temporary indoor events or, worse, underground. The
  Superbowl (2022), World Cup (2026) and Olympic Games (2028) will bring even
  more sponsored activations that we must be prepared to handle.


  In talks with local policy makers, we’ve found that Entertainment behemoths
  enjoy great influence on regulatory decisions, but small businesses in the
  industry are a larger segment of its population with a fraction of the ability
  to contribute to economic development goals. Our program is uniquely suited to
  abate this problem.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  By embracing the connection of shared experiences and the inspiration of the
  immersive design world’s creative prowess, our program leverages the
  industry’s vanguard global event, which takes place in Los Angeles, HERE Fest
  & Summit. The Summit gathers the most influential people in this cutting edge
  industry field of entertainment, leveraging LA’s position as the industry
  capital for live entertainment.


  The HERE Institute publishes an Industry Report in the Experiential
  Entertainment sector that captures key frontline data, released at the Summit
  each year. Our program ramps up this data collection, using it to empower
  local creators year-round through our online program and monthly Town Halls.
  Additionally, HERE gathers global corporations and creators to bring their
  biggest activations to LA via a curated event series tapping its unique
  network of local policy-makers, invite-only list of creative innovators across
  Theme Parks and Entertainment, and global PR agencies.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  We have been working to achieve the following:


  Local policy: We have set out to create an Arts LA equivalent to Film LA that
  can help people navigate the cumbersome and confusing landscape of permitting.
  This will be a role within or in collaboration with our contacts at the office
  of economic development that will act as a point person (akin to internal city
  department enablers) for creators and businesses looking to create pop-up
  entertainment. The goal is consolidation of permitting processes into a single
  point of contact for LAPD/LAFD/LADBS/ABC and all other relevant offices.


  Online portal and weekly town hall events: We will establish an initiative
  that codifies a formal and easy-to-navigate process for obtaining a permit.
  This process will include a form that creates a pre-generated document that
  breaks down the specific departments required to permit any particular event.
  It will create a safe and transparent way to understand how to navigate the
  existing laws and empower producers to navigate the process for themselves. It
  will also outline new compliance regulations for live events post-pandemic.
  Local permitting agents will be provided with a variety of data to inform new
  regulations as they are placed into effect. As a result, LA’s sprawl of urban
  buildings that sit empty will be full of a trackable number of compliant
  activations.


  HERE Fest programming: The Immersive Industry Annual Report will be released
  alongside a series of HERE Fest programming that serves as the culmination of
  this year of work. Thousands of carefully selected, international Summit
  attendees and many more Festival show-goers will enjoy programming that is
  both made possible and promoting the work done by LOLA, enticing locals and
  visitors to create more work in LA.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '1000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '3000000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Long term, we seek codify a formal and easy-to-navigate process for obtaining
  permits. It will pre-generate a document that breaks down the specific
  departments required to permit any event, & creates a way to understand
  existing laws, empowering producers to navigate the process themselves &
  increasing transparency into the process. We break down what sign-offs are &
  are not needed with contacts for each step.


  Permitting becomes scalable based on nature of use, length of run & event
  capacity. While our development with the City began specific to our industry,
  we found benefit to live events, non profit fundraisers, & many other
  productions. It’s hard to track the many benefits of such a program to
  bordering areas of economic development
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-

  platforms, events, & creative programming. The HERE Summit & Festival is a
