title: Grid110 South LA
project_summary: >-
  Grid110 provides free accelerator programs (no cost/no equity taken) to early
  stage founders in Los Angeles, connecting them to a growing community of
  fellow entrepreneurs, expert mentorship, and critical resources. We’re
  expanding programs into South Los Angeles, which is primarily Black & Latinx.
  Given the mere fraction of funding/loans allocated to women and people of
  color particularly, it’s imperative that support be prioritized to
  historically marginalized communities in an effort to level the playing field
  for economic mobility.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CREATE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  73% of LA residents identify as a person of color, but our startup ecosystem
  does not reflect that. The path to success as a startup founder is starkly
  homogenous and typically attributed to access to networks, capital and
  critical resources that marginalized communities have been locked out of.
  We’re working to level the playing field and create a pathway that is more
  accessible and inclusive through our program and community development.


  South LA is home to ~20% of Los Angeles residents, where

  96% identify as Black or Latinx. We see tech and entrepreneurship as keys to
  economic mobility. Our proposed plans include launching our core programs
  South LA to support the entrepreneurs in the area, in partnership with local
  community organizations and key stakeholders. In an effort to impact as many
  entrepreneurs as possible, our goal is to reach 1,000 entrepreneurs/year
  through not only these core programs, but also events, advisor hours and
  workshops that will be open to the public.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Now in our 6th year as an organization, we have supported 146 companies
  through our core programs and thousands of entrepreneurs through free events,
  workshops and office hours. 69% of our companies are led by a female founder
  and 63% are led by a founder of color. They have gone on to raise $18M+ in
  funding and created 80+ local jobs.


  Grid110 was founded with the desire to build community where we felt one
  didn’t exist and to foster a more inclusive ecosystem for entrepreneurs to
  thrive. This mindset is embraced by every aspect of our community, from our
  team to our entrepreneurs to our partners. Additionally, our programs are
  free: no cost, no equity taken. Our mission and unique model have enabled us
  to attract and support a community of founders whether their company is
  venture scale or sustainable growth, tech or non-tech, for profit or
  non-profit. As a result, we’ve supported over 140 companies, with 69% led by
  female founders and 60% led by founders of color.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Key metrics for success that we track would be:

  * Number of companies supported through the programs and completion rate

  * Number of entrepreneurs supported through events, advisor hours and
  workshops

  * Business starts

  * Funding obtained

  * Revenue growth

  * Jobs created


  Our vision for success is to build a thriving, dynamic and inclusive
  entrepreneurship community in South LA. To increase our impact and support of
  companies year by year. To enable more entrepreneurs to get the access to
  resources, capital, mentorship and community that they need, regardless of
  where they are in the lifecycle of building their business. Traditional
  business coaching programs exist through the Business Source Centers and
  one-off events through various community organizations. We want to bring all
  of these entities together through collaboration - not competition - in order
  to create multiple touch points for the business community.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '1000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '3500'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Our core programs aim to support 30-40 companies over the course of the year,
  plus 1000 additional entrepreneurs through educational events, office hours,
  and other community building activities. The South LA region has very limited
  resources for tech/tech enabled businesses, which we believe have the ability
  to be economic equalizers. By providing mentorship, community, support, access
  to funding and other key resources, we believe we can empower entrepreneurs to
  create sustainable businesses, new jobs and generational wealth. The success
  of these companies will create bring capital infusion into the area. We
  anticipate that for each entrepreneur directly served, we will be able to
  impact 3.5 additional people (staff, family, community).
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  We believe strongly in the power of community partners and would not be where
  we are today without them. We currently have several formal and informal
  established partnerships (Office of Mayor Eric Garcetti being our primary
  partner) as well as several in discussions for South LA, but we are submitting
  this proposal as an individual organization. 
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Access to the LA2050 community
  - Communications support
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.: ''
Which metrics will your submission impact?:
  - Minority- and women-owned businesses
  - High-growth startups
  - Venture capital investment
Are there any other LA2050 goal categories that your proposal will impact?:
  - LA is the best place to LEARN
  - LA is the best place to CONNECT
Has your proposal changed due to COVID-19?: >
  We have completed 13 accelerator cohorts in person over the past 5 years in
  Downtown LA, but at the onset of LA’s Safer At Home orders in mid-March,
  physically meeting in person became impossible. We made the immediate decision
  to take our programs virtual for the Spring sessions, which kicked off in
  early April. We have been able to successfully pivot to an online program
  model, while still offering the same curriculum, resources and support for our
  entrepreneurs.


  With this experience, we remain confident in our original proposal as it
  stands given our abilities to launch the proposed South LA programs in part or
  entirely as an online program this summer (if necessary). This also extends to
  events, office hours and other community focused efforts we plan to run
  alongside the programs. In the event we’re able to host our events and
  programs in person, we have already secured an incredible partner in Vector90,
  a South LA based coworking space and cultural hub. 


  We have the opportunity to rebuild our city much more equitably than many
  would have ever thought possible. In order for that to happen we have to
  provide under-resourced communities with the same quality of guidance and
  mentorship available to wealthier communities. Without this, we are
  constraining our city to rebuild to the same economic disparities. Grid110
  expanding to South LA takes aim at this challenge head on in mission and in
  practice.
