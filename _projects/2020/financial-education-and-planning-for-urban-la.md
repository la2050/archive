title: Financial education and planning for urban LA
project_summary: >-
  This grant will help grow and solidify the launch of BlueReef. As a new
  start-up, we face many challenges in terms of technology, education platforms,
  HR and overhead, which has become increasingly difficult in the new COVID-19
  financial environment. Our goal is to reach as many small business owners and
  households in need of financial guidance, with a focus on the Hispanic
  community and beyond. Our focus is on short-term action as our financial lives
  have recently changed with the loss of jobs, savings, etc., as well as long
  term planning.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CREATE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Hispanics account for nearly 16% of the U.S. population which is approximately
  52 million people. In the US there are about 86,278 certified CFP 
  professionals (financial planners) but less than 2%(1725 nationwide) of them
  are Latinos which translates into a severely underserved community in terms of
  financial advice. Locally, there are approximately 4.9 million Hispanic
  residents in LA County, that number represents almost half of the entire
  county's population. How many of them have access to relevant financial
  institutions? Who is willing to provide quality and competitive financial
  advice that in many cases is a privilege for certain groups?This project will
  help us fast-track our reach to small Hispanic business owners. We would like
  to give them the right tools and plan to create financial stability, manage
  risk and conserve any wealth and jobs created.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  We have 3 unique characteristics that make us believe we could make a large
  impact. First, between the two founding members of BlueReef, we have over 30
  years of experience in financial planning for businesses and families,
  mortgage and credit lending, risk management, tax planning, and financial
  products. Secondly, we see the needs of the community as we are both Hispanic
  and one an East LA native. We have been around long enough to understand the
  needs and find areas in which we can make a bigger impact through financial
  education and empowerment which translates into personal and community
  wellbeing. Lastly, we understand the work involved in growing a small business
  and can relate to the needs of our audience. We believe this project is more
  valid now than ever before, with an ever-changing world we are experiencing
  financial challenges that without the right preparation could cause much pain
  in our communities. Education and planning is the key to long term stability. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  Although our project has medium to long term benefits, the short term metrics
  of success are going to be measured in terms of:


  1) Number educational financial seminars and webinars throughout LA

  2) Educational content downloaded from our website

  3) The number of financial plans created per year. These plans include advice
  on wealth protection, emergency savings, investments, lending, insurance and
  in some cases tax planning

  4) Yearly follow up to make sure plans is in place and in full execution


  For us, success is to see businesses and families thrive and grow even in
  tough times like the one we are living now.

Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: ''
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >
  Our direct impact is going to be on the population being served. Hispanics
  make-up half of the LA County  and improving their lives, as well as anyone
  that would benefit from our offerings, will have a significant impact on the
  future of their local economy. 

  Financial education is a key component to get ahead in our communities, from
  simple knowledge on personal credit management, life insurance to protect our
  loved ones, a home mortgage or long term investments these are all important
  areas that are part of our daily lives We’ve have seen over the years how
  though the right planning wealth and safety is created, and this is exactly
  what we would like to replicate at a larger scale with the help of technology.
