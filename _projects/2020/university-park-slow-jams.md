title: University Park Slow Jams
project_summary: >-
  Every year LA’s streets are becoming less safe for people who walk, especially
  children. University Park Slow Jams is a creative call to action for safer
  streets. The project builds a network of local advocates—groups, schools,
  parents, youth—to draw attention to traffic violence, build capacity, and
  propose solutions. Slow Jams are a multifaceted education, engagement, and
  leadership development strategy that enable local stakeholders to participate
  in creative public acts; document safety conditions; and take action to
  achieve street safety.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to PLAY
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Western. Normandie. Vermont. Hoover. Figueroa. In the University Park area
  these streets all have something in common: they are the sites of far too many
  tragic, preventable deaths. Between 2015-19, according to LADOT seven people
  died walking, one person died biking, and five people died driving in the
  area. All these streets are part of the High Injury Network: streets where a
  disproportionate number of injuries and fatalities occur. 


  The danger is particularly acute for children ages 5-14, for whom motor
  vehicle collisions are the leading cause of death. In an area where there are
  more than 10 schools, and 6,000 students use these roadways daily, building
  awareness and advocacy for safer streets is a matter of life and death.
  Municipal resources have been sorely lacking. Language and cultural barriers,
  a lack of understanding how to navigate systems, and time limitations inhibit
  action. Without intervention, training and network building, more lives are at
  unnecessary risk.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Transforming the culture of traffic safety in University Park requires a
  special kind of alchemy. Public Matters possesses a unique skill set to meet
  the challenge: art, civic engagement, education, community building, project
  design and implementation. We are fluent across sectors, disciplines,
  languages, cultures and generations. We have a strong record of collaborating
  with residents, agencies and decision-makers, bringing together institutions
  and informal groups of varied scale. Our partners LA Walks, USC Kid Watch and
  USC faculty strengthen our engagement ecosystem.

  Slow Jams, created by Public Matters in 2017, are more than just the street
  spectacle of giant props, music and playful messaging about a serious issue.
  They tap into human impulses for creative expression and collaboration, and
  transform the effort into meaningful, hands-on exchange & idea generation
  among participants of different backgrounds and expertise. They build a
  collective capacity to create change together.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  To improve students’ sense of safety and improve opportunities for walking and
  biking, the project needs to provide concrete opportunities for constructive
  critique and improvements to the built environment. Moreover, residents need
  to develop the skills, acumen and political agency to effect change. This
  requires creating meaningful opportunities for local stakeholders to learn
  about and inform traffic safety conversations in their neighborhood through
  direct interactions with decision-makers. 


  To achieve this, we will:

  >> Increase participants’ knowledge of traffic safety, with the goal of
  improving participants’ safety. 

  >> Gather and aggregate data rich stories and maps through qualitative and
  quantitative methods to communicate the area’s safety conditions.  

  >> Train parents, students, and partners in methods used by traffic engineers
  and transportation planners to improve streets and intersections through
  workshops and community conversations.

  >> Build relationships among project partners that can support increased
  advocacy beyond the grant period.

  >> Create opportunities for parents and students to engage in dialogue with
  transportation officials, decision-makers, or elected representatives,
  regarding traffic safety conditions and the impact of current street
  conditions.


  We will conduct initial and end-of-project surveys and build relationships
  throughout the project that lead to constructive, sustained dialogue,
  problem-solving, and opportunities for emergent leadership.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '505'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '30350'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Creating safer streets requires behavioral change, education, advocacy, and
  changes to the built environment. No one element is sufficient by itself. The
  broader impact of Slow Jams is the human architecture that can carry work
  forward over the long term.


  This flexible network of 100 parents, 375 students, and 30
  teachers/administrators from multiple schools has the possibility to create a
  local multiplier effect. Each student, parent, participant becomes a traffic
  safety advocate, sharing their learning with others—family members, friends,
  neighbors—influencing these individuals’ ability to shape policy, or to simply
  be aware of their behavior on the area's shared roads: roads that more than
  27,000 drivers use daily.  
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  Public Matters will lead the design and implementation of all elements,
  managing partnerships and the delivery of project objectives.


  LA Walks is a design partner and co-facilitator. They will train and supervise
  walk auditors and work with parent groups to train them on traffic safety
  techniques, behaviors, and avenues for advocacy.


  USC Kid Watch, our neighborhood experts, will link the team with parents and
  partners schools. They will play a critical role in establishing trust between
  partners and residents, and convening Community Conversations, Slow Jams and
  Walk Audits. 


  Professors Francois Bar, David Sloane, additional faculty and student groups,
  will assist with external partnerships and coordinate USC involvement in all
  aspects of the project.

  - 'Office space for meetings, events, or for staff'
  - Network building
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.:
  - Los Angeles Walks
  - USC Kid Watch
  - Individual Faculty at the University of Southern California

  - Walking and biking
  - Prevalence of trauma and adverse childhood experiences
  - Students' sense of safety at and on the way to school

  - LA is the best place to CREATE
  - LA is the best place to CONNECT
  - LA is the healthiest place to LIVE
Has your proposal changed due to COVID-19?: >
  Our proposal remains vitally important. Traffic safety is an essential
  challenge for University Park and has in fact become more urgent due to the
  pandemic. Local pedestrians and cyclists are at increased danger since we
  submitted our proposal. In 2019, roughly 11 Los Angeles pedestrians were
  killed a month (128 total). In May 2020 alone, 21 pedestrians were killed (LA
  Times, 14 May 2020). The primary reason is drivers are driving much faster due
  to reduced traffic under the stay-at-home order. Driver behavior has changed;
  unfortunately, not for the better. People who walk, bike and roll are also
  using streets differently due to COVID-19, for physical distancing and outdoor
  recreation. Traffic safety will remain a serious problem.


  _We propose these changes:_


  * Social distancing for many has meant social isolation. We will enhance the
  project’s digital mapping and communication products for community
  mobilization, education, training, and to promote social cohesion.

  * We will train participants to use technology in new ways. This builds the
  capacity of parents and children, while addressing the digital divide exposed
  by COVID-19.

  * The public spectacle component of Slow Jams is part of a larger effort to
  build community capacity to advocate for safe streets. We will adapt public
  performances and events, practicing safe distancing. These may resemble the
  proposed choreography, or may require more static props, such as yard signs
  and human billboards along the sides of streets.
