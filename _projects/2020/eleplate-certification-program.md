title: elePlate Certification Program
project_summary: >-
  Our core service is the elePlate certification, which we provide to companies
  that work with us to successfully turn their kitchens into zero food waste
  operations. We start by assessing their current kitchen practices for waste
  and then create a customized sustainability plan that takes our partners
  through source reduction, food recycling and food donation. Proceeds from our
  certification program are used to fund the logistics required to scale our
  food recovery efforts and feed more people in need.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >
  LA has one of the largest populations of any county in the US. One-fifth of
  our population - nearly two million people - is food insecure, yet we throw
  away 30-40% of fresh food. We could feed everyone with that surplus. 


  These statistics are from before COVID-19 began sweeping through our county
  and nation. This pandemic has further revealed the devastating chasms that
  exist between those who have access to food and resources, and those who do
  not. COVID-19 has not only disproportionately affected those who already lack
  access to basic resources, but also, in many cases, the restaurants and staff
  who choose to donate their food to those individuals each day. 


  The stakes to drastically scale food recovery logistics have never been
  higher.


  While the current trend is to charge the donor to accomplish this goal, we
  created the elePlate model to provide a financially sustainable path towards
  funding free food recovery for any business that wants to donate.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >
  This project will become elePlate’s primary program and is the backbone of our
  organization. It provides the foundation we need to grow our impact and solve
  food insecurity once and for all in Los Angeles.


  Bryan previously served as the CEO of a food recovery organization and is a
  member of the LAFPC Food Waste and Prevention Working Group. He’s become
  intimately aware of the logistical roadblocks to scaling food recovery while
  learning from people working to solve all sides of this challenge: restaurant
  owners, managers, and employees; drivers; recipient organizations; and program
  participants that rely on the food.


  Kate has spent her time in LA committed to bettering her community through
  mentorship, animal rescue, food recovery, and a full-time job making higher
  education more accessible.


  In 2019, Bryan and Kate combined their business experience and passion for
  their community to cofound elePlate, with the mission of creating a solution
  that accounts for everyone involved.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Success is scaling county-wide in two years, and (1) having a profound impact
  on the food insecure community, (2) saving restaurants money, and (3) alerting
  consumers to this widespread issue.


  As with any organization, success hinges on the strength of our relationships.
  We are fortunate that despite elePlate still being in its early stages of
  development, before COVID-19 became widespread we had already begun to build
  partnerships and collaborations with well-established restaurants and
  companies. Of course, the landscape now is ever-evolving; businesses that we
  have aimed to work with since starting elePlate may shift their business
  models entirely as we emerge from this pandemic. 


  Before COVID-19, only a small portion of businesses were willing to pay to
  perform a charitable act; today with their own businesses hurting immensely
  that number will be even lower. But here is what we guarantee remains the
  same: Businesses looking ahead will have no choice but streamline their
  operations more than ever before. Beyond the challenges presented with
  COVID-19, California law SB1383, which requires food recovery programs for all
  restaurants, goes into effect in 2022. 


  elePlate offers the opportunity to accomplish both goals—save money and comply
  with the law—in advance of that deadline. How? The answer is simple: by
  improving food businesses' bottom lines. We ensure every business we work with
  becomes more profitable by becoming more sustainable. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '20000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '100000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Future of City: Access to healthy food is a human right. Our city has failed
  to provide this to its citizens. To change that, we need to rescue and divert
  food to every community in LA. 


  Right now, we have local nonprofits doing their best while relying solely on
  grants and donations, and larger organizations charging donors. These
  solutions are not scalable or sustainable. 


  Our system will end commercial food waste at the source, save thousands, and
  boost sales. This value allows us to generate revenue and unlock financially
  sustainable food recovery growth across LA. 


  We can reach every neighborhood, ensuring no one goes hungry. In turn, they
  can tackle other challenge areas: homelessness, unemployment, and physical and
  mental health.
