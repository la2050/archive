title: Using Stories to Create Community for Under-resourced Groups
project_summary: >-
  To realize our mission of enriching the lives of underserved Angelenos,
  especially seniors, recent immigrants and the homebound, we need to directly
  reach and receive the endorsement of decision makers at relevant
  organizations. Financial support will also help fund tailored programs for
  these groups, including specific courses, ancillary content and instructional
  videos. Finally, to sustain the program after the project period, we will
  train staff and volunteers in technological and programmatic elements so they
  can operate independently.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >
  LiteraTea delivers story sharing and writing instruction at scale while
  building a supportive community with profiles, member matching, live chats and
  workshops. Ad and spam free, the site is supported by low, possibly subsidized
  subscriptions. 
   
  1.8 million older adults live in LA , of whom ~30% report being lonely, which
  can cause harms on par with smoking or inactivity. Similarly, 10% of the
  county reports serious difficulty leaving home, and 54% speak languages other
  than English. Given these magnitudes and existing services, we hope to supply
  a marginal, positive service to these communities with tailored content and
  specific outreach programs. 
   
  LiteaTea's infrastructure can accommodate thousands of simultaneous users; the
  content needs to be expanded. For example, we would translate our proven tools
  into their languages, and we would create new modules, like memoir, for
  seniors. To do so, we need to recruit experts and influencers from these
  groups  into our community. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >
  This project would increase LA area organizations' awareness and use of
  LiteraTea. In doing so, it will let us leverage our existing platform with
  tailored content and underscore how virtual community can complement existing
  services to accommodate these under-resourced groups. 
   
  LiteraTea, a self-financed startup, is led by Celeste Davidson and Adam Simon,
  who have combined their talents to build a unique website. Celeste oversees
  content and instruction, being an award-winning, best selling author. and a
  certified teacher in Secondary English. She als has a USC MBA and is an Ed
  Tech PhD student.
   
  Adam runs the technology and operations. He is a political science PhD. with
  two books and many peer-reviewed articles, who has spent twenty years
  researching community and citizenship while teaching at UCLA, University of
  Washington and Yale. He also began writing computer code in third grade,
  attending MIT, before graduating UCLA in Communications.  
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >2-
   
  LiteraTea's mission began when we witnessed the devastating effects that
  social isolation and diminished agency caused in our own families, the result
  of chronic illness and age-related lack of mobility. Our backgrounds in
  education, publishing, business and technology, helped us imagine and build a
  bold enterprise: a supportive online platform where a diverse group of
  Angelenos could confidently express themselves, learn from, and connect with
  others through stories.  
   
  This project would see LiteraTea become an infrastructure for interventions
  that address the needs of underserved groups: partly by producing new lessons
  and videos tailored to specific needs. For example, we could work with senior
  organizations to develop content on memoir, by leveraging the site's existing
  architecture and ease of use, as well as LiteraTea's unique, pedagogically
  cutting-edge, scaffolding tools. Veterans’ groups may incorporate specific
  writing prompts and host live video workshops that serve therapeutic goals.
  School enrichment programs may focus on cooperative writing or practice for
  English language learners. 
   
  Our first measures of success will include institutional and individual member
  numbers, hours spent on the site, and other specifics such as the number and
  quality of stories as well as the number and depth of intramember
  interactions. In all, we see success as a vibrant community of people
  connecting with each other, learning from and enjoying stories, so they feel
  more empowered, connected and happy. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '450'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '27000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >
  LiteraTea is an excellent resource for data collection among constituent
  populations via content analysis, surveys and polls. This data could help
  assess the needs of individuals within these groups, and, ultimately, inform
  Los Angeles area policy decisions. 


  Additionally, the scalable nature of this platform makes it extensible to
  organizations and individuals nationally, and internationally.  English is the
  world’s most influential language in terms of academia and business, spoken by
  three-quarters of the world’s population, with 949 million internet users.
  LiteraTea could serve as a platform for English language development, and both
  intercultural and intracultural understanding through stories, the “currency
  of human interaction”.
