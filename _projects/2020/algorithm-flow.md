title: Algorithm & Flow
project_summary: >-
  Algorithm & Flow, a Faithworks Compton program, aims to diversify the tech
  industry by training the next generation of urban computer scientists. We
  teach game development, web development and the Java programming language to
  Black and Latino youth in South Los Angeles. We intentionally provide
  relatable instructors and teaching models that reflect the culture and
  ethnicity of our students. We created a model that offers a pathway to high
  paying careers that can shift the life trajectory of a student, his/her family
  and the community at large.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  I, Kwesi Davis, spent 15 years, at DreamWorks Animation, in the production
  Pipeline Engineering group. Being African American, I saw very few people that
  looked like me. I did not see many Black or Latino men or women in my STEM
  classes at university. Even thinking back to high school, it was difficult to
  find students with similar cultural and ethnic backgrounds that were
  passionate about STEM. I became interested in computer graphics programming
  because of my mentor Prof. Andries van Dam; the co-founder of SIGGRAPH. My
  sustained interest in tech, has resulted in extraordinary privilege and
  opportunity in my professional life. I founded Algorithm & Flow, with the
  nonprofit FaithWorks Compton, to spark interests in the field of Computer
  Science and to train the next generation of computer programmers. I know it
  can be done because I have a supportive network of STEM related professionals
  that are investing time and resources to make this work.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  I am an African American man that received an Electrical Engineering degree
  from Brown University; an Ivy League institution. I studied computer graphics
  under the mentorship of Professor Andy van Dam. Prof. van Dam is the author of
  Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice, a seminal text in the field of
  graphics. I also studied film and video media production, at New York
  University’s Tisch School of the Arts, under the mentorship of Professor Spike
  Lee. 


  Over a span of 20 years, I applied my media and technology training toward a
  career in 3D video games and feature animation; which includes 3D Animation
  Pipeline Engineering tools for the Shrek, Madagascar, Kung Fu Panda and How to
  Train Your Dragon franchise films. In recent months, I have conducted STEM
  workshops to middle school children with Digital Dragon and mentored high
  school students through the Algorithm & Flow program.  


  I am living proof to youth that they can become successful and significant
  computer scientists.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Our goal is to teach young people fundamental software development techniques.
  In the short term, at a minimum, students need to be able to declare &
  concatenate strings, declare & initialize a variable to a numerical value,
  increment that value by some arbitrary amount, know the relational operators
  (equal to, not equal to, greater than, less than, greater than or equal to &
  less than or equal to), know the logical operators (And, Or & Not), construct
  an If-statement, construct a For-loop, populate & iterate an array, define &
  call a function, define & instantiate a class object and finally compile &
  execute a Java application. Absolutely every student will possess these basic
  skills at the end of the program.


  Our long term goal is to enjoy the continued participation of our students
  across the span of their high school academic career. We want to instill, in
  them, the confidence required to sit for the AP Computer Science A exam. This
  AP exam is an indicator of who will study coding in college and go on to
  pursue a professional career in STEM.


  To measure our success, we will monitor six indicators identified by The
  National Academy of Science Engineering and Medicine: 

  1. time spent learning

  2. material used (see Common Core State Standards for Mathematics and AP
  Computer Science A)

  3. depth of topic coverage

  4. teacher expertise

  5. tests scores & project completion

  (See question 12 for more details.)

  The sixth metric relates to documenting and sharing program findings; which we
  will also do.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '60'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '17400'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Question 12 Explanation

  Many people are familiar with anthropologist Robin Dunbar’s magic number: 150.
  This number describes the maximum amount of meaningful relationships a person
  can manage. Today, due to the power of social media, researchers believe this
  number has risen to 290 meaningful relationships. Our proposal serves 60
  students. So, 60 students times 290 meaningful relationships suggests 17,400
  people could be indirectly impacted by high wage earning STEM students exiting
  our program.


  Bold Vision

  We expect and anticipate the next Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Gwynne Shotwell
  and Kimberly Bryant will emerge gloriously from Algorithm & Flow as next-gen
  leaders in STEM and innovation with the power to influence billions of lives.
