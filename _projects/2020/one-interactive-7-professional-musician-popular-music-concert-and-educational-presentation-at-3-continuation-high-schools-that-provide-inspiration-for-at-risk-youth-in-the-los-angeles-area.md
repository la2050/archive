Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CREATE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - San Gabriel Valley
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South Bay
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: "We go directly into the classroom or small courtyards. Selections include original as well as traditional Blues compositions of the 1900's. Material describes current life in LA. Three educational prompts are mailed.  Students are coached and encouraged to join the ensemble with instrumental accompaniment on rock & roll or “free-style” or “flow” Rap. Signs are held up so that the names can be remembered; those who remember 10-things that we talk about win a harmonica;\nWe will reach approximately 300 “last-chance” students. They are in dire need of our care and inspiration. The program directly affects the lives of the students and their families, by bringing art, communication, and camaraderie in school to those who are at risk of falling prey to negative situations.\n          \tClassroom as well as neighborhood art alliances and friendships arise. These include singing, poetry, instrumental and poetry appreciation, and amateur performing groups"
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: "Since 1986 we have performed 550-concerts in schools and detention facilities connecting with over 41,000 at-risk youth, essentially one-at-a-time. Opportunities to perform and compose simple songs are strongly encouraged. During each concert, music is paused in order to describe the origins of the musical instruments, the elemental mechanics, the inventors, and some famous contemporary players.    \n     \tThe LA County Arts Commission became our first sponsor in 1986. The Musicians Union Local #47 (LA) and the Recording Industries Music Performance Fund (NY) continue to give us annual co-sponsor allocations that cover 35% of our musician’s concert wages.  We received 3-year Cal Arts Council (CAC) Multi-Cultural Entry Level grants in 1995, ’98 and 2001, and an Impact grant in 2004; their Exemplary Arts Education Partnership Grant greatly expanded our separate acoustic lecture visits. The City of LA Department of Cultural Affairs has funded our program since 1991. \n"
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  3-questionnaires are given to the Principals to be returned to SNB. They
  simply ask: a) the music styles perceived, and the instrument names that are
  remembered, b) the % increase in social, verbal, student, and song
  interactions, and c) for a 2/3-page essay describing what was remembered from
  the lecture and/or concert. After analysis of the data, they will be forwarded
  to the sponsoring organization. They show us what musical concepts are
  understood and favored, and then we adjust the concert set lists accordingly.
  Students and staff complete them in their own hand, giving much thought to the
  process.  Melodies, lyrics, instruments, and artists that they may not have
  been aware of are now “in the mix”. In the past, drawings of instruments &
  musical notes, names of songs and raps/poetry appear with the answers. Three
  weeks after the concert we also mail our follow-up Creative Student Tracking
  (CST) survey that asks about performer-students and their art study plans,
  along with a printed referral list. We give written referral letters of
  recommendation accordingly. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '325'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '900'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >
  The impact of this grant will inspire, motivate, and educate young people by
  direct contact with musicians and live popular music.  Referrals will be
  systematically updated and sent in the ensuing months.  We will also give a
  file of our 38-page Music History/Theory Handbook to each school; there are
  simple and innovative extensions to our program within.  

  We provide a type of popular therapeutic music, which affects peers and
  families’ lives and their views of the future. Students who perform with SNB
  become celebrities. Resultant interest in music, role models, poetry,
  language, dance and movement are clearly apparent.  We perform a vital program
  of fostering art as well as social harmony and productivity in our young
  student’s lives.
