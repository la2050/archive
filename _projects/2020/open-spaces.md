title: Open Spaces
project_summary: >-
  This grant will support our Open Spaces project, allowing us to sponsor 50
  community college students with a stable place to live, learn, and grow. Open
  Spaces fosters partnerships with college student housing programs to reimagine
  the use of their vacant dorm rooms to provide stability to community college
  students experiencing housing insecurity. Supportive programs such as academic
  mentorship, tutoring, and job readiness will get students to self-sufficiency,
  and equip them with tools for success both inside and outside of the
  classroom.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  1 in 5 of LA’s community college students are facing housing insecurity &
  homelessness. The cost of living in LA, lack of affordable housing, and
  insufficient financial aid that's $7000 short in covering living expenses, has
  pushed vulnerable students out of college. Take Anna for example, a
  first-generation freshman who’d come to campus carrying with her the hopes &
  dreams of her family. Two-thirds into the semester, her professor noticed a
  pattern of absences and, out of concern, contacted my office. Anna had been
  living between a friend’s couch and a homeless shelter. I connected her to
  emergency resources, but it was too late. Anna failed all of her courses and
  lost her financial aid. As a result, Anna dropped out this semester. This is
  the outcome we’re hoping to prevent. We must get our students from couch
  surfing & living in cars to housing stability, thriving in college &
  graduation. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Our strategy is focused on maximizing efficiency on college campuses. Many
  dorms operate at less than 100% occupancy, leaving hundreds of rooms vacant
  each year. We’ll enter into agreements with colleges to reimagine the use of
  their open spaces to house community college students experiencing
  homelessness. In LA, students are often unable to access city/county
  resources, and shelters lack capacity. Our unique model could rapidly scale;
  and our interventions are evidence-based & student-centered. Our team has the
  expertise to execute this strategy. Sam Prater has 13 years experience as a
  college housing professional; he will guide the development of residential
  communities to meet academic & personal goals of students in spaces we
  operate. Andres Cantero is a real estate attorney with skillful negotiation
  experience with campuses & property owners. Our approach has gained traction;
  we've secured a partnership with LA Community College District to pilot this
  program with their students.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >+
  The success indicators for this program will be measured against these three
  primary goals:


  1) To provide housing for at least 50 students experiencing homelessness &
  housing insecurity.

  2) To equip students with the tools to gain self-sufficiency.

  3) To set students up with academic support and resources needed to stay in
  college.


  We envision our project’s success by achieving these goals:


  a.) Collaborating with local community college staff persons tasked with
  administering basic needs services to connect their students in need to the
  support LARNB provides.  We will house 50 students for the 2020-2021 academic
  school year through these outreach efforts;

  b) Teaching life & social skills that empower students to make sound
  interpersonal and career choices that will enable them to secure permanent
  housing upon completion of the program;

  c) Connecting students to available resources on their college campus and
  within the community to support their social, emotional, health and wellness
  needs; and 

  d) Tracking each student’s progress including enrollment record (e.g., GPA)
  and degree progress and development of academic plans for each semester.


  To measure the success of our program’s goals and aims, student participants
  will complete a pre- and post-assessment evaluation to obtain data that
  includes, current housing status, readiness for self-sufficiency, GPA,
  retention from one semester to the next, etc. These assessments will guide
  LARNB’s supportive services to students, track their individual growth, and
  our overall impact. We will know our project is successful when we can offer
  viable & affordable housing options for students with programming which builds
  life skills that promote financial planning and security, academic mentorship
  in support of a career, and interpersonal skills to navigate life’s
  challenges. Success is realized when we give students like Anna the tools to
  live out their full potential. 

Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '50'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: ''
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  One of the broader impacts of our proposal is in the local economy. The
  California Budget & Policy Center forecasts a deficit of 1 million
  college-educated workers by 2030. We understand that failure to end student
  homelessness & promote community college completion will not only impact
  individuals & families, but also the economic vitality of our region,
  especially poor communities. We will address this deficit by ensuring the 20%
  of community college students facing homelessness & housing insecurity have
  their basic needs met, thus allowing students to focus on graduating. This
  ensures they won't need this kind of support in the future since a college
  degree is related to success in the job market. LA’s vitality depends on local
  talent.
