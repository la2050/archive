title: Halt Smart Parking System
project_summary: >-
  We are seeking resources to complete our operating system called haltOS- the
  future operating system for a smart connected city. Since Halt is a company
  focused on necessity -based innovation rather that aspirational-based
  innovation; our meter's run on a completely redesigned & dynamic operating
  system.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  1. 

  Currently the parking system adopted by cities are not designed to scale.

  Even more importantly, technology products adopted by cities have no form of
  unified system to sustain their longevity. 


  That all changes with Halt; 

  The Halt smart meter is based on a fully operating system with analytics and
  metrics to assist in reducing congestion in cities, offering city WiFi to city
  residents , and even serving as more sources of revenue for cities.


  Additionally the Smart meter is capable of displaying amber alerts, critical
  city wide information, and even allows residents to dial 911 from the meter. 


  Minority business will also be able to benefit from Halt.


  In it's idle state, the meter is capable of displaying a diverse array of
  advertisements depending on time of day. During the day, the meter can
  recommend great food spots, while at night it can recommend more low-key spots
  to checkout.


  In this vein; the needs we address are safely, connectivity, ease of access
  and convenience.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  This project is necessary because of the several new features and technologies
  integrate into the market. Assisting the city in not only boosting revenue,
  but also having all the tools and necessary analytics to design cities more
  efficiently, protect the needs of residents, as well as deploy scalable
  tech-infrastructure are what's necessary to connecting with residents and
  gaining trust.


  What the coronavirus taught our organization is that we were ahead of the
  curve as a technological solution.


  98.7% of city infrastructure and public displays (screens, food menu's, gas
  stations) require people to physically make contact with the technology, using
  technologies.


  With our technology, we are able to enforce touch-less prompts and experiences
  while protecting the overall health of residents.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Our goal is to help the city be ahead of the curve. To assist the city in
  creating a unified system where essential necessity-based deployable
  technologies can communicate with each other. 


  Once these devices can communicate with each other, they can be widely
  leverage to improve how we think of such systems during infrastructural
  development, connectivity and even landscaping.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '5000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '10000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Over 30% of the cities land is dedicated to parking. With the halt smart
  meter, we have features such as on street validation. Where residents can
  visit affiliate partners and redeem parking points to validate their
  sessions. 


  Instead of building more garages, Halt is about building on top of what we
  already have therefore saving the city with a lot of space.


  We also will impact minority owned businesses by being able to give their
  businesses exposure from the meters.


  Lastly, Halt only gets better with time due to our OTA updates; updates can be
  dynamically pushed to the meters therefore drastically increasing longevity.
