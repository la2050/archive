title: The Music Center’s Dance DTLA
project_summary: >-
  Following COVID-19, The Music Center will relaunch its programming through
  Dance DTLA, a series of diverse dance engagements featuring live music, DJ
  sets, and dance instruction. Beginning with virtual dance parties and dance
  instruction, by mid-summer Dance DTLA will transition to our Plaza where
  Angelenos can participate in-person or virtually. These engagements will help
  our communities recover from social isolation by providing Angelenos from all
  demographic, economic and social backgrounds outlets for connection,
  expression, and exchange.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  COVID-19 has resulted in mass cancellation of artistic programs. Dance DTLA
  will play an important role in returning LA to normalcy after our prolonged
  social isolation and responding to the need for Angelenos to engage in the
  arts. Given our 15-year history of connecting Angelenos through dance, many of
  whom are eager for this dance season to resume, it’s important that we respond
  by relaunching and adapting our offerings to fill the voids left by the
  current climate. Dance DTLA is also an entryway for new participants of all
  ages and backgrounds, dancers and non-dancers alike. This is especially true
  due to the declining performing arts attendance. According to the Irvine
  Foundation, this decline is partly due to people from diverse communities
  having historically not felt welcomed at cultural venues, as well as facing
  barriers such as cost and travel time. This is significant because arts
  engagement has been shown to bridge the gap between social, demographic, and
  economic lines.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  The Music Center is Los Angeles’ largest performing arts center, welcoming
  over 1.7 million visitors across its multiple venues annually. Shifting its
  focus towards community engagement and inclusivity —priorities solidified with
  the hiring of nationally-known arts engagement expert Josephine Ramirez — The
  Music Center continues to offer numerous free and low-cost programming from
  large-scale dance parties and concerts to art making workshops in order to
  redefine its spaces for new audiences. Given our history, rapport with
  communities, and judicious financial planning, we are poised to bounce back
  from COVID-19 and reinstate programming. We have the space, resources, and
  social capital to be an inclusive convener of all constituents, sharing
  information, as well as bringing together people. We also have the technology
  to elevate the program into the 21st century including the live streaming
  capabilities to engage thousands of dancers from home.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: "The Music Center envisions a festive series of dance engagement both on the Plaza and digitally throughout the summer and into the fall.  We will measure success based on the following assessments:\n*\tAudience turn-out: We anticipate serving at least 20,000 community participants (10,000 community participants on the Plaza and 10,000 community participants digitally)\n*\tAudience Satisfaction & Knowledge via Surveys: In-person and online surveys will assess participant experience as well as demographics\n*\tProduction of diverse and eclectic content: The Music Center will provide an eclectic range of dance genres that highlights the diversity of Los Angeles (Salsa, Funk, Reggaeton, etc.)\n\nTo help The Music Center remain in the vanguard of innovation in serving the public and creating relevant dance programming, we also hope to discover and assess through our surveys: \na) the impact of this new engagement during a time when the need for engagement has increased\nb) how social distancing has impacted an art form – in this case, dance and dancing socially – which typically has been practiced in relatively close social contact; and \nc) how physical distancing has changed our relationship to public space resulting in newly adopted behaviors in public built environments."
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '20000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '0'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Following the COVID-19 pandemic, The Music Center will help communities
  recover, reconnecting them with each other and with the arts. Through
  meaningful arts engagement, we will foster empowered citizens who are
  essential to a healthy civil society and a thriving democracy. We will
  reactivate the Plaza as a space where people can both see and express
  themselves, their communities and their cultures in public performances and
  exhibitions.   The Music Center will be recognized as a welcomed
  community-convening space where dialogue and interaction occur regularly.
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  Teaching artist-partners will work with The Music Center through the planning
  and execution of both the online and in-person dance engagements. They will
  provide instruction, perform online and on-stage, as well as provide music.


  The League of Women Voters will set up booths on the Plaza to help attendees
  register for voting and is also looking to pilot online endeavors with The
  Music Center in support of voter registration. The Los Angeles County
  Registrar will assist these voting initiatives by providing voter registration
  workshops for volunteers who will also be working alongside the League of
  Women Voters.


  Lastly, we expect collaboration in the form of financial support from past
  funders including Bank of America and the Korean Cultural Center.
