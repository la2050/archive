  PLUS ME Project will empower LA by providing the opportunity to CONNECT
  through the art of storytelling. Our team will recruit diverse adult
  volunteers and coordinate classroom visits throughout LA for them to share
  their stories with middle and high school students. We will host monthly story
  building training sessions for our volunteers and organize quarterly
  storytelling mixers where volunteers, students, and the public will have the
  opportunity to interact, inspire, and listen to each other's stories.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Human connection is a necessity. Unfortunately, loneliness rates are on the
  rise. According to Cigna in 2020, at least 61% of adults in America feel
  disconnected, isolated, or alone.


  We believe the best way to respond to this dilemma is to embrace the art of
  storytelling and help LA connect with each other through their own stories. We
  have more in common than we realize. We are resilient beings. That's why, we
  believe it is important for us to provide space and resources to help humans
  inspire each other with their own wisdom. 


  By mobilizing hundreds of volunteers in our communities to craft their stories
  and share them with youth throughout our city, we are providing the
  opportunity for adults to share their life experiences and teenagers the
  opportunity to learn and connect with new positive role models. 


  Our goal is to ensure more adults and teens in LA feel less alone by unlocking
  the power within their own stories and empowering them to share their
  resiliency with each other.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  PLUS ME Project has become an industry leading organization in LA known for
  helping youth and adults realize their stories matter. Since 2013, PLUS ME has
  impacted over 90,000 students throughout the city with inspirational
  storytelling programming. Our organization has built curriculum and resources
  that are used by over 15,000 students and adults annually. 


  Since 2017, each year PLUS ME has successfully completed our 100 Volunteers,
  100 Stories campaign by recruiting, training, and scheduling 100 volunteers to
  share their stories with youth throughout LA on one day. Over the past 3
  years, this initiative has strengthened, grown interest, and impacted
  thousands.


  With our previous success, our goal is to expand upon everything we have
  learned from the past three years and implement a new model that connects,
  inspires, and empowers thousands throughout our city. We strongly believe that
  everyone has a story that matters and we want to use this project to help
  ensure LA realizes it.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Our vision for success is for more people in LA to feel connected by
  increasing their social and emotional support through storytelling and for
  them to feel empowered by choosing to volunteer and share their stories with
  youth. The project will create a powerful ripple effect which will be both
  seen and felt.


  We will measure our success by asking all of our volunteers, students, and
  community attendees to complete a survey or interview to help us gauge the
  impact of our three metrics. Overall, we want LA to feel (1) more empowered by
  increasing volunteerism rates, (2) more engaged by providing access to social
  and emotional support, and (3) more connected by meeting new Angelenos at
  public art and cultural events.


  By the end of June 2021, we will have successfully accomplished the following:

  At least 500 adults volunteers will have participated in storytelling training
  and shared their stories with middle and high school youth throughout LA.

  At least 10,000 students will learn about the powerful art of storytelling and
  engage with inspirational role models.

  At least 500 people will have attended our free, public storytelling events
  and connected with fellow Angelenos.


  These experiences can help people feel united and less alone. Our success will
  be demonstrated through the data we receive and with a video showing how our
  project helped make LA a better place to CONNECT. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '500'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '11000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Our city will need immense social support and our residents will be yearning
  for motivational connection after this social distancing period ends. Our
  proposal will impact the future of our city by not only increasing rates of
  adult volunteerism across LA, but also by connecting and motivating thousands
  of individuals from multiple generations through their stories.


  The storytelling celebration events that we will host across our city will
  bring together our volunteer storytellers, middle and high school youth, and
  any guest who wishes to attend. These events will remind us how resilient,
  empathetic, and diverse we are as a city - inspiring a ripple effect that will
  create deeper connections, less isolation, and remind us that we matter.
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-

  classrooms available that will host our volunteer guest speakers throughout
  the 2020 - 2021 school year. 


  GEAR UP 4 LA works with over 35 middle and high schools throughout Los
  Angeles. This allows us to implement our storytelling project to thousands of
  students. Through this collaboration, we may also have the opportunity to host
  some of our quarterly mixers at their schools to allow more students and
  community members to attend and CONNECT.

  their alumni network of current college students, educator lists, and overall
