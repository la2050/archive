title: Refoundry Los Angeles Program
project_summary: >-
  Refoundry’s goal is to expand our program in Los Angeles to serve at least 60
  participants in 2020, and 75 people per year thereafter. My LA2050 funding
  will allow Refoundry to pay for essentials like tools, equipment, and
  insurance.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CREATE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  We launched Refoundry because we believe mass incarceration is a main driver
  of systemic, generational poverty in disadvantaged communities.  We serve
  formerly incarcerated people because despite observing an incredible amount of
  talent and resourcefulness in this population, and a deep commitment to
  contribute to their communities and help other formerly incarcerated people,
  they face a 10% job retention and 75% recidivism rate.  We developed a new
  model because we feel traditional reentry/workforce
  development/entrepreneurship programs are undifferentiated, set a relatively
  low bar, and unintentionally contribute to policies and practices that
  reinforce barriers to social, economic and civic inclusion.  
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  In 2014, Refoundry founders Thomas Saifan and Cisco Pinedo designed a program
  drawn from their own personal experience with craft and entrepreneurship, and
  with employing and training people from justice-impacted communities.They
  launched pilots in Los Angeles and New York with impressive results: Refoundry
  entrepreneurs started 10 businesses that now employ 125 people; no one served
  has been imprisoned since participating in the program; all are off most forms
  of social service support; and a Columbia University Business School review
  estimated each Refoundry graduate created a net tax benefit of $100,000 per
  year. Refoundry relaunched in Los Angeles last year, and is planning a NYC
  relaunch in 2020. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Refoundry is working with the Incarceration Public Health Action Network
  (IPHAN) at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, and the
  Washington, DC-based firm Giving Science Dimension (GSD), to develop a new
  comprehensive set of quantitative measurements, along with qualitative
  measurements based on the experience of participants. The proposed research
  will track more than 70 measurements, including income growth and savings,
  access to healthcare, and business ownership, as well as things like sense of
  personal self-worth, purchase of vehicle, volunteer work -- and of course
  program attrition and recidivism. 


  Refoundry leadership believes that if it can demonstrate the success of its
  model at scale, it will open opportunities for both increased revenue
  generation and new avenues of revenue that can make the organization largely
  self-sustained within 5-7 years.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '80'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '300'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Refoundry plans to create a program model with a national footprint within
  five years, opening program sites in 10 strategically selected cities to
  ensure maximum impact on effected communities, tax revenue and systemic
  change. Over the course of our “five-year plan,” Refoundry will directly train
  650 formerly incarcerated people, incubate more than 65 businesses owned and
  operated by Refoundry Entrepreneurs, move over 5,000 people from underserved
  communities into living wage employment at a cost of about $4,250 per job,
  generate $25M in revenue, and create a net tax benefit of $500M. The program
  plan will also rescue 2,000 tons (4 million pounds) of waste from landfill,
  and engage 10,000 people in Refoundry Workshops.
