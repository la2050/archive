title: 'LA Industry: Circular Textiles'
project_summary: >-
  LA Industry aims to create a centralized HUB where material byproducts from
  businesses can be repurposed instead of going to landfills. This HUB will
  create a local closed-loop market that promotes a circular economy by
  providing stable and consistent material streams for reuse. Two key success
  factors that will be addressed are the management of an online material
  exchange platform and quality control/assurance.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CREATE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Under Mayor Eric Garcetti, the City of LA created L.A.’s Green New Deal
  sustainability pLAn. The pLAn has ambitious goals of reaching zero waste by
  2050. This can only be achieved by moving towards a circular economy through
  the implementation of different tools. As a municipality and sustainable
  business assistance team working directly with LA’s manufacturers and
  businesses, LA Industry is uniquely qualified to foster connections and build
  infrastructure to support this project. The design and implementation of a
  centralized HUB and online access portal to manage exchanges and quality
  control of the inventory will be one of the pollution prevention and
  sustainability strategies used to help businesses and industries reduce costs
  and environmental footprints. Our clients voiced concerns about a lack of
  local opportunities to reuse, repurpose, or recycle material streams along
  with L.A.’s Green New Deal’s prestigious zero waste goals provided a perfect
  opportunity for this project.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  As the City of LA, LA Sanitation and Environment’s pollution prevention and
  sustainability team, LA Industry shares common underlying goals of protecting
  public health and the environment as well as our own goals of aiding economic
  development and business continuity in the LA Region. We are constantly
  exploring new strategies and opportunities with a collaborative network of
  internal and external partners to cultivate a business-friendly environment
  for businesses and industries to thrive while meeting regulatory compliance.
  All the goals in L.A.’s Green New Deal are delegated to their respective
  agencies. As a part of LA Sanitation and Environment, LA Industry is in a
  unique position to tackle these zero waste goals through the creation of a
  centralized HUB and an online exchange portal given our team’s goals of aiding
  economic development, business continuity, and our direct connection to
  businesses and industries. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  On a shorter timeline, this grant will allow us to set up a centralized HUB
  where businesses and organizations can store clean textile scraps sorted by
  color and content that would otherwise end up in landfills. These repurposed
  scraps will naturally create new markets, business partnerships, and green
  jobs in both the creative and manufacturing sectors as innovative reuse and
  repurposing methods are employed. 


  On a longer timeline, as the HUB gains more users, an online exchange portal
  will be implemented to expand the reach and streamline the efficiency of these
  transactions. Due to the immense volume of the City of LA's textile and
  garment waste, our project will target the collection and repurposing of
  post-industrial textile scraps. Diverting this textile waste would support
  L.A.’s Green New Deal’s waste goals of 100% organic waste diversion by 2028,
  100% landfill diversion by 2050, and 50% local material reuse by 2035. We hope
  to achieve a successful, circular, and streamlined business model for textiles
  that can be applied to other material streams. This includes mapping out the
  A’s (material stream producers), B’s (intermediate processors), C’s (end
  users), as well as monitoring transactions to establish a dashboard of
  tracking metrics (ie: frequency, tonnage, composition, active users, cost
  savings, value creation, etc.)
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '70000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '4000000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  The creation of a centralized HUB has infinite impact potential. The HUB as
  proposed is focused on post-industrial material streams and will create new
  markets, green jobs, and economic opportunities for entrepreneurs to find
  innovative solutions to reuse, repurpose, and recycle. This HUB will be a
  centralized location where businesses and organizations can browse clean
  material streams to use as feedstock in their manufacturing processes,
  reducing the amount of virgin materials used and thus creating cost savings. A
  successful HUB will be an important tool to aid the City of LA in reaching
  100% landfill diversion by 2050 as well as being a proven model other cities
  moving towards sustainability can implement.
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': ''
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Access to the LA2050 community
  - Host public events or gatherings
  - 'Capacity, including staff'
  - Strategy assistance and implementation
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.: ''
Which metrics will your submission impact?:
  - Manufacturing activity
  - Employment in the creative industries
  - Jobs per capita
Are there any other LA2050 goal categories that your proposal will impact?: []
Has your proposal changed due to COVID-19?: >
  Amid the current COVID-19 situation, our team wants to add an innovative
  challenge for upcycling enthusiasts to design reusable PPE with textile scrap.
  This would create a win-win situation in both protecting the environment by
  reducing the amount of waste going to landfills and supporting our frontline
  workers.


  Safety is our number one priority when creating the centralized HUB. Proper
  precautions, worker protections, and all LA County Public Health guidelines
  will be enforced. The scale and timeline of the planned project are flexible
  and will be adjusted accordingly.
