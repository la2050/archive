title: Nonviolence Ambassadors of LA
project_summary: >-
  We will train 100 former gang members from across all neighborhoods of LA as
  Ambassadors of Nonviolence. The participants will be equipped with profound
  breath and meditation practices to heal themselves from trauma as well as with
  novel strategies to improve communication and conflict resolution skills.
  Graduates will be empowered to train community members in nonviolence practice
  and will host a Peace Innovation Summit in 2021 to promote entrepreneurial
  solutions to the socio-economic challenges in their communities.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  In 2018, there were over 25,000 violent crimes reported in LA. Such high
  violence, leads to degradation of public health and public safety. The City of
  LA employs former gang members, as Community Intervention Workers (CIW) and
  they play a vital role in reducing violence by supporting victims of violence
  to heal and prevent retaliation. These individuals have to deal with both the
  unhealed trauma of the past and ongoing stress of their job. In 2019, we
  piloted our Nonviolence Ambassador Training Program in the Harvard Park
  neighborhood in South LA. The program provided the CIW with breath&meditation
  tools to improve self-care, mental health and wellbeing. We taught over 200
  participants in that community and are now interested in scaling the impact of
  our program across all neighborhoods of LA. We believe that by training the
  CIW from different neighborhoods and empowering them to teach others would
  help bring the benefits of the program to their communities.

Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Since 1997, the International Association for Human Values (IAHV) has been
  addressing society’s sensitive and critical issues such as violence
  prevention, health, poverty, education, and sustainable development across the
  globe through its unique researched and evidence based programs. IAHV has been
  successfully offering  programs in schools, prisons, and refugee camps.
  Through our Prison program, over 800,000 inmates in 60 countries have been
  taught to reduce stress and improve overall  well being. We also train youth
  in high schools across the US and returning veterans through specific programs
  www.skyschools.org; www.pwht.org. Our project in LA would be leveraging our
  experience in training at risk youth and incarcerated prison inmates to bring
  the transformational tools to communities that are facing the challenges of
  violence. By empowering former incarcerated individuals to become trainers of
  peace and nonviolence, we are also reducing recidivism rates and crime in
  neighborhoods.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  The success of this project will be in the empowerment and holistic
  development of enthusiastic individuals in promoting peace in their
  communities. Furthermore, these empowered individuals training at least 100
  community members would be a sign that they see the value of the
  transformational tools for the community. Another measure of success will be
  the Community participation in Peace Innovation Summit in 2021 to take
  ownership of creating entrepreneurial solutions to the challenges in the
  community.


  We will measure the outcomes of our program through pre and post session
  surveys to assess improvements in resilience, mental health & wellbeing, and
  relationship building.


  The specific metrics to be measured will be designed through participatory
  evaluation (with input from participants) however, they could include
  potential reduction measurement of stress related variables viz; reduction of
  blood pressure, anxiety, tension, improved sleep and immune function, as well
  as professional metrics of improvement in professional effectiveness and
  efficiency, ability for problem solving and decision making, de-escalation of
  conflict situations, increase in ability to improve social connectedness and
  building trusted relationship.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '10000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '100000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  The program will train 100 CIWs, who respond to gang related violence
  everyday, and connect with dozens of victims of violence on a daily basis.
  During the certification program, each graduate will be required to train at
  least 100 people in their community in the practice of nonviolence. So at
  least 10000 people will be directly impacted. Each of these 10k individuals
  will bring the learnings to their own family - at least 4 people in family
  makes this about 40,000 people. In addition, the peace summit will develop
  solutions to socio-economic challenges of communities thereby affecting a much
  higher number of people in the community.
