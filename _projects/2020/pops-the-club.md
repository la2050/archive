What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Mass incarceration affects not just those convicted of crimes, but also their
  loved ones left behind. The community experiences this loss as a “shared
  sentence.” Stigma and trauma are part of the fabric of the lives of one in
  fourteen children in America who have faced this kind of separation. In just
  over 30 years, the number of people in prison in the U.S. has swelled from
  350,000 to 1.5 million and disproportionately affects people of color and
  low-income populations. And yet, the pain of the prison system for those left
  behind remains invisible. The children impacted by incarceration are
  disproportionately more likely to have higher dropout rates and higher
  incidences of depression and anxiety. As a result, they face greater
  challenges in school. They need a vehicle by which to navigate the minefield
  of their pain and loss.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  POPS was created to provide that vehicle. For the past seven years, POPS has
  been transforming the lives of Los Angeles teens with loved ones in prison or
  jail through the use of creative expression, emotional support, and community
  to nourish, inspire, and empower POPS youth. Formerly married to a man who was
  incarcerated, co-founder and executive director, Amy Friedman, witnessed
  first-hand the wound having an incarcerated parent created for her two
  daughters.  Her passion to reduce the traumatic impact of incarceration on
  youth led her in 2012 to co-found POPS at Venice HS with her second husband,
  Dennis Danziger, a veteran high school English teacher. Today, POPS is in 15
  schools across four states, and one of two organizations in the country that
  provides trauma-informed, arts- and school-based activities designed to
  support teens with justice-involved loved ones. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  POPS’s goal is that students learn to heal the stigma and shame so often
  experienced as a result of having an incarcerated loved one.  


  As a result of participating in POPS the Club, students report an increased
  desire to graduate on time, improved grades and behavioral marks in school,
  and an overall optimism about life that they did not have before. The best
  outcomes of POPS programs are evident in individual student testimonials.
  Students who intended to drop out of school before finding POPS are staying in
  school, graduating, and going on to attend college. Students suffering deep
  depression, anxiety, and anger self-report they attribute their healing
  through the self-expression they learned to do using POPS’ writing,
  storytelling, performance, art-making, and mindfulness curriculum. Students
  choose a positive future by leaving gangs they would have never before
  envisioned exiting as they understand continued involvement might lead them
  down the same path as their justice- involved loved one.


  In addition to the numbers served, POPS collects this data through participant
  surveys for qualitative impact around how their participation with POPS has
  affected the stigma, shame, community connection and mental and physical
  health. This is measured through pre- and post-participation surveys designed
  in collaboration with USC and CSUN Departments of Public Health. POPS
  regularly reviews these materials, using the information to adjust training
  and presentation methods and curricula accordingly. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '240'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '2100'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  The stigma of justice-involvement often leads to recidivism, substance abuse,
  depression, and unemployment. Family members of these individuals, children in
  particular, also serve a “silent sentence” deal with a range of emotions –
  fear, anger, anxiety, shame, and confusion.  This diminished self-esteem robs
  both justice-involved individuals and their loved ones of social
  opportunities, causing them to withdraw from their community. Both POPS and
  Defy work to shift the mindsets of justice-involved individuals and their
  loved ones to heal and reframe the stigma about incarceration. Expanding this
  dialogue to include the general public is critical to helping both vulnerable
  populations have a successful chance to rejoin their communities.
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  POPS and Defy will combine elements their existing programs to create a
  collaborative project aimed at healing the pain of the prison system amongst
  currently and formerly incarcerated people and their family members. Through
  workshops and community events, our efforts will culminate in 1) an anthology
  of writing and artwork created both in POPS Clubs and in our collaborative
  workshops; 2) a community and in-prison performance; and 3) a video featuring
  members of each of our organizations performing their work and speaking about
  the impact of our PLAY together. Project outcomes will be increased
  well-being, confidence and support in of POPS students, Defy members as well
  as altering community members’ negative perceptions of those impacted by the
  criminal justice system.
