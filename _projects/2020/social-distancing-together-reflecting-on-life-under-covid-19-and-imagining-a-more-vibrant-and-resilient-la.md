  Social Distancing Together: Reflecting on life under COVID-19 and imagining a
  more vibrant and resilient LA
project_summary: >-
  Housed in a gold shipping container equipped with A/V technology, the
  LA_Portal is a pop-up community space for Angelenos to come together, share
  their experiences with COVID-19, and explore ways to create a more vibrant and
  resilient city. The LA_Portal will move between neighborhoods, hosting
  dialogues and cultural programming with 45+ Portal sites around the world. It
  is free, open to the public, and co-created with LA arts and civic partners.
  Dialogues will be recorded to track impact, inspire other cities, and capture
  this moment in time.

What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  COVID-19 has accelerated the atomization and breakdown of our local and global
  communities. It has exposed existing fault lines in race and class. After
  social distancing tapers, there will be long-term impacts in how we gather and
  think about public space. We must use this moment to come together, be
  intentional in building community, and push LA to become more vibrant,
  inclusive, and resilient.


  We are offering a space for Angelenos to gather and share mutual experiences -
  from stories of loss to sharing newly-honed creative skills - with communities
  around the world. We believe these dialogues will remind residents of the
  importance of public spaces, help reweave the disrupted community fabric, and
  activate a sense of global togetherness.


  Due to its size, diversity, and cultural significance, LA is an ideal partner
  to lead these multi- and cross-lingual conversations. We will share these
  stories with our global network, and position LA as a model for bottom-up
  community engagement.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Shared_Studios uses structured dialogues to build empathy and community on a
  global scale. We maintain 45 sites - from refugee camps to tech hubs - and
  co-create meaningful programming with each host community. 


  Since 2017 the LA_Portal has been hosted across the city, forging deep
  relationships with local organizations and site partners, including Grand Park
  and Mercado La Paloma. Connections have included Oaxacan youth orchestra
  performances and a beats exchange with Erbil, Iraq, among many others.


  From 2017-18, the LA_Portal was part of a research initiative with Yale to
  better understand the relationship between Americans and local police. The
  Portals Policing Project hosted open recorded dialogues between U.S. cities as
  a means of data collection and generative exchange. Each dialogue was
  bookended by written surveys and helped communities define their own
  narratives and create connected political spaces. We will replicate a similar
  structure in LA. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Our vision is for Angelenos to come together, reflect upon their individual
  and shared experiences with COVID-19, and share their vision for the future of
  LA. We will measure our impact by: 


  Number of communities and participants to measure scale: Depending on budget,
  the LA_Portal can visit up to 8 communities in LA. The Portal could spend 2-4
  weeks and host 200-400 community members at each site. A portion of
  participants will engage in structured, recorded conversations on COVID-19,
  sharing ideas for the future of LA.


  Questionnaires to measure resident sentiment: Participants can opt to share
  further information about their conversation in the Portal through a
  post-Portal questionnaire. Portals are staffed locally to track participation
  and distribute questionnaires. 


  Collection of oral histories to capture this place and moment in time: Using a
  confession booth format, select participants will share their stories and
  experiences under quarantine or working on the front lines of COVID-19
  response. 


  Connections between policymakers and local leaders to compile best practices
  and ideas: These connections surface specific practices, approaches, and
  policy ideas on how to best build community in LA.


  Deliverables: The stories, ideas, and recommendations surfaced from these
  conversations will become a summary report and proposal on how to make LA a
  more resilient, inclusive, and vibrant place to live. We will also compile
  recorded oral histories to turn into one or more series of videos.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '1000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '100000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Impact on Environment and Physical Space: The LA_Portal will temporarily
  reshape existing public spaces by serving as a pop-up resource where people
  can gather in small groups while flexibly modeling responsible and integrate
  health-sensitive public activity


  Description of Population: It is critical to bring the Portal to a range of
  neighborhoods and communities that cross race, nationality, language, and
  class barriers, with an emphasis on neighborhoods that lack high-speed
  internet access. These could include Downtown LA, South Los Angeles, Hyde
  Park/Inglewood, Pacoima/Sylmar, among others. 


  Policy Impact: We will crowdsource stories, ideas, and policy recommendations
  that articulate how LA residents envision the future of the city. 
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  Shared_Studios is not applying with another organization but will work
  directly with LA-based organizations to co-author and co-create hyperlocal
  programming with local arts and civic organizations. These cultural
  connections are designed to showcase local organizations and community groups
  and connect residents to similar groups around the world. Past site partners
  for the LA_Portal have included Grand Park, the Los Angeles Law Library, CSU
  Dominguez Hills School of Art + Design, Mercado La Paloma, and Community
  Services Unlimited. We have also developed onsite relationships and
  partnerships nurtured on a block-by-block basis, most often programmed in
  concert with people we meet onsite.
