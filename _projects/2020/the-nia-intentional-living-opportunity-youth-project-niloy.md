Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  This project responds to the need to reduce the number of disengaged youth in
  LA; and address the lack of social and emotional (SEL) wellbeing of OY in LA. 
  For OY, not working and not attending school matters for their life
  opportunities.  For OY, between the ages of 16-24 neither working nor in
  school, these years can be a critical time in their lives, as decisions made
  at these ages can have a long-term impact on one’s future career and life
  trajectory. 

  Using a culturally responsive & holistic approach, OY will be exposed to: 1)
  SEL skills; 2) real life examples of engaged youth; 3) mental health services;
  and 4) access to entry level jobs in the City of Los Angeles, particularly the
  LAX area.   Project activities will include: 1) purposeful life training
  skills; 2) therapy; 3) college and career exploration, and placement; 4)
  mentoring support; and 5) technology training (including meaningful social
  media contacts and greater connections to online job searching information).

Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  LA2050 goal: 100% of those experiencing mental illness have access to services
  including medication or counseling.  100% of OY will receive therapeutic group
  counseling; Participants with acute mental health needs and/or experiencing
  mental challenges will receive intensive individual therapy session (with
  subsequent referral and/or case management support for continues services). 
  LA2050: reports that in 2015, 11.7 percent of youth, 16-24, in the City of Los
  Angeles were considered opportunity youth, not working or in school; and has
  set its target as: less than 5% of youth, 16-24 in the City of Los Angeles
  will be disengaged from work and school.  Our project aims to empower and
  support the development of socially and emotionally healthy Opportunity Youth,
  ages 16-24.  Our vision for this project includes: 1) Increase access to
  mental health services to Opportunity (Disengaged) Youth to provide community
  alternatives to isolation, suicidal tendencies, trauma, and depression; 2)
  Increase engagement of OY via providing, culturally responsive, social and
  emotional learning skills; 3) Increase Youth engagement by providing greater
  connections to online job searching, information, platforms, and skills; and
  4) Increase college and career opportunities for OY.  Secondary metrics
  include: Youth contribute meaningfully to civic life:90% of Youth will utilize
  a digital platform to voice their opinions; Dream metric: Youth will increase
  total number of local social media friends and connections by 10 friends; and
  90% of Youth will either enroll in school or be assigned to work (and no
  longer be classified as disengaged).  Project success will be measured,
  ongoing throughout the project, formally and informally, soliciting feedback
  from all stakeholders.  Project services and activities will be adjusted, as
  data supports, to ensure the highest level of success upon project
  conclusion.We will seek to partner with the Mayor’s Fund for LA and link our
  youth to opportunities provided through its following programs: Evolve
  Entertainment Fund; Hire LA’s Youth; LA’s College Promise; and the Youth
  Employment Pilot.  Outcomes from partnerships may include: paid internships,
  mentorships and educational opportunities; access to career assessment and job
  matching technologies; work force skills development and private sector job
  opportunities; and a 2-year free college experience.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '30'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: ''
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  OY in LA are disproportionately Black and Hispanic (80%) live in low-income
  neighborhoods and face key barriers to job access such as disconnections and
  labor market discrimination.  Barriers include: lack of home internet access;
  limited social networks (outside of low-income communities); and greater
  connections to online job searching information & skills.  In LA: 1) entry
  level jobs are clustered in several regions including the LAX airport area;
  and 2) South LA is one of three areas where most OY reside.  We will target OY
  living in South LA and career opportunities around LAX.  OY can engage in
  unhealthy behaviors such as criminal activities. Helping OY reconnect to
  society, SEL balanced, can also help build a healthier community.
