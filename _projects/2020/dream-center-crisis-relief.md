title: Dream Center Crisis Relief
project_summary: >-
  Dream Center programs aim to meet the basic needs of the surrounding community
  and support vulnerable families in their transition toward a more sustainable
  lifestyle. Every month, over half a million pounds of food gets distributed to
  various communities through Dream Center programs such as Foster Care
  Intervention, Food Truck outreach, and the Carey Kitchen, as well as through
  other service-led organizations partnering with our food pantry. Additionally,
  we are now actively responding to the need caused by the COVID-19 crisis.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  History has shown that some of the greatest contributors to our society were
  at some point given help to survive with hope for a better life. The Dream
  Center has provided that help and hope to the most vulnerable children and
  families in Los Angeles since our inception in 1994. Everything we have done
  and will continue to do to help is driven by our commitment to "Find a need
  and fill it, find a hurt and heal it." 


  Our programs meet the basic needs of the community and support vulnerable
  families in their transition toward a more sustainable lifestyle. Every month,
  over half a million pounds of food gets distributed to various communities
  through Dream Center programs such as Foster Care Intervention, Food Truck
  outreach, and the Carey Kitchen, and through other partnering organizations.


  Today, we ask for emergency support in the form of a General Operating grant
  to help further our mission to respond to the current health and economic
  crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  The Dream Center measures its impact in this capacity by counting the number
  of individuals in need that have access to our resources. In the surrounding
  neighborhood of Service Planning Area 4, approximately 228,148 or residents
  under age 17 are in close proximity to access to our pantry and kitchen (as
  identified by LACounty.gov). While serving anyone in need, we specifically
  target low-to-moderate income families with children and families experiencing
  homelessness. 


  A conservative estimate for the number of underserved children we positively
  impact is a multiple of the 8,166 households identified in SPA 4 to have
  students (at least one) eligible for free or reduced-price meals in public
  schools. Nevertheless, we work to impact other surrounding Service Planning
  Areas through food distribution to 21 other sites across Los Angeles county.
  Again, we are doing all this in addition to our flagship residential
  programs. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  We measure success by the number of individuals and families we are able to
  serve. 


  Those individuals and families in desperate need of programs and services come
  from many different backgrounds and locations but, through our programs, are
  equally and indiscriminately able to benefit from the kind of life-stabilizing
  support necessary for restoration, recovery, employment readiness and social
  reintegration with positive contributions to the community. Our general
  operating expenses provide housing, clothing, food, hygiene products,
  mentorship, and case management with access to community service
  opportunities, work experience, and our Adult Education program for GED
  attainment, financial literacy, and development of other life skills. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '30000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '50000'

  accessible as a resource to the entire population of LA County, we
  specifically target low-to-moderate income families with children and families
  experiencing homelessness.
