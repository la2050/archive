What is the need you’re responding to?: >
  There has never been a greater need for small businesses to understand and

  forcing businesses to strengthen their online presence, develop new ways to
  connect to their customers, and create digital products. Codemarket’s platform
  democratizes the ability to monetize online presence and digital products by
  allowing small businesses to create online communities and digital products
  tailor-made to their business. 


  Codemarket was developed under the conviction that the monetization of
  technology and digital products should not be limited to big companies like
  Google and Facebook. Instead, it should be available to all for the benefit of
  all. Small business owners understand the needs of their community better than
  anyone else. The greatest impact you can have on a community is to empower
  these individuals with technological solutions that enable them to use their
  passion and talents to benefit their community. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Codemarket helps individuals and businesses reach their goals with
  technological solutions. Our over 20 years of experience and knowledge in a
  wide-array of sectors, from health and wellness to retail, insurance, and
  non-profit organizations, allows our team to tailor the digital
  infrastructure, digital products, Customer Relationship Management (CRM), and
  AI Strategy to support every type of small business.


  Codemarket Founder, Sumithra Jonnalagadda, received her engineering degree
  from the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology, Madras and her MBA from
  the premier Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore. She has experience
  starting her own small business and first-hand knowledge of the challenges
  associated with it. Equipped with that understanding, she started Codemarket
  to help local businesses scale their businesses using technical solutions that
  large corporations use. She has over 20 years of experience creating data
  driven digital products that can be monetized.
