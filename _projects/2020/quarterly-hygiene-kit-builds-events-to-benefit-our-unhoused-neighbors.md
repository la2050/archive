title: Quarterly Hygiene Kit Builds Events to benefit our Unhoused Neighbors
project_summary: >-
  Our FLOWVEMBER hygiene kit build is easily our most impactful AND popular
  annual event. Our plan is to do this event quarterly, building 1000 hygiene
  kits at each event to be distributed by our community partners: SELAH
  Neighborhood Homeless Coalition, KTown for All, The Center in Hollywood. We're
  moving to a larger, ADA-accessible space, where we can host tabling for
  non-profit partners, encourage connection and community among volunteers, and
  invite speakers with lived experience to share their stories.

  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Since 2017, we have been producing an annual volunteer and advocacy event:
  FLOWvember: a Menstrual Product Drive & period kit building event to benefit
  our unhoused neighbors.


  We are leaning into what we do best: providing four thoughtfully curated
  volunteer events that connect and serve the community. We’ll focus on creating
  diverse, inclusive spaces accessible to everyone. We believe in curating
  volunteer events that are impactful, accessible, and inclusive. We’re
  producing hands-on opportunities that reflect our communities’ values and
  engaging events that directly help those in-need.


  We’ll continue to focus on one cause: homelessness. By partnering with local
  non-profits doing direct outreach, and inviting people with lived experience
  to share their stories, we will give volunteers a comprehensive understanding
  of this issue and equip them to participate in local solutions.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  resisterhoodLA's annual FLOWVEMBER menstrual product drive & period kit build
  event is our most impactful AND popular event, reaching over 150 volunteers
  and producing 1000 hygiene kits. These hygiene kits contain basic hygiene
  items that provide our neighbors experiencing homelessness with tools to
  maintain their health and sense of dignity.


  Since 2017, we have donated over 18,000 tampons to people experiencing
  homelessness, created 40 volunteer opportunities within our community, and
  donated $17,000 to local non-profits. Our group is committed to being
  inclusive and family-friendly.


  We've connected with some of Los Angeles' most impactful non-profit groups
  doing work around homelessness: SELAH Neighborhood Coalition, KTown For All.
  Our goal is to use our event planning and community organizing superpowers to
  provide opportunities for volunteers who may not be able to do street outreach
  while creating a connection to this important work.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Our plan is to host four events over the next year: August 2020, November
  2020, February 2021, May 2021. 


  At each quarterly event, we will:

  * Purchase wholesale hygiene products to build 1000-3000 hygiene kits for our
  unhoused neighbors

  * Offer donate-what-you-can admission to make volunteering accessible &
  affordable for everyone in our community

  * Invite speakers with lived experience to share their stories

  * Secure an ADA-accessible space for 125+ volunteers and room for building
  community

  * Host a non-profit fair for our community partners to meet new volunteers


  Our measure of success will be building 4000+ kits with a goal of reaching
  over 500 unique volunteers annually. We're exploring ways of measuring
  volunteers' level of engagement post-event, with follow-up surveys. We'll stay
  connected with our non-profit partners throughout the year, keeping a record
  of kits distributed as well as adapting to the seasonal needs/requests of our
  unhoused neighbors.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '500'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '4000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >
  At each event, we'll welcome 125-500 volunteers and train them to become
  advocates for their community. By hosting a non-profit fair, we'll introduce
  them to organizations & opportunities to broaden their impact. We'll
  demonstrate the importance of engaging in local neighborhood councils and with
  City Council representatives to affect change. By introducing volunteers to
  unhoused folks, we can work to eliminate fear & misconceptions that might be
  holding them back from getting involved.


  4000 unhoused folks in our community will receive a hygiene kit. These hygiene
  kits contain basic hygiene items that provide our neighbors experiencing
  homelessness with tools to maintain their health and sense of dignity.
