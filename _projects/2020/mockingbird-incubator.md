What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Mockingbird Incubator (MBI) was created in response to the growing need in our
  community for new and emerging voices within the nonprofit sector. Time after
  time, we ran into people who had great ideas for starting a nonprofit but
  needed more than just a passion for helping others. They needed infrastructure
  and a road map to create a sustainable nonprofit that would have a lasting
  impact on the community we serve. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Our work is simple: We are a nonprofit that helps people start their own
  nonprofit organization, on the right foot. Our work is important because we
  need newer, fresher, better ideas in the nonprofit sector and Mockingbird
  Incubator is leading the charge on creating that. We support organizations
  that foster equity, inclusivity and diversity. At Mockingbird Incubator, we
  empower nonprofit organizations to start and create sustainable impact in
  their communities. 


  We offer a 7-step program, which can be taken in its entirety or one class at
  a time. Each course teaches a different aspect of building your nonprofit. 


  Our topics include:

  Goal Definition & Strategic Planning.

  Board Development & Engagement.

  Developing a Successful Fundraising Plan.

  Program Development and Evaluation.

  Financials: Nonprofit Budget.

  Marketing & Branding.

  Ethical Leadership in a nonprofit.


  At the end of our program, participants will have a strategic plan and the
  ability to write their first grant proposal. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  By June 30, 2021, 50 people will have started their own nonprofit and
  completed a strategic plan.


  By June 30, 2021, 75% of participants will report they feel more empowered to
  start a nonprofit, as measured by our exit poll at the end of our webinars. 


  By December 31, 2020, all of our cohorts will be offered online.  


  Our vision for success is that everyone who is able to start a nonprofit, may
  do so confidently and with the ability to sustain their organization,
  particularly in times of crisis.

Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '1000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Starting a nonprofit is hard and can be very intimidating. But it shouldn't
  be. It should be a space where anyone with an idea and a passion can throw
  their hat in the ring and help change the world. If we are able to give people
  a chance to elevate their voice, we can help them change the world. Every day,
  we face new and emerging issues which is exactly why we need fresh ideas and
  new perspectives that fuel new nonprofits. We will help change the world, one
  new nonprofit at a time.
