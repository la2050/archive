title: 'ShineLA: Transforming the way Angelenos feel, move, and connect in our city'
project_summary: >-
  ShineLA is a ten-year research initiative linking the 2028 Olympic and
  Paralympic movements to a brighter future for Los Angeles. In collaboration
  with the City of Los Angeles Dept of Recreation and Parks, Mayor Garcetti’s
  office, and leading innovators in technology/design, this will be the largest
  population-based study of physical activity in the US. Through iterative
  evaluation, we will improve physical and mental health, as well as social
  connection across all populations in Los Angeles, for a sustained impact
  through 2028 and beyond.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to PLAY
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Physical inactivity is one of the leading global risk factors for mortality. 
  Physical activity participation can play a key role in the prevention of
  noncommunicable diseases, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease,
  stroke, and cancer. Research also points to associations between physical
  activity and delayed onset of dementia and improved mental health. Despite
  this extensive knowledge, participation rates are low, and physical inactivity
  a global pandemic. Globally, over one quarter of adults and approximately 80%
  of adolescents do not meet physical activity guidelines. The United States is
  not immune, with only approximately 25% of children and youth, and less than
  40% of adults sufficiently active. Within California, many of these trends are
  the same. Furthermore, physical activity levels in California drop among
  underserved, girls, and minority populations, thus, to improve public health,
  we need to find ways to get people moving.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  While there is recognized need to increase physical activity, progress at the
  population level has been minimal. This lack of significant improvement can be
  attributed to two factors. First, we will only see effective and sustained
  change through community partnerships, multi-level, multi-sector
  interventions. Second, population-level changes will only be successful if
  they consider the ever-changing diverse landscape of cities such as LA and are
  inclusive of all race, ethnicity, and abilities. In advance of the LA 2028
  Olympics, RCHE is leading a partnership to create healthy, active and engaged
  communities for all Angelenos, Shine LA. We have assembled a
  trans-disciplinary team with expertise in cancer surveillance,
  design/technology, civil/government stakeholders, and academic experts who
  look at how environmental factors influence health. We have in depth knowledge
  of how neighborhood parks influence physical activity and how community
  characteristics affect health disparities.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Over the next ten years, our overarching objective is a city-wide increase in
  physical activity, across all populations in Los Angeles, with a focus on
  underserved communities. We will: (1) Work within what RAP currently offers;
  (2) Utilize a Citizen Science approach (e.g. block parties) to increase
  visibility of the parks to be viewed as a locus and neighborhood hub for
  communities. Progress will be measured with data capture from wearable
  devices, and newly developed culturally-tailored mobile applications. The app
  will serve as a conduit to integrating this large, multi-sectoral approach
  across LA. We will be assessing secondary outcomes (e.g. obesity,
  hypertension, resting heart rate), the impact on neighborhoods (e.g. safety,
  beautification), and the larger positive impact on youth as citizens of LA;
  (3) We will use validated measures for observing where and how people use park
  space to examine current trends in RAP park usage (e.g. number of people using
  parks, how they are using them, and where they are spending their time in
  parks). At the end of the ten-year initiative, we will also help the City of
  Los Angeles assess their key performance indicators: 1) Programs; 2) Sports
  promoted; 3) Participants; 4) Coaches/staff; 5) Funding;  6) Outcomes (Overall
  participation increase over the 2019 baseline, % of parents that consider
  their children have a better lifestyle (physical and mental) because of the
  YSP, % of children reporting increased interest in new sports). 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '200'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '150000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Through our health disparities lens, this initiative will fill an important
  gap in our knowledge base of the complex interplay between policy,
  neighborhood/community, family, and individual factors that influence physical
  activity. As such, the broader goal is to substantially increase the
  engagement of youth in physical activity and use of RAP facilities and
  programs and to evaluate the process in a scientifically rigorous manner so
  that what is accomplished in LA can serve as a model for other cities.
  Ultimately, Our goal is to transform the culture of LA. ShineLA envisions a
  city that embraces physical activity at all levels and celebrates all cultures
  as it embarks on this transformation.
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  RAP: Our most important partner, together we will increase the engagement of
  youth in physical activity and use of RAP facilities and programs. We are
  working with RAP staff at every level, including Mayor Garcetti’s office.
  Stanford University: Working with Dr. Abby King, Professor of Health
  Research/Policy to implement the ‘citizen science’ approach. Arts Center:
  Working with ArtCenter to develop a digital ecosystem that encompasses imagery
  and storytelling components, to disseminate messages in culturally inclusive
  and accessible way. Discovery Cube: ShineLA will develop educational
  activities to be featured in the Discovery Cube e.g. exhibit on the science of
  physical activity/ sport.  Garmin: Working with Garmin technology to provide
  wearable fitness trackers to ShineLA participants.
