title: Ocean Adventure Together!
project_summary: >-
  LAMI's Ocean Adventure Together Program breaks barriers that keep some from
  enjoying our coasts and ocean. Parents and invited middle school-aged
  participants share in a day of ocean fun and learn how anyone can enjoy safe
  water-based activities and life aboard a sailing tall ship. The young
  participants then set sail to discover the exciting and life-changing
  experience of a 5-day and night summer voyage at sea. Parents join their kids
  on the last voyage day to witness and share in their children’s new skills and
  positive transformation.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to PLAY
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - South LA
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Barriers exist that impede the equable enjoyment of our coasts and ocean. For
  underrepresented and underserved youth, these barriers can be socially,
  economically, psychologically, and geographically based. A young person’s
  ability to access the coast is significantly impacted by cost and how far they
  live from it. Less obvious but equally impactful barriers are a parent’s
  awareness and attitude toward recreational activities on the coast. In
  underrepresented and underserved communities, parental knowledge of
  water-based activities can be limited, translating to significant
  psychological and social barriers for children. Parents in these demographics
  tend to be more accustomed to higher levels of risk and lower qualities and
  availability of resources, and therefore take a more substantial role in
  “bridging” their child’s extracurricular activities. Therefore, parents are
  more apprehensive about trying a new activity or one that includes an
  unfamiliar environment.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  For 28 years, LAMI has been providing safe at-sea experiential education
  programs to underserved young people. The 'hands-on' active learning,
  self-discovery, and connection to nature that occur through the challenge of
  sailing a tall ship and the joy of playing in and on the ocean are profound.
  LAMI crew are trained educators and experts in sailing and water safety and
  skilled at working with all levels of comfort and abilities when it comes to
  time at sea. The foundation of LAMI's mission is to provide underserved young
  people access to the empowering and life-changing benefits, the increased
  situational and self-awareness, and the importance of environmental
  stewardship that comes from at and in the sea experiences. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  LAMI’s Ocean Adventure Together Program will allow people who do not have
  equal access to the ocean and coast– due to social, economic, and geographical
  barriers– an opportunity for the joy and personal growth that results from
  experiencing time in and on the sea. Success will also be confirmed by
  participant’s elevated awareness of the accessibility of the coastal natural
  resources, their comfort levels with on and in the water activities, their
  confidence in themselves, and their awareness and concern for our coast and
  ocean environments. Changes of participant, parent, and community perceptions
  and knowledge will be measured through before and after program participation
  surveys. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '120'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '1000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  LAMI believes an individual’s and, arguably, a society’s authentic and
  successful stewardship of the natural environment is rooted in the progression
  from enjoyment, then connection, followed by awareness and concern, resulting
  in a deeply felt and acted upon care for our natural world. Therefore, the
  first step is introducing people at an early age to the simple but profound
  enjoyment that is sparked by recreating in nature. The students’ appreciation
  for and knowledge of our natural world and their competency in it will be
  shared with parents, schools, and communities in follow-up engagement
  opportunities, spreading the knowledge and importance of equitable coastal
  access and recreation. 
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': ''
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Access to the LA2050 community
  - Communications support
  - 'Capacity, including staff'
  - Strategy assistance and implementation
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.: ''
Which metrics will your submission impact?:
  - Youth sports participation
  - Access to open space and park facilities
  - Parks with intergenerational play opportunities
Are there any other LA2050 goal categories that your proposal will impact?:
  - LA is the best place to LEARN
  - LA is the healthiest place to LIVE
Has your proposal changed due to COVID-19?: >
  The Los Angeles Maritime Institute (LAMI) has always made the safety of
  program participants, volunteers, and staff our top priority, with an elevated
  commitment during the COVID-19 outbreak. LAMI follows all local, state, and
  federal guidelines and mandates to determine when and how LAMI offers its
  programs. LAMI adopted even more rigorous safety policies and procedures to
  ensure all of our ships and learning environments are safe places to enjoy.

  LAMI’s Ocean Adventure Together Program launches in July 2020, at which time
  we are hopeful some level of gathering will be allowed. If gathering is
  permitted, LAMI will follow capacity guidelines and, if necessary, reduce the
  number of participants per activity and increase the number and frequency of
  events and voyages offered. The Program is well-positioned if restrictions
  allow outdoor gathering, with LAMI able to deliver the intended positive
  outcomes with only modest adjustments, such as replacing the overnighting
  voyage with a series of top-deck day sails. Since the onset of the
  ‘stay-at-home’ orders, LAMI has become extremely proficient at providing
  virtual program experiences and instruction, offering free Virtual Voyage
  online multimedia content and live lessons. If ‘stay-at-home’ orders persist
  into the start of the Program, we are committed to using this expertise to
  create enjoyable, immersive, and educational virtual adaptations of engagement
  plans, and suspending in-person activities until it is safe to do so.
