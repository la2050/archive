Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  During the Quarantine of 2020, Access to Healthy Food dropped significantly,
  leaving citizens of Los Angeles County with less options to support healthy
  lifestyles and local food sources.


  Modern Mobile Applications have already proven that Mobile Marketplaces and
  Delivery services are viable and familiar models for methods for making all
  manner of products available locally, yet these technological advances have
  not yet been properly applied to grassroots movements such as the farmers
  market.


  We aim to change that. Using proven platforms and existing providers,
  Zipmarket will onboard every farmers market in Los Angeles County, and beyond.


  Once a viable supply chain network is established via our platform, we will
  leverage the same resources to enable donation of unsold local produce and
  more to local food banks and more, reducing food waste in the process.


  Neither Low Income nor Threats to Public Health need be a reason that citizens
  of LA county should lack access to Healthy Food.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  It is the mission of our organization to develop modern tools for grassroots
  movements.


  Our experience with advanced mobile technology and supply chains positions us
  as a uniquely well suited developer of exactly this kind of platform.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  We measure success by the number of citizens we benefit. We would therefore
  measure success by the 5 metrics detailed below. Our vision for success is to
  ultimately provide these services nationwide.


  -Every citizen who uses our app would have greater information about what
  sources of healthy local food are nearby (measure users)


  -Every Vendor who sells via our marketplace would have increased access to
  healthy food (measure vendors)


  -Every citizen who has local food delivered via our app would have increased
  access to healthy food (measure deliveries)


  -Every local food producer who donates via our app would have reduced food
  waste (measure donors)


  -Every Food Bank who receives food donations would have reduced food
  insecurity (measure donation recipients)

   
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '130'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '130000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Increasing Access to Healthy Food has the potential to impact everyone living
  in the united states directly and indirectly, according to the U.S. Department
  of Agriculture, some 40 million people in the U.S. were food-insecure in 2017,
  meaning they lacked consistent access to enough food for an active and healthy
  life. 88.9 percent (114.9 million) of U.S. households were food secure
  throughout 2018.


  The Impact of Reducing Food Insecurity and Increasing Access to Healthy Food
  cannot be overstated. The reduction of Food Waste resulting from these efforts
  would have a tremendous impact as well. The scope of the problem is so vast it
  cannot be summarized, but the solution can be as direct as the creation of
  better supply chain tools nationwide
