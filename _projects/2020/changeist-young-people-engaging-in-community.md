title: 'Changeist: Young people engaging in community'
project_summary: >-
  We immerse young people in a 6-month civic action experience, exploring the
  social justice issues they care most about. Over the next year, we will bring
  on 15 AmeriCorps members to engage 300 youth across Los Angeles, giving them
  space on Saturdays to talk about and address our most pressing issues,
  creating pathways for them to design and nurture a more just society.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Today we are facing many issues in the world: racism, climate change, failing
  education systems. Over time there has been one group of people who have taken
  on the status quo and shifted these big issues: young people. Young people are
  our risk takers and big thinkers. They are the courageous better halves of
  society, yet they are often overlooked and not given the opportunities they
  seek out. Changeist mobilizes young people (ages 11-26) from all different
  walks of life, places them on diverse teams and takes them through a 6-month
  community-based experience, exploring and taking action on the issues they
  care most about.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Changeist has been bringing together youth on Saturdays since 2015, working to
  increase youths’ civic knowledge and personal agency by leveraging diverse
  team and near-peer mentors, focusing on the building of a critical lens and
  civic leadership skills, and making connections with agencies leading social
  justice work and movements.


  Our staff’s expertise in youth development, engagement in advocacy, extensive
  citywide partnerships, and robust use of data makes us uniquely qualified to
  undertake this work and achieve our goals.


  In addition, many of our staff are AmeriCorps alums and have great experience
  leading teams of AmeriCorps members in the engagement of youth. We believe
  that providing an AmeriCorps experience (an opportunity to serve your
  community full-time for 11 months) is both a great way for young adults to
  gain meaningful skills and ensures our programming remains relevant to the
  younger generations.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  We expect to see significant changes in the program's ten target outcomes in
  the areas of Character Development, Social Capital, and Sociopolitical
  Empowerment:

  1. Diversity Attitudes

  2. Gratitude

  3. Teamwork

  4. Curiosity & Exploration

  5. Diverse Social Capital

  6. Awareness of Social Issues

  7. Motivation to Make Change

  8. Sociopolitical ProblemSolving Skills

  9. Experience Taking Action

  10. Agent of Change Identity


  We conduct formative, mixed methods program evaluation. Our evaluation focus
  highlights

  both the program process (i.e. quality of program implementation, youth
  participants’ program

  experiences) and program outcomes (i.e. youth participants’ developmental
  growth and learning).


  In addition, we are utilizing a mobile technology to collect information about
  youth’s real-time experiences during the program. This methodology, called
  Experience Sampling Method (ESM), signals youth at random points throughout
  the program day with a brief survey that asks respondents about what they are
  doing and feeling in that moment. This approach provides us with data on the
  quality of program implementation and how youth are experiencing and
  interacting with program components.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '300'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '5000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >
  We are one of nearly 60 other AmeriCorps State programs operating in
  California and are the only program model that uses service as a strategy to
  grow civic engagement among youth. Over the course of the year, we connect
  youth with 70+ LA county agencies to address issues such as Environmental
  Sustainability, Gender Justice, Housing, Immigration, School-to-Prison
  Pipeline, and more. Because youth interest is so broad, we're able to make an
  impact across issues, make connections between issues, and help older
  Angelenos see the inherent value of our young neighbors.
