Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
  - >-
    LAUSD (please select only if you have a district-wide partnership or
    project)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Emotional health doesn't have a face.  Our curriculum is applicable to the
  affluent as well as underserved communities. It creates and builds bridges
  between high and low functioning individuals, across social class, race,
  gender, age, and geographic divides by utilizing topics to unify all
  participants. As an organization our primary focus historically and currently
  has been to provide services to high risk and underserved communities.  Heart
  Sessions workshop has now been serving the Central Long Beach community since
  2009, servicing  high-risk youth between the ages of 14-24.  Open Mic Sessions
  has been offering community programming for 20 years within all of Los Angeles
  County & City of LA. The curriculum has been refined over the course of this
  time with coarse material and workbooks now available.  LA Aims 4 the Heart
  exponentially grows our organization’s efforts by making the curriculum
  available digitally and to targeted Los Angeles neighborhoods. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  In 1996 AIM was incorporated as Assemblies In Motion. In 2014, AIM officially
  changed its name to AIM 4 The Heart to reflect almost thirty years of creating
  and implementing a sustainable model of community-based programs designed to
  positively intervene in the lives of high-risk youth and individuals through
  the arts. After 25 years of experience hosting assemblies and facilitating
  workshops, Leila decided to move the organization’s work forward by having her
  life’s work developed into a curricular model called heArt Education that
  could be implemented inside of schools, community centers, juvenile halls,
  institutions, trauma centers, and prisons. At its core, heArt Education is an
  adaptable emotional literacy curriculum that utilizes the visual and
  performing arts as the primary medium to facilitate dialogue about varied
  topics. Leila has assembled a team of highly qualified teachers and volunteers
  who have a history of successful program administration.  
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Our success metrics are measured through data and marketing analysis. 

  Each quarter represents three months of the grant year period and a phase in
  our program with Q1 = July-Sept: Discovery, Q2 = Oct-Dec: Development, Q3 =
  Jan-March: Implementation, Q4 = April-June: Reporting.  

  During Q1: Discovery we will collect five data sets to serve as the basis for
  our success metrics - program history, program attendance, arts education
  enrollment records, suspension rates, and opportunity youth engagement
  records.  These data sets will be compared to draw correlations between
  Aim4theHeart program presence in the community and the rates in question.  We
  will also perform a marketing analysis to record enrollment and engagement in
  our website, email list, and media channels.   Upon completion of our initial
  data and marketing analysis, our team will establish program goals and a
  routine review system in order to achieve those goals with precision and
  velocity through all phases of the program.  

  This program’s success will be measured through solidifying our identity in
  the digital space and establishing correlations with the program and its
  positive impact in the community.  All will be measured with data.  All will
  be translated into content campaigns that will give Angelenos a way to
  interact with the program via mobile, web, and live in their communities. 
  Together we will show the world why Los Angeles is the best place to LEARN.  
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '1000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '100000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Our program brings an arts and emotional literacy program to the fingertips of
  Angelenos through online and mobile accessibility.  That digital experience
  grows into live connection.  It's important, especially in this climate, to
  give our youth access to these tools at home to guide them through this
  experience.  Expression through art will help create a future population of
  Angelenos that are more emotionally intelligent.  The program unites Angelenos
  around shared core values, experiences, and expression.  Making this knowledge
  accessible assists in relieving the angst that many of us are feeling and will
  have a positive impact on our mental health as we move through these uncertain
  times. 
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  Convergence & Freeborn Productions, in collaboration with Aim 4 the Heart,
  work as the for-profit vertical that will allow for Aim 4 the Heart to scale
  as a non-profit organization. We will be building out the infrastructure,
  county broad reach, brand integration & donations, live event actions, and
  volunteers to scale what has already successfully worked, to a more extensive
  scope of audiences and individuals.
