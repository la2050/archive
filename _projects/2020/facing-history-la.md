title: Facing History LA
project_summary: >-
  With LA2050 funds, Facing History will support over 9,000 Los Angeles teachers
  with timely professional development opportunities, tools and resources for
  guiding student inquiry into difficult issues and current events, from gun
  violence to hate crimes to ICE raids. As needed, we will help teachers pivot
  to distance learning strategies so they can keep students engaged and
  connected for the duration of the COVID-19 crisis. Together, teachers and
  Facing History will create a strong cohort of informed, compassionate,
  civically-engaged LA youth.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Facing History works with educators to inspire students to take an active role
  in the fight for tolerance and equity in their communities. The need for this
  work has been clear since long before COVID-19; civic knowledge and public
  engagement have been declining for decades, while racism, antisemitism and
  xenophobia have been on the rise. The COVID-19 crisis increases the urgency,
  as it dampens civic participation by isolating people from each other and has
  already triggered hateful rhetoric and actions. Anti-Asian racism is making
  headlines, as are anti-Semitic rants by white nationalist extremists. 


  While we expect schools to be back in session by fall, there is still
  considerable uncertainty and concern about the long-term impact of the current
  disruption. The need for support for educators in this moment is evident;
  since a statewide shelter-in-place order was announced for California, our
  webinars have seen record numbers of registrants and live participants.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Facing History is one of just four programs nationwide listed under the Every
  Student Succeeds Act as a strong evidence-based program for social emotional
  learning in high school, and one of just eight listed for middle school. Our
  proven approach combines social-emotional learning with rigorous academics to
  help students develop empathy and civic agency. We are poised to deliver
  professional development, online or in person, that will help educators
  sustain engagement and social-emotional development during school closures,
  through the transition back to the classroom, and beyond. Our teaching
  strategies and content help students address complex topics such as the rise
  of hate groups, the dangers of stereotyping, and how individual choices shape
  history. Our Current Events collection includes resources for addressing
  racism and antisemitism sparked by the spread of COVID-19; one, Coronavirus:
  Protect Yourself and Stand Against Racism, was recently recommended by the New
  York Times.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  The Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL) has
  selected Facing History as one of only nine social-emotional learning programs
  in the US that has a proven positive effect on students, including increased
  empathy, prosocial behavior, and a better classroom climate. Studies show that
  Facing History consistently impacts a range of social-emotional dispositions,
  boosting students’ capacity to:


  - Stand up for what they believe in, even when others disagree

  - Think critically about issues of racism and prejudice

  - Understand and feel for people who are different from them

  - Get along well with different types of people


  To maximize the number and diversity of students in Los Angeles County who are
  developing these traits, we must expand the number of LA teachers we are
  empowering. Therefore, we will gauge our success based on the goals outlined
  below (baselines for all metrics to be established upon grant award):


  - Increase the number of middle school and high school teachers in our LA
  network by 20% (teachers in our network receive emails announcing new
  resources, including webinars and Teaching Ideas, described below)

  - Increase the frequency of new Teaching Ideas to two per month

  - Increase the number of LA teachers who participate in our live webinars by
  50%

  - Increase the number of LA teachers who complete on-demand webinars by 50%
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '9000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '900000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Facing History empowers educators as change agents, providing the skills and
  resources they need to help students develop social and emotional skills and
  competencies—building voice, agency, empathy, and pro-social behavior. This
  work has impact well beyond the classroom: the lessons of history and the
  tools of critical thinking, civic participation, and empathy prepare students
  to stand up against hate and bias in their further education, their
  workplaces, and their neighborhoods. With funding from LA2050, Facing History
  will join with LA teachers and students to make Los Angeles more inclusive,
  more tolerant, and more just, with the ultimate goal of building a better,
  more compassionate world.
