Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CREATE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >
  There is an opportunity gap for low-income students of color to receive a high
  quality education that allows them to pursue a path to high-wage, high-demand
  careers. YBA narrows the opportunity gap by bringing industry into the
  classroom and offering relevant hands on curriculum and experiences that build
  a bridge for students to 21st century careers. 


  Recognizing that a high school student with entrepreneurial knowledge and
  problem-solving frameworks will be more attractive to any employer, we were
  motivated to extend the YBA program to provide a deep dive on entrepreneurship
  during a summer intensive program for YBA students that will form the
  foundation of a program available to hundreds of students during the school
  year as well. In response to the gap in self-paced career education learning
  tools for youth revealed by the COVID-19 school closures, digital program
  design and delivery will be prioritized for this project.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >
  YBA is committed to promoting career readiness for youth in low-income
  communities. Under normal circumstances, YBA reaches students in their high
  school classrooms, in partnership with their teacher. To promote year-round
  learning and develop new tools to reach students, we wish to develop an
  entrepreneurship program component that will reach students beyond their
  school walls. YBA's leadership team is composed of experts in the fields of
  education, entrepreneurship, innovation and positive youth development. YBA is
  in the midst of adapting program content to digital platforms to support our
  teachers and students during the pandemic school closures. Support for an
  entrepreneurship program component that can be delivered beyond the
  traditional school year will be a valuable opportunity to reach many more
  youth with information necessary for success in evolving environments.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  YBA youth who participate in the entrepreneurship program will gain confidence
  in exploring career options with high growth potential. Entrepreneurial
  knowledge and approaches prepare all young people to become analytical and
  adaptive problem-solvers for the emerging and evolving nature of 21st century
  careers. By participating in an immersive program, YBA youth will have a
  unique opportunity to learn these skills and practice them in an innovative
  setting. Real-world mentorship as well as team-based activities will be
  integrated. Young people who have a relationship with one or more trusted
  adults outside of their families have a stronger safety net and support system
  to navigate life decisions. YBA youth will gain this with our staff and
  volunteers through our intentional team-building and relationship-building
  approaches.


  Through the program’s activities, students will learn from a variety of
  professionals each day, having the opportunity to ask questions, share their
  own thoughts, and comfortably interact with adults and professionals through
  these repeated opportunities. This will prepare them for networking
  opportunities and professional relationship building that is important to
  career success.


  As students work on their business concepts and prepare a business plan, they
  will gain the tools needed for assessing opportunities, understanding the
  costs necessary to produce their product or service, and practicing financial
  analysis and planning. These skills have application for careers across many
  industries, and support the personal finance and budgeting skills students
  gain through YBA’s core curriculum. They will also create a PowerPoint and
  oral presentation for their pitch competition, improving their public speaking
  skills and creating a professional document to reflect their analysis.


  YBA’s curriculum expands students’ career options, prepares them for
  professional environments, instills healthy financial habits and sparks the
  entrepreneurial mindset. A successful project will demonstrate measurable
  gains in these areas for youth participants. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '600'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '1000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Free programs such as the one we are proposing are not widely available,
  especially for students in low-income communities. To promote even greater
  inclusivity and remove barriers to enrollment, YBA will offer the summer
  program at no cost. All students will receive meals, transportation stipends,
  an internship stipend, a laptop that they can keep and an opportunity to
  compete for a pool of seed capital. For our low-income families who rely on
  their teens to earn an income during summer break, we are providing a viable
  alternative that allows their students to continue learning, growing and
  building their career ready skills while receiving a stipend.
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >
  YBA will develop entrepreneurship programming to benefit students enrolled at
  YBA partner schools: LA Unified School District, Alliance for College Ready
  Schools, Green Dot Schools and community organizations. For programming
  offered during the school year, YBA staff on-board and train teachers in the
  YBA curriculum and program elements. Teachers receive on-going YBA staff
  support with scheduling weekly guest speakers and a field trip each semester.
  Local banks support the YBA program by offering guest speakers, field trips
  and funding to support the program. In addition, YBA has a network of 1,500
  guest speakers who serves as volunteers in each of YBA's classrooms, bringing
  the learning to life.


  YBA will partner with a program site for summer 2020 if in-person programming
  is possible.
