title: Camp Skyhook
project_summary: >-
  The Skyhook Foundation would like support for its project Camp Skyhook. Camp
  Skyhook at Clear Creek Outdoor Education Center is operated by LAUSD in
  collaboration with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's Skyhook Foundation. Camp Skyhook is
  an immersive, hands-on experience that brings together learning and the
  outdoors for 4th and 5th graders to inspire them towards a future in STEM
  fields. Founded in 1926, the site is located in the Angeles National Forest
  where nature becomes a multi-dimensional, multi-sensory experience in nature.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South LA
  - Westside
  - >-
    LAUSD (please select only if you have a district-wide partnership or
    project)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Quite frankly, science is not a priority in most elementary schools. By the
  time children reach middle school, they are not prepared to embark in studies
  related to STEM content areas. The results of the 2019 California State
  Science Assessment demonstrated that only 1/3 of students scored at or above
  grade level for science content knowledge. In response to this need, Camp
  Skyhook programs take science a dimension further. If you read about a
  subject, you’ve got the written word. A second dimension is that you hear
  about it. But real 3-dimensional learning allows us the touch, the feel, the
  weight of the equipment and standing on the site. Students have much more of
  an understanding and personal connection. We want students to build upon their
  experience at Camp Skyhook and gain a deeper understanding of STEM and
  learning creatively while exploring the outdoors. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  This project is important to us as is it provides an equal opportunity for an
  overnight residential program to all students free of cost. In collaboration
  with LAUSD-Office of Outdoor and Environmental Education (OOEE), Camp Skyhook
  provides expert instruction and support for high-risk populations such as
  foster youth, homeless youth, English Language Learners and children living in
  poverty. 

  We are uniquely suited to take on this because our partner, LAUSD, ensures
  that their staff receives sustained professional development from UCLA, NASA
  and other experts in the field of neuroscience, social emotional learning, and
  risk assessment. The majority of staff has many years of experience and often
  contributes to the improvement of curriculum. Often times, we think of
  education as limited to a formal classroom setting. However, there are types
  of learning that can best be facilitated outdoors. Where all the senses are
  enlivened.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Success is being measured by way of a two-year longitudinal study conducted by
  Occidental College. This research, a 56-school case study, is considered one
  of the most extensive and largest in the U.S. A review of pre/post evaluations
  as well as data derived from district records will evaluate science
  proficiency/content retention, social emotional learning as well as track
  attitudes about STEM. A treatment group will be compared to a control group
  from each school site in order to determine a relationship between improvement
  in participants versus non-participants of Camp Skyhook. Preliminary data
  demonstrates a 28% increase in science and engineering content retention vs
  the control group.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '2640'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '10000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  The heart of Camp Skyhook’s work involves connecting youth to STEM content and
  nature by eliminating barriers, providing resources, and promoting outdoor
  programming as essential for aspiring to be change leaders, building healthy
  lives and inspiring future stewards of the planet. The outdoors serves as an
  entry point that is relatable to all and serves to level the playing field. We
  want to fundamentally change approaches to teaching and learning. We are
  advocating for teaching the way kids learn. A focus on project-based teaching
  and more interactive instruction in the outdoors is the key to
  transformational experiences at Camp Skyhook.  The outdoors provides
  multi-sensory options for students to learn in their own learning modality.
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  Our partner LAUSD-Office of Outdoor& Environmental Education has a tremendous
  role in the project. The grounds of the campsite at Clear Creek Outdoor
  Education Center are leased by the LAUSD from the U.S. National Forest. This
  means that the staff maintains the grounds entirely. Additionally, the camp is
  staffed by LAUSD employees who have been rigorously vetted according to the
  LAUSD standards to work with children. Curriculum and the instructional focus
  are created in alignment with the LAUSD science program adopted at all
  elementary schools. Additional attention is given to the needs of special
  populations within the district including homeless youth, foster youth,
  English Language Learners and a large population (80%) living in poverty. 
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Access to the LA2050 community
  - 'Office space for meetings, events, or for staff'
  - Strategy assistance and implementation
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.: ''
Which metrics will your submission impact?:
  - Proficiency in STEM
Are there any other LA2050 goal categories that your proposal will impact?: []
Has your proposal changed due to COVID-19?: ''
