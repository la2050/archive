Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CREATE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - San Gabriel Valley
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Los Angeles County has the largest jail population nationwide. The 2,873
  individuals who exit LA County detention weekly face multiple barriers to
  successful reintegration, including employment restrictions and limited
  supportive services. (The Marshall Project, 2020) Data from the California
  Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation shows that 47% of individuals
  released from incarceration in Los Angeles County are re-convicted of a crime
  within 3 years. 


  Simultaneously, California is experiencing a massive labor shortage in the
  construction industry. The ratio of construction job openings to new hires, as
  measured by the Department of Labor, is at its highest level since 2007. In
  response, Flintridge Center facilitates the Apprenticeship Preparation
  Program, which prepares formerly incarcerated individuals for careers in union
  construction trades. The APP provides pathways to self-sufficiency while
  simultaneously creating a diverse workforce capable of meeting industry
  demand. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Flintridge Center has provided economic opportunities to the formerly
  incarcerated since 2007. The Apprenticeship Preparation Program (APP) is
  unique in its integration of trauma-informed care and workforce development.
  All staff who facilitate the APP are themselves formerly incarcerated; three
  are former graduates. The APP is continuously improved based on outcomes,
  participant feedback, and evolving best practices. The program is overseen by
  an Advisory Council that includes graduates, justice system agencies, building
  trades unions, and construction contractors.


  In 2017, the California Workforce Development Board selected Flintridge to
  build the capacity of workforce development programs throughout the State to
  serve formerly incarcerated individuals. In 2018, Flintridge was named
  California’s 41st Assembly District’s Nonprofit of the Year –Assemblymember
  Chris Holden stated, “Their successful reintegration services should be
  modeled throughout the state.”
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Over the course of the grant period, Flintridge Center will facilitate three
  cohorts of the Apprenticeship Preparation Program (APP), directly impacting
  100 individuals. Flintridge measures success by the recidivism (3-year
  reconviction) rate of APP graduates and employment outcomes. Less than 15% of
  APP graduates will recidivate, compared to the Los Angeles County rate of 47%.
  Recidivism is measured using publicly available data from the LA County
  Sherriff’s Department Inmate Locator. At least 70% of graduates will be
  employed in union apprenticeships or other sectors within one year of
  graduation. Employment outcomes are measured through ongoing case management
  with graduates, communication with employers, and workforce manager databases.


  Qualitative outcomes will include (1) trauma reduction – improvement in stress
  management, self-esteem, anger management, interpersonal communication skills,
  and changes in thinking patterns - as measured by a pre- and post- program
  assessment (2) positive and negative experiences with project services as
  measured by focus groups with program graduates and Flintridge staff. These
  outcomes consistently inform program development, delivery and expansion. 


  The long-term outcomes of the project will be (1) increased self-sufficiency
  across the formerly incarcerated community leading to generational economic
  advancement for individuals and their families (2) a diverse and inclusive
  workforce (3) a more equitable Los Angeles.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '100'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '500'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  The Apprenticeship Preparation Program (APP) advances equity by creating
  economic opportunities for the formerly incarcerated. In the past 40 years,
  the U.S. incarcerated population has increased by 500%, disproportionately
  disadvantaging communities of color. In 2017, African Americans represented
  12% of the U.S. adult population but 33% of the incarcerated population;
  Latinx represented 16% of the population but accounted for 23% of inmates. The
  APP’s service population is 57% Latinx and 25% African American. Participants
  are often siblings, cousins, friends, or children of past graduates. At
  Flintridge, we understand that when you change the life of one person, you
  change the life of their families and the communities we all live in.
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  While we are not submitting a collaborative proposal, Flintridge Center places
  a high organizational value on collaboration. We understand that the diverse
  and unique needs of formerly incarcerated individuals are best met by a
  network of partners working collectively. The Apprenticeship Preparation
  Program specifically partners with 2nd Call to provide trauma-informed life
  skills classes and  CATZ gym to provide physical fitness training. These
  services will be supported with leveraged funds.
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Access to the LA2050 community
  - Host public events or gatherings
  - Communications support
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.: ''
Which metrics will your submission impact?:
  - Income inequality
  - Economic opportunities for formerly incarcerated
  - Unemployment rate
Are there any other LA2050 goal categories that your proposal will impact?: []
Has your proposal changed due to COVID-19?: >
  As Los Angeles County and California move to slow the spread of COVID-19 in
  jails and prisons, a growing number of individuals are being released from
  incarceration. Compounding existing barriers, individuals are exiting
  incarceration to a landscape greatly altered by the pandemic, facing limited
  supportive services and employment opportunities. The pandemic is also
  disproportionately impacting communities of color, exposing deep health and
  economic inequities. Flintridge Center will adapt and expand the
  Apprenticeship Preparation Program model to meet emerging community needs and
  address disparities.


  Instructors will facilitate the program virtually over 7 weeks: core
  components will include intensive case management, trauma-informed life
  skills, and employment development trainings. In addition to individualized
  support, program participants will receive necessary technology to complete
  the course, industry-recognized credentials, and weekly stipends.


  Recognizing that there may be potentially fewer opportunities in union
  construction because of the pandemic, program scope will expand to support
  individuals in seeking employment in emerging industries. Flintridge Center’s
  team will continue to adapt program elements based on emerging participant
  needs, feedback and outcomes for the duration of this crisis. Goals for the
  program during this time remain the same: to provide economic opportunities,
  decrease recidivism, and create a more equitable Los Angeles.
