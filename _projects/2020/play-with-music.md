title: Play with Music
project_summary: >-
  We're ready to expand our in-school and after school programs to 4 more
  schools (2 semesters at each school). Each program brings 8-10 professional
  artists to create original music with students. Students learn the ropes by
  doing it with pro's, touching all aspects of the creative process, including
  technology and business. We prioritize equipping students with the skills,
  knowledge, relationships and opportunities to start their careers through our
  program, including field trips and internship opportunities in addition to
  weekly sessions.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CREATE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Creativity, collaboration, and critical thinking are considered the most
  important skills for the 21st century, yet our schools, especially in low
  income communities, are missing the corresponding classes and programs to
  build these skills. Every child has potential, but not every child has access
  to opportunities to develop it. We're responding to this problem. We're
  building and delivering programs that meet this need. We're also bringing the
  enormous talent and resources of the creative industry in Los Angeles to
  students in South LA to expand their horizons with opportunities for learning,
  networking and seeding creative careers.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >
  Play with Music was created solely to bring programs fostering creative career
  paths and professional collaboration to youth in communities without access to
  it. Teaming up with our new partner, Two Bit Circus Foundation (2BCF), who has
  taken PWM under its umbrella, we're able to uplift and cultivate a new
  generation of creators. 2BCF, a California education organization,
  collaborates with educators PreK-12 to support science, technology,
  engineering, art, music and mathematics (STEAM) education. Its programs
  transform the classroom from lecture-centered into MAKER-based experimental
  labs of inquisition, critical thinking, and re-imagining.  2BCF works
  primarily, but not exclusively, with teachers and students from PreK-12 Title
  I schools, which remain chronically underfunded and under-resourced in
  materials that are needed for project-based learning.   Overall, 2BCF’s
  students are 31% African American, 53% Hispanic, 1% American Indian, 6% Asian,
  and 9% Caucasian. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Our vision for success is to provide modern, relevant, immersive programs that
  equip youth with the creative skills, support and connections they need to
  thrive in the creative industry of Los Angeles. We hope to expand our program
  that has served Locke High School in Watts for 3 years to progWe define
  success by:

  -Student retention and graduation rates

  -Number of internships/apprenticeships and career opportunities secured for
  students

  -Student surveys

  -Teacher / school administrator surveys

  -Professional artist surveys


  We know we're successful when students, schools and artists ask for the
  program to come back (which has been the case since we started!)
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '700'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '2100'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  We primarily work in Watts in South Los Angeles, one of the most systemically
  underserved neighborhoods in LA county, with some of our highest crime rates,
  food insecurity and poverty levels. Our proposal brings tangible opportunities
  to youth in South LA to become creators, to collaborate with professionals and
  develop relationships and pathways for their careers. The impact is uplifting
  and empowering this yet unseen and unheard creative generation by simply
  building bridges that bring the music and creative industry powerhouse TO the
  youth of South LA. We are breaking down socio-economic barriers, cycles of
  poverty, the creativity deficit, the tech literacy gap and the injustice of
  unequal access to opportunities and creative jobs. 
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  Play with Music brings the content and expertise of the creative program
  (bringing artists to work with students, the curriculum itself, field trips
  and internship opportunities, etc). Green Dot Public Schools is our
  educational administrative partner that Play with Music has worked with since
  2015. We'll work together to create and meet metrics of success and expand our
  existing programs to reach more students at more schools. The Two Bit Circus
  Foundation is Play with Music's newest partner, who not only brings passion
  and expertise in bringing STEAM education programs to schools and spaces, but
  also the highest level of administrative and operations experience and
  personnel needed to scale Play with Music to 4 more schools.
