title: Connect LA Families!
project_summary: >-
  Connect LA Families will give children with disabilities and their families, a
  historically vulnerable population, access to the vital social/emotional
  benefits of community connection. Your investment will provide inclusion
  grants to 5 community-based organizations in low-income LA neighborhoods who
  will implement inclusion programming at their local inclusive playgrounds.
  Inclusion Matters will provide training, online resources, and deliver our
  education program to surrounding schools, thus deepening their social
  inclusion network.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South LA
  - >-
    LAUSD (please select only if you have a district-wide partnership or
    project)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Children with disabilities frequently face isolation both in their communities
  and schools. In one study on young adults with Autism, 1 in 4 who participated
  had absolutely no peer contact in a 12-month period. In a school setting,
  children with disabilities are 60% more likely to be involved in bullying.
  This lack of social interaction, which provides critical developmental
  benefits, and continued negative peer experiences can impact lives well into
  adulthood. One study found that 85% of the adults with disabilities who
  reported losing their jobs did so due to a lack of social skills. There are
  almost 65,000 children with disabilities in LAUSD. We are a diverse city, and
  now more than ever, the most vulnerable families need to connect in a truly
  inclusive and meaningful way. Connect LA Families will level the playing field
  by empowering community organizations to create compassionate connections in
  their neighborhoods.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  At Inclusion Matters by Shane’s Inspiration, we believe our communities are
  stronger when we play together! For over 20 years, we have been helping Los
  Angeles neighborhoods create inclusive community play spaces. There are 42
  open in Los Angeles County. In 2002, we began two social inclusion programs
  that activate these community spaces because we realized families were not
  utilizing them due to the social/emotional bias their children experienced in
  public…stares, rude comments, questions, and peers excluding them. Overcoming
  this barrier required an intentional structure that supported our families
  socially and emotionally. My PlayClub, our successful and proven family
  program, provides a powerful social network for families of all abilities
  through fully integrated play events and online resources. Our education
  program extends that connection into those children’s schools, educating their
  teachers and peers on how to facilitate social inclusion on their campuses.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: "We are scaling up My PlayClub, which has been a social lifeline for thousands of families since we began delivering it, in communities throughout Los Angeles by partnering with 5 non-profit organizations (grantee) in low-income, diverse communities to replicate the program. Each will receive:\n\n-A $5,000 inclusion grant to implement the program,\n- Staff, parent, and volunteer social inclusion training both in-person and online,\n-Together, We Are Able implementation by our staff in their local schools,\n- Sustainability planning support in the areas of fundraising, events, and social media messaging/outreach for families with disabilities.\n\nSuccess will be defined as:\n*\tA minimum of 8 inclusive play events held by the grantees at 5 identified inclusive playgrounds over the grant period (40 total)\n*\tA community inclusion review at each grantee’s organization and gaps in inclusion identified for families of children with disabilities\n*\tA social inclusion social media plan developed and implemented by each grantee\n*\tA minimum of 2 social inclusion trainings with each grantee (10 total)\n*\tA minimum of 3 additional inclusion partnerships developed by each grantee in their community to support ongoing inclusion (15 new partnerships total)\n\nAll families will receive surveys post events to refine and improve community connection services and events. We will hold monthly meetings with our partner organizations to assess progress, and two written financial/program reports will be provided by each grant recipient."
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '150'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '2657'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Most of the children served by Connect Families LA will be between the ages of
  1 and 13 and come from a variety of socio-economic circumstances. The children
  we work with have a wide range of conditions, which include Cerebral Palsy,
  Down Syndrome, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Fragile Bone Disease, Rhetts
  Syndrome, Visual Impairment, Deafness, and many others. Many of our children
  have multiple disabilities, which result in both physical and mental
  impairments, and most of the students that participate in our programs are
  classified as having moderate to severe disabilities. Of the children we work
  with, 80% of them attend Title 1, which is an indicator of poverty.
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  We have a 20-year track record of building strong partners that support social
  inclusion for Los Angeles’ diverse communities. Mike Shull, General Manager of
  Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks, has been a powerful partner,
  helping to support the development of inclusive playgrounds since 1998. LAUSD
  has partnered with our education program since 2002, connecting us to more
  than 250 schools. Organizations such as Best Start, First 5 LA, regional
  centers, Exceptional Children’s Foundation, Head Start, CHLA, and many more
  have connected families to both gather input into the design of the
  playgrounds and participate in our programs. We will utilize these existing
  partnerships to identify sustainable grantees for Connect Families LA to scale
  up inclusion for our families.
