title: Community Scale Composting across L.A County
project_summary: >
  LA Compost’s programs serve individuals with home composting opportunities,
  communities with education and access to a decentralized network of composting
  infrastructure, and the broader Los Angeles County area through regional sites
  for organics processing, compost creation, and continued education. By
  establishing new composting communities throughout Los Angeles, we will
  further reduce food waste, empower local food production, and regenerate land
  for climate resilience.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >
  Over one million tons of compostable food goes into LA's landfills every year,
  causing severe negative impacts on the environment. Rotting food scraps emit
  methane, one of the largest contributors to global warming, and liquid from
  the organic matter in landfills mixes with chemicals and contaminates our
  groundwater supply. 


  LA Compost mitigates these harmful effects by turning waste into a resource
  for healthy soil development. Our compost systems help to reduce landfill
  methane emissions and increase carbon storage capacity in soils, while
  supporting the creation of a sustainable, locally-based food system in LA
  County. 


  One of the root causes of environmental destruction is a disassociation with
  the natural world and there is a growing disconnect between our overall
  ability to trace food to back to the soil. LA Compost works to heal the
  disconnect between people and the soil and create healthy soil through
  participation, empowerment and education in the benefits of compost.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >
  LA Compost oversees 33 compost hubs throughout LA County that are available
  for food scrap drop off and compost education. Collectively these hubs have
  the capacity to divert one million pounds of food waste to be recovered as a
  valued resource for local communities. 


  We understand that soil health is vital to the health and wellbeing of
  individuals and the environment. By completing the story of food from farm to
  table and back to the land, we empower communities to participate in
  regenerating the health of our soils and our souls.


  Our programs result in positive social, economic and environmental impacts
  throughout Los Angeles, including:

  Reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing carbon sequestration; 

  Shifting individual and cultural perception of a broken food system into a
  regenerative food system; 

  Developing healthy connections to the diverse ecology in LA; 

  Healing our soils and communities through participation, empowerment and
  education in the benefits of compost.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  In the coming year, LA Compost will continue to build local infrastructure,
  expand educational programs, and grow our network in furtherance of our
  mission. We will define success as achieving our goal of establishing four new
  farmers market drop-off locations for food scraps and opening a total of five
  new community and regional compost hubs – with the potential to divert an
  additional 270 tons of inedible food waste each year.
   
  Food systems are inextricably intertwined with health, environmental, social
  and economic issues. LA Compost envisions a model for our food systems that is
  focused on soil health, rooted in equity and invested in individual
  empowerment. Our work developing healthy soils addresses issues including
  access to clean food, air and water pollution, access to green spaces, and job
  creation in a sector that is aligned with regenerating natural resources and
  stabilizing our climate.
   
  Our vision is that our programs: (1) shift individual and cultural perception
  of a broken food system into a regenerative food system, (2) allow people to
  develop healthy connections to the diverse ecology in LA, and ultimately, (3)
  heal our soils and communities through participation, empowerment and
  education in the benefits of compost.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '4000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '12000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: "LA Compost seeks to benefit local communities and the environment in the following ways:\n*\tNatural Solutions to Climate Change. Healthy soil removes excess carbon from the air and stores it in the ground.\n*\tWater Retention for Drought Tolerance. Compost acts as a natural sponge, storing water in the soil for plants to use when needed.\n*\tReducing Waste and Emissions at Landfills. Making food waste part of the solution to climate change as opposed to part of the problem is an enormous benefit to composting.\n*\tGrowing Healthy Food and building local resiliency. Compost supports local food production while providing green jobs, allowing people to support their communities through soil building and food growing.\n"
