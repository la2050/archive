Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  On average, there are 35,000 children under the protection of DCFS in LA
  county. Among them, 600-800 are Asian Pacific Islanders (API). KFAM's Asian
  Foster Family Initiative is the first and only foster family agency in the
  U.S. that specializes in serving the needs of API foster children and
  families. AFFI was launched in 2014 by KFAM to provide more API foster
  families to take care of API foster children who frequently face linguistic
  and/or cultural barriers in non-API foster homes. AFFI recruit, train,
  approves, and supports foster families as well as placing foster children to
  matching foster families. In 2019, we were able to help 23 foster children and
  2 children have been adopted. However, we also had to turn away over a dozen
  children to non-Asian homes because we didn't have enough homes to meet their
  needs. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Prior to 2014, there were very few API resource (foster) families in the
  greater LA area, including zero active Korean American resource families
  available to provide culturally appropriate homes to API foster children. Five
  years later, thanks to KFAM’s Asian Foster Family Initiative (AFFI), there are
  50+ approved API resource parents ready to provide culturally and
  linguistically specific care for API children in need of out-of-home
  placement.  In 2016, KFAM became the first and only licensed Foster Family
  Agency (FFA) in the nation specializing in the needs of API foster children
  and families. We have also facilitated several adoptions of API children who
  were surrendered by their parents. In 2018, KFAM became CARF certified,
  accrediting our program and services as high quality and oriented around
  person served. AFFI is active within the Korean, Chinese and Filipino
  communities, with bilingual staff, trainings and programming offered in
  Korean, Mandarin, Cantonese and Tagalog. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  Objective 1 – Outreach & Recruitment: AFFI is launching a new recruitment
  strategy called “Family 2 Family” this year partnering with its experienced
  resource families.  The experienced families will be incentivized and
  encouraged to recruit others by initiating small outreach gatherings to share
  their experience. AFFI staff will help facilitate and support. AFFI will
  continue the outreach through media placement and community engagement info
  sessions and orientation. 

  Measurements: 20+ potential resource families to sign up for 20+ hour
  training.


  Objective 2 – Parenting Education for Fostering Teens: Increase the number of
  resource families who are willing to foster teenagers, which are a
  hard-to-place population. Measurements: 7+ resource families who are willing
  to take teenagers.


  Objective 3 – Support Groups:  KFAM’s FFA will conduct 2-4 support group
  events for API resource parents. Measurements: 20+ API resource families will
  attend support groups.


  Objective 4 – Basic Needs: Foster youth and their families have an increased
  need under the current coronavirus pandemic for basic needs, such as
  groceries, clothing, school supplies, and utilities. Measurements: Up to 10
  API youth and their families will receive financials support to cover basic
  necessities, as families have been financially severely impacted due to
  layoffs. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '350'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '5000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Statistics show that foster children have the poorest educational outcomes of
  all at-risk groups – only 58% of kids in foster care graduate high school
  compared to 84% of the general statewide population. Only 2% of foster kids
  graduate from a 4-year college. We are determined to see significantly higher
  percentages of our kids graduate from high school and college than these
  statistics. 


  We all can help out in high risk youth in need through the programs and it’s
  truly changing the trajectory of their lives.
