Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CREATE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - San Gabriel Valley
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South LA
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Now more than ever diverse communities not only need access to health and
  wellness opportunities, they also need culturally relevant and competent
  practitioners. Unfortunately, there are many barriers for underserved
  communities to obtain the yoga training necessary to safely and effectively
  serve communities. People’s Yoga aims to fill the gap by offering affordable
  payment options and scholarships to support the development of yoga teachers
  who understand the unique lived experiences of the communities they come from.

  As a small, mama of color owned business we are only able to offer a handful
  of scholarships each year. With the support of LA2050 grant funds, we will be
  able to grow our impact by expanding our yoga teacher training program to
  offer more scholarship opportunities and community-focused yoga training like
  family yoga, yoga en español, and prenatal/postnatal yoga
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  For the past three years, People’s Yoga has successfully offered Yoga Teacher
  training to the greater Los Angeles area and beyond. Our 200-Hour training
  course offers a mindful and community focused approach to bridging yoga with
  social change, and aims to develop and encourage a new generation of leaders
  who will advocate for, and create access to, health and wellness. We have
  developed a unique and powerful yoga teacher training model that centers
  accessibility, inclusivity, sustainability, decolonized healing, community
  care, and conscious entrepreneurship. Majority of our graduates are women of
  color, older adults, and LGBTQ+ folks who are dedicated to serving their
  community and growing supportive networks by offering healing modalities where
  limited to no options are available. Many of our graduates have returned to
  People’s Yoga to offer donation based yoga classes in our studio and free
  classes through our community partnerships.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  In the short term, we plan to train 50 new yoga teachers and offer six
  continuing education opportunities to approximately 120 existing yoga teachers
  by the end of the grant period. In the long term, we aim to have 50 new yoga
  teachers offering regular yoga classes in their respective communities,
  reaching at least 50 community members each. We also will work to connect yoga
  graduates and trained yoga specialists to community based projects and
  non-profit organizations to develop long-term teaching contract partnerships. 


  Our key performance indicators include:

  -50 new yoga graduates (graduation rates, Participant demographics)

  -Host six speciality yoga training sessions for approximately 120 certified
  yoga teachers. (Track attendance, demographics of attendees, dates and
  locations of trainings)

  -At least 60% of recently trained graduates offer community yoga classes
  within one year of the Training program (Follow-up surveys with yoga
  graduates)

  -Establish 5-10 partnerships with community-based organizations and
  non-profits to offer yoga classes to their staff and/or participants.
  (MOU/contract agreements with partner organizations) 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '170'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '2500'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  There has been a self-care boom in popular society in recent years. All over
  social media you can learn about the importance of self-care and wellness.
  Unfortunately, access is a major barrier for low income communities of color
  and other underserved communities. Even though communities understand the
  value of self-care and wellness practices, many people do not have the time,
  resources, local infrastructure or support to take action. Our proposal works
  to ease barriers and lead a wellness culture shift in underserved communities
  by training community members to bring healing services back to their
  neighborhoods. When yoga instructors reflect the fabric of communities, the
  possibilities for radical community transformation are endless.
