title: Women's Community Health & Wellness Facility
project_summary: >
  Everything Wellness will use the grant to open a full-service fitness facility
  in South LA for women. The facility will breakdown women’s perceived barriers
  to participating in physical fitness programs in a safe and uplifting
  environment. We will offer group fitness, individual training, cardio, weight
  machines, spa services, workshops, health screenings, & community gardening.
  We believe that overall health and fitness is more than just a fitness
  facility it is about community and how we encourage each other toward a
  greater quality of life.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to PLAY
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Applying a proven model or solution to a new issue or sector (e.g, using a job
  recruiting software or strategy to match clients to supportive housing sites,
  applying demonstrated strategies from advocating for college affordability to
  advocating for housing affordability and homelessness, etc.)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >+
  The project will respond to the health & fitness needs of women in South LA
  giving them access to an affordable full-service fitness facility in a safe &
  nurturing environment. 60% of U.S. women do not engage in the recommended
  amount of physical activity & 25% are not active at all. However, regular
  physical activity improves health, fitness, & helps to maintain a healthy
  weight, reducing the risk of chronic disease.  Women of color have high rates
  of inactivity leading to higher incidents of obesity, heart disease, and other
  chronic illnesses. We are proposing the creation of a fitness center that will
  target women in the South LA area who are predominately African American and
  Hispanic. 68% of African American women and 62% of Hispanic Women
  self-reported that they are overweight or obese. The South LA community does
  not have a full-service fitness facility that services women of all ages that
  is financially and geographically accessible. 





Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >+
  Women encounter many barriers to participation in physical activity such as
  embarrassment, intimidation & lack of body confidence. We will create an
  uplifting environment that will nurture & make members feel that they are a
  part of a supportive fitness community. We will assemble a staff of certified
  instructors that will offer group fitness classes & individual personal
  training. The fitness facility will be a life-changing facility by offering
  motivational speakers & intermittent workshops on a variety of topics ranging
  from finance to nutrition. We also hope to cultivate a relationship with a
  health facility so that we can offer health screenings.  Additionally, studies
  show fruit & vegetable consumption is lower among African Americans &
  Hispanics; it is our intent to create a community garden that the members can
  choose to tend & will be able to harvest to take home. The facility will help
  foster improvement in mood and feelings of wellness in women in South LA.

Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  The vision for our fitness center is to create a place that is surrounded by
  an urban sanctuary that aims to inspire healthy connections with the community
  and the environment.  The woman’s fitness center will serve to promote an
  ecosystem that creates a healthy mind, body, and community effort. The Fitness
  center’s primary focus will be on group classes and personal training. A
  secondary focus will be to address the lack of green space and the difficulty
  of buying affordable fresh foods. To address both concerns is to create a
  fitness center for all women and create a community garden that provides
  aesthetic appeal and fresh, healthy produce to all. The community garden will
  assist in financial savings to those unemployed and those with low incomes.
  Short-term goal would be to open the woman’s fitness center with group fitness
  classes first.  Long-term goal would be in building out to include more
  equipment and spa services. The short-term goal for the community garden would
  be to implement 4-6 raised beds for growing. Long-term goal would be to
  gradually increase and include partnerships. The measure to define success
  would be implementing a gym software system that tracks memberships,
  retention, and a detailed workflow system that tracks gym and community garden
  performance.  The outcomes will be those that create a strong community,
  interacting with our members and neighbors, and using technology to frame this
  revolutionary business model.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '800'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '2400'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >
  Better health and fitness in women translates into better health for their
  families. Globally overweight infants & young children increased from 32
  million in 1990 to 41 million in 2016. In the US 13.7 million children and
  adolescents aged 2-19 years are obese and those rates rise significantly for
  African American and Hispanic children to 22% and 25.8% respectively. Other
  studies show that a healthy lifestyle of the mother during an offspring’s
  childhood and adolescence was associated with a 75% lower risk of those
  children developing obesity. These findings highlight the impact of a mother’s
  health & fitness on their families. Our fitness facility will potentially
  affect the health and well being of hundreds of people living in South LA.
