Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: ' LA currently does not have a movement studio that prioritizes Queer, Disabled, Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC.) Downtown LA is emerging as a center of queer nightlife and community. It''s central location makes it also accessible to disabled and BIPOC populations. Good Trouble Makers and Downtown Dance & Movement are joining forces to address the absence of movement based programming that centers artists and members of these communities. '
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >+
  Good Trouble Makers (GTM) already serve BIPOC, disabled, and creative
  communities offering classes, community gatherings, parties, and performances
  making us uniquely qualified to expand programming for these communities.
  GTM's shared leadership is a diverse reflection of the communities we share
  and is guided by a mission statement that centers diversity, equity, and
  inclusivity.  


  Centrally located in downtown LA, Downtown Dance & Movement (DDM)  was
  designed to be fully level and easily navigated by physically disabled people
  who are so often completely invisible in the performing arts, especially
  dance. With their gender neutral bathrooms facilities DDM makes a perfect
  partner. Together GTM and DDM have already run In Progress to serve the
  populations centered in both organizations missions and hosted 2 years of
  classes centering queer folx, people of color, and disabled artists and
  community members.

Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Success for this project would look like robust attendance for our classes,
  returning clientele, and a strong community. This will be measured by: 


  1. Collecting data on program participants from artists, students, and
  audiences that prove the majority of our participants are a part of the BIPOC,
  disabled, and queer communities)

  2. Mailing list growth, indicating new people joining our community

  3. An upward trend in attendance numbers which will be measured by tracking
  attendance at classes and events

  3. Post event and workshop surveys indicating positive experiences by
  attendees 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '30'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '500'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >+
  In Progress will have a profound impact in the disabled, queer and POC
  communities in Los Angeles, both in terms of accessibility to the arts and
  overall emotional health. To have a program that centers the distinct needs of
  these communities is incredibly vital, as everyone deserves to have
  representation that speaks directly to them and their lived experiences. By
  creating and funding a dance program that showcases accessible social and
  concert dance, downtown Los Angeles would not only be serving its diverse and
  intersectional communities, but would also be serving as an example to other
  cities that accessible arts programs are both possible and necessary.
