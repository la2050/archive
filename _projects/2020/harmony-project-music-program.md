title: Harmony Project Music Program
project_summary: >-
  Harmony Project will expand by enrolling more students into our music program.
  We will provide a safe and secure place for more than 3,500 students to go
  after school and on Saturdays. The program will engage students in sequential
  music instruction, opportunities to learn alongside their peers through
  ensembles, and comprehensive academic and social support. Additionally, we
  will promote strong communities through the incorporation of parent
  engagement, student performances open and advertised to the public, and a
  strong network of partners.

What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Harmony Projects seeks to empower communities through high quality arts
  experiences and in doing so, create a touchpoint for holistic support and
  resources. After school programs are essential in fostering safe communities.
  The period between 3:00-7:00 p.m. are peak hours for juvenile crime or
  victimization and experimentation with drugs, alcohol, cigarettes and sex. We
  use this time to help students grow, develop skills, and foster safe, positive
  community spaces.


  Our students come from historically marginalized communities and as a result,
  many face socioeconomic barriers, including inadequate educational and
  supportive resources. Our leadership recognized that we could not adequately
  serve our youth if we focused solely on music learning and glossed over the
  unique vulnerabilities our students face. In response, we established the
  Community and Relational Engagement (CARE) team, which provides educational
  workshops, community resources, as well as social emotional support.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >
  Harmony Project has been involved in this work for nearly 20 years. Our
  program is unique in that we engage students throughout their entire
  childhood--from kindergarten through 12th grade and that we are dedicated to
  the social emotional needs of our students and families. These two aspects of
  our programming truly sets us apart in the landscape of music learning. We
  recognize that our students may be dealing with challenges and we give them
  the space and resources to address them in order to thrive in our music
  program.


  Further, collaboration is integral to the effectiveness of our program. Each
  of our 17 program hubs works in partnership with network of partners and we
  weave together the many resources each community offers. We have more than 50
  partners who share our commitment to the communities we serve, including LA
  County Department of Parks and Recreation, the Compton Sheriff’s Department,
  the Los Angeles Unified School District’s Beyond the Bell, and LA Phil.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  Our vision for success entails increasing our service population by enrolling
  students off our extensive waitlist of 1000+ students, simultaneously
  maintaining the high quality of our program and comprehensive wraparound
  services. We aim to create an equitable playing field for our students while
  also cultivating strong communities through public performances and activating
  partnerships with entities that take stake in our communities.


  Throughout Harmony Project’s history, we have achieved a high retention rate
  year to year and a high attendance rate. We will continue to see this as a
  sign of impact and success. Additionally, survey results show that 92% of
  parents feel their child is safe when in Harmony Project classes and 87% of
  parents feel that Harmony Project has had a positive impact on their
  connection to their community. 


  Evaluation of our program is an organizational priority. Our data manager
  oversees the collection and reporting of evaluations, which allows us to
  inform our program in real time, effectively evaluate the needs of our
  population, as well as identify opportunities for tailored improvement. We
  will measure the wider engagement of the communities we serve through 
  audience attendance, parent engagement, and partner involvement. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '3500'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '7000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >
  While we know that music education is transformational, our work runs much
  deeper. We recognize that the children and families we work with face systemic
  inequities that can be difficult to overcome. Above all, Harmony Project
  provides safe spaces for children after school and on Saturdays, where they
  are shown a pathway to achieve their ambitions, no matter what those are. We
  envision a Los Angeles where every child has access to after school
  experiences that foster excellence and provide guidance, where community
  members have access to arts and culture experiences, and where community
  entities create a robust network of opportunity and support for their
  neighbors.
