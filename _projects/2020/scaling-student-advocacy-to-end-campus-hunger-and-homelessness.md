title: Scaling Student Advocacy to End Campus Hunger and Homelessness
project_summary: >-
  Rise is building an online training program to teach college students how to
  address student hunger and homelessness on their campus. We will prepare 40
  student organizing fellows--predominantly students of color and students from
  low-income backgrounds--to train 25 students each to advocate for solutions to
  campus hunger and homelessness. Rise’s digital curriculum and training program
  will enable students to lead campaigns even if their campuses do not reopen
  during the grant period because of the coronavirus.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - South LA
  - Westside
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  As many as 1 in 5 Los Angeles Community College students experiences
  homelessness, and 2 in 3 face food insecurity according to 2016 research from
  the Hope Center for College, Community, and Justice. Rise’s own survey
  research from March 2020 suggests that the coronavirus outbreak has
  exacerbated this basic needs crisis by causing unexpected layoffs and campus
  closures. This project will build on the basic needs advocacy campaigns Rise
  launched on 4 college campuses with 25 student organizers in 2019 through the
  LA2050 Grants Challenge. To meet the growing demand for basic needs programs,
  as well as students’ overwhelming desire to participate in this advocacy, Rise
  plans to lead an online advocacy course in 2020. In partnership with existing
  student organizations, we will train 1,000 or more students to scale our
  campaign to end student hunger and homelessness in Los Angeles. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Rise is the leading student advocacy organization dedicated to college
  affordability. Our work is dedicated not only to the idea that all students
  deserve to be healthy and safely housed on their path to graduation, but also
  that student advocates are best positioned to lead this change. 


  Outside of LA2050, Rise has led campaigns to make 2 years of community college
  tuition-free in California and stop tuition hikes at the California State
  University and University of California systems. However, if students in Los
  Angeles continue to struggle with food and housing needs on a large scale,
  those wins and policy changes will not deliver on their full potential to help
  all students. This project is essential to fulfilling the promise of those
  policy victories by ensuring that when we tell students that “community
  college is free,” they know that also means they will be free from hunger and
  homelessness on their path to graduation. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  This project will succeed if we scale our LA2050 Advocacy Corps across 20 or
  more campuses and institutionalize them with a sustainable growth model (e.g.,
  creating partnerships with existing campus organizations that receive funding
  as a registered student organization). This approach is crucial because Rise’s
  first year building the LA2050 Advocacy Corps has underscored the need for
  multi-year advocacy. Our strategy informs the metrics we have selected for
  this project: 


  I) Leading a high quality online advocacy course measured through pre and post
  surveys. 


  II) Teaching 40 student organizing fellows to lead basic needs advocacy
  trainings via our online curriculum, measuring quality through pre and post
  surveys of their trainees. 


  III) Increasing the number of campuses with basic needs advocacy campaigns
  from 4 in ‘19-’20 to 20 in ‘20-’21.


  IV) Building a network of 1,000 student advocates through partnerships. These
  student advocates will be trained by our student organizing fellows to carry
  out our basic needs advocacy campaigns digitally and/or on campus.


  V) Engaging 20,000 students in advocacy actions. In 2019, the average number
  of students engaged by Rise’s LA2050 Advocacy Corps on any campus was ~1,000.
  This number refers to the number of students who have taken an advocacy action
  with Rise (e.g., signing a petition, showing up to an event, or sharing their
  story). Applying this metric to the 2020-2021 program, Rise’s indirect reach
  from advocacy will be at least 20,000 students (1,000 students X 20
  campuses).  


  VI) Measuring increases in students' access to nonprofit or public benefits
  using data provided by campuses where Rise has an established campaign (e.g.,
  a new food pantry at Los Angeles Trade Tech College serves 300% more students
  by becoming permanent and full-time). 


  When campuses deliver on the changes students advocate for, the resulting
  increases in food and housing security among students will increase college
  matriculation and college completion in Los Angeles. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '1040'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '20000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >
  Our proposal will:

  - Benefit low-income communities and communities of color: If these
  communities can access basic needs resources, they will be more likely to
  enroll in and graduate from college, creating a more equitable higher
  education system in Los Angeles.

  - Destigmatize student hunger and homelessness: By changing the cultural
  perception of hunger and homelessness, we are creating a safe place for
  students to come forward and seek help, as opposed to feeling shame and
  isolation. 

  - Highlight institutional responsibility and action: Our advocacy puts
  pressure on higher education institutions to stay true to their commitment to
  student learning by investing resources in the basic needs that students
  require to graduate.
