title: Report for Los Angeles
project_summary: >-
  In 2020, Report for America will field four full-time 'corps members' -
  emerging journalists - who will report on under-covered communities and topics
  in the greater Los Angeles area: environment and sustainability; homelessness,
  affordable housing, and development; education and young people;
  transportation; and minority communities. In partnership with existing local
  news organizations, we will ensure Los Angeles has the local news it needs and
  deserves to inform more equitable community growth and development for all
  people.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Nearly 1,500 communities across the United States no longer have sufficient
  basic news and thousands must turn to hollowed out newsrooms whose reporting
  resources have been decimated.


  And while many may not think of Los Angeles as a "news desert," local
  reporting has dramatically declined here too. The revered Los Angeles Times
  has fewer than one-third of the reporters it had in the 1990s, and a study by
  the Lear Center showed that, on average, in Los Angeles TV news, less than 1%
  of coverage is  dedicated to public interest topics such as transportation,
  health, environment, education, and taxes.


  Since the Federal Communications Commission report first raised the alarm
  about this crisis in local news in 2011, the situation has only worsened. And
  there are many who fear it still hasn’t hit rock bottom. Studies have shown
  that this disintegration of local news reporting leads to greater
  polarization, lower voter turnout, more pollution, less government
  accountability, and less trust. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Report for America, an initiative of The GroundTruth Project, matches talented
  journalists with local newsrooms from California to Connecticut for 1-2 years
  of service, reporting on under-covered challenges such as health, inequality,
  education, environment, and more. Our “corps members” are full-time employees
  of the news organizations they are matched with — daily newspapers, public
  radio stations, nonprofit newsrooms, public television — and receive training,
  mentorship, and networking opportunities. Additionally, all corps members
  complete a media-related service project in the local community. 


  Report for America is quadrupling the number of reporters we are fielding in
  local newsrooms each year — from 60 in 2019 to 250 in 2020, including four in
  Los Angeles. We leverage a two-to-one regional funding match model, paying
  half of a corps members’ salary, while supporting our news partners to raise
  the other half, promoting new models for shared investment in local
  journalism.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  All of our Report for America corps members and newsroom partners are selected
  because they are filling a specific news gap. In other words, they're
  providing coverage in Los Angeles that matters in people's everyday lives and
  that wouldn't otherwise be possible because of funding. We take a baseline of
  the coverage that existed the year before the Report for America corps member
  arrived, and track coverage throughout the year to assess how that news gap
  has been filled. 


  This year, our Los Angeles reporting will fill the following news gaps: 

  - Spectrum News 1: This reporter explores the question of how to make a
  mega-city such as Los Angeles sustainable. The reporter is responsible for
  covering municipal decisions regarding sustainability, attending city council
  meetings, and following the city’s progress on its Green New Deal goals. 

  - Long Beach Post: This reporter focuses on West Long Beach, writing stories
  that shine a light on both the good and bad. West Long Beach has long been
  considered an underreported area of the city. It is separated from the rest of
  the city by a major freeway that feeds in and out of the country's biggest
  port complex, the ports of LA and Long Beach. Next to the freeway is the Los
  Angeles River, known for its polluted waters that feed into the Pacific Ocean,
  rendering our beaches unusable on rainy days or when sewage spills. The area
  is also home to a large minority population including Latinos, Asians, African
  Americans and Pacific Islanders. They face high crime, high unemployment and
  have some of the lowest numbers of high school graduates compared to the rest
  of the city, according to the latest Census figures.

  - Voice of OC: This is a local beat, covering various cities of North Central
  Orange County. The county’s three million residents live in the secondmost
  densely populated county in California. Homelessness, affordable housing,
  transportation, environmental issues and social services/healthcare are major
  public policy issues that touch every resident on a daily basis. 

  -EdSource: This journalist covers post-secondary education, a struggle for
  immigrants from many countries. We know, for example, that fewer immigrant
  students applied for state college tuition assistances out of fear that doing
  so would attract attention from immigration authorities. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '50'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '2000000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  In addition to our regular metrics and tracking, we also carefully track
  impact instances where coverage makes a difference. To date, we have seen our
  corps members' work lead to communities getting cleaner drinking water, tax
  dollars being more efficiently spent, and legislation on homeless students
  being informed by reporting. 


  The four Report for America corps members in Los Angeles will directly impact
  the newsrooms in which they are placed, ensuring they have more adequate
  reporting resources to better inform communities. Our partner newsrooms reach
  over 2M people across the Los Angeles area, and their reporting will directly
  inform efforts around environmental sustainability, homelessness and
  affordable housing, education, and more. 
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  Our four newsroom partners on this collaboration will host our corps members
  as full-time employees, and provide them mentorship, space, editing, and
  distribution of their work. Those partners include Spectrum News 1, Long Beach
  Post, Voice of OC, and EdSource. 
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:

  - 'Office space for meetings, events, or for staff'
