title: How To New LA
project_summary: >-
  LAist is uniquely positioned to help our community navigate the new normal.
  You will never hit a paywall on our site and we’re known for fact-checked,
  calm reporting that’s delivered in conversational language everyone can
  understand. As a national leader in engaged journalism, we’re also known for
  responding to direct questions from readers. We will take those traditions and
  the trust we’ve already built to transform our “How To LA” guide into a “How
  To New LA” guide, serving a critical need as our city recovers from the
  COVID-19 pandemic.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  LAist launched “How To LA” last year as a handbook for day-to-day living in LA
  with an ongoing series of practical guides for understanding our complicated
  city. LA is a dizzying place to wrap your head around whether you're a
  lifelong Angeleno, a wide-eyed transplant, or somewhere in between. With 88
  cities, it has one of the world’s most diverse populations. It's an incubator
  for the industrious and a cautionary tale for society's most difficult
  problems.


  COVID-19 will no doubt change the way we connect and understand LA, and we
  will need each other more than ever before. With “How To New LA,” we can help
  one another navigate the new normal with no-panic guides to the supply chain,
  social distancing, medical stock, and more. 


  LAist is here for you during this strange, challenging time with
  up-to-the-minute information from health and city officials. Our goal is to
  make sure you’re better equipped for the crisis at hand and what’s to come. We
  want to become your encyclopedia of LA.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  LAist is a trusted source of news and information with a public service
  journalism mission. We seek to speak with authority, to be human, and to
  explain LA. We collaborate with our award-winning engagement team to answer
  your questions and to give you the answers you need to know. This type of
  trusted service fact-based journalism, delivered with confidence and
  composure, will continue to be your go-to place to help you understand and get
  through the COVID-19 pandemic.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Since the COVID-19 pandemic reached LA, we have helped to answer over 150
  questions per day, and we imagine that this influx of questions will continue
  in the year ahead. We will track analytics and metrics like digital engaged
  minutes and unique visitors, as well as the number of questions asked and
  answered via our community engagement team and social media channels. We have
  created a public Facebook page, “A No-Panic Support Group For Living Through
  Coronavirus in LA,” where we will use not only to source and answer questions
  but also to help connect Angelenos during this devastating time.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '500000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '10000000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw exponential growth in the
  number of readers seeking out LAist for information that’s specific to where
  we live -- more than 5 million unique readers in March 2020 alone. We
  witnessed a new appetite for the type of information we are providing, with
  some questions coming from as far away as India and the UK. Los Angeles County
  has roughly 10 million people, and we could ultimately reach a majority of
  them as our guide grows and word of mouth spreads. Currently, our COVID-19
  Facebook group has 2,000 members after only two weeks, reflecting people’s
  desire to seek out community at this time.
