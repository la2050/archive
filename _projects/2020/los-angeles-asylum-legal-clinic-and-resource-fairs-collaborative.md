title: Los Angeles Asylum Legal Clinic and Resource Fairs Collaborative
project_summary: >-
  In 2019, we piloted the Asylum Legal Clinic & Resource Fairs with legal
  services organizations, pro bono attorneys, students & volunteer social
  workers. Through this collaboration we’ve served 80+ asylum seekers with Know
  Your Rights info, legal counsel & connection to critical social services. We
  aim to expand by providing assistance to a larger number of people & families
  seeking asylum. By building on the work of our partners & volunteers, we’ll
  connect more asylum seekers to vital resources to help them navigate and
  succeed in this country.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  The US asylum system is being dismantled by the Trump administration through
  dangerous and immoral policies such as family separations, metering, the
  asylum ban, and the Migrant Protection Protocols, also known as the “Remain in
  Mexico” policy. The administration has created insurmountable barriers for
  refugees trying to access our asylum system. In the past years, we have seen
  an increasing number of non-detained asylum seekers in need of representation
  and legal guidance. In Los Angeles, over 100,000 individuals in removal
  proceedings do not have access to legal counsel and therefore face violations
  in due process procedures. We know that with legal defense individuals’
  success rate in court increases 5x. Unfortunately, there is a lack of capacity
  among pro-bono legal service providers. To address this unmet need in Los
  Angeles we activated our network, bringing together legal service providers
  and private attorneys to increase access to legal services for asylum
  seekers. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  OneJustice advances the impact of the legal services delivery system by
  building the capacity of the legal aid nonprofits that comprise the system
  through the use of pro bono private sector resources. As a statewide support
  center for legal services organizations, we work with partner organizations to
  build up their capacity by training and mobilizing volunteer attorneys and law
  students to provide pro bono legal services to people throughout California
  who have limited access to legal help due to systemic, regional, and economic
  barriers. OneJustice partners with law firms, law schools, corporations, and
  legal services organizations to implement free legal clinics in rural and
  isolated communities throughout California in order to connect communities
  with free, high-quality legal services. Since 2009, OneJustice’s pro bono
  program has engaged over 2,000 pro bono volunteers, implemented over 190
  immigration clinics, and provided legal assistance to over 3,500 immigrants.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  LA’s immigration legal services nonprofits cannot currently meet the growing
  legal needs of asylum seekers in LA. With this grant, our collaborative hopes
  to implement a strong infrastructure of regular volunteers and expand access
  to justice by ensuring that all individuals and families seeking asylum in LA
  who cannot afford an attorney are equipped to meaningfully represent
  themselves in immigration court with correctly filled out asylum applications.
  In the short-term, our goal is to implement quarterly large-scale virtual or
  in-person Asylum Legal Clinics and Resource Fairs to respond to the immediate
  needs of pro se asylum seekers who have upcoming immigration court cases in
  Los Angeles and connect them to legal, mental health, medical, and comunity
  services and resources. We will track the following quantitative metrics to
  help us gauge our success: the number of trained volunteers; the number of
  asylum seekers provided legal and social services; the number of asylum
  applications completed and reviewed by a supervising attorney; the number of
  social services organizations and City departments engaged as partners.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '200'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '250'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Asylum application clinics are part of a national effort to ensure
  unrepresented asylum seekers have access to due process. In FY 2019,
  unrepresented asylum seekers had an 84% denial rate at their immigration court
  hearings in LA. As the number of asylum seekers in need of support to navigate
  procedural intricacies exponentially increases, trained volunteers supervised
  by experienced attorneys give asylum seekers a better chance of winning their
  cases. Until we have publicly funded universal legal representation to ensure
  asylum seekers have their fair day in court, efficient pro bono services can
  build capacity. Mobilizing volunteers and law students exponentially increases
  access to legal assistance for asylum seekers and their families.
