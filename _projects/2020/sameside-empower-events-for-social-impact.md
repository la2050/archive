title: 'SameSide: Empower Events for Social Impact'
project_summary: >-
  SameSide has built a web-based events platform powering social impact
  gatherings that are live or virtual. We want to make Los Angeles the most
  civically engaged city in America by making it as easy as possible to
  incorporate information and calls to action for causes into the activities and
  gatherings already happening every day.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  In a time when people power is more critical than ever to solve tremendous
  social issues, we must meet people where they're at to empower them to join
  the fight and be part of solutions. SameSide is a peer-to-peer events platform
  that allows anyone to connect their live or virtual gathering to a cause
  (political or issue-based). During the event, SameSide's technology delivers
  calls-to-action from the cause to participants' mobile phones with ways to
  join and drive change.


  In 2017, our Dinners for DACA raised over $40,000 and led 200+ participants to
  engage in action to protect Dreamers in just 2 months. Using technology, this
  type of engagement can be replicated across the millions of gatherings that
  already happen every day - dinners, fitness classes, happy hours - to expand
  access to grassroots power in every community.


  In turn, events on SameSide help causes reach new people in new communities
  digitally and through their phones at events led by people they trust.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  While SameSide is used across America, we want Los Angeles to be the
  standard-bearer for what a city looks like to be civically engaged in 2020. We
  are a team of native Angelenos who know the solutions to many of our city's
  toughest issues can be solved with technology and power through people.
  Leveraging LA's best-in-class creativity, open-mindedness and diversity,
  SameSide aims to harness the LA spirit in every community to amplify voices
  for the issues that matter to them most while doing the things they love.


  We know that to create progressive change, we must build power from the ground
  up and make it discoverable and accessible to all. We are a team of
  technologists, user experience experts and activists. We have brought together
  a powerful combination of talent - and will enhance it with this grant - to
  empower the next generation of civic engagement like it has never been seen
  before. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Our goal is to empower 1000 unique hosts in Los Angeles from July to November
  2020 to host events for political engagement and Get Out The Vote (GOTV). We
  aim to empower non-traditional political engagement event hosts and venues -
  restaurants, retail locations, health and wellness leaders, party planners,
  and more - to bring in participants who would not normally take part in
  political action. 


  Through SameSide, anything can be an advocacy event. Birthday parties, comedy
  shows, dance workouts, movie screenings and so much more have already been
  advocacy events through SameSide delivering information and mobile activism to
  support progressive issues.


  Success for us is defined as 50% or higher participation from event guests who
  have never engaged in political action prior to their first SameSide event. 


  We will measure success through follow-up surveys to understand participants'
  engagement in political action prior to their SameSide event.


  Following November 2020, we have set a goal of another 1,000 events in Los
  Angeles from November 2020 - July 2021 focused on issue engagement. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '2009'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '100000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  By directly focusing our efforts on building an ecosystem in Los Angeles for
  civic engagement capabilities that touch the everyday lives of Angelenos,
  SameSide will empower community members to bring people together and align
  with the organizations on the front lines of change in the city. Through
  SameSide Angelenos can see that people just like them are creating change, not
  the celebrities, politicians or billionaires who dominate our city.  


  Any gathering can be an advocacy event with SameSide. Already birthday
  parties, comedy shows, dance workouts, movie screenings and so much more have
  been advocacy events through SameSide delivering information and mobile
  activism to support homelessness, income inequality, education gap and more.
