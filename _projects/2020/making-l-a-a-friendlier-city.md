title: Making L.A. a Friendlier City
project_summary: >
  Instead of people being on devices while waiting for a movie to start, on line
  in a market, or drinking coffee at Starbucks, it will get people connecting
  with each other, person to person. This project will create a wave of
  friendliness washing over the city, enhancing the attraction of L.A. as a
  place to visit and to live. Making L.A. a Friendlier City will burst into
  reality when we are out of lockdown, helping us come together as one city let
  alone as one humanity.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >+
  This project was sparked by my awareness that when I’m in small towns it feels
  different, like I’m welcome and I feel the warmth, whereas in L.A., wherever I
  go people are closed off, separated, and indifferent to one another. It’s a
  tenet of my beliefs that community and oneness is what we were designed for
  and for many years all the projects and events I‘ve produced have been to
  foster connection and coming to care about each other as much as we care about
  ourselves. Before the virus hit, this project came to me as what could change
  the vibe in L.A., and the value of it for when we emerge as an interactive
  society has only increased with the experience of everyone in it together that
  we are having now.

Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >+
  For many years, I’ve been producing projects and events to raise consciousness
  – early on at an individual level and moving more and more into looking at the
  collective consciousness and how mired it is in oppositional thinking where
  what we need, for all of our good, is to be cooperative. Also, I have a
  history of doing things related to play, having discovered early on that it
  was a useful modality to get people loosened up and engaged. This project has
  some of that spirit! Here’s some history on the things I’ve done:

Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  The project would result in people engaging in movie theaters and at plays, on
  lines, at sports events, in markets, anywhere they rub elbows with others,
  people would be enrolling each other. In fact, we would get such a friendly
  spirit going that people wouldn’t even need to be recruited in our formal
  project to be friendly to each other. 


  We will notice our fellow Angelinos in a level of engagement that never has
  been before. One way to measure our success will be sign-ups on the website
  for updates, bearing in mind that the numbers of people who will be involved
  will be larger than the sign-ups. Another measure will be how many buttons get
  circulated and worn.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '4000000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '320000000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >+
  When I worked on this, before the virus hit, I thought it would produce
  massive change in the ambiance in L.A., and that expectation has only been
  enhanced by the current situation. It would provide impetus to ride the wave
  of connection and caring that has come from our crisis, where, when we emerge
  from quarantine, it would help us to not go back to the level of alienation
  and competition that we were in. Working together, caring about the good of
  the whole, is the ticket to success. As Buckminster Fuller prophetically said,
  “We have enough

  resources to house, clothe and feed everybody on the planet,” but we just lack
  the will. Moving us to a camaraderie where we would work together is the
  greatest impact the project could have.

'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >+
  Although at this time there are no collaborators, I want to answer this
  question because my project will be heavily dependent on collaboration. I will
  recruit widely for organizations in Los Angeles to be collaborators who get
  the word about the project out to their constituents.
