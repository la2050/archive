title: 'Music Forward: Helping Engage our Youth through Careers in the Music Industry'
project_summary: >-
  Music Forward empowers young people to follow their dreams into the music
  industry and enrich it with their diverse voices and perspectives. In 2020,
  Music Forward will launch a refreshed and expanded youth development program
  serving twice the number of musically talented 14 to 24-year-old residents of
  Greater Los Angeles, and more effectively reach those who are living in
  low-income, underserved communities. New partnerships with the LA City
  Economic & Workforce Development Department (EWWD) and ReLAY Institute will
  help us reach these goals.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Today’s youth in LA County face a crisis when it comes to education and
  employment. 11.7% of young people ages 16-24 are disconnected, meaning they
  are not currently enrolled in school or working and that disconnection is even
  greater for people of color.


  Also, the music industry continues to lack diversity at the highest levels of
  influence. Today there is just one female producer for every 37 male
  producers. And only 10% of music executives listed on Billboard’s Top 100 are
  people of color. Music Forward addresses these sobering statistics by helping
  underrepresented youth turn their passion for music into professions and by
  creating a platform for industry leaders to connect with and mentor young,
  diverse voices.


  After a thoughtful, 10-month assessment our 2020 programs are shifting to
  increase performance opportunities, improve mentorship effectiveness and
  provide greater access for underrepresented youth. It will also include
  digital strategies developed over the past few weeks.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Music Forward has served Los Angeles youth since 1994, and in recent years
  expanded its traditional arts education program to help fill the void in
  creative workforce development opportunities available to youth.


  We offer two tracks – Artist and Career Development. Our artist development
  program connects aspiring young musicians to music industry mentors who help
  them build self-confidence, learn new marketable skills, and connect with
  audiences. Our career development program brings high school and college
  students into music venues, offices, and studios to discover careers in the
  music industry and build professional networks.


  Music Forward offers unmatched insider access to music industry leaders and
  mentors at no cost to participants. Our participants join a robust alumni
  program that facilitates paid gigs, job shadows, and additional learning
  opportunities with coveted music industry partners. And we are continually
  working to improve our services and impact.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  Music Forward’s project GOALS are to: 


  1) Increase participation in our SoCal programs by 50% with a focus on
  low-income youth, women and underrepresented voices. 


  2) Reduce youth disengagement by recruiting affected youth and using music as
  the gateway to alternative education and careers.  


  3) Use and share knowledge gained through research to break down barriers and
  increase opportunities in the music industry.


  The OUTCOMES for program participants are: 


  1) CONNECTION: Increase sense of competence, confidence, contribution, caring,
  and connection through hands-on learning, mentorship and peer support.


  2) CAREER SKILLS: Greater knowledge of the music industry and other related
  careers; Improved ability to network, interview and pursue employment in the
  creative sector. 


  3) PERSONAL ENRICHMENT: A greater understanding of how their personal goals
  and preferences can guide them in identifying a future career; personal growth
  through encounters with different voices and viewpoints.


  4) PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT: For those youth participating in the emerging
  artist track, performance opportunities and feedback from professionals help
  develop their repertoire and stage presence. 


  We’ll track our goals and outcomes through qualitative and quantitative means
  including pre- and post-program surveys and staff assessments. Volunteers,
  industry mentors, and partners are also surveyed on the value of their
  experience as it relates to personal and professional priorities and the
  quality of program content.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '3850'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '2750'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Music is a powerful force in society – a universal language that connects us
  all culturally and emotionally. That’s why it is so important to ensure
  diverse voices are represented at all levels of creation and dissemination.


  Music also has the power to inspire youth to dream. Music Forward facilitates
  access to creative sector careers but also helps youth master competitive
  performance, business, and management skills that would be attractive to any
  employer in any industry. While all young people are invited to participate,
  we focus our recruitment on those currently underrepresented in the music
  industry (students of color, women, and from low-income households) through
  our network of partners, schools and community-based organizations.
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  Collaborations with LA City EWWD and ReLAY, a CSU5 initiative headquartered at
  California State University, Northridge, will help increase our ability to
  recruit youth and assess impact. Music Forward will bring programs focusing on
  work readiness, career exploration, and job skills training for the music
  industry to EWWD YouthSource Centers. Additionally, ReLAY will help us build
  research on the barriers to access in the music industry and implement
  initiatives to break down these barriers.
