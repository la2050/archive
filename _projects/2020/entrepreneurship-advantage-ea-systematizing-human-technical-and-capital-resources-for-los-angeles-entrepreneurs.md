  Entrepreneurship Advantage (EA): Systematizing human, technical, and capital
  resources for Los Angeles entrepreneurs
project_summary: >
  EA connects under-resourced entrepreneurs with resources they need to grow
  thriving businesses that provide income for entrepreneurs, their families, and
  communities. Having done initial work on identifying, vetting and compiling
  LA’s regional resources (microloans, technical assistance, and education), the
  current project will intensify and expand our efforts; we will accelerate the
  distribution of resources and growth of our membership, ultimately
  strengthening the entrepreneurial ecosystem that allows LA-based entrepreneurs
  to thrive.

In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >
  Entrepreneurship is a pathway to economic mobility for many minorities,
  immigrants and women. Yet 50% of small businesses fail (SBA) since they can’t
  access capital/support necessary to build sustainable enterprises.


  LA has many resources to overcome these barriers, but these programs are not
  fully utilized. According to our research of EA stakeholders in 2019, many
  organizations, including banks, don't understand the range of services,
  programs, and products available for clients that don’t qualify.


  Due to “referral barriers”, the opportunity is lost to develop clients for
  traditional banking. Meanwhile, clients are at-risk to high-cost predatory
  loans which can charge APRs up to 94%, trapping entrepreneurs in a cycle of
  debt they can never repay (Opportunity Fund, 2016)


  As a result, EA was formed to make it easier for LA entrepreneurs to connect
  with the right resources by developing resource guides, training for
  business-service organizations, and a web-based matching tool.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >
  EA is uniquely suited to tackle this information gap because of its
  community-informed approach and its growing support from LA’s small-business
  community. Founded in March 2018 by Opportunity Fund and CDC Small Business
  Finance, EA formed a collaboration with members from government agencies,
  nonprofits and banks with assistance from CAMEO. After conducting surveys and
  focus groups with entrepreneurs and small-business stakeholders, EA finalized
  a strategic plan in the spring of 2019 that addressed the need for connection
  among LA's business ecosystem.


  Since then, we have: 1) grown our collaboration to 30+ participating members,
  (includes influential stakeholders such as the Mayor’s Office of Economic
  Development, Small Business Majority,); 2) completed a preliminary set of
  tools to improve referrals in LA, and 3) have hosted two convenings that
  connected over 50 organizations and received a 100% satisfaction rating on the
  information and resources provided through the events.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  Our vision for success is that every LA entrepreneur can access resources to
  grow their small business and secure a better future for their family and
  community. To achieve that vision, EA has outlined the following strategic
  goals:


  1.     Help entrepreneurs connect with the right resources: identify
  resources, provide a web tool that matches financing, resources and networks,
  offer a calendar of business training and events, and develop resource guides.
  Success: Develop a website that connects entrepreneurs and shares
  resources.   


  2.     Communicate the availability of these resources by executing a branding
  strategy, launching a website, marketing through social media, networking and
  community outreach, and presenting resource workshops to business
  owners.Success: Develop and execute a branding strategy. Develop three
  presentations for business owners that can be executed by any collaboration
  member.


  3.     Improve the referral network through networking events, coordination
  with financial institutions, chambers of commerce, SBA, cities and other
  government agencies, and building capacity of the network to refer
  effectively. Success: Hold four networking events. Bring five bank partners,
  five chambers, and five city/government agencies into the referral network.
   
  4.     Build an effective and efficient collaborative by raising funds and
  operationalizing collaborative processes. Success: Hire a full-time staff
  member to ensure the collaborative’s effectiveness.

Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '5500'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >
  Approaches to entrepreneurial support are often presented in narrow silos and
  EA’s efforts reflect a shift to a more holistic ecosystemic view. A robust
  local entrepreneurial ecosystem is made up of 5 Cs: Coaching, Capital,
  Connections, Climate, and Culture. When these pieces are all in place, small
  businesses can succeed and create a sustainable and thriving local economy. 


  This collaborative initiative will provide a robust ecosystem, expanded
  outreach and a single point of access. EA will efficiently enhance existing
  services, providing entrepreneurs seamless access to the wealth of LA County’s
  capital, human and technical resources at the right time on their business
  journey.    
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >
  CAMEO, the fiscal sponsor for Entrepreneurship Advantage has been in operation
  for over 25 years. CAMEO will leverage their experience creating 
  entrepreneurial ecosystems, building the capacity of nonprofits and advocating
  for small business owners to ensure that Entrepreneurship Advantage continues
  to make a sustainable impact in their community.  In addition,
  Entrepreneurship Advantage will work with CAMEO to raise funding and develop
  income generating activities.

  better connect more resources to more small businesses in LA County.
