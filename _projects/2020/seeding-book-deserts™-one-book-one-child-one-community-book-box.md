Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >
  We are responding to the ongoing need of getting books to children and
  families in the LA  County communities, who are not able to or do not have
  access to books within a reasonable distance from their home. LA County's rate
  of illiteracy is one of the highest in the nation, and that is directly linked
  to lack of literacy resources. With the lack of libraries or literacy
  resources, children to read or imagine what could be when they don’t have
  access to books from an early age directly has a direct impact on a child’s
  ability to succeed in life, both in the short term and throughout their
  lifetime. 

  “Both physical and psychological proximity to books mattern when it comes to
  children’s literacy skills. Children need access to books in their
  neighborhoods, as well as adults who create an environment that inspires
  reading.” 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >
  The Literacy Club’s sole purpose is getting books into the hands of children,
  doing whatever it takes, and at no charge. For instance over the last 2 weeks
  (March 15- April 3, 2020,) we have donated over 10,000 books to children
  throughout the nation, however and primarily in Southern California. Each
  child receives on average 7-10 books for their age group, and we are able to
  donate books for every age level. 



  The Literacy Club has developed a successful grassroots infrastructure through
  which we are able to partner with several community organizations in Los
  Angeles County. As of today, we have built and delivered 140 custom designed
  Book Boxes, and are proud to have designed a Book Box for the LA2050 grant. 


  We are proud to have partnered with LAPD, USC Public Safety, Kiwanis
  International and other community organizations to assist us in getting books
  into the community and installing our book boxes into the communities most in
  need.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >+
  We measure success by the impact of the children in these communities having
  access to books and while we cannot always follow the book and the child, we
  do get direct feedback from the organizations and community where the boxes
  and books are located. Additionally, we measure success on the impact the book
  box has to a community like the one we did in University Gardens in South LA.
  There we installed two boxes and within 30 days they had the first
  neighborhood watch meeting in this housing project and 5 years later it is
  still happening.

Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '750'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: ''
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >
  The physical impact that our Book Boxes have been shown to have in all of the
  various communities that we’ve had the privilege of working with are
  countless. However, for this proposal specifically, the physical impact is
  bringing the community together. Neighborhoods gather and take pride in their
  Book Boxes, creating a sense of engagement between leaders and community
  members. The Boxes are designed to withstand the elements and to start
  conversations. 
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': ''
