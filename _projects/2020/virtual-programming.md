title: Virtual programming
project_summary: >
  TFLB cares about each individual woman,and applies our wrap-around approach to
  helping women regain their sense of femininity, self-worth, beauty and
  emotional stability after coping with the taxing effects of cancer and
  chemotherapy. Our virtual programming project will support our efforts in
  being able to serve and reach out to more women with cancer, collaborate with
  all agencies that serve these women, and begin offering them our services,
  especially women who cannot be in public due to recent chemotherapy or current
  immune deficiencies.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  The current need we are responding to is ensuring women have access to our
  services without having to go out in public or being in a group of people.
  Women who come to us are looking to empower themselves to participate in their
  own healing process, They are considered “at risk”, and we know virtual
  services will allow us to serve them now and in the future without further
  risk to their health. Our women need the healing tools they learn at every
  workshop, day retreat, overnight retreat and individual session. In order to
  continue to provide this support in the upcoming years, we have begun the
  process of adding virtual programming, which is the focus of this proposal.
  Attending a virtual session means there is no additional risk to a woman’s
  health by being around others. We are working with our talented facilitators
  on transforming workshops and day retreats to be held live and on online
  platforms. Our virtual programs will be free to all we serve, as are all of
  our services. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Serving women with cancer is all we do. Most women facing a cancer diagnosis
  tend to isolate themselves or refuse to talk about the diagnosis in an effort
  to protect their loved ones. They continue to try to hold down jobs, mother
  their children, and maintain a household while enduring a grueling
  chemotherapy or radiation regimen. In the time we have been doing this work we
  have learned of the unique challenges facing women with cancer and created our
  current services and programs to alleviate many of the difficulties these
  women face, difficulties aside from their cancer. We currently serve almost
  1,000 women and have been serving women with cancer and adding to their
  overall wellness for 15 years. Although most women with cancer seek
  traditional treatment, many leading oncologists now believe that wellness and
  holistic healing is a critical part of the cancer journey. We have a respect
  in local cancer communities and a solid reputation in the greater LA County
  community. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >+
  We have recently come to realize that virtual programing is important to many
  women with cancer who have always had to live as many of us are living now.
  Although we started implementing this programing because of the current
  crisis, we now want to grow it so that even when the world is back to normal
  we can continue to serve more and more women who cannot for health reasons
  join our events attended by dozens of people. We will measure success by how
  many women we can share our mission with and how many women we can begin
  serving from that number. We will create online goals for attendance of each
  program and work to making sure we serve as many as we can per program. An
  example of this is that we intend to serve as many women with an online
  retreat as we would with an in-person retreat, and success would be meeting
  that goal. As the virtual programming will also support our efforts in
  collaborating with other organizations, for profit and nonprofit, that serve
  women with cancer, part of our success will be measured by an increase in
  those relationships. 


  Cancer does not discriminate. One thing women served by Living Beauty have in
  common is that they suffer from cancer.  But they come from a wide range of
  underserved, disenfranchised populations – low income, single parents,
  military veterans, LGBTQ, and all different ethnicities, ages and economic
  levels. Ensuring all women in these communities have more access to our
  programming will be the last way we measure success. 

Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '250'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '2500'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Our virtual programming will allow us to serve more women, especially those in
  disenfranchised populations. Our overall message of physical and mental
  wellness while going through a cancer diagnosis to the virtual world will not
  only allow us to directly serve more women, it will also reengage those who
  know someone with cancer to be of more service. Additional impact includes
  allowing women who are already being served by us to continue services while
  undergoing treatments and surgeries that might keep them away from public
  gatherings for a specific amount of time. Additional impact is giving an
  opportunity to those we serve to continue building relationships with other
  women with cancer, a big factor in overall wellness.
