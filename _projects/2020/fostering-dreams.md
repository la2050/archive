Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Antelope Valley
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Fostering Dreams Project is a dance and performing arts program to empower,
  educate and inspire youth foster and at-promise youth in underserved
  communities. Our 8-week dance education programs are designed specifically for
  foster youth who are currently attending schools in Antelope Valley districts.

  The program and curriculum include dance instruction, integrated academics
  (creative and expressive writing, workshops and guest speakers), social
  engagement (trips/tours), leadership and public performances. Students in
  Antelope Valley have limited access to arts education programming. Our
  curriculum increases students' proficiency in dance, improved academic
  performance, community engagement, and enriched learning. 

  Implementation of Fostering Dreams offers the school district and
  administration an opportunity to enhance its role as a leader in education, be
  an innovator in collaborative arts education and a change-maker for students
  in foster care.  

   
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Fostering Dreams presents a framework for leveraging dance as a vehicle for
  addressing the unique needs of youth in foster care, clearing a new path for
  learning, building confidence and a host of 21st-century skills, that can help
  foster youth be more successful in school. In exploring the well-being of
  vulnerable children and youth, our dance program improves social behavior,
  creative expression, academic success, real-world problem-solving,
  civic-engagement, and lifelong learning.


  Our professional dance instructors have undergone Live Scan and training to
  work with foster youth, are college graduates and are influential in the dance
  industry working with A-list artists in entertainment. They provide
  inspiration and support by sharing personal stories about the impact of dance
  to turn their lives around and achieve success. Together we create a community
  that leads to long-lasting connections and support.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >+
  Our vision is to be recognized nationally as a transformative dance education,
  performing arts program enriching the lives of our most underserved youth
  through creative self-expression. We aim to provide foster youth with
  exclusive opportunity to learn dance as a way of being more expressive,
  socially and academically engaged. 


  We want our students to see that they are bigger than their circumstances, by
  building confidence, creating community, and brighter futures to be successful
  in life. 

  While students achieve proficiency in hip-hop, salsa, and contemporary dance
  styles, they will also:

  1) gain knowledge of the historical impact of dance on culture and society.

  2) display increased competency in soft-skills, such as self-confidence,
  leadership, teamwork, self-awareness, motivation, self-expression, emotional
  wellbeing, cultural competence, and self-discipline. 

  3) courage and belief in themselves to learn choreography and perform for a
  live audience. This courage transcends into other areas of life. 

  A videographer is brought in to film the progress of the students during the
  8-weeks and their final performance. On the last day of classes, students will
  watch their video and reflect on their progress and accomplishments and how
  far they've come during the program. 

  Additional Evaluations:

  * On camera interviews: feedback from students and admin about the program. 

  * Journal Evaluation: qualitative evaluation measures to assess student
  progress in soft skill competencies, such as self-expression through writing,
  self-confidence, and emotional wellbeing. 

  * Start and End Surveys: The surveys will use quantitative and qualitative
  measures to assess student competency in the objectives and goals, before and
  after the program. 

  * Focus Group: FDP will assess students’ satisfaction with the program and
  gain targeted feedback for the program’s continued development.

Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Fostering Dreams has been designed to respond to the shifting social,
  academic, legislative and policy landscape and offers an innovative strategy
  for the Palmdale School Unified District to build on the success of arts
  education to help achieve key goals for foster youth. We have served 420
  foster youth out of the 890 foster youth enrolled in PSUD. Our goal is to
  reach the remaining foster students while indirectly impacting their schools,
  teachers, and peers. We are pleased to report 100% of students in our program
  have improved overall behavior, attendance rates, and class participation.
  Providing more foster youth with a creative outlet to stay off the streets
  means improving the lives and well-being of the city of Palmdale.
