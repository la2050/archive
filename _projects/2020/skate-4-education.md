title: Skate-4-Education
project_summary: >-
  Our program is tailored to provide alternatives to vulnerable inner-city youth
  in East LA. Many of our participants come from low-income families or children
  in the foster system with minimum guidance.  The Skate-4-Education after
  school program offers skateboarding as an academic incentive by exchanging
  skateboarding gear & skate ramp time when they meet specific education goals
  (i.e., 3.0+ GPAs).  By keeping them off the streets & engaged in developing
  their educational goals, they can redirect their energy towards more positive
  endeavors.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to PLAY
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - East LA
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Our immediate goal is to provide an after school program that is an
  alternative to being on the streets.  The long-term goal is to place an
  emphasis on the importance of focusing on their education by providing them
  with mentors, who are currently enrolled in college, and exchanging
  skateboarding gear and activities for reaching their academic goals (i.e, A's
  on test scores).  The extracurricular activities also include an indoor skate
  park, DJ room, and silk screening studio at no cost. In addition to focusing
  on their education, we provide them with an entrepreneurial program that
  teaches them how to develop a brand, create the merchandise via the silk
  screening studio and marketing the sale of the items they create. Because so
  many of these kids come from an underserved community, we also expect them to
  give back by taking part in graffiti clean-ups, food drives and community
  clean-up projects. Our goal is to develop well-rounded individuals.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  The majority of the boys go from failing grades to straight As, with many of
  them pursuing college educations after completing our program.  Our goal of
  "breaking the cycle" is realized when they return to the program to help
  mentor the younger boys. We are providing them with the opportunity to remove
  themselves from negative influences and, instead channel their energy towards
  more productive activities and their education.  We create a family
  environment, where there has been none before. Over the last 13 years, we have
  provided the guidance and inspiration for our youth to see an alternative to
  the cycle of poverty and hopelessness in which many of them live.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  We developed a point system that we have employed at the shop since the
  beginning of the program.  They are rewarded for completed homework and
  reading assignments, scoring A's on their tests and report cards with 3.0+
  GPAs.  There are no limits to the number of rewards they can earn.  When they
  initially join our program, they have failing grades and lower level reading
  proficiency.  Measuring their success is at the base of our program.  Over the
  last 3 years, the program has reached over 2,000 registered students.  72% of
  our participants achieve GPAs of 3.0 or better.  Of those that complete the
  program through high school, 60% move on to a community college or four-year
  college. We have had participants that have earned engineering, graphic
  design, social work and law degrees to just name a few.


  Ideally, we would like to expand the program to other underserved communities
  in the Los Angeles area.  We have a program that has proven effective and we
  can help replicate it in other areas.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '2000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '5000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Many of our participants' sibling and schoolmates join our program once they
  see the improvement in grades and reading level proficiency.  The participants
  host different educational events at the local grammar and middle schools in
  the community to share their personal experiences and present skateboard
  safety training. We work with different organizations including the Rotary
  Club of East LA and job development programs to help promote our program
  benefits.
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': ''
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Access to the LA2050 community
  - 'Capacity, including staff'
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.: Allstate
Which metrics will your submission impact?:
  - Youth sports participation
  - Easy access to a safe park
  - Students' sense of safety at and on the way to school
Are there any other LA2050 goal categories that your proposal will impact?:
  - LA is the best place to LEARN
Has your proposal changed due to COVID-19?: >
  1. Switched to an on-line Game of Skate zoom program. Each session is made up
  of a group of 10-15 participants including mentors. It is an on-line
  competition, where participants perform a skateboarding trick. Tricks are
  voted on & the participant with the highest score wins the challenge & earns
  free skateboarding gear.

  2. Change to the homework challenge. We’re unable to have them come to the
  shop for their daily homework/tutoring sessions so we are now holding these
  sessions on-line. Each participant is required to complete a minimum amount of
  homework before they can participate in the points program.

  3. Modified bonus points program from 20 minutes of reading per day & a 3
  paragraph essay summarizing what they read to 1 book per week & 6 paragraph
  essay summarizing what they read.

  4. Change to 1-on-1 tutoring sessions. Each participant submits a question in
  advance to our tutors, who follows up with them to help them work through
  their question. We established a daily 3 hour window in which to provide
  1-on-1 tutoring.

  5. Holding entrepreneurial workshops on-line instead of in-person. COVID-19
  experience has provided a real life example of how an entrepreneur must be
  flexible to unforeseen challenges & new business opportunities.

  6. We have an increased need during Food Bank Fridays. Our average number of
  food boxes was 200 pre-COVID-19; it is now 400 30 - 50 lb boxes. Our challenge
  has proven to be accessing enough food from the food bank to provide at our
  Food Bank Fridays. 


  We re-engaged the majority of our participants by keeping them active,
  reducing the amount of time they spend on video games & assisting them in
  improving their grades.
