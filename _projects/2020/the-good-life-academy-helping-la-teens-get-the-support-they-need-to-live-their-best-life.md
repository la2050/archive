  The Good Life Academy: Helping LA Teens Get the Support they Need to Live
  Their Best Life
project_summary: >-
  The Good Life Academy is a virtual platform that will provide free online
  psychological support for teens and parents throughout LAUSD. We offer
  evidence-based text and online therapy, shown to be as effective as live
  psychotherapy. Our courses teach psychological and social and emotional tools
  such as how to: reduce anxiety and depression, achieve your goals and develop
  a growth mindset. This model raises the future to its highest potential by
  implementing data-driven psychological change that is trauma-informed,
  evidence-based and valued.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
  - >-
    LAUSD (please select only if you have a district-wide partnership or
    project)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >
  The Good Life Academy addresses the urgent need for emotional support and
  mental health resources for teens. Due to stigma, cost and difficulty getting
  to a physical appointment, most teens who are in need of psychological support
  do not get help. Yet, teens are at the highest risk for anxiety and depression
  with 50% of all lifetime cases of mental illness beginning by the age of 14.
  We also know that teens spend more than seven hours per day on their devices,
  making a virtual platform the best way to reach them. With access to
  professional therapeutic services from their phones or computers, we will be
  able to detect and mitigate the onset of mental illness which can prevent
  substance abuse, dropping out of school, and suicide.

  The Good Life Academy also supports parents because without adequate training,
  parents can exacerbate trauma rather than provide relief. This comprehensive
  model transforms teens’ entire ecosystem, creating a new environment of
  emotional support. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >
  Roots & Wings has ample experience in the treatment and prevention of
  childhood trauma, anxiety, and depression as well as parent education. Founded
  and run by a renowned clinical psychologist and led by a team of seasoned
  psychologists and psychotherapists, our unique model offers the highest
  quality of service, which is essential to support these complex issues. The
  Good Life Academy is the latest iteration of our model, bringing our
  trauma-informed social emotional learning curriculum into every home through
  our virtual platform.

  The COVID19 pandemic has pointed to the need for online resources for students
  whether they are in the classroom or at home. To address this immediate need,
  we have begun piloting this model, offering free weekly resources through our
  virtual system. With funding from LA 2050, The Good Life Academy will expand
  our offerings with static virtual resources as well as live support through
  one-on-one and group sessions with our team of skilled psychologists.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  Roots & Wings will measure the success of this project through tracking
  multiple quantitative and qualitative outcomes. Data collection will focus on
  the overall social emotional learning and mental health awareness of students
  with a secondary target audience of teachers and parents. We will also monitor
  changes in academic outcomes such as: attendance, student engagement, academic
  performance and bullying rates, which are typically correlated with higher SEL
  awareness. 

  The Good Life Academy offers opportunities for seamless data tracking embedded
  into the virtual platform. Through the website we will be able to track the
  number of students and parents from LAUSD who are accessing resources. All
  services will also include a pre and post survey to collect data throughout
  program implementation. 

  Through this project we hope to establish an ecosystem where every child feels
  supported by their parents, and to give all parties the trauma-informed,
  evidence-driven social emotional tools necessary to navigate the difficult
  situations they face everyday.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '70000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '2250000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >
  While the primary audience for this project is students—parents, teachers and
  school administrators are secondary beneficiaries. The broader Los Angeles
  community will also be greatly impacted as all of our lives are touched by the
  education system.


  This program will also radically enhance the capacity of Los Angeles schools
  to provide social emotional learning (SEL) curriculum which is linked to
  improved: academic achievement, graduation rates, employment prospects,
  teacher retention, college and career-ready skills, school climate and safety.
