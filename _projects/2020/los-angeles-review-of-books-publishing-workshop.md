title: Los Angeles Review of Books Publishing Workshop
project_summary: >-
  The LARB Publishing Workshop is a three-week intensive summer course offering
  students a comprehensive overview of how the publishing industry works and
  where it is heading. Our curriculum and program of speakers reflect LARB’s
  commitment to innovation, inclusivity, and independent literary production,
  featuring students and leading professionals from wide-ranging backgrounds and
  a robust scholarship program. Our goal is to train a new, diverse, and
  forward-thinking generation of publishing professionals here in Los Angeles.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CREATE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  The publishing industry shapes the stories we read and determines whose
  stories we encounter. As a result, its acute lack of diversity—predominantly
  white (76%), straight (81%), and non-disabled (89%)—raises concerns about not
  only its hiring practices, but also its cultural gatekeeping. Recent literary
  controversies have borne out such concerns, highlighting troubling blindspots
  in how publishers treat authors of color and stories about people of color. 


  At LARB, we see the lack of diversity within publishing as partly a function
  of its traditionally high financial bar of entry. Publishing, centered largely
  in New York City, has historically been built on unpaid internships or
  underpaid jobs, legacy connections, and expensive programs that offer little
  to no financial aid. We created the Publishing Workshop to train and support
  talented students regardless of their finances or location, and, in doing so,
  to highlight the innovative work of independent publishers here in LA. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Democratizing access to the smart, vibrant exchange of ideas is the
  cornerstone of LARB. Our flagship magazine gives voice to more socially and
  intellectually diverse writers than the legacy outlets. We provide free online
  content to six million readers annually in all 50 states and 200+ countries.
  Our civic arts programs, the Publishing Workshop and the Little Literary Fair
  (LITLIT), were created to advance the next generation of writers, editors, and
  publishers with the same commitment to access and creative exchange in mind.

  LARB is uniquely situated to offer the Publishing Workshop because of our
  professional relationships and the extensive network of community support we
  have established over the years. We welcome 60 leading publishing
  professionals from all over the industry every year and offer 90% of students
  financial aid through the support of LARB’s readers, eight university
  partnerships, individual sponsors, and grant funders including the LA
  Department of Arts and Culture.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Success to us means:

  —Meeting admitted fellows’ need for tuition assistance. We measure this
  through a review process where we evaluate statements of need and finances,
  and work with students, donors, and institutional partners on a case-by-case
  basis to establish funding packages that make attendance possible. 


  —Seeing our fellows flourish in publishing jobs. Through a biweekly
  newsletter, monthly events, and comprehensive directory, we continue to
  support our students and celebrate their career achievements as they’ve gone
  on to work at places such as Jack Jones Literary Arts, Palgrave Macmillan,
  Prospect Park Books, Stanford University Press, W.W. Norton, and many more.


  —Helping fellows launch new creative ventures in publishing. Through our
  project incubator programs and tailored workshops on entrepreneurship, we’ve
  fostered nearly two dozen magazines, publishing houses, websites, workshops,
  and residencies, both in the U.S. and abroad.


  —Building a diverse and supportive community within the publishing industry.
  Through the application process, we’ve learned that they’ve joined us from all
  over the U.S. and nine other countries; half are people of color (versus 15%
  in similar programs); and many can only attend through varying levels of
  financial assistance. By maintaining our alumni network, we know that they’ve
  gone on to work together on projects, find jobs and mentorship with our
  speakers and faculty, and a few have even returned to staff the Publishing
  Workshop itself. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '60'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '120000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Our emphasis is on creating access for students underrepresented in the
  publishing industry and amplifying the work of independent publishers. Fellows
  that we train this year will go on to be the next generation of publishing
  professionals and leaders both in LA and across the country. If an average of
  75% of this year's cohort go on to careers in publishing, we estimate that in
  the course of their careers they will have a hand in the careers of 120,000+
  writers, and countless readers across the globe. As editors, agents,
  publicists, designers, and marketers, LARB Publishing Workshop Fellows will
  enter a rapidly changing field and shape its future into one that is
  inclusive, diverse, and reflective of the world we live in.
