title: Whose Streets? Our Streets!
project_summary: >-
  We are 5 organizations that want to bring transportation and housing advocates
  together to create a new mobility movement that prioritizes equity, climate
  change, and the need to make walking and biking safer, improve buses, and to
  make it possible for low-income people to live near high quality transit. We
  will expand our movement with a series of coordinated and inclusive events to
  address our common and most pressing issues—ranging from bikeable and walkable
  streets to affordable housing near transit, and from open streets to better
  buses.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Individuals who are walking, biking and riding transit around LA are first
  hand witnesses to the inequities and needs on the ground. Neighbors understand
  which is the most dangerous area for crossing the street, and workers know
  which bus routes are in need of more investment so they can get to work on
  time. In many cases, people want to get involved in organizing for their
  community’s transportation needs but aren’t sure how to plug in. Our
  organizations are increasing the avenues for community involvement and
  encouraging organizations to collaborate and strengthen their organizing
  power. Through events, surveys, workshops and more, we will provide on-ramps
  for community members who want to create an accessible city with better air
  and water quality, less traffic and thriving streets.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  We are a group of organizations actively working to increase collaboration,
  trust and power. In the fall of 2019, non-profit organizations: CicLAvia,
  Investing in Place, Los Angeles Walks, Los Angeles County Bicycle Coalition,
  People for Mobility Justice, Move LA, all transportation non-profits working
  in Los Angeles, co-created a monthly space where staff could strengthen
  relationships, share information and develop ideas for collaborative
  campaigns. We recognized transportation advocacy in the City of Los Angeles
  needed a reboot. In January 2020, our key partner ACT-LA joined this effort to
  expand these conversations to include affordable housing near transit and
  align the group's efforts to engage grassroots organizations in campaigns to
  win transit justice and equitable transit-oriented communities. All partners
  are experts in these issues and have relationships with decision-makers. If we
  collaborate to rethink our transportation system we can contest the status
  quo.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  We would define and measure success as a powerful, engaged, inclusive
  constituency and conversation around transportation and transit-oriented
  communities in the City of Los Angeles. For years the Los Angeles region has
  struggled to build a transportation advocacy movement that can generate
  sufficient political will to achieve equitable transportation and land use.
  Let’s change that by getting more Angelenos involved in dreaming about a more
  equitable city together.

  Transportation budgets will shrink in the aftermath of COVID-19, and there
  needs to be an organized and supported constituency to ensure funds are
  prioritized to address issues around equity, sustainability and climate
  change. 

  Los Angeles is a big place with so many advocacy organizations operating in
  different ways and in diverse communities. This proposal would provide us with
  an opportunity to double down and build power together in order to have a
  bigger and more inclusive impact. All of the applicant organizations are
  already doing their own work, but this proposal would bring us together and
  pool our constituencies and power. While we all work in the same space, there
  hasn't been an opportunity to work together as one and this could be that
  shot.The result could be a resounding success.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '3000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '300000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  LA’s transportation system is not sustainable, or affordable and desperately
  needs an overhaul. We need walkable sidewalks, protected bike lanes, streets
  where cars travel at slower speeds and buses have their own lanes. There has
  been “a staggering 75% increase in the number of pedestrian deaths between
  2015 and 2018”, Cars are expensive and transportation is the major contributor
  of GHGs and air pollution, putting those who live near freeways at high risk
  for pandemics like COVID-19. Many people who used to ride buses and trains
  have been pushed to housing farther out from their jobs, schools, and
  healthcare resources they depend on. All are major reasons transit ridership
  is down, traffic is up, and we’re scared to walk and bike.
