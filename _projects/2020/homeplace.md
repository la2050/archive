title: HOMEplace
project_summary: >-
  In the first annual HOMEplace Fellowship, Liberation Arts Community Health
  Strategists innovate replicable interventions for internal, interpersonal, and
  collective freedom from internalised and enforced systemic oppression.
  HOMEplace grants cohort members monthly housing subsidies to create
  BATJC-inspired pods of first-responders in their chosen families, support
  unhoused Survivors with resource navigation, and lead monthly Participatory
  Action Research workshops as community events to tenaciously blossom impact in
  both quantity and quality.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Applying a proven model or solution to a new issue or sector (e.g, using a job
  recruiting software or strategy to match clients to supportive housing sites,
  applying demonstrated strategies from advocating for college affordability to
  advocating for housing affordability and homelessness, etc.)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  People often stay in abusive situations because they do not have the resources
  to safely leave, and when they do, they find themselves un-homed and/or
  without the necessary support to rebuild healthily. Indeed, there are
  available subsidized housing programs and social service benefits available
  for LA residents. They also take time. HOMEplace forms a net-work in the gap
  times of the LAHSA rapid rehousing process  in order that no one falls through
  the cracks of the bureaucratic process or gets lost in institutional
  paperwork. The HOMEplace fellowship activates Liberation Arts Community Health
  Strategists to co-create curriculum-based emergency housing retreats that
  reinforce capacity-building cultural customs already anchored in home
  communities. Currently living in housing made possible by HOPICS and LAHSA’s
  Rapid Rehousing program and having been in shelters, I experienced zero
  community-building efforts. HOMEplace seeks to make all levels of Maslow’s
  Hierarchy of Needs attainable. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Lakhiyia Hicks, HOMEplace Founder/Project Manager, co-educated hundreds of
  Community Health Workers in LA County’s Department of Health Services 2018-19;
  and  previously trained C2PLA, CAC, and Planned Parenthood Peer Advocates as
  well asAMP! Peer Educators at UCLA and LAUSD High Schools. Lakhiyia also
  identifies with each marginalized identity named in target populations.
  HOMEplace believes those most proximate to crisis need to be at the heart of
  every response. Whole Person Care-LA for which HOMEplace consulted, continues
  to prove this with sole employment of those who have lived experience in the
  populations to which they will contribute.
   
  Following a discriminatory pushout from a university lecturer position
  resulting in homelessness, Lakhiyia was offered motel vouchers and group
  subsidized housing with all cis-males. Queer folks are already at risk for
  "corrective" sexual violence. When they expressed discomfort, they were told
  that the bedroom door locks. ...HOMEplace was born.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  HOMEplace: Healing Truth to Power is a public health intervention to uproot
  systemic generators of disproportionate impacts of homelessness, intimate
  partner violence, mental unwellness, incarceration, HIV/STI transmission,
  deportation, human trafficking, and suicide for Black, Queer/Questioning and
  Gender Non-conforming Female-assigned Survivors of childhood sexual assault.
  Even in the context of dire straits, people deserve better and most
  importantly, people have a birthright to heal, call all their fragmented parts
  back home in their bodies. We know those rebuttals, like “they should be
  grateful.” During Participatory Action Research workshops, we will survey and
  monitor shifts in stigma. In so doing, we co-curate the best possible
  conditions towards such self-possessed autonomy. How can we reimagine safe
  spaces that also cultivate liberating opportunities for self-reclamation?
  Homeownership and entrepreneurship are proven promotive and protective factors
  that help people reinvent their lives while building self-esteem, especially
  since there is much data on the relationship between low self-esteem and
  unwanted health outcomes. Survivors thrive in spaces that are removed from the
  immediacy of the environments they seek to escape. Which is why HOMEplace
  considers weekend-long retreats  tailored to offer people the breathing space
  they need with the presence of healing arts practitioners to help them process
  their way towards ensuring healthier home possibilities for them, invaluable.
