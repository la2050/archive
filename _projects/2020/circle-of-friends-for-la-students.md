title: Circle of Friends for LA Students
project_summary: >-
  Circle of Friends (CoF) provides support and strategies for K-12 educators who
  work with students experiencing social isolation due to disability or other
  challenges. Starting with weekly lunches and meaningful activities, students
  of all abilities and backgrounds develop awareness and acceptance of
  differences through genuine friendships. CoF participants model leadership as
  they become allies and advocates for marginalized students, increasing school
  safety and reducing bullying.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    LAUSD (please select only if you have a district-wide partnership or
    project)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >
  Nationally, 1 in 5 students has a disability or behavioral or developmental
  disorder that may be trauma-related, and spend 80% of the day in general
  education classrooms. 33.1% of students reported being bullied in 2019, a 5%
  increase since 2016. Students with disabilities are 2-3 times more likely to
  be bullied and may avoid school.  83% of general education teachers report
  that credential programs and training has not prepared them to work with
  students with disabilities or teach social-emotional skills. Each year, 8% of
  US teachers leave the classroom before retirement age due to dissatisfaction
  with support and classroom conditions. 

  CoF’s School Inclusion Program addresses the social-emotional needs and safety
  of each student by providing strategies and support for educators to improve
  student engagement, teacher morale, and school climate. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Circle of Friends partnered with LAUSD from 2015-2018 to develop school
  inclusion programs and an internal team of trainers. While CoF sites expanded
  from 10-28 during this time, structural and staffing changes have made it
  difficult to sustain. Parent concerns about safety and chronic absenteeism for
  students with disabilities have increased. CoF’s Executive Director has met
  with LAUSD Parent Center Directors, and they want to bring our program to
  their schools. LAUSD’s 2017-2019 Action Plan for Achieving Breakthroughs in
  Outcomes for Students with Disabilities identified inclusion as a goal,
  establishing pilot sites across the district. Several LAUSD schools want to
  implement CoF, but the LAUSD trainers do not have the capacity to work with
  them.  With schools closed until the summer or fall as a result of the
  Coronavirus, many students and teachers will need supports more than ever.
  Circle of Friends would love to be part of bringing inclusion back to school
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  Through Circle of Friends’ School Inclusion Program, students build key social
  emotional skills like self-regulation, compassion, problem-solving and
  patience. These Students will be empowered to create a school where everyone
  belongs and is valued.

  CoF will use our current pre-post program survey with school advisors,
  administrators and parents. Advisors will complete annual surveys to record
  demographics and the impact of inclusion on participants with disabilities,
  expansion of social skills and participation with peers in extracurricular
  activities. Evaluation of nondisabled peers will reflect their understanding
  and acceptance of differences. We will develop a project planning log for
  students that includes a reflection component that can be written or
  videotaped.

  As students attend or participate in meetings, assemblies and activities, we
  will use social media to track their reflections and growth via Twitter,
  Instagram. 

  Short-term: We will track how many students attend CoF events in the spring
  and how many additional students participate in CoF in the fall. Schools can
  also track attendance and suspension records and the California School Climate
  and Safety Survey results.

  Long-term: Increased student initiative and advocacy will result in more
  sustainability and deeper schoolwide impact.  
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '90'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '750'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >
  By experiencing authentic inclusion, students will develop an understanding
  that we all have strengths and we all need support. Human diversity will be
  valued and inclusion will be an expectation as they move through their lives.
  These students are the citizens, neighbors, employees and employers of the
  next generation.  

  We have seen how toxic fear and prejudice have become. For many, school is the
  first community we belong to outside of our family, so it is the perfect place
  for children to safely experience and bridge difference.  A recent
  dissertation included interviews with many former CoF members who are now in
  their 20s, and they said that it changed the way they saw themselves and the
  world. 
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': "As a collaborative partner, Los Angeles Unified School District will \n*\tSelect the local district and schools participating\n*\tIdentify onsite CoF Advisors to attend training and be members of the Inclusion Task Force\n*\tArrange coverage and meeting spaces for professional development, planning and meetings\n*\tBe responsible for keeping records of participation, surveys and other documentation for evaluation purposes.\n"
