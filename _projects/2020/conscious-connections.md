title: Conscious Connections
project_summary: >-
  Our project goal is to develop engaging, innovative strategies for teaching
  yoga to special education students that supports not only their physical
  health, but also their social and emotional well-being. This project will
  research, implement, assess, and design yoga curriculum aimed at meeting the
  needs of these students and support their movement towards their unique
  learning goals. We aim to reach 100 special education students in Los Angeles
  area public schools to deliver weekly yoga classes throughout the 2020/2021
  school year.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
  - Westside
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Physical education (PE) standards mandated at federal and state levels are an
  integral component of a student’s learning and overall well-being. Yoga
  instruction strengthens a student’s fundamental motor skills, teaches them to
  learn and follow patterns, and gives opportunity to participate in group
  activities, meeting PE standards. Yoga also offers dynamic tools for building
  conscious awareness of the self and social-emotional well-being. This practice
  allows students to build a connection with themselves in a way that they feel
  empowered to connect to others and their environment. In the context of
  special education (SPED), these connections can be cultivated to grow social
  and academic inclusion opportunities, giving students tools to fortify the
  skills that empower them to participate. While there is a need for best
  practice guidelines for yoga in SPED classrooms, there is virtually little or
  no research on how to be most impactful with yoga instruction in SPED
  classrooms.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Our organization grows when our instruction is diversified to reach more
  students. When we diversify our instruction, we can reach larger populations
  of students and school communities across Los Angeles. We realize that
  teaching yoga to SPED students is unique not only experientially, but also
  pedagogically. Expanding this area of our work with research, assessment, and
  curriculum design will allow us to truly reach each and every student at the
  schools where we work. As an organization focused on yoga instruction in a
  school setting, we are equipped to continue expanding our breadth of knowledge
  in the field and grow an experiential and pedagogical understanding of what
  yoga has to offer SPED students. Through curriculum development, we seek to
  demonstrate the successes of tools and methods implemented in our work both
  new and thus far, and develop project findings and research into a resource
  toolkit accessible to other yoga teachers, educators, our SPED students and
  their families.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  The ways we will define and measure success will largely fall under the
  categories of research, implementation, assessment and design. We will augment
  our current breadth of work by conducting a literature review on topics of
  physical education for SPED students as well as yoga instruction for SPED
  students. Our ongoing research throughout the school year will consist of
  written observations of yoga classes. Throughout the school year, we will
  carry out yoga instruction via regular, weekly classes at the school sites
  where we teach. We will continuously identify and implement the tools that
  best support student participation in class as well as those that positively
  support their progress toward their Individualized Education Plan (IEP) goals.
  This will include identifying ways in which yoga tools can be implemented in
  the student’s academic classroom and how these tools can bolster their
  connection to themselves and their peers. Student surveys will be conducted
  where it is age and ability appropriate to gather feedback on indicators of
  emotional/physical awareness and overall well-being. We will also partner with
  classroom teachers and family members to conduct electronic surveys and
  in-person interviews as an assessment of the impact and effectiveness of
  student participation in yoga classes. Our vision for success is to reach 100
  SPED students at elementary schools in Los Angeles and inform a toolkit
  resource for yoga educators, teachers, SPED students and their families.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '350'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '2500'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  The latest research across medical, psychological, and educational fields show
  that children can get life-changing benefits from yoga. These benefits support
  physical and emotional awareness and well-being in dynamic ways unique to
  yoga. We have seen, in a fast-paced, ever-changing world that the ways in
  which we live our everyday lives can shift quicker than ever before. Providing
  children with tools for maintaining not only physical and emotional
  well-being, but also attaining peace of mind is an invaluable practice to be
  used at any time. Providing children with these tools, and children with
  special needs particularly, empowers them to be well not only in a practice of
  presence but over the course of their lifetime.
