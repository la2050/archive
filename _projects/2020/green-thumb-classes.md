title: Green Thumb Classes!
project_summary: >-
  STWF's  newest project is creating a series of courses that allow members of
  our community, of all ages, to learn to grow their own produce and plants that
  are native to Los Angeles. Nutritious and organic food is a right. By bringing
  people together to understand plants, each class will take place in some of
  LA"s most underutilized spaces; parks, yards and community gardens. With our
  blend of academic and hands-on knowledge, our Green Thumb classes will inform,
  empower and build a stronger society.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - South LA
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  As our community has felt bolstered in academic achievement because of our
  tutoring services, it gave parents the chance to step back & look at what else
  they want for their families. Parents communicated they want to be able to
  provide access to nature and have their children know what goes into growing
  food. We resonate with this need as it is part of our mission to foster
  environmental resource understanding. Our community is composed of mainly
  low-income families who want safe green spaces for their young & themselves.
  This is difficult for some;  the high crime rate in West Adams can lead to the
  underutilization of parks. Human interaction with nature can relieve stress,
  anxiety and depression. Providing access to green spaces while also offering
  classes that promote social inclusion & learning about nature is the next
  avenue of education STWF is working to bring to life. Making these classes
  means our community can be outdoors while taking part in creating their own
  green spaces.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >
  STWF is partnered with Crop Swap LA. CSLA hires reentry citizens & veterans to
  build & maintain vegetable gardens on residential & commercial space. We have
  developed a curriculum designed around the Common Core Standards & are
  informed by the California Foundation for Agriculture in the Classroom. Each
  class has academic aspects of science, math, ELA, history, & nutrition
  included in the 2 hours. There will also be planting of seeds, pruning,
  watering, digging & gathering. Multiple community gardens already have
  generously promised their space to us. Each class will be run by staff &
  volunteers. STWF’s Director Maribel Rosales & Administrator Maria Myrick, will
  be full-time coordinators. Maria is a LAUSD teacher who cowrote the curriculum
  with CSLA’s founder, Jamiah Higgins. Jamiah would teach each class as resident
  garden master. Maribel & Maria would help as needed, making sure the younger
  students receive more hands-on assistance & both are trained in first aid/CPR
  response. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  We believe in constant communication. Success is defined by the feedback
  students of each Green Thumb Class provide us with. As these classes are for a
  community of all ages, we want to make sure we are designing and serving
  material that the community wants. The way we measure success will be 1: how
  many people are we able to provide with classes? We want to serve a large
  portion of our West Adams population. 2: We would like to have multiple
  classes start happening in many different community gardens, parks and front
  yards across the area. Saving the West Foundation ultimately wants people to
  have the access and environmental knowledge to start utilizing and creating
  their own open green spaces. By educating themselves on growing food and
  plants native to Los Angeles, they are able to provide their own agency…
  Saving the West Foundation believes environmental education is just as
  necessary as academic excellence. Affordable, weekly and open to all ages,
  participants in the Green Thumb Classes will learn how to grow plants native
  to Los Angeles, their own produce and their own wealth.  
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '80'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '5000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  With a wealth of information, comes the desire to share it. We project that
  these classes & open gardens will impact the entire community. There are
  approximately 46,581 residents in our zip code alone. We suspect that even if
  the majority of West Adams does not go to our classes, there will be
  conversations about what we are doing, more green beauty accessible to all &
  an increase in access to healthier food. We want the dissemination of
  information on how easy it is to grow produce from scraps for yourself. The
  service population of STWF is 47% African American, 53% Latino, with 21% of
  the population living below the poverty line; 1.5 times the average for CA.
  95% of our registered students receive free/reduced lunch from their schools. 
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  We are presenting these classes in collaboration with Crop Swap LA. We have
  written the curricula with Jamiah Higgins, CSLA’s founder. Crop Swap LA has
  experience in taking empty lots and revitalizing them into green spaces. With
  Jamiah’s knowledge we will be able to build raised garden beds, troughs for
  the water to stay in and vine supports. CSLA will also show other faculty the
  basics of proper soil mixing, which is essential to preparing the growth of
  any plants. For the first few class sessions, Jamiah would also be lead
  teaching advisor.
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Host public events or gatherings
  - 'Capacity, including staff'
  - Strategy assistance and implementation
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.: CropSwap LA
Which metrics will your submission impact?:
  - Enrollment in afterschool programs
  - Opportunity youth (“Disengaged youth” 16-24 not working or in school)
  - Proficiency in STEM
Are there any other LA2050 goal categories that your proposal will impact?:
  - LA is the best place to CREATE
  - LA is the best place to CONNECT
  - LA is the healthiest place to LIVE
