title: Connect With Curling
project_summary: >-
  Curling is an 8 to 80 sport that fosters social connections, social mixing,
  competitive outlets, and activity that is eminently adaptable for athletes and
  participants of all skills and abilities. The program aims to bring together
  various community groups to share the tenants of curling (sportsmanship,
  teamwork, practice, camaraderie) through team building and fundraising
  activities for the organizations. These sessions will occur throughout the
  year and culminate in a tournament where they come together to compete and mix
  with each other.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - South LA
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  There’s a constant refrain in cities that it's difficult to make friends and
  connect with people as adults. Friendships made through school, work, and
  physical proximity can be limiting in scope and create bubbles. Sports is a
  proven outlet for folks of all ages to connect with each other. Teamwork and
  competition can create intense bonds. Curling is a particularly unique sport
  in that it is available to anyone who wants to play. There are very few
  limitations as the game isn’t about pure strength, size isn’t a determining
  factor, and folks can participate from wheelchairs, deaf, or even blind. Women
  can compete with men and families can play together. It is through this lens
  that curling can help connect disparate groups who otherwise would have no
  reason to meet in a collaborative setting. Lawyers and artists, bureaucrats
  and scientists, children and retirees. If you’re new to a city, you can go to
  a curling club and instantly find a welcoming group of folks to make you feel
  at home.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Southern California Curling Center is the only facility dedicated to the sport
  of curling in Southern California. Currently, Hollywood Curling runs curling
  activities at local ice rinks, but primarily at the Ice Station in Valencia.
  Unfortunately, that ice rink is shutting down, severely cutting down on the
  region’s capacity to host all ice sports, and particularly curling. With
  access to curling ice 24/7, we have the unique opportunity to put on all sorts
  of specialty events of all sizes for different groups.


  By bringing these groups together, we can broaden our participation and create
  a base of players that reflect Los Angeles in the 21st century.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  We will measure success with a few metrics. First, the sheer number of
  participants from each participating organization. These events will bring
  staff, volunteers, participants, and general supporters of the organization
  together for team building and fundraising activities. These are opportunities
  for support volunteers and mix with current curling members.

  Next, we’ll measure fundraising. Each event is simultaneously a team building
  event for staff and volunteers as well as an opportunity to raise funds
  through general participation for the organization. We want to turn these
  dollars back into the community we serve.

  Last, we’ll measure in converted curlers. Most participants will simply enjoy
  their time out and be one and done, but some will continue on and we want to
  foster their participation and grow the diverse base of players who convene
  every week
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '400'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '500'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  The broader impact of this proposal is to highlight the value of sports,
  competition, and physical activity in a highly urbanized world. It is very
  difficult to create new park space, so we have an opportunity to create
  recreation opportunities indoors for a sport that has a very low barrier to
  access. The fact that the sport is open to all means participants represent
  such a broad spectrum of Angelenos and bringing different groups together for
  a common activity is a first step to bridging many of the social gaps we find
  ourselves with. While total number of people we reach will be in the hundreds,
  not thousands, the effect will be more impactful for those we do reach.
