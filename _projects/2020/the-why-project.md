title: The Why Project
project_summary: >-
  The Why Project empowers underprivileged students in the [NEIGHBORHOOD] of Los
  Angeles. Inspired by neuroscience research demonstrating that we can only
  think deeply about things we care deeply about, we start with the why, working
  with students to hone in on their passions and develop creative projects
  around them. Those projects expose students to new ideas, challenges, and
  opportunities, promote their self-agency and project management skills, and
  above all, reinforce upon them that their passions are worth being passionate
  about.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - South LA
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  The Why Project is a direct response to the current education system, which 
  lacks in its ability to support the passions of students in ALL subjects.
  Education should not be limited to essays or exams, but applications of how
  knowledge can be used to empower and change the world. Unfortunately,
  underprivileged communities are further disempowered as students are not
  motivated to believe that their ideas can change the world. Ultimately, this
  squashes their ability to bring forward their ideas and make them into
  reality. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >
  As a grassroots organization, we’ve seen firsthand how execution of a passion
  project incites creativity and self agency, an essential skill to flourishing
  in all endeavors. Our organizers have gone on to become successful academics,
  engineers, and entrepreneurs due to the skills they’ve learned within our
  organization. Novus carefully crafts an environment in which the community
  built in the organization fosters collaboration in the creation of robust,
  specific solutions to problems endemic to our community.

  Novus more accurately simulates the “real world” job market outside of an
  educational setting, further empowering students with the toolkits they need
  to pursue what matters to them in any career. The Why Project doesn’t teach
  students what to think, but rather how to think critically and pursue their
  goals, regardless of the current structures in place. We want to emulate these
  values found in our own organization to foster the same type of passion
  amongst students.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  The vision for the Why Project is to develop a community of passionate,
  empathetic and driven individuals in high schools across Los Angeles that
  embody values of self agency, vulnerability, and compassion. Because the Why
  Project’s main focus is the development of people and projects, we will
  measure success by tracking students personal growth through the use of
  journals. 

  A big part of the Why Project is action so success can be tracked via the
  tangible improvement of student engagement and productivity. The goal of the
  program is to empower students, through self agency, to pursue a project in
  whatever subject choice in a structured setting. Usually, students aren’t
  given any autonomy in the work that they are assigned, nor have much say in
  the content of what they are learning. Through the Why Project, students will
  be given autonomy to build out their projects that are representative of their
  learning and ability. From this goal, we are able to track their success
  through their own set milestones within their projects, which emphasize their
  autonomy, enabling them to follow through on their project ambitions.
  Furthermore, their milestones can be used as a marker to give guidance to
  students, allowing them to develop their project in their own ways, but also
  enable for constructive input on their progress while maintaining the
  project’s independence. We hope to be able to guide the students along their
  projects and provide them with the guidance and resources that they’ll need,
  but also be able to see a tangible project that they are fully invested in and
  responsible for.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '30'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '150'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  We hope that The Why Project is able to change the way in which education is
  approached within the classroom. This includes a curriculum that is focused on
  discovering the passions of each individual student. Moreover, a proper
  execution of the project may further prove the level of imagination and
  productivity students may have when given not only the proper resources but
  also the guidance of individuals who genuinely believe in their passions and
  creations. We aim to inspire the next generation of passionate creators, and
  provide them with the assistance that they lacked prior to carrying out their
  ideas, and we believe that a holistic approach such as the WHY Project is best
  suited for it.
