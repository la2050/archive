Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Applying a proven model or solution to a new issue or sector (e.g, using a job
  recruiting software or strategy to match clients to supportive housing sites,
  applying demonstrated strategies from advocating for college affordability to
  advocating for housing affordability and homelessness, etc.)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Pre-pandemic, 150 Angelenos fell into homelessness daily. Now, that number is
  expanding exponentially. The nature of homelessness, marked by devastating
  losses of home, property, and safety, inflicts internal trauma that often
  becomes a barrier to employment. Urban Possibilities (UP) exists to help
  remedy these internal traumas and empower homeless job seekers with tools to
  get back on the road to accomplishment. Partnered with LA Mission, we will
  convert our classes to a digital format, allowing us to reach homeless job
  seekers now sheltering in place. UP has delivered in-person classes for 8
  years with remarkable student success. UP courses inspire positive focus in
  our students, build skills and raise self-esteem. Converting to a digital
  platform in this pilot program, we have the opportunity to gather qualitative
  and quantitative data to examine program efficiencies and then be able to
  offer these online classes to other homeless service providers during and post
  pandemic. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Since 2014, UP has successfully delivered our empowerment training in the Skid
  Row Community; 3 years at LA Mission and 4 years at Chrysalis Job Center.
  Before the pandemic,73% of our graduates were working or in school. We have a
  proven, results-based curriculum that uses the arts to teach empowerment
  lessons resulting in enhanced critical thinking, discipline, creativity,
  communication and collaboration skills as well as increased self-confidence
  and self-efficacy resulting in improved employment prospects. Our partners,
  the Geffen Playhouse and the Wallis Annenberg Center for Performing Arts,
  supply theatre practitioners as an in-kind contribution to teach our students
  performance and self-presentation skills. Our graduation performances engage a
  cross section of Angelenos and inspire audiences to new perspectives about
  homeless Angelenos and themselves. Our book signings of published student work
  engage graduates and attendees in meaningful dialogue and cultural exchange. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  Historically, we have graduated 75% of enrolled students. Our students have
  shown us what success looks like. Completing our unique 12-week program,
  students feel valued, empowered and land jobs. Learning the building blocks of
  success, they alchemize muscles built in struggle and employ them to take
  concrete steps to significantly improve their lives. Through writing and
  public performance, they come alive to their gifts and talents. Telling their
  stories on stage, they heal from shame and stigma and inspire Angelenos of all
  backgrounds to engage in meaningful dialogue, let go of stereotypes and see
  new possibilities in their homeless neighbors and themselves. 

  Success for the pilot project with LA Mission will allow us to convert our
  curriculum to an online format to reach homeless job seekers now sheltering in
  place.  Success will prove that our program can be equally effective delivered
  remotely, allowing greater program expansion. We will measure our impact
  through pre and post surveys, producing an online graduation show including a
  live talk back and the sale of an e-book of student work that raises at least
  $5k for the program. Our goal is to build social media viewership of the
  online show reaching at least 5000 viewers initially and continuing to
  increase views with ongoing social media campaigns. Success ultimately will be
  to scale up delivery by offering classes both online and in person to support
  and partner with LA agencies on the front line of homelessness.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '45'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '5000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Imagine classes delivered to homeless job seekers in person, online or via
  cell phone that help them transform from the inside out. Classes that teach
  tools to  help them ace interviews and land jobs. Urban Possibilities offers
  those classes. UP students participate in a process that helps heal the
  internal traumas of homelessness. Writing their stories and performing them
  raises confidence and esteem. Our performances inspire Angelenos to see their
  homeless neighbors differently, decreasing resistance and stigma. A
  chronically homeless person costs taxpayers an average of $35,578 a year. We
  can support the work of service providers to get homeless job seekers on a
  path to employment and self-sufficiency and lower homeless numbers in LA.
