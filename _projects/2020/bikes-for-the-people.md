title: Bikes for the People
project_summary: >-
  With this grant, we would like to partner with organizations that provide
  services to underserved or underprivileged individuals, identifying those who
  lack access to transportation. We will provide participants with bicycles and
  teach them how to properly maintain them. We will then provide safe riding
  classes using Bicycle Kitchen staff, volunteers, and licensed instructors to
  help participants gain confidence and knowledge while successfully riding on
  the streets of Los Angeles.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to PLAY
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  While Los Angeles is widely considered a "city built around cars", there are
  many underprivileged groups that have limited access to vehicles or other
  modes of transportation. For these groups, the bicycle may be their only
  feasible means of accessing essential resources, including employment,
  education, health care, and social services. While the bicycle can be a fun,
  safe, healthy, and accessible form of transportation, many individuals who
  could benefit from owning a bike cannot afford to buy one and do not know how
  to maintain or ride one safely on the streets of Los Angeles. If these
  individuals could have access to bikes and develop maintenance and safe riding
  skills, it would not only increase their mobility and access to fundamental
  resources, but also provide them with the empowerment, enjoyment, and health
  benefits of owning and riding a bike that they know how to repair themselves
  if needed.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  With a history going back 18 years, the Bicycle Kitchen is one of the oldest
  and most well-known bicycle cooperatives in Los Angeles and has
  well-established roots throughout the local community. The Bicycle Kitchen
  stands at a unique intersection within bicycling culture: we interject our
  do-it-yourself, co-op spirit into the bicycle community as a whole, and we
  already serve many underprivileged groups that have limited access to other
  modes of transportation. The Bicycle Kitchen has successfully implemented
  aspects of this proposal separately in the past, but we have never integrated
  them together into a single streamlined program due to lack of funds and
  adequate staff. With sufficient funding, we can build upon our past successes
  and use our connections and expertise to scale the impact of our programs to a
  higher level.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Each participant that completes this program will be an additional experienced
  bicycle commuter. They will have gained access to reliable transportation that
  can be used year-round with minimal expense. We would like to gauge their
  attitudes and perceptions on a number of bike-related issues in L.A. before
  and after the program through surveys and testimonials. A sample of our survey
  is shown here to indicate the metrics we plan to measure.


  On a scale from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest): 


  1. Do you feel that you have reliable access to transportation?

  2. Do you feel that you have adequate access to essential resources, including
  employment, education, health care, and social services?

  3. How confident are you on a bike?

  4. Do you know how to do basic repairs on a bike (fix a flat, adjust your
  brakes, etc.)?

  5. How likely are you to bike to school/work?

  6. How likely are you to attend bicycle-related events throughout Los Angeles
  (CicLAvia, LA Marathon Crash Ride, Midnight Ridazz, etc.)?

  7. How likely are you to ride a bike for exercise?

  8. How likely are you to ride a bike for fun/recreation?

  9. How likely are you to ride a bike to businesses or institutions within your
  community?

  10. How likely are you to ride a bike instead of using an alternative mode of
  transportation?


  We hope to see improvements across all of these metrics, showcasing the
  ability of this program to create impacts in terms of economic opportunity,
  physical health, and community building.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '165'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '1650'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Cycling may lead to better, healthier lives and help participants engage more
  actively with their community. Access to a working bicycle will help expand
  participants’ mobility and create economic and other opportunities. Bicycling
  also has a number of health benefits. For instance, cycling commuters have
  lower rates of cancer and heart disease compared to other types of commuters.
  Furthermore, cycling has a lower environmental impact than driving, and more
  cyclists on the road will help mitigate the growing problems related to
  motorized vehicle traffic throughout Los Angeles. These benefits would have
  substantial social, economic, and environmental impacts, and pave the way
  towards a better version of the city we all love and call home.
