title: Social and Emotional Learning at Alliance
project_summary: >-
  The Alliance Foundation seeks funding to expand Social-Emotional Learning
  (SEL) strategies and practices across a network of 28 public charter schools
  operated by Alliance College-Ready Public Schools (Alliance) in Los Angeles.
  Through this project, Alliance’s newly-formed Scholar, Family, & Community
  Services team will support teachers and school leaders to implement
  instructional best practices that contribute to healthy school climates and
  nurture social and emotional competencies among the network’s 13,000 students
  enrolled in grades 6-12.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South LA
  - South Bay
  - San Pedro
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Alliance opened in 2004 when only 49% of local youth graduated high school.
  Today, the network educates 13,000 scholars annually at 28 academies located
  in East, South, and Central Los Angeles, Huntington Park, San Pedro, and Sun
  Valley. Scholars live, learn, and play in some of the city’s most systemically
  oppressed communities—neighborhoods that are rich with historic and cultural
  assets and deeply-rooted community pride, but that also grapple with acute
  financial disparities, high rates of violence, and inequitable access to
  quality education due to decades of institutional racism and socio-economic
  injustice. Many Alliance scholars have experienced trauma and Adverse
  Childhood Experiences.


  Despite this, 95% of our seniors graduate and 95% are accepted to college.
  Once there, however, fewer than 30% earn a degree. Seeing a dissonance between
  scholars’ success under our high support model and the independent skills
  needed to manage college stressors, Alliance seeks to close the gap.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Alliance was founded on the belief that all youth, regardless of personal and
  environmental challenges, can achieve at high levels when provided the
  rightful opportunity to do so—and that we all have an important obligation to
  help youth in our community fulfill the vast promise of that potential.
  Alliance underscores this founding belief in every educational service design
  it puts in place, including the introduction of its new Scholar, Family, &
  Community Services team. This team will support teachers and school leaders to
  build school climates that nurture resilient learners—where schoolwide
  practices support scholars’ healing, social-emotional growth, and lifelong
  adaptability to stressful situations, and where such practices are considered
  inextricably linked to the pursuit of rigorous academic goals and standards.
  As one of the largest and highest performing charter networks in Los Angeles,
  and with this new team in place, Alliance is uniquely poised to advance the
  LEARN metrics.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  In this next phase of its strategic growth, Alliance is committed to ensuring
  that its scholars not only get into college, but that at least 75%
  successfully earn a college degree. This will be accomplished in part by
  ensuring that all scholars who go on to independently manage their educational
  journeys in college have the social and emotional competencies to persist
  along the demanding path to degree completion. Toward this end, the Scholar,
  Family, & Community Services team will provide critical professional
  development and coaching for teachers and school leaders, data tracking and
  analysis, as well as curriculum materials and collateral resources for
  expanded SEL to take place in Alliance schools. 


  In the short-term, this project will support capacity to deliver SEL services
  to a greater number of schools and scholars across the network. Long-term, the
  project will contribute to a more forbearing, considerate, and enriched
  society by helping Alliance graduate more self-aware, civically engaged,
  academically accomplished, and college-ready scholars each year. SEL learning
  gains will be measured through discipline/suspension and expulsion decreases,
  increased or strongly sustained attendance, and outcomes gains on the Panorama
  SEL Survey, which is a research-based tool that measures scholars’
  social-emotional functioning and perceptions. There is also a teacher survey
  component that will be used in conjunction with student surveys.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '13000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '35500'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Research shows that children who have traumatic life experiences are at
  increased risk for challenges in school, including spending more time out of
  the classroom and lost instructional minutes due to disciplinary consequences;
  strained relationships with teachers and peers; being at greater risk of
  failing a grade; scoring lower on achievement tests; and experiencing higher
  rates of suspensions, expulsions, and referrals to special education. This
  project will also have broader implications for the 35,500 Alliance teachers,
  school leaders, and parents who are collectively invested in scholars’ safety
  and wellbeing, and who will benefit from scholars’ increased ability to
  discuss and regulate their emotional responses to stressors. 
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  The Alliance Foundation is serving as lead applicant for this proposal, with
  project implementation being carried out by Alliance College-Ready Public
  Schools. Existing solely to strengthen community support of and investment in
  Alliance schools, the Alliance Foundation, a separate legal entity with no
  overlapping board members or staff, works in tandem with Alliance to ensure
  that excellent educational opportunities exist for scholars and families that
  live in communities where traditional institutions have failed them. While
  distinct 501(c)(3) entities, both organizations are working in fidelity to the
  charge established by Alliance’s founders more than 15 years ago—to provide
  support for scholars and families who deserve access to an exceptional public
  education.
