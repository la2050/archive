title: West L.A. Votes! — A Civic Engagement Initiative
project_summary: >-
  Venice Family Clinic will mobilize Angelenos across West L.A. to make their
  voices heard through a non-partisan outreach initiative that will make
  politics, politicians, and the polls more accessible. Through West L.A. Votes!
  we will launch a government education campaign, train volunteers to connect
  residents to voting resources, and bridge the gap between voters and local
  officials by promoting dialogue in community settings. We believe that
  increasing civic engagement among the families we serve is critical to driving
  health equity.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Westside
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Venice Family Clinic seeks to unite staff, volunteers, our partners, and
  community members across West L.A. in breaking down barriers to voting and
  broader civic participation. West L.A. Votes! will:


  *  Promote opportunities for Angelenos to learn about political offices and
  their functions through a civic education campaign

  *  Train a force of dedicated volunteers alongside our staff to register
  voters and get them to the polls  

  *  Bring local elected officials and community members together face-to-face
  to dialogue about policies and community needs


  We believe that civic engagement has a significant impact on the health of our
  community. When community members participate in civic processes, they build
  collective power to access health-affirming policies and programs, ranging
  from health insurance to housing to education. They also build relationships
  with each other, strengthening the social fabric and wellbeing of our
  neighborhoods.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >
  As the largest community health provider on the Westside, Venice Family Clinic
  is a trusted source of care for nearly 28,000 Angelenos. Our services
  encompass the “4 C’s” of primary care: first Contact, Continuity,
  Comprehensiveness, and Coordination. We also recognize a 5th “C,” which stands
  for Community. In recent years, we have made a commitment to responding to the
  sociopolitical factors that influence the health and wellness of the people we
  serve. 


  Venice Family Clinic boasts a team of dedicated staff and volunteers that
  engage in outreach and advocacy efforts across our community. Our team
  maintains strong relationships with over 80 local institutions—including
  schools, libraries, and county agencies. Team activities range from connecting
  hundreds of community members to health and social services during National
  Health Center Week, to meeting with officials about policies that affect our
  patients. Our extensive reach makes us the ideal hub for a civic engagement
  initiative. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: "Research shows people are more likely to vote when they understand how government works. We will launch a non-partisan campaign to educate Angelenos about national, state, and local government. We will:\n\n*  Create Government 101 video shorts, narrated in English/Spanish by our patients, to play in clinic waiting rooms.—Over 20,000 patients will view them.\n*  Pilot a government Lunch & Lecture series with our staff and Patient Advisory Council.—Over 200 people will attend. Focus groups will capture impact.\n\nOnly 1 in 2 Angelenos report they always or frequently vote. Rates are even lower among people we serve, who are largely low-income and from communities of color. We will mobilize West L.A. residents to vote through non-partisan outreach efforts at community-wide events and online. We will:\n\n*  Recruit and train at least 20 outreach volunteers\n*  Assist over 100 residents with voter registration \n*  Partner with agencies who will demo ballot marking devices and register residents for ID cards with no fee waivers \n*  Disseminate election information e-blasts \n*  Provide shuttle transport to the polls\n\nCitizens who trust elected officials are more likely to vote and feel a sense of civic duty. We will connect residents with their officials and facilitate meaningful interactions. We will:\n\n*\tInvite government officials to speak at our lecture series\n*\tHold “Meet Your Representative” booths at local events\n*\tCreate an online guide on how to contact elected officials  "
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '21500'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '144000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Health centers like Venice Family Clinic are responsive to communities who are
  not often heard, including people living in poverty, the uninsured, and people
  of color. Empowering our patients and neighbors to participate in politics
  will add new voices to civic discourse and shape policy to be representative
  of all Angelenos.


  We know that initiatives like West L.A. Votes! work. The 2018 Get-Out-The-Vote
  campaign led by regional health network AltaMed is a prime example. AltaMed
  increased midterm election turnout in underrepresented neighborhoods by
  canvassing, calling, and addressing transportation needs. By employing a
  similar engagement strategy—paired with opportunities for education and
  dialogue—we will mobilize voters across West L.A.
