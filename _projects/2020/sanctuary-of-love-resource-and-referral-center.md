  The youth homelessness is a tragic and growing problem. Current counts from
  the L.A. Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA) state that of the 50,000 - 60,000
  homeless people in L.A. in 2019, “youth, from minors through age 24, make up
  8,915 of the county's homeless population.” 
   
  It’s important to understand that it’s NOT a lack of housing that causes
  homelessness. Most homeless youth think they have no safe or supportive
  environment to return “home” to. They feel unloved, utterly worthless and
  discarded by society and their own families. 


  As a community, we must address the conditions that CAUSE youth to feel they
  have such little worth that living on the streets and in a perpetual cycle of
  strife and chaos is what they deserve. Homelessness, disengagement, substance
  abuse, and prostitution are outward manifestations of deep feelings of
  worthlessness and inadequacy. 


  Our youth desire kindness, resources, unconditional love and training,
  teaching self-love and respect. 

Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >+
  At age 35, Greg Johnson made the decision to clean up his life in 2005 after
  his father died of a drug overdose and just two months later his uncle took
  his life during a drunken binge. Knowing he was next if he continued with his
  methamphetamine addiction, Greg chose to live. His healing and recovery
  unfolded through a spiritual journey to forgiveness and rediscovery of the
  self-love.


  Sober, Greg became a licensed spiritual practitioner & drug and alcohol
  counselor. 

  Having once been homeless, lost, and battling his own inner demons, Greg
  founded L.O.V.E. Foundation in 2012 to help homeless and disenfranchised youth
  cultivate their own innate power to heal their hearts, amplify their inner
  strength, and discover the leadership capability within in order to live,
  create, play, and thrive in life. Services and interventions are based on
  Greg’s extensive research on adolescent development and high-risk youth
  populations during his master’s program in Human Services.



Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >+
  Funding will be used to help support our Sanctuary of Love Resource & Referral
  Center (SOL) operations and our outreach, resource and referral events, and
  transformational self-empowerment workshops. And finally, it will help us
  continue grow and improve our network of partners volunteers who want to work
  with us to make a transformative difference in the lives of our most
  vulnerable. Below are our services and that we will use your funding to help
  provide, grow, and/or improve.


  Homeless Community Outreach 

  Through our street outreach and community events, we provide basic needs and a
  critically important sense of community. 


  Resource & Referral Events

  Resource and referral events provide basic needs to our homeless young people
  and further build rapport, trust, and a sense of community. These events are
  planned and delivered in collaboration with numerous community partners and
  businesses to providing much needed food, supplies, and hygiene. 


  Self-Empowerment Workshops 

  Self-empowerment training workshops help our youth in crisis resolve their
  deep inner wounds and learn to love themselves. Those who attend our workshops
  learn that their challenges have purpose and meaning by helping them build
  resilience and grow into amazingly strong individuals. Until they can see how
  amazing they are for themselves, 


  Community Awareness & Education 

  We also raise awareness and build community collaborative support about the
  epidemic problem of youth homelessness. 

Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '2000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '10000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Real, lasting transformation starts from within and must begin at the core of
  the problem. We help homeless and otherwise vulnerable, lost young people who
  are READY to take charge and transform their lives to heal the deep inner
  wounds that are the true cause of their problems, whatever they may be. We
  teach our most vulnerable and emotionally damaged young people how to love,
  trust, and honor themselves so they can overcome their real and perceived
  obstacles and design lives that honor themselves and others. Then, they can
  teach others how to do the same through the power of their own example. With
  whole-hearted living, our youth are reconnected with their purpose to live a
  life of strength and passion, alive with integrity and character.
