title: Money Makers
project_summary: >-
  Junior High will create “Money Makers” — a 10-month program featuring 10
  workshops built to prepare artists ages 15—25 for life in creative careers.
  With career artists, tax professionals, and legal experts working with trained
  educators to develop instruction, Junior High will curate accessible
  programming for young people to develop skills in financial literacy. Topics
  will include budgeting, invoicing, and paying taxes. Lessons and branding will
  prioritize females, people of color, queer artists, and those experiencing
  financial burdens.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  The first step in addressing pay inequity is teaching young women and artists
  of color their value. Remedial education lacks the necessary training for
  financial literacy, especially for poor and working class students who often
  have the most to lose when it comes to poor financial management. “Money
  Makers” will equip teenagers and young adults with educational components that
  basic schooling lacks. Through learning budgeting, invoicing, and proper
  financial practices, more young people will feel equipped to enter the
  workforce, get paid for their labor, and pursue successful careers in the
  arts. Through this education — pay gaps will diminish, lower-income
  communities will secure more financially-fulfilling opportunities, and those
  most burdened by a lack of literacy will have the chance to advance in a
  society that prioritizes wealth.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Junior High is uniquely situated as a dynamic space for both young people and
  emerging artists. We have an expansive community of over 30,000 members — 33%
  of which are between the ages of 13 to 24. Throughout our five year tenure as
  Los Angeles’ most notable art space for young people, we have garnered a
  reputation for authenticity, responsibility, and knowledge. As the founder of
  Junior High and a freelance artist myself, pursuing art and entrepreneurship
  with no professional financial training felt like starting at an incalculable
  disadvantage. While the ethos of Junior High in general has always been to
  offer my community what I, myself, lacked — this particular project feels more
  immediate. Financial literacy is tied directly to self-worth. If I could teach
  young me what I know now, I’d spend fewer years struggling financially and
  invalidating my labor. Just because I “made it on my own” doesn’t mean the
  next generation of artists should have to. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  Junior High will consider “Money Makers” successful if:


  — we provide 10 months and 10 courses of professional development and
  financial literacy at no cost to the community

  — we serve at least 50 artists IRL and 5,000 artists online per workshop

  — 95% of the artists served are between the ages of 15 to 25

  — 95% of the artists served are from the following demographics:
  female-identifying, queer, trans or nonbinary, people of color, and lower or
  working class

  —100% of the instructors are female-identifying, queer, trans or nonbinary,
  people of color, and lower or working class

  — we are able to pay instructors sustainable wages high above any minimum wage
  evaluations

  — Junior’s High’s following doubles per social media metrics

  — we partner with more community organizations to bring these courses to life,
  thus granting students more access to dedicated resources from not just Junior
  High, but also our community partners


  On a broader scale, a true testament of success will be how many young people
  interact with our content and go on to become successful, financially secure,
  and empowered.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '5000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '50000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  As programming will be free to the young people of Los Angeles, we hope many
  will subsequently begin successful careers as artists. We're accounting for 50
  students in person per workshop, and a much larger audience digitally. Online,
  we estimate the viewership to be around 10,000-20,000 unique impressions.
  Focusing our efforts on prioritizing women, POC, and queer artists will better
  equip them for successful long-term careers in the arts. Not only does this
  improve the economic standing of these communities and their varying
  intersections, but studies have proven that increasing the pay and economic
  standing of women, especially women of color, would dramatically impact their
  families and the United States economy as a whole.
