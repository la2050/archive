title: One Day
project_summary: >
  Climate Resolve’s One Day campaign will encourage Angelenos to get out of
  their cars one day per week and either bike or walk or take public
  transportation to get where they’re going. The One Day campaign would not only
  reduce traffic, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions, but, most
  importantly, would also show elected leaders that the public supports modes of
  transportation other than the automobile.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - San Gabriel Valley
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South LA
  - Westside
  - South Bay
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >+
  Cars pollute our air and contribute to the crisis of climate change. Cars also
  clog our streets, maim our loved ones, and make us feel antagonistic toward
  our neighbors. Depending on cars for mobility is not a step in the right
  direction; it is a devolution. Car-less transportation must no longer be
  treated as “lesser than” and marginalized, and transportation infrastructure
  should no longer serve cars above all else. 


  In addition to reducing air pollution and traffic, using active and public
  transportation increases social cohesion and public wellbeing. Climate Resolve
  sees a future where we walk to the bus or train, get some exercise, breathe
  cleaner air, and say hello to our neighbors along the way. We’ll arrive at our
  jobs refreshed by the experience of traversing through public spaces that
  build community bonds, and we’ll be relieved of the burden and risks of car
  ownership. We’ll be safer, healthier, happier, and doing right by the planet.

Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >
  Climate Resolve has been successfully advocating for improvements to LA’s
  transportation system for nearly a decade. We created and lead the EnviroMetro
  coalition, a network of more than 70 groups dedicated to making public transit
  more equitable, more accessible, and more usable. EnviroMetro was successful
  in establishing a comprehensive sustainability policy at Metro and an equity
  framework, which is to guide everything that the agency does. Climate Resolve
  also chairs the Sustainability Council at Metro, which helps lead the agency
  in making investments in the transit system more sustainable and equitable. 


  We’re also involved in crafting a plan for a “green street” in South El Monte,
  where cars, bikes, buses, and pedestrians can all happily coexist on a shaded
  thoroughfare. Climate Resolve also conducted a comprehensive study of
  ridership at the Sherman Way transit station in Canoga Park, looking at
  barriers to access and ways to improve the rider experience. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  Climate Resolve’s overall vision for success is having people take public
  transit or active transportation for one day per week. More granular measures
  of success for this project will be:


  -The number of people reached by our communications campaign. Climate Resolve
  has an extensive digital contact list, and we hope to leverage the LA2050
  community to increase the number of people we are able to contact.
  Communications measures will include a description of the campaign, the
  climate and social benefits of not driving a car, information about different
  transit options, and social media packages featuring custom gifs and memes. In
  addition to online communications, Climate Resolve will put up billboards and
  banners in high-traffic areas to encourage participation in its One Day
  campaign.


  -A change in public perception around driving versus other transportation
  modes. Climate Resolve believes we can change the public narrative around Los
  Angeles. We envision surveying community members, both in-person and through
  our online platforms, about their changing perceptions of driving - especially
  single-occupant vehicles.


  -An increase in ridership on public transportation. While an increase in
  ridership is a difficult goal to attain, Climate Resolve believes this
  campaign can truly make a difference in how Los Angeles views transportation.
  We will leverage our strong working relationship with Metro to obtain and
  examine ridership trends over the grant period. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '20000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '4000000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >
  The One Day campaign has the potential to change the narrative around cars in
  Los Angeles - especially the hundreds of thousands of single-occupant vehicles
  crowding the freeways every day. Climate Resolve believes this effort can
  compliment the measures it has already taken to improve public transportation
  in LA, including making it more sustainable, equitable, and responsive to
  riders. This shift in perception will have many broader impacts: increased
  support for ballot measures that spur transit investment; more people riding
  Metro buses and trains; a decrease in traffic and air pollution; and an
  increase in social cohesion. We know we can reach 20,000 of our contacts
  alone, and with support from LA2050 we can benefit the whole city!
