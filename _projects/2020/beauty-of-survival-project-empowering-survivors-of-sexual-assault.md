What is the need you’re responding to?: "The latest reports in the City of Los Angeles from Jan 1–June 30, 2019, there were 468 reported rapes. These numbers likely don’t reflect the total incidents, rape is one of the most underreported crimes. Nationwide, only about one quarter of rapes are reported, meaning about 75% of rapes and sexual assaults are not reported to the police. Issues of sexual violence are linked to some of our most prevalent social problems including addictions, mental illness, sexual exploitation, medical problems, self-harm, suicide, parenting challenges, poverty, homelessness and domestic violence. In other words, sexual violence is a serious public health issue. Having direct access to information, support, therapy and therapeutic activities can positively change lives. Every survivor deserves the chance to resolve\_their internal trauma and restore their\_future progression. VBA plans to be\_readily available to assist with this need. Our programs will empower and encourage survivors to heal and thrive."
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: "This project is important to the work of our organization because by educating individuals of the community about sexual assault can surely decrease the amount of sexual violence within the City of Los Angeles. Providing the resources necessary if abuse/sexual assault happens it will encourage survivors to either report the crime and/or start a journey to heal from the trauma. By having to safe environments where we can have therapy, meditation, yoga, conversation sessions, writing experiences, etc. will create self confidence, self awareness and hope for survivors. Our Survival Retreats are survival celebration and a healing experience like no other. The healing\_process for survivors starts with a space where they feel comfortable expressing themselves. VBA is an organization that knows first hand what sexual violence and the effects of sexual trauma look like. Our Founder was brutally raped and kidnapped so the passion behind out work is notable. We are dedicated to seeing change!\n "

Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Addressing sexual violence will require action and input across government
  ministries and a collaborative, coordinated approach ensuring that the
  political, social and economic issues related to sexual violence are included
  in government policies and practices.

  A coordinated multidisciplinary approach is essential to ensure that every
  survivor is able to access a full continuum of responsive, effective sexual
  violence services and support systems across their life span if needed.
  Programs and services must be continuously evaluated and ongoing sexual
  violence research is essential to ensure that current practices are always up
  to standard. The survivors within Los Angeles will be able to be a healthy,
  active members within the community.
