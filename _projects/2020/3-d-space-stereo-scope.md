title: '3-D SPACE: STEREO/SCOPE'
project_summary: >-
  STEREO/SCOPE: Looking Forward By Looking Back utilizes the latest virtual
  reality technology to create a simulacrum of a Victorian era stereoviewer, in
  which participants will experience life in the 19th century through historical
  immersive 3-D still photography, digitized and enhanced for the digital age.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CREATE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >
  This project will digitize the over 3,000 analog stereogram cards currently in
  the collection of 3-D SPACE, and integrate them into a VR environment and
  public installation that will serve as a destination where participants will
  explore and view the stereo images just as they were intended when they were
  produced over a century ago.


  While Virtual Reality and holographic display are relatively new innovations,
  the state-of-the-art is greatly informed by the many forms of immersive media
  that have come before.


  VR has its roots in the stereoscope of the 19th century. By juxtaposing
  popular analog stereo photos of the 1800s with digital VR technologies, this
  project will demonstrate that motivations for immersive experiences today are
  the same as in the past, and that VR techniques culturally achieve the exact
  same goals. This will provide a means of immersive exposure to our history,
  that the public would not otherwise have the opportunity to experience.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: "Thanks to recent advances in digital technologies, there has been a renewed enthusiasm for all things 3-D, from 3-D movies to virtual reality.\n\_\nBut most people aren't aware that stereoscopic imaging has a very rich history that dates back to the 19th century. Our center celebrates the work of many talented artists, photographers and filmmakers who have used the medium of 3-D as their creative tool, and educates the public on the art and science of stereography.\n\nBy combining the latest state-of-the-art VR technology with the immersive media that was state-of-the-art 150 years ago we will give participants a transportive experience within a transportive experience, and will demonstrate how the analog of the past directly informs the digital of the future.\n\n3-D SPACE, The Center For Stereoscopic Photography, Art, Cinema, and Education is uniquely suited for this project as we are the only museum in the US dedicated specifically to the past, present, and future of 3-D imagery."
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >+
  During the project’s working phase, the public will be invited to beta test
  the VR apps at preview events. Upon completion, a room-scale VR installation
  will serve as a destination for public participation and the cellphone based
  version will be available so that distant participants can also engage to
  explore the environment and collection. Larger groups will be able to view
  glasses-free holographic versions of the Victorian imagery on lightfield
  displays installed at locations throughout Los Angeles. Immersive interactive
  mages will be shared on social media using 3-D image formats.


  Our work will be directly evaluated by the public who engage with the
  installations. The people who attend our exhibitions will be given the
  opportunity to provide feedback that will be used to shape future programs.The
  project media will be exhibited in various public venues including art
  galleries, film festivals, and online, where the Los Angeles community at
  large will be able to see, experience, and comment. Our internal evaluation
  will be based on measuring levels of continuing engagement with the public,
  growth of audience size, attendance numbers at our events, and public demand
  for increased activities. 

Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '50'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '1000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Our hope is that the VR applications and content developed through this
  project will be of interest to other museums, archives, and libraries in Los
  Angeles. The finished VR applications can be made available to organizations
  and individuals who would like to utilize them to make their own collections
  available, and will invite future collaborations with the 3-D SPACE. The
  project will provide a roadmap to making new assets available in the same
  manner, and potentially spawn a publicly accessible network of digital
  stereoscopic images that can be shared among institutions and with the public
  at large.
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  There is no specific collaborative partner for this project. 3-D SPACE is the
  singular applicant for this grant. Funds will not be disbursed to any
  partners.


  In the past, 3-D SPACE has collaborated creatively with organizations
  throughout the Los Angeles arts and education sectors, including the Los
  Angeles Central Library, Columbia Memorial Space Center, LA Filmforum, the
  Velaslavasay Panorama, the Echo Park Film Center, Captured Aural Phantasy
  Theater, Monsterpalooza, Heritage Square Museum, the Academy of Motion Picture
  Arts and Sciences, and the LA 3-D Club, as well as other arts and science
  organizations, museums, galleries, libraries, and schools. When funded, this
  project will offer multiple collaborative opportunities with these and others.
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Access to the LA2050 community
  - Host public events or gatherings
  - Communications support
  - Strategy assistance and implementation
