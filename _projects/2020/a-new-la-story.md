title: A New LA Story
project_summary: >-
  In a divided country and a diverse and fragmented city, how can young adults
  deepen connections among marginalized and silo’d communities to create a new
  LA Story? In this project, young leaders facilitate story circles in
  collaboration with the Museum of Social Justice. Story circles connect the
  lived experience of artists, elders, and museum visitors to upcoming exhibits
  that explore human trafficking in Los Angeles; comfort women in the Korean
  War, and Salvadoran needlework that chronicles the war in Central America.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Applying a proven model or solution to a new issue or sector (e.g, using a job
  recruiting software or strategy to match clients to supportive housing sites,
  applying demonstrated strategies from advocating for college affordability to
  advocating for housing affordability and homelessness, etc.)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  LA needs a new story! Especially during, and after, Covid-19, LA needs stories
  that bring people together to heal. The young people who will facilitate story
  circles at the museum are part of that new LA story. They are first generation
  college students from very low-income families. They are from mixed status
  families with roots in El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Korea, China, and
  Ghana. They are curious, caring, dedicated to lifting up their neighborhoods
  and communities, and interested in weaving a new LA  story. They are experts
  at inclusion, invitation, and welcome. 

  Among Kid City members, there is a longing for a greater sense of connection
  to a larger community, and in particular, to social justice movements of the
  past, present, and future. The Museum’s emphasis on social justice addresses
  the desire of a younger generation to know its history. The story circles are
  a beautiful vessel to connect resident artists and curators to a new audience,
  and to deepen visitor experience.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Kid City and the Museum of Social Justice are long-time partners and fiscal
  sponsees of the Urban Foundation. We seek to amplify our impact by combining
  our greatest resources -- Kid City’s young adults, and the Museum’s artists
  and exhibits. This year, a group of approximately 20 Kid City alumni received
  training from the Center for Council in facilitating small groups (often
  called councils, listening circles, or story circles). They are interested in
  using the process to share stories and build a deeper sense of community among
  young people and others from marginalized communities. The Museum of Social
  Justice provides context and history for particular movements and times in
  social justice history upon which to center the story circles. Story circles
  facilitated by Kid City alumni would bring another real-life dimension to the
  Museum’s exhibits by hearing related stories from artists and people of
  diverse ages, races, ethnic backgrounds, and experience.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  Our goal is to connect people from marginalized communities and diverse
  backgrounds to create a new LA Story. In the short term, story circles will
  bring a new audience to the museum. There, they may hear a story different,
  but parallel or similar to their own. Story circles are an intimate form of
  public art, which rests with the participants themselves. The point is not for
  us to broadcast anyone else’s story, but to encourage people to own their
  stories, their voices, and to see themselves in a larger LA Story.

  We hope to facilitate 30 story circles -- at least ten at each of three
  exhibits, with an average of 15 participants. All three exhibits connect to
  Los Angeles’ immigrant community. And not just in an obvious way. For example,
  human trafficking in El Monte involved Thai workers, but immigrants from many
  places have also been trafficked. When people see their commonality, and have
  an opportunity to share their stories with others, they feel they are a part
  of a community, become more engaged with their neighbors, and more integrated
  into the life of the city.  At the close of each exhibit, participants will
  have an opportunity to share their story to a larger audience, if they wish.

  When closing a story circle, we have a “witness” round, where participants say
  a word or two that they heard. It is a simple sentence, that starts with “I
  heard someone say ….” These will be collected by facilitators, and analyzed to
  look for themes of integration and a sense of belonging.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '450'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '5000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Program staff and facilitators also have stories of challenge. Like the story
  circle participants, they are from humble roots, low-income, and mixed status
  families from a wide diversity of immigrant backgrounds. Now they are leaders
  in education, social work, and public policy, with the knowledge and heart to
  bring to the process. This experience will inform their leadership for
  decades. As a result, it is hard to measure the project’s full impact, but the
  goal is to create a new LA story, and a new LA city -- one that is kind and
  soulful, with these young people at the helm. 

  The Museum of Social Justice is located on the plaza Olvera, and has 40-50K
  visitors annually. Most visitors are Latinx families and school groups. 
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  As the fiscal sponsor of both Kid City and the Museum of Social Justice, the
  Urban Foundation handles most administrative duties. Kid City will recruit,
  train, and supervise communications personnel, story circle facilitators, and
  other event coordination. Christy Illescas (F&M 2019) serves as Kid City
  program coordinator. The Museum's Assistant Curator, Domenica Castillo (UCLA
  2015) will serve as the liaison with artists, curators, and the museum's
  exhibitions, as well as provide some administrative support for exhibits,
  janitorial for before and after story circle events. Both Christy and Domenica
  are also first-generation college graduates, and representative of similar
  communities as facilitators and program participants.
