title: WriteGirl Connected
project_summary: >-
  In March 2020, WriteGirl moved quickly towards shifting all in-person creative
  writing workshops, one-to-one mentoring and college entrance guidance to a
  digital platform in response to COVID-19. WriteGirl Connected would be a
  digital suite of interactive programming that will engage hundreds of
  home-bound Los Angeles youth and keep them on track to graduate from high
  school and enroll in college. Funding will support the development of a robust
  suite of digital programming so that teens can create, learn and connect from
  anywhere.

In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  In the wake of upheaval caused by COVID-19, we have reached out to more than
  700 WriteGirl teens and program alumnae to connect with our members and learn
  how we can help. We have learned first-hand that the girls we serve are in
  need of a sense of community and connection now more than ever. Many feel
  isolated, stressed and uncertain. 


  Consistent class schedules and extracurricular activities have been disrupted
  and life milestones, such as high graduation ceremonies, have been cancelled.
  Many of our high school students are participating in online classes, but are
  unable to see their teachers’ faces as they carry out their daily assignments
  without personal interactions. Building upon WriteGirl’s 20 years of success
  inspiring girls to academic and creative success, WriteGirl Connected will
  give hundreds of Los Angeles teen girls an engaging, interactive and positive
  online space to learn, create and be inspired. WriteGirl Connected will allow
  us to reach more girls than ever.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Since 2001, WriteGirl has provided a consistent and supportive community of
  accomplished women writers who have guided 100% of the seniors in our Core
  Mentoring Program to enroll in college. We want to continue to send all of our
  girls to college and this transition to a digital learning environment will
  allow us to achieve that goal for the girls we serve, and many others in
  need. 


  We would like to reinvent WriteGirl in digital form to continue to present
  interactive creative writing workshops led by professional women writers,
  one-to-one mentoring, publishing opportunities through a new and expanded
  WriteGirl blog, and an expanded alumnae network.


  We have decades of expertise in creating a unique learning environment through
  a robust curriculum that we call “literacy in disguise.” WriteGirl’s unique
  community of dedicated and trained mentors provides individual guidance to
  inspire even the most reticent learners. Taking this program online is a
  natural next step for WriteGirl.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  We are committed to providing quality content that embodies WriteGirl’s high
  standards in presenting the uplifting and engaging educational programming
  that is the hallmark of our organization. We are confident that WriteGirl
  Connected will maintain these standards, allowing us to do more for greater
  numbers of youth.


  We will measure success through the number of girls participating in online
  workshops, the level of their engagement, the number of submissions to our
  blog and publications, the increasing number of matched one-on-one
  mentee-mentor pairs, and of course their success in graduating from high
  school and enrolling in college.


  We will conduct surveys and periodic focus groups with our mentees to make
  sure we’re giving them what they want and need. We will also conduct regular
  "mentoring roundtables" enabling members to share feedback and strategies
  about their mentoring experiences.


  As we reinvent this full slate of online programs, we are excited to see how
  we will be able to give girls the support they need now to develop the
  confidence and creative skills they need to thrive in high school and beyond
  into creative careers.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '1000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '12000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  WriteGirl has guided more than 1,000 underserved girls to graduate from high
  school and enroll in college, many with scholarships and as the first in their
  families to go to college. Our alumnae mentees are pursuing ambitious academic
  and professional goals, using the power of their voice, their confidence and
  their enhanced skills as writers to advocate for human rights, environmental
  protection and marginalized communities. WriteGirl Connected would
  exponentially expand our ability to reach and transform the lives of the
  city’s most vulnerable youth. WriteGirl’s safe and supportive atmosphere
  empowers teens to use their voices to create positive change in their
  families, neighborhoods and the broader community of Los Angeles.
