  Red Hen Press is dedicated to bringing fresh stories to the world by

  continuously bring relevant literary jobs and internships to Greater Los
  Angeles. Our award series and free to low-cost events will spotlight emerging
  authors either in print or on a stage. We will also expand our work providing

What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  After 26 years, has become a vanguard in establishing the West Coast and
  Southern California as a nexus of literary arts and publishing excellence. We
  provide a home for authors and poets from the Los Angeles area and throughout
  America and the world who would otherwise not have found a place for their
  voices that is local to them. Los Angeles is known for its thriving film
  industry, and through our events and internship programs, Red Hen also
  provides hands-on experience in the flourishing publishing industry to
  communities that would otherwise be unable to travel to major publishing
  locales. As the biggest independent publisher in Southern California, we also
  introduce underserved Los Angeles youth to the literary arts through our
  Writing in the Schools program, providing no-cost poetry workshops with
  established, lauded local poets to foster youth literacy and engagement with
  the arts.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  We founded our organization on the idea that literature needs three things to
  exist: a diverse range of voices telling stories in fresh ways, an engaged
  reading and writing community, and quality literacy in our schools. Without
  even one of these, we believe literature would only exist for a select few, so
  we have equipped ourselves to best provide these items to Greater Los Angeles.
  Our catalog features an increasing array of writers and stories: 2021 will see
  us team with 20 emerging authors new to Red Hen. We regularly host events with
  our authors in our in-house event space—the Hen House Literary Center—and work
  with local establishments like Vroman’s, Skylight Books, Book Soup, and the
  Annenberg. During the COVID-19 crisis, we partnered with the Broad Stage for
  “The Broad Stage at Home, Red Hen Poetry Hour,” which reconnected writers and
  readers in isolation through weekly poetry. Our authors raise new creative
  generations by bringing creative writing workshops to local schools.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Red Hen Press will measure the success of our project by tracking physical and
  online sales, the amount of media coverage our books and authors receive, and
  attendance at our reading events. Our goal is to raise the profile of the
  press and our authors to draw attention to the literary culture of Los
  Angeles. A successful project will see us meet our sales goals, raise our
  social media following by 10%, and host 30+ events at capacity.


  To evaluate the Writing in the Schools program and measure its success, Red
  Hen Press utilizes participant evaluation forms and staff notes. These
  evaluations coincide with many of the same standards covered in the Common
  Core State Standards for California Public Schools and are completed by
  participating students, teachers, and authors. Student evaluations are
  administered both at the beginning and at the end of the program to directly
  track improvement in controlled criteria. By reviewing these sources of
  information, we are able to assess students’ improvement in word analysis,
  vocabulary development, general rhetorical skills, and overall academic
  confidence, and to develop curricula that meet the specific needs of current
  student demographics.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '35000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: ''
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Red Hen’s work represents an effort, on our part, to establish Los Angeles as
  a literary hub and to see the publishing industry, as a whole, recognize West
  Coast authors. Our proposed programming will see the Southern California
  literary scene become a more prominent part of our cultural landscape and pave
  the way for more authors and independent presses. 


  We anticipate our Writing in the Schools program will serve 300 students in
  the 2020–2021 school year. Based on previous years with our partner schools,
  we expect to serve the following demographics: 85% Latinx/Hispanic, 11%
  African-American, 2% Asian-American, <1 % White, <1 % Native American, and <1%
  Middle Eastern.
