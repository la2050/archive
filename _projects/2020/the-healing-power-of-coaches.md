title: The Healing Power of Coaches
project_summary: >-
  LA2050 will make possible “The Healing Power of Coaches”, a citywide effort to
  support and train coaches who will inspire the health and wellbeing of Los
  Angeles youth through PLAY. Our two-pronged approach will involve leveraging
  LA2050 support to increase the number of coaches working with youth in LA’s
  most underserved communities and to provide training citywide to all youth
  sports coaches who want to use play to impact the physical, social-emotional
  and academic health of young people.

What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  When the impact of the coronavirus is over, LA youth will need to PLAY as soon
  as possible.  Sports will have a major role  in their healing process. Up2Us
  Sports would like to address this immense need for healing among LA youth by
  providing our nationally recognized “trauma-informed” coach training to
  schools, parks and nonprofits in every neighborhood in the city.  Our training
  will help coaches to intentionally use the combination of physical activity,
  positive peer-support, adult mentoring and life skills development in sports
  to directly address post-traumatic stress and other social emotional issues
  youth will face as a result of self-isolation.  What’s more, Up2Us Sports will
  also identify communities that are lacking coaches and leverage our federal
  AmeriCorps grant to recruit coaches for these communities. In the long term,
  we hope to address the larger need for leveling the playing field for
  opportunities for all youth to play regardless of their socio-economic
  status.  
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Since 2013, Up2Us Sports has been supporting young adults to be coach-mentors
  in LA’s most underserved neighborhoods. To date, we have recruited more than
  350 coaches who have served 37,500 youth. Up2Us Sports has also created
  partnerships with more than 80 programs across LA to help our coaches launch
  and/or expand sports activities in their neighborhoods. We have managed
  federal and state grants, including the DOJ and California Volunteers. We have
  created comprehensive systems to ensure that our coaches are background
  checked and that every coach receives 32 hours of training on sports-based
  youth development.  In 2015, Up2Us Sports hired its first team of LA-based
  trainers who have delivered more than 40 trainings to 5200 coaches. Our
  training has received city-wide attention from the Mayor’s Office, the parks
  department, schools, and nonprofits.  Up2Us Sports has also undergone two
  extensive evaluations that measured its effectiveness in supporting youth
  development outcomes.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >+
  Up2Us Sports will define success through the following: 1) the number of
  coaches we train and support; 2) the impact of the training on changing
  coaching practices to encourage more youth participation and to foster
  social-emotional skills building; and 3) the impact of coaches directly placed
  by Up2Us Sports on youth engagement and mental health outcomes. As stated
  above, we anticipate a two-pronged approach for promoting PLAY that involves
  training existing coaches and recruiting additional coaches where needed. In
  both cases, measurement of success will involve key metrics around coach
  self-efficacy and youth outcomes. Using surveys, site observations and online
  tools, Up2Us Sports will determine whether coaches have increased competency
  for 1) addressing fitness and mental health issues facing their youth and 2)
  designing coaching practices that engage all of their players in physical
  activity and positive youth development. Up2Us Sports will visit key programs
  to observe coaches and offer direct support. Up2Us Sports anticipates that 90%
  or more of coaches will feel more confident and better equipped to help LA
  youth heal after attending coach training. In cases in which Up2Us Sports
  directly places subsidized coaches in LA neighborhoods, we will measure their
  success by conducting PACER Tests and pre-and post surveys on youth to
  evaluate direct improvements in both physical activity and non-cognitive skill
  building, such as resiliency and pro-social attachment.  



Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '10100'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '50000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >
  Our broader impact is to train at least 10000 coaches throughout LA and to
  place 100 trained and subsidized  coaches in communities that lack sufficient
  sports opportunities for youth. Collectively, we seek to inspire more than
  50,000 youth.  With LA2050, these goals are achievable because Up2Us Sports
  will have the resources to establish a citywide strategy for coach training
  and placement.  We believe this is critical not just because of the need for
  mentors post-Covid-19 but also because LA is the Olympic host in 2028. 
  Ensuring that our city’s coaches are capable of helping our youth achieve
  their potential will be a hallmark for this city’s preparedness in
  demonstrating the best of sports on a global stage.
