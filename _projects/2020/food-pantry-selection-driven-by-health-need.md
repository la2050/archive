title: Food Pantry Selection Driven by Health Need
project_summary: >-
  Many Food Pantries in Los Angeles are well supplied due to outstanding
  Regional Food Banks and generous restaurants.  How well matched is the food to
  the true nutritional needs of food pantry clients?  By searching medical
  records, emergency room visits, and doing blood tests, our goal is to identify
  true nutritional deficiencies and work to meet that specific need.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  We know that socio-economic challenges have health impact.  Many urban
  communities have high rates of diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease. 
  Can these and other health problem be connected to chronic deficiencies in
  vitamins, minerals, and micronutrients.  New research continues to improve the
  importance of micronutrients in overall health.  A British medical study found
  trends of vitamin B1 and vitamin C deficiencies in homeless persons with
  problematic drinking.  Can we better identify nutritional deficiencies in a
  South Los Angeles Community and address them during Food Pantry
  distributions?   
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >
  My Friends House has never settled with just giving out food.  Our mission is
  not just Food but “Wellness.”  We know that just providing clients with food
  calories is not enough; the food must be healthy.  We strive every week to
  provide a range of fresh and healthy food items.   We know that even if the
  client leaves the Food Pantry with fresh vegetables, fish, and lean meats, if
  they cook at home by frying and using a lot of salt and butter, it will limit
  the impact on overall wellness.  We also teach healthy cooking classes.  

  My Friends House has been helping the community since 1995.  We are
  well-established, well-known, and trusted.  One potential problem is
  resistance to medical testing that may existing with Blacks and with the
  un-housed.  We expect the trust we have with our clients will help overcome
  this.  
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  We expect to find measurable nutritional deficiencies in our food pantry
  clients and in the Crenshaw/Slauson Community.  We will share our results at
  Food Bank Conferences, with public health officials, with medical
  professional, and with academic researchers.  We hope that it may make slight
  changes in the foods which are emphasized by the Food Bank and local Food
  Pantries.  It may trigger a push for supplemental vitamins and enriched food. 
  We realize that 12 months is a short time to see community nutritional
  changes.  But if data from the end of the 12 months is compared to beginning
  of the twelve months, we hope to see improvements.  
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '2000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '200000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Policy Decisions are becoming more data driven.  Medical treatments are
  becoming highly targeted; breast cancer treatments vary based on the specific
  of the tumors.  Can Food Pantry offerings become better targeted to the
  clientele they serve?  Our clients have a wide, multi-category demographic
  profile.   We serve demographics that include seniors, families with young
  children, un-housed, college students, unemployed, substance abuse, high blood
  pressure, cardiac disease, diabetes, and asthma.  As nutrition become more
  actively managed for the general population, why can the marginalized
  populations which visit food pantries benefit from food choices matched to
  their medically determined needs.   
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  Even though we are not initiating this project as a formal collaboration, we
  may be working with several partners.  Dignity Health - California Hospital
  Medical Center has provided us with nurses for our screening clinics.  We are
  expanding out collaboration with WellCare Health Plans.  Los Angele County
  Department of Public Health will be a potential partner.   Public Health
  Programs at USC and UCLA will also be potential partners.
