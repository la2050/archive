title: College Moms Project
project_summary: >-
  We have spent almost four years investigating the reasons why only 1.5% of
  teen mothers graduate from college. We've built partnerships with L.A.-based
  maternity homes, social service agencies, public schools, charter schools,
  colleges, universities, childcare agencies and women's mentorship teams within
  leading companies -- all without seeking outside funding.  Our objective for
  the coming year is to fully implement the programs we've developed and expand
  our capacity to reach hundreds of teen moms.

What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  The College Moms Project was created when a student in the Educational Talent
  Search program at USC became pregnant and dropped out of school. We spent more
  than a year formally studying the challenges that young mothers hoping to
  finish high school and enroll in college face. We visited schools for teen
  moms, social service agencies that serve young parents and college and
  university campuses across the state, speaking with academic deans, inspecting
  campus child care facilities and cataloging the services that each school
  provides. 


  It became apparent that young mothers fail to attend college because the
  resource hunt is overwhelming. The required goods and services actually exist
  and, to our surprise, virtually all young mothers in our program can attend
  college for free. But learning the system at any one campus is an overwhelming
  challenge for teens. By working with many agencies, we created a single-source
  solution that provides everything from tuition payments to child care. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  It's time for us to dramatically expand the program we've researched and
  developed over the last three years. We believe we're the only nonprofit in
  the country dedicated exclusively to putting teen mothers into college and
  ensuring that they have the resources required to graduate. While there are
  support services of varying quality for parents on most college campuses, we
  have found no other nonprofits that work across campuses, and certainly none
  that start with pregnant and parenting high school students. 


  Other nonprofits do a terrific job of  providing resources such as diapers and
  food and medical care, but we appear to the only organization that focuses
  exclusively on education -- and specifically higher education. 


  Fortunately, most of us have many years of experience putting
  first-generation, inner-city students into college. We've now built on that
  expertise an understanding of the unique needs of young mothers who hope to
  complete their education.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  Our current project involves expanding operations to serve many more teen
  mothers, and our success will continue to be measured by the number of
  pregnant and parenting students we engage in our mentorship networks.


  Because we grew out of the MBA schools at USC and UCLA, our mentors tend to be
  female MBA students at those two universities and executive women at leading
  companies in Los Angeles. The project for which we seek support involves
  formalizing the mentorship networks we've run informally for the last two
  years -- specifically, using the funds to engage hundreds of young mothers
  throughout Los Angeles County.


  Our objective is always to engage pregnant and parenting teens, two-thirds of
  whom drop out of high school. Our mentors bring them back into school and,
  together with our staff, educate the young moms about certificate programs in
  community colleges, degree pathways and professional careers. The mentors
  serve as role models and sources of encouragement, while the staff members
  function as technical experts who do academic advising and secure resources
  such as financial aid and childcare services. 


  Our success is easy to measure because virtually none of the teens we work
  with would pursue higher education on their own. We help the students complete
  high school, enroll in community college, receive the support services they
  need, and complete their certificate programs or college degrees.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '400'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '1000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >+
  We know from studies conducted by reputable organizations (principally, the
  Institute for Women's Policy Research), that educating young mothers lifts
  generations of family members out of poverty. Every impoverished single mother
  who attends college elevates not only herself, but also her children from a
  life of public dependency to one of self-sufficiency. 


  Many of our teens are in the foster system or are wards of the court. Even
  before becoming pregnant, they struggled to imagine the kind of careers that
  many of us take for granted. Once they enter our cohorts, however, we guide
  them toward education pathways that allow them to become independent adults
  and to raise their children in a dignified manner.

'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  Our partner organizations can be divided into three categories:


  1. Sources of Teen Moms: These include high schools and social service
  agencies. We visit these campuses throughout L.A. County and work directly
  with the teachers and students.


  2. Colleges and Universities: We work with dozens of campuses to secure
  enrollment and support services. Most of our teens will enroll initially in
  community colleges, where they will be supported by the campus C.A.R.E.
  office.


  3. Nonprofits: In addition to our mentors, we work with other nonprofits that
  support our young moms. These include agencies such as Pathways L.A., which
  helps us secure off-campus childcare services when on-campus facilities are
  full.
