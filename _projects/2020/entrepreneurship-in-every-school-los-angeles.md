  NFTE currently serves over 2,108 LAUSD students per year. NFTE has the
  opportunity to deepen our current partnership with the LAUSD by integrating
  NFTE’s entrepreneurship curriculum with all high school economic classes
  across all regions, with the potential to reach 30,000+ students and work with
  over 200 teachers over the next 3 years.


  Grant would support phase 1 to expand into 12 economics high school teachers

What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Entrepreneurship changes the way young people see their futures. NFTE aims to
  provide underserved, at-risk youth with new opportunities that give them
  skills, confidence, and know-how to take and maintain control over their
  lives. The NFTE program shows students how they can recognize opportunities,
  develop their talents, discover their potential, and chart their own course.
  And when that happens, they succeed personally, educationally, and
  professionally and communities are stronger. Through the lens of
  entrepreneurship, NFTE brings relevancy to core academic subjects alongside
  traditional business development skills, showing students how to use their
  knowledge, maximize their potential, and become leaders and innovators. NFTE
  students respond well to this approach, performing better in school, enrolling
  in higher education, and outpacing national averages in employment and
  self-employment.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Since 2007, NFTE LA has reached over 20,000 youth in Los Angeles. NFTE
  partners with schools in under-resourced neighborhoods and community-based
  organizations with like-minded missions to integrate our uniquely suited small
  business, entrepreneurship and workforce development curriculum into their
  educational offerings as a regular course of study.  Our curriculum is
  G-approved through the University of California Office of the President A-G
  list, and our signature experiential learning methodology is taught in the
  classroom by NFTE-certified teachers. Essential to the experience is our
  in-depth educator training, certification and ongoing professional
  development.
