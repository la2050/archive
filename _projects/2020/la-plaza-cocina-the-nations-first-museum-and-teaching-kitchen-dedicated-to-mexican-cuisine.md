    benefit)

What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  LA Plaza Cocina is a first-of-its-kind museum dedicated to the artistry,
  history and contemporary interpretations of the regional cuisines of Mexico. 
  Food is one of the most treasured aspects of Mexican culture and serves as one
  of the country’s most important gifts to the world.  Nowhere else in the world
  other than Mexico itself is the tradition of Mexican cooking so widely
  practiced and cherished than in Los Angeles.  From individual households to
  catering trucks, to the growing number of Mexican restaurants, and local food
  festivals, LA is the undisputed Mexican food capital of the USA. 

  LA Plaza Cocina is intended to serve as a unique space where the many cuisines
  of Mexico can be studied, shared, and savored. It will serve as a gathering
  place where trained chefs, family cooks and all those interested in learning
  more and sharing their passion for Mexican cooking can meet to create,
  explore, learn, shop and savor.  
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Latino roots are embedded in the fabric of Los Angeles. They are essential to
  understanding the city’s culture. Yet, even with a significant Latino
  population (48% of L.A. County), there was previously no museum to trace
  Latino history and achievements in Southern California until the opening of LA
  Plaza in 2011. 


  LA Plaza remains the only institution in the region that combines and honors
  Latino history, art, and culture. Our mission has resonated with the community
  and we have turned that original inspiration into impact. In 2019, LA Plaza
  welcomed more than 100,000 visitors and served 9,000 students through our free
  garden and culinary educational workshops. We’ve increased programs from 15 in
  2011 to 85 last year. We are an admission-free museum providing quality
  events, elevating and celebrating L.A.’s rich Latino culture and heritage. LA
  Plaza is a trusted community brand, known for making the arts accessible to
  all while promoting cultural diversity and inclusivity.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: "Opening LA Plaza Cocina has been a priority for LA Plaza since its inception. We have worked toward this for nearly a decade and are finally in a position to bring this project to fruition. The location, plans, and designs are in place, and the corresponding programming has a successful track record with a strong following.  \n\nLA Plaza Cocina’s goals are to:\n\n-\tComplete construction and open to the public in Q1 2021.\n-\tCreate a unique, multi-disciplinary site where professionals and the general public alike \n can explore the rich culinary treasures of Mexico\n-\tInstill a greater understanding of the beneficial aspects of indigenous foods  \n-\tEmpower women and minority-owned businesses engaged in Mexican cooking\n-\tCreate a space for personal, familial and cultural exploration. \n-\tIncrease interconnectedness among different populations and cultures. \n-\tInspire and educate individuals about the history, and influence of Mexican cuisine in Los Angeles, reaching a minimum of 40,000 people annually\n-\tIncrease families’ awareness of nutrition, culinary preparation, and the culture and history of food migration\n\nWe will measure the degree to which we achieve these goals, and therefore program success, through an increase in attendance and online engagement, demand for more culinary arts classes, and feedback from the community, both organically and through participant and visitor surveys. LA Plaza Cocina will be open to the public six days a week. \n"

Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >
  LA Plaza promotes awareness, empowers individuals, builds pathways for diverse

  which they live.


  Located in the El Pueblo historic district, LA Plaza and partner organizations
  have breathed new economic and cultural life into the neighborhood, turning
  dilapidated buildings into the museum’s home, transforming an empty lot into
  an open-air meeting space with a stage, teaching garden, and historic walkway
  for public art. There are several historical landmarks nearby, LA Plaza brings
  these sites and the city’s rich history to life with coherence and
  authenticity. Most visitors are low to middle-income families from East, South
  East L.A. and the San Fernando Valley.
