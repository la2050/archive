Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  LA has the second largest urban “American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN)”
  population in the country. According to the CDC (2018), AIAN were more likely
  to experience serious psychological distress compared to non-White Hispanic,
  9.2% and 3.7% respectively. Youth and adult suicide rates are also the highest
  among AIAN compared to any other racial group. This project responds to the
  urgent need for Indigenous-specific social and emotional support. Studies show
  art increases relaxation, helps with developing positive identity and allows
  individuals to symbolically express experiences that are difficult to put into
  words by interweaving traditional, ancestral teachings with contemporary
  experiences. Art rooted in cultural connectedness also helps promote a sense
  of belonging and validation that all Angelenos should experience by 2050.
  Further, cultural connectedness serves as a protective factor in strengthening
  resilience and intergenerational health. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  The So’oh-Shinálí Sister Project is the Indigenous Circle of Wellness’ (ICOW)
  community-based extension project led by three Indigenous womxn that have
  worked in the community over a decade: Monique Castro (Diné/Xicana, LMFT),
  Elena Nourrie (Hopi/Cherokee/Chicanx, M.Ed.), and Melissa Alcala (Diné/Xicana,
  M.A.). All three womxn were raised on Tongva land, the LA area, as federal
  policies led their families to relocate to the city. They value education as a
  means to self-determination and giving back to the community. SSSP is
  dedicated to decolonizing education and wellness in the urban setting by
  staying rooted in indigenous core values and practices passed down by the
  matriarchs of their families. So’oh translates to grandmother in Hopi and
  Shinálí translates to grandmother in “Navajo.” In 2019, ICoW hosted five
  successful LA county sponsored mental wellness gatherings to engage, empower,
  and enlist the community into conversations about mental health and
  traditional forms of healing.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  Success will be defined as an increase of Indigenized spaces, where all
  community members feel welcome and immersed in an experience that allows them
  to foster relationships and build support. By July 2021, there will be a 40%
  increase among community members who receive social and emotional support.
  This will be measured through several methods including a community needs
  assessment, community event participation, observational assessment, and
  follow up comparisons of need assessments taken during initial focus groups to
  post-event surveys. Effective partnership with local Indigenous
  community-based organizations will be measured by the amount of attendees
  recruited by participants, the number of outreach materials shared and through
  followup accounts regarding qualitative feedback. SSSP will also work with an
  Indigenous consultant to assist with data management and analysis to
  continuously evaluate this project and strengthen future events as we strive
  to ensure Indigenous Arts events are a staple throughout Los Angeles county.


  A toolkit will also be developed for community-based organizations, grassroots
  groups, and other related entities to host Indigenous community-focused art
  events that will include: event planning guide, artist network directory,
  event social media strategy, and evaluation tools. SSSP envisions this as the
  start of Indigenous Arts events coupled around existing, ongoing and
  well-known community events.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '600'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '2400'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  The majority of Native American community based events and programs are only
  offered to those who identify with a U.S. federally recognized tribe. As a
  result, there is severe underrepresentation of people who identify as
  Indigenous with roots in central or south America. We plan to address the
  double erasure in our community and be inclusive of those who identify as
  American Indian/Alaska Native, Native American, Native Hawaiian and
  Central/South American by indigenizing physical spaces during county-wide
  cultural events. Our goal is to create a space that allows Angelenos to
  recognize all Indigenous people and the diversity that exists within and
  across our communities. This may inform policy to be more inclusive of all
  Indigenous people.
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  SSSP plans to continue collaboration with Indigenous community-based
  organizations including American Indian Community Council, Indigenous
  Collective, Pukuu Cultural Community Services, Tribal TANF and United American
  Indian Involvement. SSSP will also continue partnership with local colleges,
  artists and businesses. Partners will work collaboratively to bridge
  participants, increase visibility of Indigenous peoples’ and foster social and
  emotional support for community members across Los Angeles county. SSSP will
  work with partner organizations to lead focused outreach and recruitment for
  the events. Collaborators will confirm participants and coordinate
  transportation of attendees and logistical needs with SSSP. Collaborators will
  also assist with surveys and qualitative feedback.
