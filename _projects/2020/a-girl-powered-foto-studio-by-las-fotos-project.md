  Las Fotos Project is opening a youth-centered photography studio in the heart
  of Boyle Heights where teen girls can build up their professional skills and
  earn an income by providing culturally relevant services for the community.
  During the school day, the studio will be made available as an affordable
  option for local artists/creatives, and after-school and on weekends the

  photography services for women/POC-owned small businesses.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CREATE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - East LA
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Las Fotos Project was created for teenage girls to have the freedom to express
  themselves and explore their identity. When our students completed our
  creative programs, they asked ‘what next?’ We knew that simply pointing them
  toward careers in the creative economy would be setting them down an
  inequitable path of racial and gender roadblocks. Our students' question
  inspired a vision for a youth-centered photography studio where teen girls can
  begin to dismantle roadblocks by building their professional and economic
  capital. In the midst of COVID19, we are refining our vision to support
  recovery and healing by launching a model that supports students, offers
  affordable services to the community and partners with some of the 200,000
  women business owners in L.A. This mutual-aid effort will invite creatives to
  work in the studio through low-cost memberships, offer e-commerce product
  photography packages and provide opportunities for students to receive paid
  on-the-job training. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  We launched a small photography entrepreneurial training program for teen
  girls in 2017, providing our students opportunities to work as hired
  photographers with the support of professional photographer mentors. The
  program grew from 7 girls generating $24,700 in revenue during our first year
  to 15 girls generating $38,800 in revenue our second year; there are currently
  23 teen girls learning everything from event photography to post-production.
  We attribute the successful growth of the program to the guidance of our
  strong women of color leaders and mentors. Additionally, Las Fotos Project has
  always been a youth-centered photography nonprofit organization; there is a
  power-sharing between adults and youth—where youth are entrusted with the big
  issues and encouraged to drive our gender equity work with their feedback.
  This power-sharing gives youth a seat at the table, value, and respect, while
  still receiving support and guidance from adults through a generative learning
  process. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Through the youth-led photography studio, Las Fotos Project is applying its
  community-centered engagement approach to build a mutually-beneficial and
  sustainable site for youth, artists and small businesses to support one
  another and recover from the economic fallout caused by COVID19. We envision
  the Las Fotos Project’s youth-centered photography studio as both an incubator
  and accelerator, ensuring that more teenage girls have the skills and support
  to pursue lucrative creative careers while also providing local creatives and
  small business owners with accessible and culturally-responsive photography
  services. LFP defines success as working to reduce income inequality by
  removing barriers for emerging artists to access professional networks and
  launch entrepreneurial business models for the creative economy. We will
  identify women-owned businesses seeking to build their online presence to
  provide affordable e-commerce and marketing photography services, creating an
  economic support loop between women and girls. We are also currently
  developing service pricing models that will be accessible and affordable to
  the local community. The outcomes of our activities will be measured through
  pre/post-program assessments for students, pre/post-surveys for venue renters,
  and client satisfaction surveys. Our regular Youth Advisory Council meetings
  and LFP member meetings will also create an avenue for direct feedback on the
  effectiveness and accessibility of our business model.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '100'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '1200'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Las Fotos Project supports the agency of teenage girls from communities of
  color by creating an environment that both values and validates their lived
  experiences. They are mentored by and create images of people who look like
  them, living lives that may be similar to their own lived experiences. We've
  seen how this environment empowers girls to self-advocate and explore their
  own cultural, community and professional identities further. Our new studio
  will allow us to continue this work on a much greater level by creating a
  venue where girls from the community can launch into their creative careers by
  providing their families, neighbors and local small businesses with the
  relevant photography resources they need to rebound and flourish.

Has your proposal changed due to COVID-19?: >
  The Las Fotos Project team has remained vigilant of the new changes to state
  and city-wide mandates, as well as health developments emerging from the CDC.
  We will be amending our project time-line to reflect these emerging
  recommendations.  Our project remains focused on mutual-aid, post-COVID19
  support for our students, and women-owned businesses. In the interim, we will
  begin the launch of our project by supporting our students and women-owned
  businesses with safe, at-home product photography services in the upcoming
  months until we feel we can safely and adequately open the Foto Studio in
  person.
