title: CCMM-in-Schools Program
project_summary: >-
  The CCMM-in-SCHOOLS program brings a pop-up world cultures museum directly to
  students in their own schools, free of charge to participating public schools.
  In the 2020-2021 school year, CCMM aims to serve at least 32 school
  communities, as many as 50. Funds will be used for program-related costs,
  including installation and removal of the exhibition, educator-docents who
  lead students through an educational presentation, materials for hands-on
  learning, and community Open Houses, which will open the museum to
  participating schools’ communities.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CREATE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South LA
  - Westside
  - South Bay
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Boasting one of the most diverse populations in the country, Los Angeles has a
  critical need for cultural awareness and understanding. However, many students
  and their families remain isolated in their own cultural enclaves. These
  communities face unparalleled diversity without adequate exposure to and
  understanding of the beliefs and practices of “others”.


  CCMM was founded to bring the bigger world directly to LA schools. Imagine
  students visiting a museum in their own schools filled with hundreds of
  objects from more than 75 countries and dozens of cultures. During their
  visit, CCMM docents give students a constructive framework in which to explore
  the objects and their cultural importance and context.  One CCMM docent
  writes, “My work is a way to fight the idea that ‘different’ means ‘wrong.’”
  Next, imagine these students guiding their families through the museum at a
  festive Open House, open to the schools’ communities, celebrating their own
  and other cultures.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  CCMM has served LA-area middle schools since 1995, incorporating as a
  501(c)(3) non-profit organization in 2011. CCMM has served 150,000+ students
  in schools in five school districts and 6 out of 8 Los Angeles County’s
  Service Planning Areas.


  CCMM can easily expand the number of schools it visits, having already amassed
  a collection of 3,500+ objects from 75+ countries, curated to highlight
  similarities between disparate cultural identities. And, CCMM has established
  an active cadre of retired history teacher docents who, having participated
  with their own classes, guide students through the collections, drawing
  comparisons and contrasts between objects and cultures. 


  CCMM has held community Open Houses at some participating schools, with great
  success. Additional schools, including principals, teachers, and parent
  groups, are eager to involve their communities in events at their schools, and
  CCMM is committed to providing this enhancing experience at as many schools as
  possible.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  CCMM measures its outputs, tracking the number of schools it visits each year
  and the approximate number of students it serves. After their experience with
  CCMM, a portion of students complete questionnaires to assess the extent to
  which CCMM has enhanced their classroom learning and made them feel more
  understanding and respectful of cultural diversity, among other measures.


  Teacher evaluations ask for teachers to gauge CCMM's relevance to classroom
  learning and overall program effectiveness. Teachers are also asked to
  appraise, through their observations, the extent to which CCMM promotes
  understanding and acceptance of diversity. CCMM will be successful if all
  teachers’ evaluations are variations on this theme:
   
  “Any exposure to outside cultures is beneficial. I feel the students are more
  accepting the more they know. This program allows them to travel the world
  without leaving our main building. It is essential that you continue to do
  this and give students an opportunity to see things they may never have a
  chance to visit.”


  Extending Open Houses into more schools, if successful, would attract more
  students and their families, giving students an opportunity to act as docents
  and guides, showing what they learned and found important. CCMM would track
  attendance and conduct periodic interviews to gauge impact. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '50000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '10000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  CCMM’s docents ask at every presentation: "How many of your grandparents were
  born in a country outside of the U.S.?" Often most students – and teachers -
  raise their hands. This simple exercise, along with the docent’s presentation,
  prepares students to recognize and appreciate their own, and other, cultural
  traditions. Currently, over 25,000 students benefit from this program
  annually, as do their teachers and other school staff. Parents and students
  tell CCMM about stories students bring home after their participation with
  CCMM, objects and traditions they recognized from their own cultures or new
  things they learned about other peoples. Additional Open Houses will extend
  this impact directly to hundreds, if not thousands, of Angelenos.
