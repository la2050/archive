title: Pathways to Stability for Justice-involved Individuals
project_summary: >-
  Chrysalis is the leading organization in LA focused on helping formerly
  incarcerated individuals attain self-sufficiency through employment.  Each
  year, through supportive services and our social enterprise “Chrysalis
  Enterprises” (CE), we provide job readiness training and transitional jobs for
  over 3000 justice-involved people, offering them a second chance. LA2050 funds
  will support innovative technology upgrades that will make Chrysalis more
  efficient and effective in our efforts to help justice-involved clients find
  and retain employment.

  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Chrysalis serves the most vulnerable in our community—those with the most
  barriers to employment. People who have criminal histories and past
  incarceration face big challenges finding and retaining jobs due to a lack of
  education, vocational skills, and/or work history, as well as employers’
  reluctance to hire those who have been justice-involved. Also, the criminal
  justice system disproportionately impacts African Americans and other people
  of color, and thus, it is important to provide them with services and
  opportunities to thrive following incarceration. We offer job-readiness
  services, through social programs and paid, transitional jobs, that strengthen
  our clients’ employability and help them secure work. For clients with the
  most barriers to employment Chrysalis offers paid, transitional jobs with our
  in-house CE businesses to get them started on the road to permanent, outside
  jobs. Sixty percent (60%) of our clients are justice-involved and 47% have
  prior felony convictions.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >
  Chrysalis helps CREATE opportunities for formerly incarcerated people to
  reenter society, find work, and get on the path to self-sufficiency.  We are
  leaders in the reentry community for the work that we do to create jobs,
  connect people to employment, and assist formerly incarcerated people to
  increase their incomes. 


  Our clients participate in our job-readiness program, including classes, case
  management and supplemental supports.  Those with additional barriers can work
  in our CE transitional jobs program. Last year, we helped 910 justice-involved
  individuals find outside employment and employed 1265 in transitional jobs, so
  they can to rebuild their lives. 


  Chrysalis is an inclusive, data-driven, learning organization, committed to
  delivering highly effective programming.   As Chrysalis transitions our data
  processes to Salesforce, enhanced applications supported by LA2050 will
  increase our capacity to effectively create economic opportunities for the
  formerly incarcerated. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  Chrysalis has a robust evaluation system. Our dashboard tracks short- and
  long-term outcomes, and our strategic plan includes a broader vision of
  success over time. We are now transitioning data collection and reporting to
  Salesforce. LA2050 funding will support important technology enhancements
  across Salesforce and related apps, resulting in transformative impacts to
  program effectiveness and efficiency, and more jobs for our justice-involved
  clients. 


  The enhancements will include processes to auto-generate resumes, job-matching
  applications, resource tracking, and communication tools. Staff will save time
  on data and spend more time with clients, clients will see improved service
  delivery, and managers will have real-time tools they need. We have a strong
  data-driven culture, and through this critical investment, we will leverage
  that culture to produce improvements in our programs now and as we scale for
  future growth. 


  During the grant term, Chrysalis will provide workforce development services
  for 3120 justice-involved individuals. Of those, 1000 will find outside
  employment and 1370 will work a transitional job. We will also develop and
  implement a Salesforce database that will increase efficiency and
  effectiveness in our programs, driving a 10% increase in the number of
  justice-involved clients finding employment.


  To support LA2050’s dream metric, we will also track the employment rate among
  all of our formerly incarcerated clients throughout the grant term and
  beyond. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '3120'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '150000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Jobs help justice-involved people gain economic stability and reduce the
  likelihood that they return to prison, promoting greater public safety to the
  benefit of everyone. But people who have been to prison are often shut out of
  the labor market. Justice-involved people are some of the most vulnerable
  already. With the new economy emerging after the COVID-19 crisis, their
  struggles to find jobs will increase.  We need to be better equipped to serve
  them, and to elevate our program model to help them in what promises to be a
  more challenging environment. As they become successfully employed, we can
  help dispel the stigma against giving them a second chance and ensure that
  they can actively participate in our community’s economic recovery.
