What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Los Angeles faces a national leading and surging housing crisis, with dire
  consequences for a large segment of residents.  Critical resources are needed
  to address and support those facing housing insecurities, and remains a top
  priority for communities and stakeholders.  ONEgeneration recognizes a vital
  need to provide homeless prevention interventions for those most vulnerable,
  and expanded our social services in 2018 to include a Housing Navigator,
  offering on-site assistance in accessing affordable housing options. As the
  housing crisis grew, ONEgeneration in partnership with LA Family Housing
  established a coalition of aging providers to collaborate and serve those in
  need of affordable housing. Our Shared Housing project seeks to expand its
  efforts in addressing housing insecurity among San Fernando Valley residents
  through the development and implementation of intergenerational shared housing
  opportunities incorporating effective and meaningful approaches.

  in the San Fernando Valley for over 42 years.  We are uniquely focused and are
  a vanguard in building intergenerational communities, programs, care, and
  services, a more elegant model which bridges generational, gender, race, and
  socio-economic gaps.  Recognized as a Program of Distinction from Generations
  United and the sole active National Accreditation Council on Aging (NCOA)
  center in California, we lead with program excellence and high standards of
  service that help those most vulnerable, including essential affordable
  housing resources. With broad and deep expertise, ONEgeneration leverages
  critical collaborations when innovating and expanding comprehensive and
  progressive service models that address safety net needs. With the support of
  over 100 community partnerships, we succeed in meeting the high needs of the
  city.

  intergenerational shared housing model. Similar programs that have proven to
  be effective and are already widely adopted across the country and state.

  Los Angeles city. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '250'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '750'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  In the County of Los Angeles, over 50% of renters are cost-burdened, spending
  ½ of their income on housing alone. The ever stressful rising cost of housing
  and the lack of affordable units continue to exacerbate the number of
  individuals at the tipping point of homelessness. Shared Housing maximizes
  resources and reduces individuals facing housing insecurity, supporting the
  overall well-being of communities and all age groups including older adults. 
  Existing models have been effectively utilized by older adults, veterans, and
  young adults. Research strongly validates that shared housing improves living
  circumstances for those living in poverty through decreased rent burden,
  lessened isolation, and heightened sense of safety.
