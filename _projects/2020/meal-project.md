title: Meal Project
project_summary: >-
  The ability to afford food is a known barrier to low-income college students’
  persistence and degree completion. Santa Monica College is stepping up to help
  solve this Los Angeles-wide problem made worse by the COVID-19 crisis. Ninety
  percent of SMC’s 31,500 students live outside of Santa Monica boundaries and
  54% of SMC students have been identified as food insecure in a highly regarded
  2019 research report. SMC Foundation will extend our piloted Meal Project
  program to provide fresh and nutritious meals free to vulnerable students.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Westside
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Today’s college students are at risk of not completing degrees due to the
  pressure to choose between food and textbooks (or rent). The markers of food
  insecurity are evident in Santa Monica College students: 54% are unable to
  purchase enough groceries, and 21% revealed they have lost weight recently
  because they did not have enough money for food, according to the #RealCollege
  Report, based on an anonymous national survey conducted by Temple University
  researchers. It is also well-documented that degree completion rates are
  higher once students are no longer food insecure.  


  SMC Students:

  90% live outside of the Santa Monica area. 

  75% qualify for financial aid 

  73% are racially minoritized 

  52% are first-generation college students

Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  SMC Foundation is well-positioned to scale the Meal Project and create a
  roadmap for other organizations. Launched in 2017, the SMC Foundation piloted
  the Meal Project providing nutritious meals to our most critically needy
  students. In early 2020, the Foundation opened the Everytable Lounge, a unique
  partnership with social enterprise, where in lieu of charging rent, the
  company pays in meals. Between 500-800 meals per week are distributed to food
  insecure students. Shortly thereafter, COVID-19 caused thousands of students
  to lose jobs and all classes moved to a digital learning format. SMC
  Foundation responded immediately and pivoted to direct-to-student home
  delivery services. In 2019, 54% of SMC students were food insecure. During the
  2020-21 academic year, the Meal Project endeavors to serve students remotely
  who were previously identified as food insecure as well as students newly
  affected by the fallout of COVID-19 and its ongoing economic impact. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Food is a human right. As such, SMC Foundation envisions a future in which the
  possibility of food assistance will be in every prospective and new students’
  scope when they dare to dream about attending college. We want all students
  who think they can’t participate in college due to their struggles to keep a
  roof over their heads and food in their stomachs to know that food access is
  not going to be a stressor. Free tuition and textbooks are provided to
  students in need through SMC’s Promise Program (free tuition and textbooks for
  first-time freshmen for their first two years). 


  Success indicators: 

  Increase in student responsiveness to messaging about meal programs from
  staff. 

  Increase in the number of students screened for food insecurity.* 

  Increase in the number of at-risk students who enroll in the free meal
  program. 

  Increase in enrollment of low-income students at SMC. 

  Increase in degree completion and transfer rates among low-income students. 


  A template and roadmap shared with and replicable by other organizations and
  higher education institutions. SMC was asked to present its program at the
  California Higher Education Basic Needs Alliance conference in February 2020.


  * Due to resource limitations, students are currently identified through their
  participation in special programs such as Dreamers, Guardian Scholars (current
  and former foster youth), Veterans Resource Center, the Latino Center, Black
  Collegians, single parents, Center for Students with Disabilities, as such.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '3000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '16740'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  At the intersection of food security and higher education, the impact reaches
  far and wide – housing, employment, economic development, and health and
  wellbeing. Santa Monica College is investing heavily as an institution in the
  principals of #RealCollege, an emerging national movement that is redefining
  what it means to be a student-ready college, and driving changes based on the
  understanding that food and housing security are essential conditions of
  learning. SMC’s students are drawn from nearly 200 high schools in greater Los
  Angeles, with 90% residing across the Los Angeles County basin. As such, we
  see ourselves and the Meal Project as an incubator to create a roadmap
  benefiting other organizations and policy development.
