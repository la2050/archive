Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to PLAY
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >
  According to the CDC, over 23% of Californians 18+ years old are living with a
  physical disability. CDC researchers have found that 47% of those with
  disabilities get no aerobic physical activity. The significant number of
  individuals with disabilities who are inactive is particularly alarming,
  researchers said, because they found this group is 50% more likely to report
  having a chronic condition like cancer, diabetes, stroke, or heart disease.


  Adaptive sports are essential for differently-abled individuals’ overall
  health. Without such activity, individuals are at higher risk for physical and
  mental health problems, such as obesity, heart disease, and depression.
  Physical activity is especially important for special needs children as it can
  help boost self-confidence and self-worth. It can also improve skills in
  relationship building and working as part of a team.  These skills and tools
  help youth build the foundation for healthy, productive and successful lives
  as adults.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  ACS’ CEO’s, Clayton Frech’s, son, Ezra, was born with congenital limb
  differences.  Growing up, Ezra developed into a competitive athlete and is
  currently a U.S. Paralympics track and field athlete.  In addition, Ezra
  serves as a motivational speaker and ambassador for adaptive sports. Angel
  City Sports began in June 2013 when Clayton and Ezra Frech were on the track
  at the Endeavor Games wondering why there were not more adaptive programs in
  Southern California. In October 2014, the ACS Games found a facility and
  programming partner in UCLA Recreation. Today, ACS has leveraged the
  relationships and partnerships Clayton and Ezra have developed with
  organizations that serve the adaptive sports community and is leading a
  growing network of resources and opportunities to support this underserved
  population.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  The goal of ACS is to ensure physically disabled individuals of all ages and
  abilities have access to activities that support their physical, mental, and
  emotional health.


  The effectiveness, outcomes and impact of ACS’ programs are evaluated on a
  regular basis through post-activity surveys of various stakeholders, including
  athletes, volunteers, coaches, and other stakeholders. Information tracked
  includes quantitative and qualitative metrics that provide valuable insight as
  to how effectively the clinics are meeting the needs of physically disabled
  adult and youth athletes to enhance the organization’s current offerings as
  well as gain information about unmet needs to guide ACS’ expansion efforts.
  The primary quantitative metric will be how many adults and youth attended and
  will be tracked by signed participation waivers.


  Qualitatively, the key criteria for success is that adults and youth feel
  positive about the overall experience – that they feel accomplished,
  confident, and motivated to repeat that feeling again and again.  Having
  coaches and staff that create this positive experience, as well as serve as
  role models themselves as many are athletes with disabilities, is essential to
  building this success.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '3000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '18000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >
  In 2019, the Games drew 425 athletes and 600+ volunteers for a total of 4,200+
  total attendees. ACS anticipates these numbers will continue to grow for the
  June 2021 event. Typically, ACS adaptive sports clinics draw over 600 adult
  and youth participants throughout the year.  The addition of the VR activities
  is unprecedented for ACS and it is challenging to predict the numbers that
  will be served.


  Staying active is for disabled individuals is important under normal
  circumstances. During the COVID-19 shelter-in-place restrictions and mandates,
  remaining active is critical as it lifts mood; helps people sleep and manage
  stress better, manage weight, and; works to boost overall immunity.
