  LIFT’s Family Goal Fund: Moving Money into the Hands of Families who Need it
  Most
project_summary: >-
  LIFT’s Family Goal Fund is designed to help parents build a small buffer. Not
  just in times of crisis like COVID-19, but to withstand the daily stressors
  that come with living in poverty and accelerate their progress towards
  long-term goals. As parents persist through LIFT’s coaching program, they
  receive $150 every three months that they can spend in any way they see fit—
  be it making a rental payment, starting an emergency savings fund, or paying
  for a vocational licensing exam on their path to a higher paying job.

What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Los Angeles County holds nearly 10% of the country’s homelessness population
  and has a poverty rate of 21.5%, significantly higher than the U.S. average of
  13.4%. Families arrive at LIFT’s office in the Pico Union neighborhood (where
  one in three families live below the poverty line) with an average annual
  income of $18,000 and an employment rate of 32%, often just one financial
  emergency away from homelessness.


  According to a recent study, four out of 10 Americans would not be able to
  cover $400 in unexpected expenses without selling something or going into
  debt. Which means that Americans need access to financial slack now, in times
  of crisis like COVID-19, and on an ongoing basis.


  LIFT’s model helps parents achieve financial stability and well-being through
  personalized wraparound supports, including one-on-one financial and career
  coaching, workshops, and resources that will support them in increasing
  savings and income, decreasing debt, and securing family-sustaining
  employment.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >
  For more than 20 years LIFT has partnered with over 100,000 families on their
  paths out of poverty. We know from experience that parents are motivated,
  resilient, and thrive when they have access to the same things we all need to
  succeed—a financial cushion to weather emergencies, social networks that offer
  opportunities, and personal supports that give you the confidence to get
  through hard times.


  Recognizing that parents know what they need most to succeed but often don’t
  have the luxury of investing in themselves, LIFT began piloting cash transfer
  programs in 2015. After testing matched savings, restricted use, and
  reimbursement models, we formalized our Family Goal Fund in 2018. Combined
  with our coaching program, LIFT’s model offers a powerful tool in breaking the
  cycle of poverty. Of the 400 families we serve each year, 95% report
  improvements in economic security, 95% report improved personal well-being and
  99% of our members feel that they can turn to LIFT in a time of need.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  LIFT will measure success using the following metrics:

  -90% of committed members will persist or progress in employment, finances, or
  education; 

  -50% will persist or progress in employment; 

  -70% will persist or progress in finances (i.e. increase savings, decrease
  debt, increase credit score, save money each month, make minimum debt payments
  each month, complete a Finances goal); and 

  -50% will persist or progress in education 


  Our vision for the Family Goal Fund is that families are entrusted with
  regular injections of cash in order to provide much needed stability and
  ensure long-term security. Even the most motivated parents are vulnerable to
  getting knocked off track by seemingly small financial shocks which trigger a
  cascade of challenges that are hard to recover from. LIFT’s Family Goal Fund
  provides a concrete safety net based on implicit trust. Parents want to give
  their children a better life than their own, and they can and should be
  trusted to make smart decisions to get it done.


  Christina’s story embodies our vision for success. Christina came to LIFT
  three years ago looking for connections to food and clothing support for her
  children. Though she did not have the legal right to work, she was able to set
  and achieve goals in LIFT’s program. Since then, she went back to school, got
  a job, started her own construction company, and became a homeowner. Access to
  LIFT’s Goal Fund was pivotal in helping her stay on course, rebound in crisis,
  and make her dreams a reality.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '400'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '1600'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  LIFT can share key lessons that have clear policy implications. 1) We can
  trust parents. If given access to funds—and the right to choose how to spend
  it—our data show that parents spend on what they need most. 2) Fewer
  restrictions, more results. Offering more cash and cash-like supports (WIC,
  SNAP), not less, is the most effective way of reducing child poverty. However,
  burdensome eligibility criteria and enrollment procedures and the “benefits
  cliff” prevent families from accessing what they need. 3) More bang for your
  (public) buck. Research shows that increasing families’ incomes during a
  child’s earliest years leads to better long-term academic performance, health
  outcomes, and employment for their children. These outcomes save money.
