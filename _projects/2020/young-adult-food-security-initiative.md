title: Young Adult Food Security Initiative
project_summary: >-
  Young adults in Los Angeles face persistent insecurity in access to both food
  and health care. This insecurity is made worse by deficits in both information
  about and uptake of available health benefits, such as Medi-Cal, and food
  benefits, such as Cal-Fresh. YI seeks support to expand the scope of its
  proven Barbershops campaign, previously focused on Medi-Cal only - to better
  connect young people from the Black and Latinx communities in Los Angeles
  County to the health and nutritional benefits for which they are eligible.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - East LA
  - San Gabriel Valley
  - South LA
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Applying a proven model or solution to a new issue or sector (e.g, using a job
  recruiting software or strategy to match clients to supportive housing sites,
  applying demonstrated strategies from advocating for college affordability to
  advocating for housing affordability and homelessness, etc.)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  A 2019 article in the Journal of General Internal Medicine estimates 11% of
  young adults nationally are food insecure. A 2017 report from The Urban
  Institute estimated 11% of households with a 4-year college student
  experienced food insecurity. That figure is 17% when including a community
  college student. A 2019 study of 40,000 California community college students
  shared that half of respondents were food insecure in the prior 30 days. Food
  insecurity is characterized by disrupted eating patterns and reduced quality
  and quantity of diets. Hunger has deep physical, emotional, and academic
  effects, exacerbating health problems and derailing academic progress. The
  problem often goes unnoticed, and the stigma around being unable to meet basic
  needs keeps people from seeking help. Having already developed and proven a
  model to drive Medi-Cal uptake among young adults of color in LA, YI seeks the
  resources to expand the scope of our outreach to encompass both health care
  and nutrition.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  YI is a leader promoting expanded health coverage and anti-hunger policy for
  young adults. In 2017, YI partnered with iHeart Media and DPSS in a Medi-Cal
  health care outreach and enrollment program at 12 LA County barbershops,
  averaging nearly 1,500 enrollments in 3 months.  We will expand this model to
  include Cal-Fresh outreach. Young adults in YI’s programs launched an advocacy
  campaign to expand SNAP benefits for college students by increasing access to
  CalFresh benefits. In 2019, YI successfully launched the 2nd year of our
  #HealthyAdulting campaign micro-targeting Black and Latinx young men for
  health care literacy and Medi-Cal enrollments. YI led a preventive care
  conversation with young adults and community members. We developed strategic
  partnerships with the LA Co. DPSS, Medi-Cal division, small business
  barbershops in LA Co., local elected officials, the Real 92.3 Big Boy's Hip
  Hop and iHeartradio. The series was so successful LA Co. requested adding
  locations.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  YI assesses the impact of our activities through tracking the number of
  beneficiaries reached, along with overall evidence of effective communication
  and benefit uptake among target demographics. Consistent with YI’s previous
  successful model, YI will track individual participation in programming, and
  will work with LA DPSS to track sign-ups for eligible benefits. Our
  state-based work concentrates on digital engagement, resource development,
  in-person engagement, and coalition partnership. We simultaneously recognize
  that elevating awareness of a program availability is valuable, as well as the
  number enrolled. We track the number of people to whom we provide information
  and capture stories of their experiences. By the end of the grant year, 1000
  Californians, primarily those newly eligible for health care, will have
  received education about their health care coverage options and enrollment
  opportunities. Typically, each person directly impacted by our program reports
  having shared information and resources with 3 others. With this in mind, our
  indirect impact will be at least 3000 additional Angelinos.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '1000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '3000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Following proven models of success driving benefit uptake among hard-to-reach
  populations, YI’s efforts will ensure that a generation of young people who
  might otherwise see their goals deferred or denied due to food and health
  insecurity will be connected with the resources they need. We seek in
  particular to both improve benefit uptake, especially among young people of
  color, as well as to reduce stigma around hunger and health access among young
  adults in LA. Young people need access to all the resources for which they are
  eligible.
