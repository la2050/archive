project_summary: >-
  We have been offering retreats and immersive experiences for men of
  transgender experience for the past two years. We would like to shift into

    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Camp Lost Boys was born out of necessity. Transgender men have no other
  dedicated space (worldwide) or services that care for their specific needs.
  This event has literally saved lives. It was at the first gathering in 2017,
  that I realized how isolated I’d felt from other men and my own masculinity
  and, consequently, how I’d been harboring an old and obsolete hatred in my
  heart. The damaging beliefs I’d had about all men being toxic had corroded my
  sense of self. I realized all men (not just trans men) are isolated, depressed
  and suicidal, as indicated by the statistics. Men are 4 times as likely to die
  by suicide than women and 51% of trans men under the age of 18 have admitted
  to attempting suicide. 


  Camp Lost Boys is helping trans men love themselves, love each other and build
  community. We want to extend this into the larger culture of all men.  
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  While so-called crises of masculinity have existed as long as the concept of
  masculinity itself, we are experiencing a moment of greater cultural awareness
  today. Men’s work may be nothing new, but our approach is completely radical
  and different from what has come before and what currently exists. Much of
  that work is not in conscious dialogue with broader social questions, but
  treats men’s issues as stand-alone and solipsistic. Our work is unique in its
  nature. Unwaveringly allied with and rooted in intersectional feminism and
  social justice movements, it approaches men’s work from an expansive and
  inclusive way, transforming greater communities by positively reshaping
  individual lives. 


  All of our four events have had attendance of between 30-45% men of color and
  between the ages of 18-76. It is always our aim to continue to grow our
  diverse attendance. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  A few factors will define success. If we are able to produce an event for 100
  men, half of which are cis gender and half trans men and there is a diverse
  age range and men of color in attendance. If in the exit survey men express
  radical transformation, life changing or life saving sentiments. If we are
  able to host an event full of conversations and workshops that transform the
  culture of masculinity in the men that attend and their subsequent communities
  and that ripple effect takes hold of LA. And especially if it becomes clear
  that there is an ongoing desire for more of this event. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '100'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '10000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  These events transform men. It allows men to have a deep inward moment of self
  reflection. They will build deep connections to themselves and their fellows,
  while unpacking patriarchal gendered norms and building authentic connection
  to self. This experience resources men with new tools for understanding
  privilege and how they can extract themselves from patriarchy and begin to
  work in solidarity with women in non-binary people, with a simple approach to
  personal growth based on five progressive tenets: awareness, connection,
  accountability, empathy, solidarity.


  This experience not only transforms the men, but it transforms their
  subsequent communities. 
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  Intentional Man Project will focus on cross promotion to engage men of all
  kinds. Camp Lost Boys currently serves trans men exclusively and Intentional
  Man Project serves trans and cisgender men. It is our aim to bring men of all
  experience together and IMP will do this through its broader reach. 


  In programming for events and gatherings, Camp Lost Boys will provide chat
  leaders and experts from the trans male perspective and Intentional Man
  Project will provide leaders that are cisgender.
