title: Helping Angelenos Access Services and Thrive
project_summary: >-
  GSO will help hard-working Angelenos access the resources they need to take
  care of their families and improve their financial resiliency. Working with
  our broad coalition of community partners, GSO will leverage our proven
  outreach and education model to provide the information and support Angelenos
  need to claim the millions of dollars available via tax credits, stimulus
  checks, and public benefit programs. This will provide families with the
  ability to buy food, pay rent, spend time with their children, and lead
  healthier and happier lives.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  California has the highest poverty rate of any state and Los Angeles County
  the highest rate in CA, with over 2.3 million residents living in poverty. Yet
  billions of dollars from federal and state programs go unclaimed because
  people don’t realize they are eligible or face barriers in claiming
  assistance.
   
  Research shows that these programs are effective mechanisms to reduce poverty
  for recipients, boost local economies, lower infant mortality rates, improve
  student test scores and college graduation rates, increase employment, and
  more. By raising awareness and providing critical support, GSO can help
  Angelenos access ALL available resources. This is more important than ever in
  the wake of COVID-19’s disastrous effects on our economy, since federal
  stimulus checks are linked to individual’s tax returns and an additional $1
  billion can be claimed right now through state tax credits. In these uncertain
  times, GSO wants to help every Angeleno access the money and resources they
  need.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Since 2015, GSO has helped over 4.7 million California households claim the
  California Earned Income Tax Credit (CalEITC) and $1.3+ billion dollars in
  state funds. We coordinate CalEITC outreach across the state, working with
  diverse partners. Our CalEITC4Me campaign serves as a national model for
  anti-poverty advocacy and outreach, with our cost-effective, targeted,
  scalable, and multi-layered digital strategy based on innovative use of
  technology to reach low-income workers.


  GSO has already identified millions of the lowest income Californians and
  Angelenos, tested and refined effective engagement strategies, and has a
  proven track record of increasing the number of people who claim the CalEITC
  and the money they are owed. GSO is also already seen as a trusted resource
  for low-income workers. There has been a marked increase in visits to our
  website since the COVID-19 economic downturn began, as people turn to us for
  information on how to get the dollars they need more than ever.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  GSO’s long-term vision is a Los Angeles County where millions of workers and
  their families no longer live in poverty. Hard-working Angelenos will not
  require or qualify for the CalEITC and other programs because they have built
  the financial security to meet their basic needs and thrive. We will assess
  progress by working with public agencies and academic researchers to track
  poverty rates in Los Angeles County and the numbers of people eligible for the
  CalEITC, CalFresh, and other public benefits.


  The first step towards achieving this vision is ensuring every eligible
  Angeleno claims the CalEITC dollars they are owed. We will achieve this by
  communicating with 750,000 low-income LA County households by the end of the
  grant period (July 2021) to share information about the resources available
  and help them claim cash through the CalEITC and public benefit programs like
  CalFresh. We will track the number of LA County residents contacted by us and
  our coalition partners, resources shared with them, the number of LA County
  CalEITC claims, how much of the full $1 billion available is claimed
  statewide, and the amount claimed in LA County specifically.  


  GSO will carefully evaluate the project and track progress towards goals. We
  will do this through the methods outlined above as well as gathering
  qualitative feedback from our partners and the people we reach. We will use
  all of the gathered data to assess project impact and refine our approach.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '750000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '1500000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  This project will improve the lives of millions of LA County residents, a
  region long one of GSO’s highest priorities even before COVID devastated the
  economy. In addition to the numerous children and adults in the 750,000
  households we will contact, EITCs also have a multiplier effect—every dollar
  generates $1.50-$2 in local economic activity. Stimulus funds have similar
  effects, so helping low-income Angelenos file their taxes eventually helps ALL
  people in LA County.


  Reducing financial anxiety also lessens long-term toxic impacts of stress,
  particularly on children’s developing brains. This is especially important for
  people of color—the primary community GSO serves—who have historically endured
  the most inequitable economic conditions.
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  We are not submitting a collaborative proposal; we will, however, be providing
  subgrants to a number of partner organizations to help conduct outreach and
  provide free tax preparation and other services. In order to reach low-income
  Angelenos from throughout the county and from diverse communities, we work
  with community-based organizations who are trusted messengers for our target
  audiences, as well as school districts who can help us reach their families.
  Our projected budget includes $304,000 for these community grants.
