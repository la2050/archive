title: Get Lit – Words Ignite Online Curriculum
project_summary: >-
  This grant will support the launch of Get Lit’s Online In-School Curriculum
  for all students and teachers in L.A. County. Our award-winning and impactful
  poetry, literacy, and youth empowerment curriculum is the only program in the
  nation that combines learning classic literature with the creation of poems by
  youth. It is approved as a Univ of CA ‘A-G’ college prep elective, and has
  been proven to significantly raise youth literacy, reduce drop-out rates and
  improve graduation rates, and deeply affect students’ socio-emotional
  wellbeing.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
  - >-
    LAUSD (please select only if you have a district-wide partnership or
    project)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  We are responding to three urgent needs specifically regarding online
  curricula for L.A. students: academic rigor, structure, and connectedness.
  What the COVID-19 crisis has made clear is that the current offerings in
  distance education are often shells of classroom curricula, and do not provide
  students with adequate, or in some cases any, opportunity for intellectual
  challenges, or for feedback, discussion, and connection. Through our robust
  program, students improve their reading comprehension, vocabulary, and writing
  skills; increase critical thinking and public speaking abilities; develop
  greater academic engagement and self-efficacy; and build vital social skills
  rooted in self-awareness, confidence, personal responsibility, and compassion.
  We currently serve 120 southern CA schools with approximately 8,500 students.
  Because of our strong belief in educational equity and inclusion, our goal is
  to provide our life changing program to all L.A. students at this critical
  juncture.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Get Lit is perfectly poised for this project. We have been a leader and
  innovator in education for 14 years with a reputation for integrity in program
  implementation and effectiveness. We have a long partnership with LAUSD for
  delivery of our In-School Program. Our curriculum aligns with the Common Core
  and VAPA Standards and is Univ of CA ‘A-G’ approved. Because of its success in
  engaging students at risk of missing on-time graduation, LAUSD has certified
  our curriculum as an Intervention Course. Whereas other organizations are only
  beginning to ramp up online programs, we are prepared, savvy, and secure in
  this arena, with a vast amount of content at the ready. We are already working
  with tech companies Agency 39A and Extension Engine in preparation for the
  launch, and LAUSD is now using Flipgrid video technology to record our
  students’ performances. We have provided online content for youth for other
  partners including The California Endowment and the L.A. Dept. of Mental
  Health.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  The outcome of this project will be that the Get Lit common-core aligned
  curriculum is available online to all students in L.A. County. Currently,
  there is no similar program in existence, especially with the outreach,
  academic rigor, and adaptability to student needs that ours features. The
  online curriculum will be designed to be interactive, exciting, and engaging.
  It will include “Blitz” performances by our teen poetry troupe the Get Lit
  Players, virtual mentoring sessions, guest speakers, the Get Lit Scoremetrics
  app where students and teachers can see writing and performance feedback from
  their peers in real time, as well settings for teacher/student and
  student/student interactions. The app collects and analyzes evaluations,
  enabling teachers to record and document student growth, in both writing and
  performance, as well as assess the effectiveness of the curriculum. This
  cutting-edge curriculum will culminate in the opportunity for youth to compete
  in our Classic Slam. Lessons will incorporate video links, Google Docs, and
  Zoom sessions, offering students sequential instruction, a nimble forum for
  dialogues on pertinent subjects, mentorship, and support for youth who feel
  isolated and traumatized, especially during COVID-19. To evaluate the online
  program, Get Lit staff will survey teachers and students utilizing the
  curriculum each semester, focusing on ease of use, content quality, depth of
  learning, and the number of schools that are implementing the system.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '800000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '1500000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  We will  transform the format of education by improving literacy on a broad
  scale. This project will close the achievement gap by providing an online
  personalized learning experience to all students (traditional or homeschool),
  regardless of income or social class. It will ignite students’ love of
  language, provide them with tools for empowerment and success, and support
  college readiness. It will change the dynamics and power structures, allowing
  all students, including those not comfortable speaking, to share stories and
  engage in cross-city dialogue. It will provide socio-emotional support,
  facilitate connection and active civic engagement. Our plan is to offer this
  curriculum to all of California, followed by nationally.
