title: 'Child and Family Development Center:  Nurture In Nature Project'
project_summary: >
  Nurture In Nature assesses the impact of wilderness outings on mental health
  and well-being of two low income groups: a) child welfare referred
  mothers/caregivers of children zero to 5 and b) children and families living
  in a large public housing facility (Mar Vista Gardens). By getting young
  children out in nature and providing parents with opportunities to bond and
  create memories with their children, we aim to provide opportunities to
  experience respite from daily stressors, and connect with other families in a
  supportive environment.

  Our Goals

  *Bring the benefits of nature to children to improve and sustain their mental
  health 

  *Build relationships/engage families at Mar Vista Gardens public housing
  project 

  *Assist parents and children in deepening attachment with one another and with
  nature as a protective factor 


  CFDC successfully implemented a grant from CA State Parks to
  design/implement/assess the impact of nature on mental health of families with
  young children diverted from involvement with DCFS.  


  Since beginning that in 2019, we were invited in to partner with the Boys and
  Girls Club (BGC) located in Mar Vista Gardens Public Housing (MVG) to bring
  mental health services to the community’s children. MVG residents are “very
  low” to “extremely low income.”  The population is 82% Latinx, 12% African
  American, 5% Asian and Caucasian. Around 60% of caretakers are solely Spanish
  speaking. Despite the need as identified by BCG, and paucity of providers,
  residents are wary of mental health services. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Since 1962, CFDC has been a “Center of Excellence” providing early childhood
  intervention programs and services supporting 1,000 young children and their
  families living at or below the poverty level. Programs include Early
  Childhood Assessment & Treatment (outpatient mental health), Partnerships for
  Families (0-5 home visiting program), Perinatal Wellness Program
  (perinatal/infant mental health support), Therapeutic Preschool, Preschool
  Wellness Consultation, and Helen Reid Parenting. Programs are delivered at the
  Center and at community sites, including 8 schools, 23 preschool classes,
  transitional housing, parks, and homes, reinforcing the concept of a “clinic
  without walls.” We collaborate with dozens of non-profits, and have contracts
  with LA County Dept. of Mental Health, DCFS, and City of Santa Monica. Our
  Preschool Wellness Consultation was recently chosen by the Robert Wood Johnson
  Foundation as a bold and unique approach to building a “Culture of Health” in
  our community.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >+
  Short term: Decrease levels of stress, anxiety and depression, increase
  connections between caregivers and children and increase connection to
  nature.  

  Longer term: Build resiliency and ultimately contribute to the field by
  developing a model for work with disenfranchised children and families which
  will incorporate the use of nature into mental health treatment. 


  Success will be determined by pre and post tests: 

  Participants will show statistically significant:  

  -Decreased levels of stress and depression  as measured by the Perceived
  Stress Scale for Children and CES-DC; 

  -Increased levels of caregiver/child connection as measured by the MORS-SF; 

  -Increased connection to nature as measured by the Connection to Nature Index.


  3 months after longitudinal success will be measured by: 

  -Mar Vista Gardens (BCG) participating children attending 3 out of 4
  excursions will be re-measured to determine if there are statistically
  significant improvements in stress, depression, caregiver/child connection and
  in connection to nature. 

  -Parents of children 0-5 who attend 2 out of 3 excursions will be  re-measured
  to determine if there are statistically significant improvements in
  caregiver/child connection and in connection to nature. 

  -Clinicians will show a decrease in their work related stress and feelings of
  burnout, and an increase in engagement as measured by the Maslach Burnout
  Inventory (MBI) and by a 30 minute questionnaire to be developed with the Rand
  Corporation. 

Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '205'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '1000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Success means: 

  -Bringing state-of-the-art mental health services to an underserved community
  and decreasing stigma of mental health treatment by embedding with Boys and
  Girls Club and becoming a part of the Mar Vista Gardens family. 

  -Building resiliency in children impacted by poverty and violence by
  connecting them and their families to nature.   

  -Connecting children to nature by creating life-long benefits for them and the
  planet. 

  -Contributing to early research in the field about using nature to help
  children heal and to address burn out in community mental health workers.  


  We note that a review of 35 studies from 6 countries (Tillman et al., 2018)
  showed that nature positively impacts mental health in children and teens. 
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >
  -Boys and Girls Club will partner with CFDC on outings.  Since 1944, BCG has
  been giving youth what they need to succeed, currently serving 4,000+ youth
  ages 6-18 in 128 LA zip codes by providing a safe and nurturing environment. 


  -RAND Corp, a nonprofit nonpartisan research group, will be the research
  partner for the project. Rand helps improve policy and decision making through
  research and analysis, developing solutions to public policy challenges
  throughout the world. Each year, more than 5 million research products are
  downloaded from RAND.org by policymakers, academics, and the general public.
