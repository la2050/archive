title: United Friends Scholars Program
project_summary: >-
  The Scholars Program is specifically designed to meet the critical need for
  high-touch, relationship-focused programming focusing on the educational
  attainment of youth in Los Angeles County’s foster care system. Providing a
  suite of services including educational case management and advocacy,
  college-readiness workshops, college tours, enrichment activities, youth
  development, and peer-led leadership opportunities, academic support, and
  financial aid, LA foster youth are able to bridge the gap between them and
  their non-foster peers.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Los Angeles County is home to the largest population of foster youth in the
  country with nearly 30,000 youth in care. Often without supports and stable a
  home life, too many foster youth confront far too many obstacles to their
  success in life. The mental and emotional challenges, lack of stability and
  attachments, and sadly, the violence and abuse often experienced by young
  people in the system translate into disproportionately high rates of
  homelessness, incarceration, poor academic achievement, unemployment, and a
  reliance on public assistance. Youth in foster care experience particular
  challenges related to obtaining an education. In academic year 2018/19, only
  57.3% of LA County foster youth graduated high school compared to 84.2%
  overall. This represents a significant achievement gap, especially when
  compared against graduation rates for other vulnerable subgroups –
  socioeconomically disadvantaged (82.6%), migrant youth (89.1%), and homeless
  youth (75.5%).  
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  United Friends has been providing educational support services to Los Angeles
  County’s foster youth since 2003. The experience and success of youth in our
  programs (+90% graduation rate, 80% college matriculation rate), makes us
  uniquely qualified to expand services into the Antelope Valley. To deliver
  these services, we hire and train college-focused counselors with professional
  backgrounds in college counseling and/or the social services field, providing
  a unique and effective blend of expertise. United Friends also utilizes the
  evidence-based practices Motivational Interviewing and Positive Youth
  Development Strategies to work in tandem with academic improvement and college
  preparation. Finally, COVID-19 has wreaked havoc on the educational systems
  further exacerbating the need for Scholars Program counselors to provide
  one-on-one educational case management and oversight to ensure youth in foster
  care receive the individual attention necessary in such an isolating
  situation.  
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: "Evaluating the success of the programs is achieved through in-depth data collection and analysis and is led by our Director of Impact and Evaluation. The organization currently utilizes Social Solution’s Apricot system, an encrypted cloud-based case management/outcomes database, to record and analyze participant and administrative data for our programs. This upgraded software allows for more efficient tracking of data points such as participation in key activities, indicators for success, and a youth’s progress toward their goals. Program staff routinely monitor progress towards outcomes utilizing this data monthly and at annual retreats. We also use the National Student Clearinghouse (NSC) database to help confirm the attendance and progression of students through college. This enables us to further track student progress beyond their participation in our program. \n\nOur vision is to close the significant achievement gap between youth in foster care and their non-foster peers. We will be successful when foster youth access institutions of higher education at rates meeting and exceeding the general population – in turn providing the ability to take back control of their lives and create the future they desire. To this end, outcomes for Scholars Program include: \n*\t90% of students will graduate high school \n*\t85% of students will matriculate to college \n*\t70% of college scholars will earn a college degree  \n"
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '700'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '500'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  The broader impact is observed in the foster and biological families as well.
  Counselors are a frequent presence in the home, building relationships with
  caregivers who become a primary referral source for the program. Additionally,
  an annual conference draws hundreds of foster youth, caregivers, social
  workers, and group home staff providing college readiness workshops and
  motivation to key stakeholders throughout the county. In response to COVID-19,
  families are provided technology to ensure digital touchpoints are accessible
  in lieu of face-to-face contact. Finally, as youth transition from college and
  into careers, they begin to provide the much-needed stability as pillars of
  support to their own communities and family units.
