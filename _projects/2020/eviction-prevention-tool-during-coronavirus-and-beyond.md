title: 'Eviction Prevention Tool, During Coronavirus and Beyond'
project_summary: >-
  This project will prevent homelessness caused by illegal evictions by
  connecting tenants at risk of displacement to newly-available eviction
  prevention resources. The new LA County Eviction Defense program provides
  low-income tenants access to a free lawyer for eviction cases. SAJE and
  JustFix will create an online tool that links eligible tenants to these
  resources and conduct an outreach/education campaign informing tenants. In the
  coronavirus era, online resources are critical to making essential services
  available to the most vulnerable.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Avoiding eviction helps prevent homelessness and ensures that tenants do not
  have to leave their homes just so landlords can reap higher profits. LA
  County’s new Eviction Defense Program rolls out tenant protections, including
  legal counsel, to five Los Angeles zip codes this summer. The new eviction
  prevention resources will increase tenants’ ability to remain in their current
  home and reduce homelessness. In the coronavirus era, keeping people in their
  homes is more than ever a matter of life and death. Residents need to be
  informed of the rights and services available to them by a trusted source.
  SAJE is a trusted source in South LA and helps convene the Right to Counsel
  Coalition, a broad network across LA County. With easy-to-access technology,
  SAJE and JustFix aim to create an online resource for tenants to access the
  information and referrals they need to exercise their rights in a moment when
  in-person support and screening are challenged by the need for physical
  distancing.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  SAJE helps lead the LA Right to Counsel coalition and supports the coalition
  organizing in support of the recent rent stabilization ordinance in the
  County. In response to the coronavirus, SAJE helped lead efforts to ensure
  tenants gain protections from displacement to prevent further public health
  challenges. SAJE’s work on OWN IT! (https://www.ownit.la/) similarly leveraged
  technology to help enhance code enforcement capabilities with LA County and
  reduce slum living conditions. Paired with tenant-friendly policies,
  technology can be a powerful tool to connect individuals at risk of eviction.
  SAJE will build on the success of OWN IT! and the experience of JustFix’s
  right to counsel website. JustFix built a first-of-its-kind screening tool for
  Right to Counsel in NYC, helping connect 4,000+ tenants with free legal
  representation in just the first year. The technology can be paired with a
  variety of community organizing campaigns SAJE is engaged in locally and
  countywide.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  SAJE envisions that this project will complement its current actions on
  tenants rights and equitable development in LA and similar efforts by groups
  across LA County. Through the existing Tenant Action Clinics and outreach
  efforts, including partnerships with broad coalitions and LA County, SAJE will
  educate tenants on their right to legal counsel for eviction issues. Success
  in this project would be the launch of a user-friendly web-based tool to help
  tenants navigate the complexities of the phased roll-out process and an
  outreach campaign to ensure the target population is aware of and able to use
  eviction defense resources. Success will be measured by the completion and
  publication of the website and by the active use of the tool by tenants in LA
  County. 

  Because this project complements SAJE’s current work, it is scalable and can
  be adjusted to grow with a larger budget. The right to counsel website can be
  woven into SAJE’s current efforts and communications with coalition members,
  but a larger amount of funding would enable SAJE to take additional actions
  that ensure the widespread knowledge and use of the website in the initial
  areas to receive access to this legal counsel.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '10000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '118901'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  This proposal aligns with a nationwide movement to ensure tenants have a right
  to counsel in eviction cases. While there is a right to counsel in criminal
  cases, there is no comparative legal right in civil cases. Other cities,
  including New York City, are enacting right to counsel protections for
  tenants. SAJE’s proven track record at addressing slum housing conditions and
  helping tenants to better advocate for themselves will allow LA neighborhoods
  to determine their own future as the city grows. Increased legal
  representation will help prevent displacement, reduce homelessness, and allow
  more tenants to remain in their homes and continue to influence the future of
  their communities.
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  SAJE will be conducting the work in LA County to inform tenants of their new
  right to counsel. In building up their outreach and education efforts, SAJE
  will work with JustFix to build off of the success of JustFix’s work on New
  York City’s right to counsel for tenants. Utilizing a co-design process,
  tenants who participate in SAJE programs, SAJE organizers, and JustFix staff
  will develop a tool that is accessible to tenants. SAJE will devote its
  expertise in eviction prevention, tenant rights, and years of experience
  conducting outreach and organizing with tenants from the most vulnerable
  communities in Los Angeles. JustFix will bring tremendous design, product
  management, technical engineering, and software development expertise and
  experience, having created similar tools in NYC.
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Access to the LA2050 community
  - Host public events or gatherings
  - Communications support
  - Strategy assistance and implementation
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.: JustFix
Which metrics will your submission impact?:
  - Housing affordability
  - Homelessness
Are there any other LA2050 goal categories that your proposal will impact?: []
Has your proposal changed due to COVID-19?: >
  Eviction prevention has become an even higher priority as the covid-19
  pandemic has caused millions of renters in LA County to wonder if they can pay
  their rent. Keeping our homes IS public health. Without a home, exposure to
  the coronavirus is dramatically worsened. Temporary emergency measures protect
  many tenants, but only for a limited time. Now more than ever, tenants need
  easy access to tools and resources to help exercise their rights and stay in
  their homes. In the coronavirus era, easy-to-use and multi-lingual online
  resources are essential to making critical services available to people who
  need it the most. In rapid response to the current crisis, we created
  NoRent.org, which has helped tenants throughout the County protect themselves
  from unlawful evictions. 


  Dramatic impacts to the County's budget have shifted the focus of this current
  project and amplify its value. Currently, the LA County Eviction Defense
  Program will be replaced by a short-term Emergency Eviction Prevention
  Program. New tools for tenants to protect against displacement remain
  critically necessary. For instance, our tools may help tenants effectively
  document and respond to issues of harassment and slum housing conditions - two
  major drivers of displacement.
