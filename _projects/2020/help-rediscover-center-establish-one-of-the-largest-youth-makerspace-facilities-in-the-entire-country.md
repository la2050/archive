  Help ReDiscover Center establish one of the largest Youth Makerspace
  Facilities in the entire country!
project_summary: >-
  Envision 4,000 sf of Kids Makerspace, specially designed to develop the
  creativity, collaboration skills, and ingenuity of LA County's youth - serving
  up to 75 "tinkerers" at once, establishing one of the largest facilities in
  the entire U.S. Our youth learn practical making (Building a Dog House! Design
  a Bookshelf!) to large-scale, highly imaginative creating (a 6' Squirrel
  Robot! A Unicorn Cart!) Your vote will put tools, confidence, and
  eco-awareness in our children's lives. Let's do this!

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - San Fernando Valley
  - Westside
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >+
  In too many schools, particularly in LAUSD, arts education has become a sad
  afterthought, and students are not gaining the STEAM skills necessary for full
  engagement with our increasingly knowledge-intensive, globally integrated and
  innovation-based economy. The vast majority of students go through their
  entire education without exposure to the shop classes utilized by previous
  generations to gain manual skills, resilience, and 3D reasoning. Most students
  graduate unable to safely use tools for even basic construction and repairs.
  Our unique ethos and methods have been incredibly effective at imparting STEM
  and STEAM lessons in an organic, intuitive way. We are responding to
  children's needs to learn both how to DO and how to CREATE: How to learn the
  practical, the mathematical, and the common sense skills that come from, say,
  constructing a nightstand from scratch- to the sheer exhilaration that comes
  from creating something huge and fantastical. 

Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Since 2003, reDiscover Center has been providing hands-on creativity education
  programs to over 10,000 children per year in Los Angeles County. Based out of
  our current 2,000 sf kids makerspace in Venice, we engage children through
  camps, workshops, in-school programs, and community events throughout the
  Westside and beyond. Our programs combine large quantities of sustainable and
  reclaimed materials, like industrial offcuts, commercial discards, and
  recyclables, with real power tools like drills and saws, to create a tinkering
  environment where children can create projects as wild and vivid as their
  imaginations!  With this expansion, we will reach and impact more youth, and
  become a regional anchor for parents and their children to learn to make and
  tinker. Our work will soar exponentially-and allow us to impact and change the
  lives of so many more deserving youth. We were one of the first independent
  kids' makerspaces, and have been pioneers ever since! 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  This expansion into a 4,000 sf makerspace facility will allow reDiscover to
  triple the number of youth served annually in our spring and summer intensive
  Tinkering Camp Programs, double the capacity to serve the youth in our
  Tinkering Club program, and allow us to expand the number of LAUSD school
  trips by 250%, as well as greatly expand our current outreach services to
  local parks and community festivals such as CicLAvia. In addition, we serve as
  a vital space for artists, teachers and parents to inexpensively purchase
  quantities of recycled and upcycled materials. With new materials processing
  and storage capacity, we can help to reduce LA's carbon footprint while
  providing great maker and arts materials to the community. Our visiting
  schools can now send whole buses of students, train teachers, and gain access
  to our curriculum for in-school maker lessons. In addition to tripling our
  client capacity, we will be able to open a retail facility to sell tools,
  materials, maker resources, and serve as a gallery for youth artists. rDC
  participates in the California Cultural Data Project to track our impact in
  the community, including measures such as:


  *          Children 18 and under attendance


  *          Classes and workshops attendance


  *          Number of temporary exhibitions


  *          Number of exhibition openings


  *          Number of off-site school programs

  Our vision is to facilitate 20,000 children per year as they learn to not
  simply to problem-solve, but expand upon their own solutions; not only to
  express creativity, but to become experienced makers and tinkerers-learning to
  design things with their own hands, making something real. Our youth become
  young adults who are unafraid to make their world a better place-and we
  literally give them the tools to do just that.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '20000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '25000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  reDiscover Center's programs have always followed our mission to instill
  resiliency, creativity, and efficiency in our youth. We are not only
  developing skilled makers, we are preparing future leaders and thinkers-
  runners of thriving households, starters of essential companies, and beacons
  of light and environmental innovation in community volunteer groups and
  neighborhood and city councils alike. Our youth experience greater confidence,
  utilize practical skill sets, gain an increased interest in careers in STEM,
  develop a great sense of responsibility and awareness for the environment,
  change consumption habits, and increase their abilities to collaborate and
  problem solve-across differences. We're creating the future citizens L.A.
  needs.
