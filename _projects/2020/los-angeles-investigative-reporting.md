Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Applying a proven model or solution to a new issue or sector (e.g, using a job
  recruiting software or strategy to match clients to supportive housing sites,
  applying demonstrated strategies from advocating for college affordability to
  advocating for housing affordability and homelessness, etc.)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >
  Across the country and in Los Angeles, dailies and magazines are disappearing,
  victims of venture capital takeovers, consolidation, and unsustainable
  business models. Nearly 8,000 Journalism jobs were lost in 2019 (and Covd-19
  is looking to add to that toll). Alternative papers are also struggling (or
  have already died) in L.A. and with them, a lost depth of investigative
  reporting.


  Meanwhile, we are experiencing a humanitarian crisis across the globe and this
  crisis is playing out--and will continue to--in many ways in Los Angeles.
  There is a growing need to provide deep-dive reporting; people need actionable
  information to make a better world.


  Mother Jones intends to provide new investigative journalism resources to
  explore and provide visibility to many important issues within Los Angeles,
  addressed within the "LIVE" goal and metrics of Affordable Housing,
  Homelessness, and Access to Healthy Food.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  From our inception Mother Jones has prioritized exposing abuses of power; we
  look at social systems excessively weighted in favor of the individual gain of
  the few. 


  The most impactful journalism happens at the intersection of traditional
  reporting verticals – this is one of the great assets that a general-purpose
  journalism organization like Mother Jones brings to the story, along with a
  DNA baked into magazine reporting and not just breaking news – both character
  driven but also systems-focused. We will produce stories that grab the
  reader’s attention but also point to the structural sources of problems and
  solutions that work. The reporting in Los Angeles will help bring to light the
  solutions currently being explored across NGOs, policy institutes, and
  government.


  We are the oldest investigative journalism organization in the country and we
  are excited to leverage our experience and extensive editorial and media
  resources to make a significant impact for those who live here.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  Success will be defined by having impact on the public understanding and
  conversation  surrounding the big issues. We can roughly measure success by an
  increase in the Mother Jones' readership in Los Angeles as well as tracking
  the activity/penetration for specific articles related to the GOAL and
  Metrics.  


  We can also measure success through event participation and by tracking the
  relationships with event attendees and their involvement in polls and surveys
  related to the GOAL and Metrics.


  Our vision of success includes increasing our readership by 50% in Los Angeles
  (by the first year). In March of 2020 we had nearly 200,000 unique digital
  users in L.A. and close to 10M nationwide.


  Above all, the reporting in Los Angeles will explore how the issues we face
  are shaping communities as we make all of these transitions--especially in the
  new reality of Covid-19-- and find solutions to Homelessness, Food Quality,
  Transit, Gun Violence, Immigration, etc. Los Angeles can be a bellwether
  around the many issues/challenges that are facing us and the nation.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '3000000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: ''
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Mother Jones' reporting often has impact on policy decisions, either directly
  through policy-makers or through an energized and activated
  readership.Historically, Mother Jones' has successfully engaged and mobilized
  its' community. Mother Jones makes readers feel like they are part of a
  community and pulling together for good.


  The number of 3,000,000 above represents the goal rate of people reached in
  Los Angeles (annually) by Mother Jones.  Measuring direct or indirect impact
  is challenging when measuring the impact of journalism but the value of
  providing fact-based reporting in a time when we have a crisis of information
  is indisputable.
