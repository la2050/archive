title: LA COVID-19 Assessment and Response System (CARES)
project_summary: >-
  The COVID-19 pandemic, trite now to be calling it a disaster of historic
  proportions, is different in yet another way. Typically, when disasters occur,
  thousands of volunteers descend to relieve the pain. Not this time. But there
  is hope. And because of our work, people are not helpless. Using innovative
  technology tools, we've turned our volunteer ecosystem-building platforms into
  an assessment, response and recovery tool for the entire Los Angeles social
  sector. In a single site in real time, Los Angeles will know who, where and
  how to help.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  The Greater Los Angeles region is ranked 46th out of 50 states in the number
  of adults volunteering at 24 percent. Our mission is to provide communities
  with the modern technology tools they need to rebuild volunteer ecosystems,
  and in normal times (not during a pandemic), our tools are making a dramatic
  difference in the who, what, where, when and how of volunteer engagement in
  communities. The coronavirus pandemic has changed how volunteers can engage
  with nonprofits. As a result, we have created a toolkit -- the COVID-19
  Assessment and Response System or CARES -- embedded as part of our platform
  that helps every nonprofit community assess, respond and recover from the
  horrific impact of COVID-19. This pandemic has been a triple-whammy on
  nonprofits -- hitting them hard in their main fundraising or performance
  season with the cancelation of numerous events, reductions in service-delivery
  revenue and the final big impact is the removal of most volunteers from their
  business model.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  CARES helps us rebuild a volunteer ecosystem, devastated by COVID-19's
  impacts. First, each nonprofit can share data about how they have been
  impacted by COVID-19. The data can be put into context with a story. Both the
  stories and data are maintained in real time to show the impact of COVID-19 on
  individual organizations, causes, sectors and an entire community's social
  sector. A second phase is using the tool to recruit prospective volunteers to
  COVID-19-friendly ways to help now. A lot of people are looking to help, but
  until now have felt helpless in finding online, remote or socially distant
  safe ways to help. In the third phase of the approach, residents can use the
  tool to give to nonprofits or campaigns within a community to help the sector
  recover. We are a nonprofit technology firm that has rebuilt the Cincinnati
  volunteer ecosystem. Our success in Cincinnati has led to other communities
  deploying our platforms. We're pleased to get to work in America's second
  largest city.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Beginning April 3, success looks like helping Los Angelenos find their way to
  help. Less than 1 in 4 Greater Los Angeles residents volunteers. Our 2050 goal
  would be to lift Los Angeles to one of the nation's best, increasing the
  percentage of adults volunteering to close to 50 percent. In the short-term,
  success looks like CARES becoming a key barometer for the health of the
  region's social sector. The tool will help the region understand both the
  impact from COVID-19 as well as the aggregate of the community's response. We
  start with 150 organizations on the platform, and the goal would be to engage
  all 12,000 volunteer-engaging organizations in the region.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '4000000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '13000000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Building -- or rebuilding, due to the COVID-19 crisis -- the volunteer
  ecosystem in Los Angeles is a capacity building effort that impacts the entire
  region's social sector. The social sector in Los Angeles includes more than
  12,000 volunteer-engaging nonprofits who directly impact more than 4 million
  people -- employees, clients and volunteers -- while having an indirect impact
  on the entire population of 13 million. A healthy volunteer ecosystem
  positively impacts all causes, including the most difficult social issues,
  from homelessness to equitable education. The implementation of CARES will
  immediately give policymakers insight into COVID-19's impact on the social
  sector, helping to determine the future of critically scarce resources.
