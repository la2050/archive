project_summary: >-
  826LA will inspire Los Angeles residents to support local students by
  volunteering. 826LA will develop outreach strategies to recruit new
  volunteers, with a focus on volunteers-of-color and older volunteers. 826LA
  will create relevant trainings for volunteers to complete online and in our
  centers. These steps will help 826LA grow its volunteer program, with a focus

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - South LA
  - Westside
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
  - >-
    LAUSD (please select only if you have a district-wide partnership or
    project)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  In Los Angeles, over 80% of LAUSD students qualify for free or reduced price
  lunch and only 42% of LAUSD students met English standards last year.
  Additionally, “a prominent factor in education quality” is the
  student-to-teacher ratio, in which California ranks last in the nation. The
  Review of Educational Research found that “students who work with volunteer
  tutors are likely to earn higher scores on assessments related to letters and
  words, oral fluency, and writing compared to their peers who were not
  tutored.”


  826LA’s programs pair students with volunteers who support them with homework,
  reading, and writing. 826LA provides consistent, individualized attention from
  multigenerational volunteers who guide students through the creative process
  and support teachers and families in under-resourced schools and communities.
  Attention from caring adults outside young people’s own families has been
  shown to play a significant role in providing a number of developmental
  assets.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  For 15 years, 826LA has mobilized volunteers to support students through
  engaging, creative programs. Working with thousands of volunteers has taught
  us the importance and impact of connection, especially in times of crisis.
  826LA will continue to grow by providing highly-requested trainings, digital
  platforms, and new outreach models that will allow volunteers in Los Angeles
  to support students year-round, in our centers and online.
   
  Volunteers provide the one-to-one attention that makes 826LA’s programs
  exceptional. Last year, over 1,100 volunteers provided 22,000 hours of
  volunteer work. Through this project, 826LA’s volunteer base will grow and
  diversify and the rate of volunteerism in the city will increase. Support from
  LA2050 will enable us to focus on connecting with 1,000 new volunteers through
  new outreach tools and providing trainings developed with an equity lens to
  better support new and existing volunteers with cultural competence.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  826LA’s Changing the Story project has two components: outreach and trainings.
   
  The first part of 826LA’s project is outward-facing, centered around volunteer
  outreach and appreciation. 826LA would use support from LA2050 to reimagine
  the presentation materials (digital and physical) we use at festivals, fairs,
  and events around the city and design and purchase high-visibility items like
  standing pop-up or feather banners, postcards and pamphlets, and useful,
  branded items for take-aways. We would be able to invest in public radio
  advertisements and newspaper placements, to increase visibility beyond our
  online and in-person outreach campaigns.
   
  The second area is aimed at improving our training systems. 826LA will create
  quarterly training modules for new and existing volunteers. These trainings
  will focus on improving the cultural competencies of volunteers, such as race,
  gender, and identity; restorative justice; behavior management; working with
  neurodiverse learners; supporting English language learners; the fundamentals
  of volunteering in anti-harassment spaces; and emergency, safety, and health
  protocols. The LA2050 grant will open up the possibility for 826LA to move our
  trainings online, by allowing us to use subscription-based training management
  platforms.


  Measurable goals include connecting with 1,000 new volunteers and developing
  four cultural competency trainings.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '1000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '9000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  LA2050's Vision for a Successful Los Angeles found that only 22% of Angelenos
  “formally volunteered at least once annually” ranking LA “45th among the 51
  largest metropolitan areas in the nation.” Over 22,000 of LA’s volunteer hours
  last year came from 826LA volunteers. With centers in Mar Vista and Echo Park
  and Writers’ Rooms at Manual Arts High School in South LA and Roosevelt High
  School in Boyle Heights, 826LA accommodates volunteers all over the city.
  Support from LA2050 will take 826LA’s proven volunteer program and grow not
  only our corps of volunteers, but increase the number of active volunteers in
  Los Angeles.
