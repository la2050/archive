title: Modern Band Los Angeles County
project_summary: >-
  LKR will democratize music education across LA County through the expansion of
  our modern band program. Modern band trains and equips music teachers to
  connect learning to the music that kids already know and love—including rock,
  pop, Latin, and hip-hop, and others—performed with guitars, keyboards, drums,
  vocals, and technology. The program has resulted in increased participation in
  music, as well as improved social, emotional, and academic outcomes especially
  for students who do not feel represented by traditional music education
  offerings.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
  - >-
    LAUSD (please select only if you have a district-wide partnership or
    project)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Music education cannot impact the lives of children it does not reach. In
  LAUSD, for example, 80%+ of students are eligible for free/reduced-fee meals,
  a strong indicator of the socio-economic realities that students and their
  families face. When buying groceries is a challenge, obtaining an instrument
  or getting lessons outside of school is almost impossible. Additionally, 70%+
  of the student population is Latino/Hispanic, meaning many young people may
  choose not to participate in traditional music programs as they do not reflect
  their likes and diverse cultural perspectives. The need then is two-fold:
  music education must be both accessible and relevant to be effective. At a
  time when the benefits of music education are better understood than ever
  before, LKR is improving participation and inspiring young people to unlock
  their inner music-makers with profound results including enhanced emotional
  literacy, improved attendance, and increased engagement in the school
  community.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  No other service provider combines teacher training, instruments, and
  curriculum and offers them as a direct investment in the district’s existing
  infrastructure. For instance, LKR’s modern band approach is implemented by
  full-time district employees, offered during the academic day or as a
  sustained after-school program, and is made available at no fee to the
  students, teachers, or schools.


  LKR also has a proven track of working with school districts across LA County,
  including LAUSD where we’ve worked in partnership since 2004. Currently, we
  serve more than 17,000 students in 175 classrooms across LA County (in cities
  including Los Angeles, Pasadena, Altadena, Compton, and many others). For an
  overview of our current program schools, find a LA County Impact Map here:

  With a modest initial investment, and by leveraging students’ cultural capital
  through inclusive curricula, LKR can scale modern band exponentially to
  transform music education across LA County.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  The Modern Band Los Angeles County project will dramatically expand access to
  culturally relevant music education in LA County. LKR currently serves over
  17,000 students in 175 classrooms across the county. During the 2020-2021
  school year, with support of My LA2050, LKR will:

  - Train and equip 20 new modern band teachers who’ll each launch new programs
  at their schools

  - Serve 3,000 additional students (helping us reach 20,000+ total students
  county-wide)

  - Provide 250+ hours of teacher training and professional development

  - Provide over 700,000 hours of student instructional time


  To measure the program’s impact, LKR will conduct classroom site visits,
  solicit teacher feedback, and require program teachers to complete an annual
  year-end assessment survey gathering feedback on four key markers: Youth
  Development, Youth Musical Development, Teacher Development, and School
  Outcomes.


  Based on historical data, we propose the following student/school outcomes as
  a result of modern band participation: 

  - 80% of students are more likely to express themselves and their emotions 

  - 80% of teachers say the program has engaged students who were not previously
  engaged in school

  - 75% of students say the program makes them want to come to school

  - 75% of teachers say the program has improved the school environment/culture

  - 70% of teachers observe improved behavior among students who had previously
  behaved poorly in class
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '3000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '20000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Ours is an age of unprecedented diversity, but traditional music education
  excludes students who do not recognize themselves or their culture in the
  music being offered in school. By teaching genres like rap, hip hop, Latin and
  R&B, which have been historically excluded from classrooms, modern band gives
  students that feel represented by these genres the means to express themselves
  and be heard, thus radically democratizing music education. Beyond the 20,000
  public-school students who’ll participate directly in a modern band class, our
  data shows that access and exposure to inclusive music education practices
  positively impact the entire school and many modern band programs are a point
  of pride throughout the larger community.
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  While this is not a collaborative proposal, partnerships are at the core of
  all of LKR’s work. We have a strong relationship with LAUSD, which supports
  our introductory workshops, Ambassador-led professional developments, and
  guest artist visits. They have also been supportive of the LA All-City Modern
  Band which was created in 2018, and have incorporated modern band methods into
  Beyond the Bell, their district-wide after-school program. 


  LKR also has a great collaborative relationship with Partnership LA and has
  ensured that all 20 LAUSD schools they oversee have a modern band program. We
  also partner with LA Works, which provides volunteers to assist teachers in
  the classroom. Their volunteers with musical backgrounds work with our LA
  All-City Modern Band students during rehearsals. 
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Access to the LA2050 community
  - Host public events or gatherings
  - 'Office space for meetings, events, or for staff'
