Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  The Startups in the Sky team is launching a first of its kind InTECHrity
  Podcast and Conference series aimed at peeling back the curtain on the
  do-gooders of the tech world. Who are they, you might ask? They are the people
  you very rarely hear about because their work isn't salacious in nature. They
  are the people whose work is quietly focused on your data security, halting
  "dark" business practices, undermining the spread of fake news and the list
  goes on.



   
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  InTECHrity is a collective call to action for all of us to demand a more
  inclusive, equitable digital future, and we're only as strong as our network.
  Startups in the Sky is a node within the Startup Coil network, reaching more
  startup entrepreneurs and small business owners than any other online event
  and media network in the Southern California region. We are ready to come out
  of the digital shadows in order to activate the Los Angeles academic,
  economic, cultural/art, social justice, and civic communities around one of
  our most important topics du jour: our digital futures. 


  Today more than ever, your zip code, your country code, and your social
  capitol determine our digital connectedness. It's time that a group focus on
  ensuring we put an end to the cycle of digital exclusion. It starts with
  InTECHrity - and frankly, we don't yet know where it ends. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  InTECHrity is a people powered event - an amalgamation of digital enthusiasts
  who spend a lot of their mental bandwidth thinking about a safer and more
  inclusive digital environment for Angelenos and the global community more
  broadly. Because of the hyper connectedness of the world, as dictated by the
  internet, Los Angeles has the opportunity to be an anchor for an event that
  has the potential to launch a global movement aimed at amassing an informed,
  empowered populace of people more ready and emboldened to advocate for safer
  policies while holding large tech companies accountable for maintaining
  integrity in their business dealings. 


  Success for InTECHrity is measured by productive knowledge sharing vis a vis
  the coalescence of the academic, software engineering, civic, and social
  justice communities. By bringing these different groups together at the
  InTECHrity Conference each year (and the resulting online work that will
  follow) InTECHrity Conference will lead to working groups and projects aimed
  at minimizing the deleterious effects of a money-first internet model that for
  nearly two decades has forced end users to choose between their data and
  privacy, and access to the most ubiquitous utility known to man: the
  internet. 


  We plan to anchor this work in our hometown of Los Angeles, continuing to
  convene the community of "internet do-gooders" in Los Angeles for an annual
  conference. Given the success of many of our other conference series (see: LA
  Tech Happy Hour), our vision is to ensure more people in Los Angeles are
  invited to think more critically about the future of the internet, and to be a
  stand for improving our digital futures. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '800'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '100000'

  We'll offer curated conference topics, including:

  to deploy may include anything listed above, or anything else that the
  InTECHrity Conference inspires that isn't listed above. This means the impact
  can and should vary. From improving diversity in tech, to online accessibility
