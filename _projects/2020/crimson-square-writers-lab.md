title: Crimson Square Writer's Lab
project_summary: >-
  Our Emerging Writer's Lab will provide guidance and development for new and
  diverse playwrights who do not have access to expensive university writer's
  programs. The grant money would go towards instructors fees, room rentals and
  theatre rentals for staged readings of student's original works.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  There is a lack of support for new and diverse voices in theatre. Many
  theatres focus primarily on graduates from higher education or
  collegiate/university writing programs, already established playwrights, and
  prominently named talent. Thus, emerging talent outside that demographic
  struggles to have access to development and performance opportunities. We want
  to creat a program that gives writing development and education to those who
  would normally not have access, financial ability, or opportunity to attend a
  university writing program.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Cheshire Moon is dedicated to using the arts as a force for positive change in
  Southern California. Our longest-running program, Dancescape LA, has provided
  dance and music education to over 6500 students in the LA area. Starting
  Crimson Square Theatre Company in 2019, and Crimson Square Writer's Lab (pilot
  program for 2020) is our expansion into theatre and dramatic arts education.
  With our 16 years of experience, we are confident in our ability to launch
  this program.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Success for the Crimson Square Writer's Lab would be a minimum of 10 new
  writing students per year, receiving education, mentorship, and development
  opportunity, culminating in the production of the multiple original works in
  2021 through Crimson Square Theatre Company. Our goal is to create an ongoing
  writer lab that has the infrastructure to expand into a larger program of up
  to 30 writers in the coming years. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '30'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '1100'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Giving underrepresented voices and emerging talent the opportunity to have
  their work performed on a professional stage, with a broad audience, and
  presenting the general public to original works from unique perspectives, will
  hopefully encourage support and viewership of inclusive theatre by the current
  and next generation. Each of the writers (30) given the opportunity to have
  their work seen will impact the audiences in attendance for the entire run of
  the show(1100). 
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': ''
