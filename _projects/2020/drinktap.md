title: DrinkTap
project_summary: >-
  We are requesting support for the creation of a multi-lingual communications
  campaign to inform and reassure Angeleno’s that their tap water is accessible,
  clean and safe to drink.  On 5/17/20, Mayor Garcetti said “If you live in the
  city of Los Angeles, Department of Water and Power water is, ... is actually
  cleaner than bottled water and is clean today.” Due to years of beverage
  company marketing campaigns, Angeleno’s have come to fear their drinking
  water. Repeated education and information is necessary to change these
  perceptions.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Applying a proven model or solution to a new issue or sector (e.g, using a job
  recruiting software or strategy to match clients to supportive housing sites,
  applying demonstrated strategies from advocating for college affordability to
  advocating for housing affordability and homelessness, etc.)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Our efforts for a new campaign called #DrinkTap, which creates a new mindset
  around LA's tap water, began in response to our 2019 program called
  #LAGREENTEEN. This began at LA High School, to teach environmental
  sustainability and using social media as the driver for change. Our goal was
  to reduce single-use plastics among students due to costs and environmental
  impact. However, we learned that students were encouraged to purchase plastic
  water bottles for drinking water, which many could not afford, because, while
  the available tap water was good, the water fountains making the water
  available were old and dilapidated and therefore unfit to provide water to the
  school. 

  We worked with the school to create a social media campaign to upgrade the
  water fountains allowing students to access LA's clean water resource backed
  by LADWP. Through this project, we learned that LADWP has been unsuccessful in
  communicating the quality of LA's tap water, especially among non-English
  speakers. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  We found, after successfully spearheading the first ever plastic straw &
  cutlery ban in the City of Malibu and partnering with UberEats and Postmates
  to change their default settings for plastic utensils to opt in rather than
  opt out that impactful changes can be made at the individual and societal
  level. The key is trusted information and alternative solutions.  

  Now we are tackling the massive plastic water bottle problem. Through our
  research with doctors and LADWP we know that our tap water is safe, clean, and
  accessible. However, the marketing prowess of plastic water bottle companies
  have us drinking and discarding 1 million plastic bottles per minute, and 91%
  are not recycled. Instead, they make their way into the environment, killing
  sea life or degrading into microplastics, which we then ingest. 

  “Few things are more basic and important to all of us than good, clean water.
  So many of us take for granted the easy access to such a basic necessity.” –

Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  Our communications campaign goal, targeted to Angeleno's, is to educate the
  community about their rights to information about their drinking water as well
  as inform them of its quality and accessibility. We want to reassure
  Angeleno's that they do not need to spend their money on bottled water and can
  rely on their tap water to be safe and clean.  


  We believe that a truthful, authentic communications campaign that informs
  Angeleno's of the facts is the necessary first step to undo decades of
  misinformation that our communities have gotten from the multi-billion-dollar
  water bottle industry. 


  The campaign message will be delivered through local targeted efforts such as
  neighborhood billboards and posters as well as social media, earned media and
  video content PSA's. The bi-lingual campaign will include easy to understand
  information and a hashtag to inspire sharing. 


  We will measure success of the campaign through a variety of pre and post
  audits and surveys.  


  Bottle Water Purchases Audit - we will select 250-300 Angeleno's as a
  representative sample for the larger group of 780,000 Angeleno's living below
  the poverty line for an online survey pre and post campaign. 


  Supermarket Audit - we will target several supermarkets with high populations
  of residents living below the poverty line to understand sales of bottled
  water pre and post campaign. 


  Los Angeles Waste Haulers Audit – The City of Los Angeles continually
  communicates the quantity of plastic water bottles that are discarded per
  year. 


  Social Media Metrics - we will track the campaign hashtag for likes and shares
  throughout the campaign.  
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '100000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '780000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  The broad impact of this campaign is environmental betterment that comes from
  decreasing plastic bottle usage/waste. 


  Globally, plastic water bottle production requires more than 17 million
  barrels of oil annually.  


  Americans used about 50 billion plastic water bottles last year. The U.S.’s
  recycling rate for plastic is only 9 percent (and declining), which means over
  40 billion water bottles are thrown away each year. Plastic only starts to
  degrade after 700 years, so all the plastic that has ever been produced has
  not degraded yet. Also, plastic doesn’t biodegrade, it photo-degrades,
  meaning, it breaks down into smaller toxic micro particles, which contaminate
  and bleed into the environment, which we later ingest in our food and water.
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  While not a collaborative proposal, we will be working closely with LADWP who
  has expressed great appreciation for our #DrinkTap campaign. They have been a
  partner in this mission to help Angeleno's not waste hard-earned dollars on
  plastic water bottles and they are ready to provide all facts and figures
  needed to create the city-wide campaign promoting our clean tap water.
