title: Get Out From Under The Table Payroll
project_summary: >-
  Create a website and app to educate the public on how to pay household
  worker/nanny tax including: how to sign up, what are the costs, payroll
  calculations, and education on the importance of paying taxes for workers and
  what those workers do not receive if they are paid under the table.Along with
  this we will have set up a "LA Tour" of live educational sessions at local
  schools to reach those who are currently not adhering to the law or are
  thinking of hiring a household worker. We'll show them how easy and
  inexpensive it is to follow the law.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Applying a proven model or solution to a new issue or sector (e.g, using a job
  recruiting software or strategy to match clients to supportive housing sites,
  applying demonstrated strategies from advocating for college affordability to
  advocating for housing affordability and homelessness, etc.)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  I am always surprised and dismayed at the number of people I know who pay
  their household workers under the table.  Not only are they breaking the law,
  but they are denying people the safe guards of unemployment insurance, holding
  them back from being tax paying members of our community and really creating a
  segregation of our community. I also find that these same people are not
  educated on the ease of paying payroll taxes and how little it really costs. I
  feel education can go a long way to solving this problem.  Many people say
  that household workers don't want to pay taxes, and I believe this is not
  true.  Everyone wants to feel a part of the community.  No one wants to be
  hidden under a table and have the fear of being found out.  This is
  unfortunately just another way that the haves are keeping the have-nots down.
  We can help fix this problem and create inclusivity and community.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  It is important to my organization because community is a an important value
  and part of the mission of our organization and this project would help build
  and bring community together.  We are uniquely suited to take this on because
  we are leaders in the community and have a voice people respond to.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  We will define and measure success for the project by the number of people who
  use the application/website and actually register to pay payroll taxes for
  household workers. Success for me would be a wave of new registrations and a
  word of mouth referrals to the application and of course more taxes being paid
  to workers.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '100000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '10000000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  The impact of this app and accompanying educational tour will impact the city
  in many ways including increased revenue for the city and less manpower for
  tracking law breakers assuming the city does this.  But more importantly, it
  will assure that household workers are afforded the same protections as other
  workers, give them a sense of being a part of a community as they are given
  the opportunity to pay their taxes, and foster a sense of equality, and
  inclusivity between employer and household worker.
