title: Version One App Accelerator
project_summary: >-
  Born out of the Startup Coil MVP program and in partnership with V ONE Inc,
  the Version One Accelerator helps small business owners and aspiring startup
  entrepreneurs launch native mobile apps.


  With the help of LA2050, the App Accelerator can offer scholarships to local
  entrepreneurs so they can take some of the difficult first steps toward
  success without needing to risk thousands of dollars on software developer
  costs. They will each emerge from the program with a fully functional mobile
  app and the business skills to keep making progress.

  mall business owners and aspiring entrepreneurs, though facing myriad

  We have built a program to rapidly move their projects forward which also
  guides them in best practices for building a sustainable product.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  After building the largest startup networking community in Los Angeles,
  feedback from our community members has made it clear that these are the

  business owners.


  Our scope and experience, over 8+ years, has led us to this solution: The
  Version One App Accelerator.

  Our vision of success is to yield at least 50 fully launched mobile software

  L.A. can and will be the city of the future, and that starts by keeping our
  innovators here and giving them a chance to succeed.
