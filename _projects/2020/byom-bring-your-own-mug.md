title: BYOM - Bring Your Own Mug
project_summary: >-
  Novus Think Tank is seeking support for a community-based living and food
  insecurity project called BYOM (Bring Your Own Mug). Visitors are encouraged
  to bring their own mugs to enjoy a coffee, and volunteer in our community
  garden in exchange for discounted produce or rent subsidization. Visitors are
  also invited to engage in BYOM's online community, where access to healthy
  recipe videos and forums can be found.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - South LA
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Research (initial work to identify and understand the problem)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >
  We are social creatures and what makes us human are our communities.
  Throughout human history our homes, cultures, and cities have reflected this.
  However, with the increasing prioritization of efficiency and profit, we have
  stepped away from community-oriented living. Our cities have become funneled
  to a single purpose: to buy, to shop, and to transport. Absent from this
  approach is genuine human connection. To buy is to trade, to shop is to
  connect, and to walk in a city is to enjoy the complexity of the space. To
  address this increasing disconnection from place and food around us, we have
  created BYOM: a garden, a coffee shop, a zero waste grocery store, and most
  importantly, a community.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >
  Novus Think Tank is an organization that relies on self-agency and intrinsic
  motivation to tackle a wide variety of issues. We use a committee model to
  tackle seven different social causes: sustainability, narrative insights,
  Internet, political polarization, philanthropy, education, and mental health.
  We seek to use interdisciplinary approaches to solve problems—this means we
  don’t only think about the environmental benefits of a community garden, we
  also consider the unique stories that members of the community form, and where
  their needs may be lacking in terms of housing and education. Our focus is
  always at the root cause of these issues, and thus the events and material we
  create reflect that. Through our work in social change, we are active
  community members ourselves, which gives us a unique, insider perspective on
  not only what the community may need, but how to best implement an idea in
  ways that the community will respond well to, and how to tackle the root
  issues.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  We will measure impact in terms of families served. We know that in our first
  year, reaching people will be difficult due to the fact that the garden needs
  to be planted and established before we can begin to provide discounted
  produce. Furthermore, in order to provide rent subsidization for garden
  volunteers, we first need to form trusting relationships with owners of
  low-income housing developments in South Central Los Angeles. Therefore, our
  goal for the first year of BYOM is to reach 100 families, at least 10 of those
  being through our rent subsidy program. We will pay landlords to develop
  remnant land within their complexes into community gardens in which residents
  can contribute volunteer hours, for which they will receive compensation
  directly to their rent payment portal. BYOM will be able to earn profits
  through the rent subsidy program by hosting farmers markets directly out of
  the garden, where produce will be sold at slightly above cost. In years
  beyond, we hope to increase the number of families reached by 20 percent each
  year, with a proportionate amount being through the rent subsidy program.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '500'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '1000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >+
  BYOM is intended to tie people to their foods through multiple different
  mediums, both in a physical space and online. BYOM gardens will fill remnant
  land spaces in Los Angeles, not only creating a physical community, but
  reducing carbon footprint and increasing pervious surface cover in areas which
  are the most polluted and in need. Many low-income communities in LA are
  minority-inhabited, and disproportionately polluted. Therefore, it is
  important to tackle sustainable consumption and development through a
  democratic, community-scale project so that all residents feel they are
  stakeholders. BYOM not only fights food deserts and food waste, but encourages
  the community to bond with and learn from one another.
