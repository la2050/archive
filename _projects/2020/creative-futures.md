Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CREATE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  We're responding to a broken system. A system that punishes poor people for
  getting sick, not being college educated or being system impacted. Apart from
  the obvious wealth gap, there is also an opportunity gap and it's this
  opportunity gap that we are bridging.


  We believe that there is a ton of creative & diverse talent that is being
  ignored because they weren't born into the right families, neighborhoods or
  went to the right schools. 


  Our program is about identifying and supporting this talent, providing the
  opportunity and then having our Fellows pay it forward by providing future
  opportunities to others in their communities.


  This isn't just about jobs, we are getting people careers and we're focussed
  on the creative industries because it gets more diverse voices in the room.


  We are also helping companies providing them with diverse talent that adds
  value by helping them capture new markets, engage new employees and out
  perform their counterparts.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  We're a 3 person founding team and none of us went to college or university.
  The fact that creative industry companies say that you need a 4 year college
  degree to apply is a form of discrimination, that leaves out a large portion
  of the population but especially from underserved communities.


  Myself, I'm born and raised in Australia to an immigrant Indonesian father and
  white Australian mother. My father never earned over 50k per year, so we
  didn't grow up with money or connections, but at 16 I started a record label
  with $500 and sold it to EMI when I was 24 - I know that you don't need a 4
  year college degree and 6 figures of student debt to become a marketing
  coordinator at Sony Music. 


  Yahniie is a system impacted African American Woman, born and raised in LA,
  grew up in foster care system, formerly incarcerated and was a teenage mother.
  She's incredibly bright, creative and resilient with over 5 years working in
  non profits and her lived experience is invaluable to our mission.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Success for our project is measured in a few ways, one is how many people we
  successfully take through the program, finishing both the 12 weeks of
  workshops and the 4-week paid internship. 


  Secondly, how many people we help find full time employment after they
  graduate from our program. Right now 70% of our Fellows have full time
  employment.


  Thirdly, from an economic point of view we estimate that every person that
  goes through the program and gets a full time job contributes $30,000 back per
  year into the economy (roughly it costs the government $20k per year for every
  person living below the poverty line, and a person earning 50k per year pays
  roughly 10k in taxes). 


  Last year one of our Fellows, Francine, was living in a homeless shelter with
  her 11 year old daughter when she joined our program, did her internship at
  the World Surf League and day after she graduated they hired her full time.
  She now is an associate content producer, telling stories of diversity through
  surfing.


  Yahniie, another one of our Fellows, joined us as non profit partnerships
  manager after she graduated and this year we officially brought her on as a
  co-founder, equity partner and director of partnerships.


  The future for us is building out an online version of our curriculum so that
  we can scale our program to cities all across the globe and provide
  opportunities to those that traditionally have access to them.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '120'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '240'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  The way we find our talent is through our non profit partnerships listed in
  Question 10. However we have found that a majority of our Fellows are people
  of color, low income, single mothers and have been system impacted.


  We will take 20 Fellows through our two in-person cohorts and 100 people
  online.


  Example:We started this program as a pilot in 2017, with Michel'ei who had
  just been released from prison and was living with A New Way Of Life. She
  wanted to be a chef, we set up a 4 week paid traineeship with a chef and after
  the 4 weeks she was hired full time. She then used her story to become a
  criminal justice advocate and to inspire other Women and her 3 kids that they
  too could change their life. This is the indirect impact to others.
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  We aren't a collaborative proposal but we are a fiscally sponsored project
  through the Edward Charles Foundation.
