title: WECARE Trauma-Informed Training
project_summary: "This training program provides assessment, training and care for 10 community partner organizations that work with people experiencing trauma but who are not themselves trained in trauma-informed care. Our trainings empower agencies\_to do high-quality, trauma-sensitive work as well as to better understand how to address the impact of secondary trauma on their staff. The session is taught and assessed by clinicians, who then provide therapy for participants who need additional support to manage trauma, in their own lives or for those they serve."

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
  - >-
    LAUSD (please select only if you have a district-wide partnership or
    project)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  We focus on organizations that serve individuals of all ages experiencing
  trauma related to: domestic violence, homelessness, incarceration,
  immigration, poverty. Our outreach shows that many organizations are not
  trained in trauma-informed care. Not only do they need these resources to do
  their work at the highest level, but they also benefit from understanding
  secondary trauma.


  According to the American Counseling Association, caregivers may experience
  secondary trauma as a result of becoming “witnesses to the pain, fear, and
  terror that trauma survivors have endured.” Examples of this abound. One 2012
  study found that over 75% of 300 school staff personnel showed strong signs
  secondary trauma syndrome.


  We recognize that we need to develop support systems for those who work on the
  frontlines if we want our caregivers and organizations to succeed, without
  burnout or harm to themselves.


  Examples of organizations are: education, gang-prevention, probation/reentry,
  social services.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Since 2011, our leadership has provided training and services to over 7,500
  people in more than 50 community-based organizations. 


  We currently have a team of over 30 trauma-informed clinicians that make up
  Los Angeles’ leading specialists in Trauma-Informed/Community Care. Together,
  we have developed this unique program. Many of our specialists have strong
  private practices, but they are also committed to working with at-risk
  communities. They do this by supporting CleanSlate on a near-volunteer basis,
  which enables the funding we seek to go far. 


  We come together to support this program because we know that by sharing our
  specialized training with community members working on the ground, we leverage
  our ability to provide higher-level care to many more people than any us could
  on our own. 


  We can offer these trainings despite the uncertainty created by COVID-19, as
  we have industry approval to do therapy remotely, which we believe is urgently
  needed at these organizations today.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  We will partner with ten organizations at an average of 70 participants. This
  enables 700 people serving our communities to work with a higher level of
  trauma-informed care, as well as with the tools to understand the importance
  of their own self-care as it relates to secondary trauma.


  Our program integrates assessment by: (1) working with the partner
  organization to understand the needs of their clientele in order to develop
  the best program for them; (2) assessing all participants’ emotional state at
  the beginning of the workshop through questionnaires; (3) assessing the impact
  of the workshop upon its completion. 


  We provide this data to the participating organizations for use in program
  assessment, reports to stakeholders, or however an organization may need
  evidence of their understanding of the issues. This is valuable not only to
  the assessment and training requirements of each organization, but also to
  help us improve our programming. We are committed to integrity-focused
  assessment practices, in which we continually assess ourselves to ensure that
  we are improving our work.


  The organizations we work with report improved ability to recognize the signs
  and symptoms of trauma; avoiding re-traumatization; integrating knowledge
  about trauma into policies, procedures, and practices. They also report a
  better understanding of identifying the strengths of their clientele and the
  challenges they face, to tailor service plans to their specific needs.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '700'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '21000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: "Trauma can be passed down through generations (ACEs study, Felitti, 1998). Trauma-informed care fosters healing and resilience, thereby mitigating transmission of trauma. Support of frontline community organizations can positively impact generations to come.\n\_\nMany organizations do not have a budget to provide training/support for staff. However, we assert that access to mental health resources must be a right, not a privilege. Programs like this help build towards a world that provides access to mental health care for all. \n\nThe health of the individual impacts the health of the community, just as the health of the community impacts the health of the individual. In this way, we strive to affect change in our society from the inside out."
