title: Improving Educational Outcomes for Foster Youth in LA County
project_summary: >-
  Foster youth face unique obstacles that can disrupt their learning and impact
  their long-term educational success. As such, students in foster care need
  extra educational supports, yet school districts, charter schools, and county
  offices of education are not held accountable for providing the targeted help
  they need to learn and succeed. Children Now will work to increase
  transparency and accountability in Los Angeles County to ensure foster youth
  receive the dedicated supports and services they need to improve their
  educational outcomes.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Research (initial work to identify and understand the problem)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Foster youth face unique challenges that can disrupt their learning. They are
  often chronically absent (i.e. miss 10% or more days of school) due to
  placement changes, school transfers, court hearings, family visits, and
  disproportionate school discipline. The effects of trauma, frequent absences,
  and school changes can cause them to struggle to stay on track. LA County
  foster youth are more likely to perform below grade level than other students
  and have the highest rates of chronic absenteeism (29%), suspensions (11%),
  and expulsions (0.1%). They also have the lowest graduation rate (54%).
  Ultimately, they are not prepared for college and careers. While 93% of foster
  youth want to go to college, only 4% obtain a bachelor’s degree by age 26.


  Foster youth need extra educational supports, yet local educational agencies
  (LEAs), like school districts, charter schools, and county offices of
  education, are not held accountable for providing the targeted help youth need
  to learn and thrive.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Children Now is the only whole-child research, policy development, advocacy,
  communications and network-building organization that covers the full-range of
  children’s issues from prenatal through age 26, including early childhood,
  education, health, trauma and resilience, foster care and youth justice.


  To improve the lives of California children, we must confront the structural
  barriers that stand in the way of children of color and children living in
  poverty being able to reach their full potential. To do that, we must
  transform children’s advocacy. We need to coordinate the voices of the
  thousands of organizations that serve and care about kids along with the
  enormous public support, and use that to push our state and local leaders to
  do what they know is right. Together, we can ensure that every child,
  especially those who are most vulnerable, such as kids living up the foster
  care system, receives the services and supports needed to grow up healthy and
  thrive.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  We envision that our project will increase transparency around the dedicated
  supports and services provided to LA County’s foster youth and lead to greater
  accountability for improving the dire educational outcomes they face. In 2019,
  California changed the template for the Local Control and Accountability Plan
  (LCAP) that LEAs must submit to the state each year detailing how they serve
  their students. The LCAP template now includes instructions that encourage
  LEAs to specifically describe the services and supports they provide to meet
  foster youth’s educational needs. We believe this change will be a critical
  first step to improving the educational outcomes of foster youth by bringing
  to light the targeted educational services and supports provided to foster
  youth and identifying the gaps that must be addressed. 


  For this project, we will measure our success by the following metrics:

  * The number of LEAs in LA County that are educated about the new
  instructions.

  * The number of LEAs in LA County provided technical assistance as they
  complete their 2020-23 LCAPs. 

  * The number of LA County LCAPs analyzed to determine the services and
  supports provided to these highly vulnerable students.

  * The number of LA County stakeholders and policymakers educated about the
  targeted services and supports available to foster youth and any gaps as
  identified through this analysis.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '80'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '15000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  On average, more than 61,000 California children and youth are in foster care
  each year and more than one third of them reside in LA County. When children
  and youth cannot safely remain at home due to abuse or neglect, they enter
  foster care and the state becomes their legal parent. Many children in foster
  care face unique challenges stemming from the complex trauma they have
  experienced and are at greater risk for poor outcomes, including low
  educational attainment and high rates of unemployment and homelessness, among
  others. It is imperative that supports and services are in place to help
  ensure that these vulnerable children and youth find the safety and stability
  they need in order to heal and thrive.
