title: Operation Emancipation
project_summary: >-
  The RightWay Foundation does critical preventative work to end the pipeline
  from foster care to homelessness, unemployment, incarceration, and poverty by
  providing foster youth with mental health services, job training, community
  support, and connections to opportunities in the workforce.  With the economy
  fractured due to COVID-19 and rampant homelessness, the need in Los Angeles
  for employment-focused mental health services for transition-age foster and
  reentry youth is greater than ever.

What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  California houses the largest foster care system in the country, and more than
  38% of foster youth in California live in LA County.  For foster youth exiting
  the system, the statistics are bleak.  In LA County, over 50% of former foster
  youth will be unemployed by age 24.  50% of foster youth will experience
  homelessness within 2-4 years of emancipation.  The unemployment rate of
  former foster youth is rooted in unresolved trauma from the foster care
  system, with the rate of PTSD for former foster youth more than twice that of
  Iraq War Veterans.  50% of foster youth do not graduate from high school, and
  only 3% of foster youth earn a college degree.  


  25% of foster youth will be incarcerated within two years of emancipation. 
  85% of the young women picked up in sex trafficking raids are from the child
  welfare system.  80% of men incarcerated in California have been touched by
  the foster care system. The foster care system, especially for young boys of
  color, is a pipeline to prison. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  In 2011, Franco Vega, a former orphan and probation youth, founded RightWay to
  provide LA County transition-age foster youth with support and training to
  acquire and maintain employment.  Within months, in recognition of the
  unresolved trauma creating barriers to job retention, Franco pioneered
  Operation Emancipation, RightWay’s flagship trauma-informed program to address
  past trauma and support successful employment by integrating mental health
  with employment services for foster youth working toward a stable adulthood. 
  Now in our ninth year, RightWay has served as a lifeline for over 440 foster
  and reentry youth.  RightWay’s effective programs challenge negative outcomes
  and upend statistics. 


  The COVID-19 pandemic is devastating for RightWay youth, with 90% of them
  losing employment. By expanding services, RightWay will ensure that
  transition-age youth have access to the tools and opportunities they need to
  weather hardship and reach toward an enriching, secure life.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  RightWay’s programs counter resistance to mental health treatment with the
  goal of a long-lasting job, building bridges to employers, housing, and
  support that enable youth to cross from a point of trauma and isolation to the
  permanent footing of self-sufficiency and community.  


  Our flagship program, Operation Emancipation, provides trauma-informed mental
  health and employment services, including therapy, job training, financial
  literacy, and employment placement, to transition-age foster youth, ages
  18-26, who are emancipating from the foster care system in LA County.


  Operation Second Chance, RightWay’s program for reentry and crossover youth,
  provides trauma-informed mental health and employment services to youth who
  have been involved with the criminal justice and foster systems and have
  difficulty acquiring gainful employment due to their criminal background.  In
  the current climate of California’s changing laws regarding criminalization
  and with the increasing number of construction and technology job
  opportunities in Los Angeles, there is no better time to focus on career-path
  training for formerly incarcerated youth.  


  RightWay’s pilot program, Operation Positive Parenting, aims to stop the
  foster care cycle for foster youth who risk losing their children to the very
  system that failed them.  The program provides individualized parenting
  support, employment services, and mental health services to help young parents
  connect with their children through empathy and build a nonviolent, nurturing
  environment.


  RightWay's central goals are to increase social capital, increase work
  readiness, employment, and job retention rates, and increase access to mental
  health services and overall emotional wellbeing for transition-age foster and
  reentry youth.  Our anticipated outcomes are to see 100% of youth reporting an
  increase in social support and decrease in social isolation, a minimum of 80%
  of program participants securing and retaining employment, and a minimum of
  70% of participants receiving individual therapy reporting progress toward
  identified treatment goals and decreases in symptoms and behaviors related to
  their mental health diagnoses.


  We measure outcomes by administering pre and post surveys during the intake
  process, the 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month periods, by collecting employment
  verification and paycheck stubs, and by evaluating a client’s self-reporting
  during clinical sessions.  
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '125'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '500'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Through our core programs, RightWay serves foster youth and reentry youth,
  ages 18-26, from all over LA County, some referred by judges or the Department
  of Children and Family Services and some who find us through other youth. Of
  the youth RightWay serves, 90% are African-American; 9% are Latino. RightWay
  works to counter both economic and racial inequality for our youth. In our
  wider outreach and workshops, RightWay has served over 2500 foster youth and
  reentry youth with employment readiness, hiring services, and financial
  literacy classes. Our employment partners benefit from our Trauma-informed
  Employer Training. 


  We seek to end the cycle of trauma that leads our youth to homelessness,
  incarceration, unemployment, and poverty.
