What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  211 LA maintains a homeless services website that is available for LA County
  service providers seeking information, resources, and support for their
  homeless clients. Currently, only services and programs that are
  well-established and provide static resources are posted on the homeless
  services website. 


  With the significant increase of individuals and families experiencing
  homelessness in LA County, there is a growing need to quickly and efficiently
  assist homeless individuals access needed services including food, shelter,
  and other basic needs. This need is often stifled by the challenge of sharing
  timely information on fast-moving resources and lack of coordination. This has
  created the high need for a real-time Homeless Resource Portal with a
  “bulletin board” feature to help homeless service providers obtain real-time,
  accurate, and timely information on homeless services and resource currently
  available; e.g. shelter, showers, nutritious meals, hygiene products, etc. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Since 1981, 211 LA has provided supportive services to homeless individuals
  living in LA County and maintains a homeless services website that is utilized
  by hundreds of LA County homeless service providers seeking information,
  resources, and support for their homeless clients. 


  The 211 LA team handles approximately 100,000 housing-related contacts every
  year, maintains a resource database of about 40,000 services, attends hundreds
  of resource fairs and community events, and has supported LA County’s
  Coordinated Entry System for Homeless Families by providing emergency
  shelter/motel vouchers since 2008.  211 LA’s experience has given them years
  of quantitative and qualitative data on issues related to homelessness and
  best practice strategies for supporting individuals and families experiencing
  homelessness. In addition, 211 LA has its own in-house technology develop team
  who maintains and upgrades all existing 211 systems on a daily basis.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Upon development of the LA Homeless Resource Portal, success will be measure
  by the increased access and utilization of the portal by the following user:

  1. Number of individuals and families experiencing homelessness seeking
  accurate information and resources with the intent of finding the help they
  need quickly and effortlessly, and providing feedback on user
  experience/service quality when accessing services.

  2. Number of Homeless Service Providers who review and update their services
  and resource availability in real-time. Providers will have the ability to
  review the services they provide. Including but not limited to: Tracking
  resource availability/utilization in real time, creating ‘pop-up’ or mobile
  services, managing and calendaring events

  3. Number of individuals from the general public who are seeking ways to
  contribute to the overall cause of supporting homeless individuals in LA by:
  a) providing donations (funds, supplies, materials), b) volunteering, and/or
  c) providing support and advocacy for someone experiencing homelessness.


  In addition to data on access and utilization of the Homeless Resource Portal,
  211 LA will measure success based on the usability of the portal.  This is to
  ensure target users (homeless service providers, homeless individuals, and
  general public wanting to get involved) find the tool to be user-centric with
  accurate service data with minimal interruptions to their day-to-day roles. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '100'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '10000'

  issues related to homelessness and factors that contribute to the increase in

  communication tool that will all service providers to request and share
  resources needed for homeless individuals and families they serve. This
