title: Big City Lab
project_summary: >
  With the support of LA 2050 Big City Forum proposes to expand Big City Lab: a
  social practice and design education initiative founded by artist and educator
  Leonardo Bravo. The focus for Big City Lab is the urban environment as a site
  for meaning making and building critical thinking skills and social
  responsibility for students. We will partner with four schools within the
  Camino Nuevo Charter Academy campuses in the greater MacArthur Park area to
  impact their middle and high school students enrolled in the Ethnic Studies 4
  All program.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >+
  Through this yearlong arts education project, students from low-income
  communities in the Camino Nuevo Charter Academy network come together to
  explore their history, social conditions, neighborhoods, and storylines. 

  CNCA facts:

  95% are Latino

  96% are eligible for free or reduced-priced lunch, based on their family
  incomes

  79% enter school as English language learners 

  12% receive special education services 


  Big City Lab aims to reinforce CNCA's efforts to meet the needs of its student
  population through the promotion of literacy for their students. Experience
  with design, art, and socially engaged art practices—though not typically
  considered foundational to strengthen literacy—is a vital missing link for
  youth learners to engage and foster literacy skills. Through their direct
  engagement with design and art students develop the visual, auditory and
  kinesthetic skills key to fostering the “21st century skills” of
  collaboration, creativity, critical thinking, and communication.

Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  In 2016 we received a grant from the SPArt Foundation to pilot Big City Lab at
  Camino Nuevo Miramar High School in the MacArthur Park neighborhood. Through
  Big City Lab students explored the history, story lines, and social conditions
  embedded in their communities by examining issues related to identity,
  storytelling, social justice, and public space. By working with professionals
  in the areas of urban planing and design, photo journalism, and creative
  writing students were able to use tools in these disciplines to develop an
  entire research methodology that allowed them to understand how these issues
  impact their own communities and began to shape their own perspectives to
  build a sense of how they can impact change. Most importantly the project
  allowed the students to develop their own critical thinking about these issues
  by putting forth strategies in which they could express their own
  perspectives. The goal is to replicate the program with far more students
  across CNCA schools.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >+
  My vision for success for Big City Lab is based on bringing youth together who
  learn to think critically and express their thoughts and opinions on relevant
  issues about their own lives. Within every aspect of the program we strive to
  create a space, free of judgement, where questioning and challenging assumed
  notions, creating dialogue, and using creativity as a tool is highly valued
  and encouraged.


  Some of the most valuable feedback from the initial Big City Lab pilot in 2016
  was the students' comments regarding a sense of community in the cohort and
  being able to express themselves openly and freely. Upon culmination of the
  program, many youth expressed that they had found their voice and felt like
  they have the abilities and the power to make real change in their
  communities. 


  From a more quantitative perspective Big City Lab will track program success
  during the grant period through observation and by administering pre and
  post-program evaluations to all student participants. This will help assess
  their prior knowledge and compare how students felt at the beginning of the
  program to how they felt and what they learned by the conclusion of the
  program.


  We will also know that the program has been successful when staff and
  facilitator observations and student evaluations reflect improvement in how
  students feel about their confidence levels, leadership skills, and
  interpersonal relationships with their peers and instructors, their ability to
  make an impact on their community, their overall understanding of activism and
  the various art forms that were taught. We will also track program retention
  rates as a measure of success.


  In addition, while college readiness is not a formal part of the program, I
  believe that the overall program helps equip young people with the skills
  necessary for college success and offering access to a creative learning
  environment where they can envision themselves thriving.


  A final outcome, extending into the future, is that Big City Lab aims to
  foster the establishment of a signature program that allows Camino Nuevo
  Charter Academy schools to conduct community outreach and identify prospective
  middle and high school students in the community. Big City Lab thus can
  support their academic goals and provide greater opportunity for long-term
  success. Furthermore, Big City Lab becomes a testing ground to study how, and
  the ways in which, students can cultivate the development of transferable life
  skills such as critical thinking, problem solving, leadership, and
  collaboration.

Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '360'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '600'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >+
  By focusing on the arts as a catalyst for change and growth, Big City Lab aims
  to reach out and bring together underserved youth by providing students with
  opportunities to learn and collaborate with professional artists, designers,
  writers, and activists. Youth from low-income, underserved populations are in
  environments that are limiting in many aspects, and fails to recognize or
  activate students’ full potential. Exposing them to paths of possibility and
  potential gives students the opportunity to know what they can achieve. Big
  City Lab develops bridges to community, helping students shape a vision for
  their neighborhoods in the short term, while aiming to develop a sustained,
  equitable vision for transformative social change.
