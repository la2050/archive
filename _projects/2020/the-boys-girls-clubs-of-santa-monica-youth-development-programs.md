In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Our young people benefit social-emotionally, academically, behaviorally, and
  physically through our supportive and caring outcomes-based program design.
  Our goal is for our kids to tackle their dilemmas and use them to become
  competent and compassionate leaders. Many of the youth we serve are facing
  multiple socio-economic barriers that make it nearly impossible to get ahead
  in life. Youth are more likely to engage in risky behaviors and crime when
  unsupervised during the hours outside of school. Studies indicate that these
  factors amongst others influence a person’s health and wellbeing. Both
  environmental and emotional circumstances contribute to whether a young person
  will be prepared to graduate high school, advance to higher education, and
  successfully transition into a thriving-wage career.  
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  BGCSM’s four-pillar program model integrates overall holistic wellbeing and
  growth in our youth, while further focusing on targeting services for our most
  at-risk youth in the community. We provide a well-rounded approach toward
  youth development that utilizes prevention and intervention with academic,
  physical, and social-emotional support to help youth achieve overall success
  and wellbeing in life. Program activities include academic support,
  leadership, financial awareness, career exploration, social-emotional
  wellbeing, sports, performing arts, technology, STEM, mentorships, college
  preparation, civic engagement, and other enrichment activities. Additionally,
  we utilize research-based, high-quality training in our staff development,
  which allows us to continually  evaluate our program implementation and youth
  engagement practices to improve. Through this, we can create a safe and
  supportive environment that fosters growth and resiliency while building
  confidence in our youth.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  We define success through our youth achieving positive outcomes for overall
  wellbeing and success in life, and to become competent, effective leaders in
  their communities. Our vision for success lies in our four outcomes for youth.
  We want our youth to: 
   
  1) be socially/emotionally healthy with competencies such as adaptability,
  resilience, emotional regulation, interpersonal communication skills,
  confidence and self-efficacy   
   
  2) feel ready to be successful in 21st Century Education and Career
  Pathways   
   
  3) strive for and practice healthy habits such as healthy eating and regular
  physical activity, financial responsibility and empowerment   
   
  4) be actively engaged in, and committed to, community and service
  leadership.
