title: 'Turnaround Arts: CA Los Angeles School Partnerships'
project_summary: >-
  We will support 9 high-need elementary and middle schools in LA County, using
  the arts to support whole school change. We will act as a thought partner to
  each school, offering financial, strategic planning, and implementation
  support to principals and teachers. This includes regularly convening our
  school and community arts partners for professional development and to
  exchange best practices. Through the arts, we will empower schools to build
  equity and lead for change, improve culture and climate, and increase student
  and family engagement.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  There is a large opportunity gap in our schools, with students from affluent
  communities significantly outperforming their less affluent peers. Studies
  consistently show a strong connection between arts education and positive
  outcomes, yet students who need art the most are getting it the least. 6
  million children in this country - nearly all of who live in poverty - have no
  access to the arts in school. We support schools by adding the arts as a key
  strategy for building equity and as an intervention to chronic
  underperformance. Our partner schools are considered state and federal
  “priority” schools, in the lowest 5-10% of achievement in the state. 
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  TACA’s innovative partnership model allows us to have a broader and deeper
  impact through collaboration. By nurturing partnerships at the national,
  state, district, and community levels, the students we reach benefit from the
  shared expertise and best practices that are continuously being developed by
  those who understand the unique needs of each school community best. Our
  approach relies on eight key pillars: 1) principal leadership, 2) the
  strategic use of arts specialists, 3) non-arts classroom teachers integrating
  arts into core content, 4) the use of teaching artists and community
  organizations, 5) the engagement of the district, parents, and community, 6)
  strategic arts planning, 7) professional development, and 8) improvements to
  the school environment. By leveraging support in these key areas, we ensure
  the arts are well supported, resourced, and sustainable within the schools
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Throughout the year we gather quantitative and qualitative data to measure
  improvement and success in 4 key areas: 

  - Development of shared vision and collaborative leadership in and through the
  arts. We work with our schools to develop a school-wide strategic arts plan,
  outlining goals for bringing their shared vision to life. 

  - Improved teacher capacity to integrate arts into classroom instruction,
  providing multiple, culturally responsive entry points for learning. 

  - Improved school culture and climate that, through strategic use of the arts,
  embraces an equity and growth mindset, supports risk-taking, collaboration and
  empathy, and honors student voices. 

  - Increased family and community engagement that builds advocates, volunteers,
  and equitable partners in our students’ learning through arts-based
  strategies.

  - We also anticipate continuing to see macro level improvement at our partner
  schools within english language arts and math proficiency rates, along with
  suspension rates decreasing. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '299'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '6000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Schools in need of improvement often have principals and teachers that aren’t
  equipped, nor empowered, to lead for change. We directly serve 299 teachers
  and principals in LA County by building their capacity to integrate the arts
  into all facets of the school and across subject matter. TACA’s deep focus on
  building equity and culturally responsive teaching practices through the arts,
  indirectly benefits 6,000 students. We aim to create learning environments
  responsive to the varying needs of students in high-need communities.
  Additionally, many of the future jobs young people will have are yet to be
  created. We are helping to mold creative, innovative thinkers who will be
  better prepared for an ever-changing job market and economy.
