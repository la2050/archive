  An Inclusive, Next-Gen Digital Career Navigation Hub for LA’s Green Jobs
  (Presented by Gladeo and LACI)
project_summary: >-
  Our project is to partner with the Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator (LACI) to
  build out a “Green Careers in Los Angeles” section for Gladeo’s existing free,
  online, youth-friendly career exploration platform, which is already being
  used by thousands of learners in LA. This new microsite will serve as both a
  “Virtual Career Day” as well as a digital information hub for “green career”
  pathway information, educational and training program finder, and job
  recruiting portal for opportunities in one of the fastest-growing industries
  in Los Angeles.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Applying a proven model or solution to a new issue or sector (e.g, using a job
  recruiting software or strategy to match clients to supportive housing sites,
  applying demonstrated strategies from advocating for college affordability to
  advocating for housing affordability and homelessness, etc.)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Data shows that the major barriers to fulfilling the promise of green jobs are
  not lack of training programs or skilled workforce, but rather a time-delay
  skills mismatch (i.e., a rapidly changing industry’s workforce needs outpacing
  program development and recruitment timelines) primarily due to the lack of
  connection between quality career training programs with employers who will
  eventually hire trainees. Leveraging its unique assets as a nonprofit
  cleantech incubator, LACI closes the loop in workforce development for the
  burgeoning green economy by providing continuity from identification of
  real-world demand for workforce skills to training and job placement. Together
  with LACI, Gladeo’s new learner-facing microsite for “Green Careers in Los
  Angeles” will serve as a valuable platform for communicating timely,
  industry-vetted information directly with learners in a way that’s
  cost-effective, sustainable, and adaptable to the long-term needs of a
  continuously changing industry.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Our project possesses significant cost effectiveness and outsized impact
  potential because it leverages Gladeo’s existing career exploration platform
  (www.gladeo.org), an existing user base, and an extensive library of career
  content which highlights the broad spectrum of career pathways and diverse
  professionals in Los Angeles. Our team is experienced in tech product
  development, human-centered UX design, and video and digital content. Our team
  is also experienced engaging with stakeholders across the public and private
  sectors including employers, trade unions, K-14 education, workforce training,
  and government career centers. Together with the team at LACI and our combined
  working relationships with Los Angeles-based K-14 school districts, workforce
  career centers, and job training programs like Job Corps, we will achieve
  system-wide distribution of our free resource across the LA region, ensuring
  that we reach our target audience efficiently and effectively.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Outcome #1 (Awareness): To expand career awareness for low-income and
  first-generation students to “green career” paths in the LA region.

  Outputs: # of new visitors/subscribers, # of video views, # of Spotlight
  interviews read, # of Career Profiles read, Time on Site, # of Career and
  Industry follows

  Outcomes: (through online user surveys)

  Short-Term: Did Gladeo introduce you to a green career path you previously had
  little or no knowledge about? Did Gladeo help you decide to pursue a green
  career?


  Outcome #2 (Training): To expand access to quality information about green
  careers and skills. To increase enrollment in employer-vetted local community
  college programs, workforce training programs, and apprenticeships.

  Outputs: # of Click Thrus (and Conversions when trackable) to educational
  programs, CTE programs, meetup events, internship/job postings, apprenticeship
  programs, online courses. (We will also gather 2nd party data from our
  partners)

  Outcomes:

  Did Gladeo help you learn about what education or training you needed to
  pursue your green career? If yes, have you enrolled in an education or
  training program? Which one?


  Outcome #3 (Employment): To increase job placement rate of newly-trained
  entry-level workers.

  Outputs: # of Click Thrus to internship/job postings, apprenticeships.

  Outcomes: (Through Gladeo user surveys, profile updates, and program reviews)

  Short-Term: Upon completion (or within 6 months) of your training program, did
  you gain employment in a green job that you otherwise would not have been
  qualified for? 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '75000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '500000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Our project will help fulfill the promise that “green jobs” will rebuild the
  stock of solid middle-class jobs in America. Our regional microsite “Green
  Careers in Los Angeles” will serve as a model for future regional green job
  microsites across the U.S., as well as for other industries facing similar
  kinds of workforce challenges.


  With inclusivity at the core of our design and distribution principles, our
  project will ensure that low-income and underrepresented learners have
  equitable access to and the best chance of success in green career paths.
  Entering the workforce with a level of job readiness will reduce attrition and
  increase job performance, which thereby contributes to productivity,
  efficiency and economic growth.
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  A major barrier to fulfilling the promise of green jobs is the ability to link
  quality career training and placement programs directly with job
  opportunities. LACI ( https://laincubator.org/apcfellowship/) closes the loop
  in workforce development for the burgeoning green economy by providing
  continuity from identification of real-world demand for skills to training and
  job placement by connecting graduates of its workforce development programs
  directly with portfolio companies. They will:


  1. Create a list of green career pathways

  2. Connect us to employers who will allow us to interview employees for career
  videos, spotlights and profiles

  3. Create a list of reputable educational / training programs that LACI
  recommends for each career pathway

  4. Fact Check our career profile content
