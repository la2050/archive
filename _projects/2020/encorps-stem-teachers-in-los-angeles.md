title: EnCorps STEM Teachers in Los Angeles
project_summary: >-
  EnCorps has been working earnestly since 2007 to recruit the best and
  brightest science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)
  professionals to teach in California, providing meaningful opportunities to
  impact disadvantaged students. We believe all students deserve access to a
  great STEM teacher, a great STEM education and all the opportunities that
  those can provide. EnCorps educators are connecting students to real-world
  math and science career and economic opportunities and transforming public
  education statewide.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LEARN
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - San Gabriel Valley
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South LA
  - South Bay
  - >-
    LAUSD (please select only if you have a district-wide partnership or
    project)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Enduring STEM achievement, access and opportunity gaps continue to
  disproportionately limit low-income and minority student opportunities In Los
  Angeles. Access to quality STEM education can close these gaps, but Los
  Angeles County has the greatest need statewide for qualified math and science
  teachers. 


  The percentage of underprepared teachers is the most significant predictor of
  low achievement, particularly for students of color, yet districts continue to
  hire under-credentialed teachers. Underprepared teachers have a 2-3 times
  higher turnover rate than fully-credentialed teachers, which has a greater
  disruptive effect on low-income students and students of color, who already
  lag behind their white and Asian peers in math and science proficiency.  The
  STEM teacher shortage exacerbates this achievement gap, and undermines efforts
  to prepare a diverse future workforce with career-relevant STEM education.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >
  EnCorps STEM TEachers is the only nonprofit in California recruiting and
  placing STEM professionals as long-term educators for underrepresented
  students in high-need schools. Fellows bring years of industry experience and
  professional maturity to classrooms, and are career role models for
  disadvantaged students. Our unique program model results in an EnCorps teacher
  5+ year retention rate of 89%, compared to the national average of 50%.


  Many efforts have been made to increase educational equity, decrease the
  teacher shortage, and diversify the future STEM workforce, but no other
  organization tackles all three issues with one cost-effective and long-term
  solution. With experience in the public education and nonprofit sectors, we
  continuously refine support strategies to be responsive to the changing
  demands of teaching and learning.  EnCorps’ leadership has the experience,
  broad knowledge of educational ecosystems, and the commitment to educational
  equity to achieve our mission.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  We define success by the number of trained and supported STEM teachers and
  teacher candidates in our pipeline, their student impact and by the efficacy
  of our educators in the classroom. To measure program successes, we track the
  number of Fellows: recruited, in each phase of teacher preparation, those who
  transition into teaching positions, the number of Teachers retained in their
  positions each year and the number of students that they have taught. Surveys
  measuring the efficacy of Fellows in the classroom are conducted each semester
  with students and mentor teachers.


  Executive and program staff review program implementation quarterly to assess
  status against Key Performance Indicators, which are used to revise and
  evaluate EnCorps’ recruitment strategies, levels of support for Fellows, and
  professional development opportunities as preparation for full-time teaching.
  EnCorps’ steady progress towards closing the gap of qualified STEM teachers,
  and thereby addressing the STEM achievement gap of our state's most
  disadvantaged students, is its ultimate indicator of success.


  The EnCorps Fellowship has seen consistent success year after year, evidenced
  by our growing Fellowship numbers, and by the impact Fellows have on their
  students, as recently reported by their students and Host Teachers:  86% of
  students experienced an increased level of academic achievement and 88% had a
  better understanding of real-world connections with math and science due to
  their EnCorps Guest Teacher.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '300'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '15000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >
  The Fellowship serves middle and high school students, ages 11-18, in Title 1
  schools where over 60% of students are low-income, as defined by qualifying
  for free or reduced-price lunch. 77% of our students are of populations
  traditionally underrepresented in higher education, 16% are English Language
  Learners, and only 30% meet or exceed math proficiency standards.


  On average, Fellows have been employed 17 years in STEM fields, 68% have a
  Masters or Ph.D. in a STEM subject, and 48% report as people of color. EnCorps
  Fellows have experience as engineers, principal research scientists, and data
  architects,; and have worked in energy, engineering, banking and finance,
  research, biotech, and pharmaceutical industries.
