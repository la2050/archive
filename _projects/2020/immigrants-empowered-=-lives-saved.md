title: Immigrants Empowered = Lives Saved
project_summary: >-
  The Covid-19 crisis has exposed what we have known for decades:  millions of
  immigrants and mixed-status families are among the most vulnerable in our
  community.  Although they are essential workers that continue to work in our
  ICUs, drive delivery trucks, and feed us from the farm fields, they are left
  behind in this emergency.  CHIRLA needs support to be a life line for
  immigrants in this crisis.  An LA2050 grant would allow us to advocate for the
  needs of 1 in 4 Angelinos while informing and legally protecting them.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:

    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  As we all face the Coronavirus emergency, there is a truth we can not deny: 
  millions of immigrants and mix-status families are among the most vulnerable
  and overlooked in this crisis.  As COVID-19 continues to take its toll, we
  must protect those most at-risk who are disproportionately affected due to
  lack of healthcare, unemployment relief, and fear of immigration enforcement. 
  Mixed legal status is common in immigrant households, which can hinder
  families from seeking assistance due to fear of losing legal protections or
  putting a family member at-risk. Undocumented immigrants working in sectors
  hard-hit by the crisis may be ineligible for worker supports such as
  disability, unemployment aid, or paid family leave. Those who face language
  barriers, particularly seniors, need multilingual testing and treatment
  information. Meanwhile, immigrants working in essential industries are risking
  their lives, often without adequate healthcare, as they continue to serve the
  community.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Improving the lives of immigrants and their families is at the core of who we
  are.  CHIRLA has been advocating for immigrant rights for 34 years,
  spearheading grassroots organizing and power building initiatives across
  California.  Guided by the vision and needs of our community, we have been
  driving progressive social change for decades.  We were formed in response to
  the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) of 1986 which made hiring
  undocumented workers illegal, thus creating a situation ripe for worker
  exploitation and abuse which continues in this crisis.  Since then, we have
  been on the front lines defending our communities in the face of attacks and
  family separation.  Our advocacy and education at various levels of government
  reaches nationally driving systematic change improving the lives of millions. 
  We have also earned a position as a trusted source of information and support
  proving our communities with timely, in-language information for the critical
  help they need.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  COVID-19 has exposed already existing gaps in our health, economic, and labor
  sectors. It is imperative that CHIRLA continues to lead the way to ensure
  equal justice for immigrants, particularly during this time of crisis. We
  define success by continuing to work to inform, protect, and advocate for
  immigrant communities as: (1) a multilingual information and benefits referral
  hub connecting immigrants to essential services; (2) a trusted source of legal
  advice and protections (3) a policy leader and catalyst for measures and
  critical funding and programs that ensure immigrant and refugee communities
  are included in the emergency response.  Our ultimate goal during this health
  crisis is that lives are saved and that the health of immigrants is valued in
  the same way as those with full citizenship status. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '450000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '10000000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  CHIRLA's work creatively engages and advocates for over 10 million immigrants
  living in California.  Our existing infrastructure of 10 regional offices,
  especially our headquarters in L.A., serve in great part the over 2 million
  undocumented in the state.  We help a majority of the 19% of LA County
  residents that are either undocumented or live with someone who is.  Of those
  individuals, 12% are in occupations hardest-hit such as janitorial and food
  services or in essential roles like farming, production and transportation. 
  Supporting a pillar organization like CHIRLA will have incredible impact on
  saving lives regardless of status, providing safety net resources to sustain
  families, and empowering individuals to recover in the future. 
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >-
  CHIRLA has been around for almost 35 years and has developed an extensive
  network of collaborations and partnerships throughout the years.  Our role as
  a coalition builder statewide and a leader in immigrant rights nationally has
  allowed us to work closely with many powerful groups deep in the movement. 
  Locally our community education and outreach efforts, as well as our
  organizing, advocacy, civic engagement, youth development, and legal work
  connect our strategies with hundreds of public, private, and nonprofit
  entities.  Together we move the needle in supporting our communities by
  partnering on events, local and statewide campaigns, and other initiatives
  impacting the lives of immigrants.  In light of Covid-19 those networks are
  growing, we are in the process of updating our lists.
