title: Connected & Empowered Communities (CEC)
project_summary: >-
  CEC is a virtual digital skills training program for low-income adults and
  seniors. Facilitated by community college students, the virtual training
  program will ensure participants develop the digital literacy skills required
  to access critical services, employment opportunities, and educational
  resources found online. This program will also equip participants with
  affordable internet service and computers to ensure a robust learning
  experience. A virtual and multi-generational program will create new
  opportunities to connect, learn, and grow

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >
  Recently, we’ve observed COVID-19 shed light on the severity of the digital
  divide and also exacerbate it by forcing libraries, schools, and other public
  spaces to close, eliminating the places many low-income people relied on for
  connectivity and learning. Now more than ever we need to ensure all
  communities are connected to the internet, have devices, and develop the
  digital skills needed to participate and thrive in today’s digital society and
  economy. 


  Our proposed program builds off of a digital skills training program that
  reached 80 seniors in the Los Angeles Promise Zone (LAPZ), which prepared
  participants to use a computer, enroll in services, and manage their finances
  online. The need for digital skills training is even greater now. CEC will
  deliver a robust digital skills training in a virtual and multigenerational
  format, with the goal of fostering new social connections, increasing digital
  literacy, and improving internet adoption rates.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  CEC reflects EveryoneOn’s commitment to creating a society where people, in
  particular those who are underserved, harness the power of the internet and
  technology to build transformative opportunities for themselves and their
  communities. To achieve this, we employ a multi-prong approach: we built a
  national platform of low-cost internet offers; we conduct internet adoption
  campaigns in communities; and we implement digital skills trainings that are
  inclusive and deliver measurable impact for participants. 


  Since 2013, we have collaborated with cross-sector organizations throughout
  Los Angeles, including the City of Los Angeles to help launch OurCycleLA and
  the LAPZ to deliver trainings for unconnected and underconnected seniors. The
  latter was supported by the Annenberg Foundation (via our LA2050 application
  submittal) and Capital One. We look forward to building on our collective
  impact approach to curb the digital divide and foster digital equity for
  residents of the LAPZ. 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  Through CEC we aim to create opportunities for adults and seniors to learn how
  and feel empowered to harness the power of the internet and build new social
  connections with each other and younger neighbors (local community college
  students) via live virtual digital skills training sessions. 


  To achieve this vision, we will 1) design and deliver 5 four-week virtual
  digital skills trainings; 2) train a total of 100 adults and seniors with
  limited or no digital skills; 3) enroll unconnected and underconnected
  training participants in a low-cost internet service program and sponsor the
  first month of service; 4) equip all training participants with a computer;
  and 5) utilize a “train-the-trainer” model to prepare up to 5 local community
  college students to deliver the live virtual training sessions. 


  To capture outcomes and measure impact, EveryoneOn will utilize a continuous
  feedback process, via pre and post training surveys, session-specific surveys,
  and interviews. The following will be measured to help assess impact and
  overall success: 


  - Internet adoption 

  - Comfort utilizing the internet and computers

  - Ability to communicate, collaborate, and create on digital platforms

  - Ability to safely navigate the internet and set privacy settings 

  - Awareness and utilization of diverse online platforms, such as job search
  engines, K-12 parent/student portals, and medical portals 

  - Social connectedness 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '105'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '180'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >
  Our efforts will focus in Hollywood, East Hollywood, Pico-Union, Westlake, and
  Wilshire Center (LAPZ communities), where many noncitizens, seniors, and those
  with low educational levels confront poverty, overcrowded housing conditions,
  and lack high-speed internet at home. CEC will engage those who are most
  affected by the digital divide, adults with an annual household income under
  $30,000 and low-income seniors.


  We also look forward to adding to conversations about the development of Los
  Angeles as a smart city. We cannot talk about creating smart cities if
  low-income communities have no or limited internet access and digital skills. 
'If you are submitting a collaborative proposal, please describe the specific role of partner organizations in the project.': >
  While this is not a “collaborative proposal”, EveryoneOn will work with
  organizations that serve the LAPZ and the Office of Los Angeles Mayor Garcetti
  to help identify adults and seniors who can benefit from participating in the
  program. Modest stipends will be provided for their outreach support. In
  addition, we will work with Los Angeles City College to identify students
  interested in delivering the virtual trainings. Student trainers will be
  provided a stipend for their support of the program.  


  The success of our digital skills trainings for 80 seniors in 2018 was in
  large part due to the collective efforts with LAPZ partners. We look forward
  to continuing the collective impact work to foster digital equity in the LAPZ
  and beyond. 
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?:
  - Access to the LA2050 community
  - Communications support
  - 'Capacity, including staff'
  - Strategy assistance and implementation
