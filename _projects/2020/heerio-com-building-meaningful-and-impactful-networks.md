Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CREATE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >
  Networking is Hard. It takes too much time and coordination. When people
  finally decide to network, it is only at mission critical times (i.e. during a
  job search). We want to change that mindset by making networking not just
  essential, but easier. And even encouraging more face to face interactions.

  When people are able to connect with quality people and to build quality
  relationships, this improves both professional and business outcomes,
  especially for under represented groups LGBQT+, African Americans, Hispanics,
  Asians.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Central to our value proposition is connecting people-encouraging people to do
  more face to face interactions (individually or groups). However, our platform
  is not like any generic social networking tool. It's about active networking
  and making that process as seamless as possible. Our platform focuses on
  developing high quality networks based on people you know (phone/email
  contacts) and with whom there is a strong affinity. Those affinities can range
  from race, college or university, social causes, industry and sexual
  orientation. These are a few examples. The platform allows you to see who is
  in your network and their availability(today and the future).  This becomes a
  powerful tool to encourage face to face interactions and to enable
  collaborations in many contexts (local, national and even international). 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  Success of our platform will primarily be measured based on the number of
  daily active users (400K nationally by end of first year with 50% LGBQT+).
  However, our roll out strategy will home in on LGBQT+ community given large
  representation here in California (1M+) and ease of reach in social centers
  like West Hollywood and Castro San Francisco. In conjunction with local
  business partners (e.g. Roccos of West Hollywood, Disney), we will create
  networking/social mixers that will likely provide career, business and network
  development opportunities.This will be a model to replicate across targeted
  groups. So for example, National Hispanic MBAs (Los Angeles) in conjunction
  with a local or national business sponsor could coordinate recruiting mixers
  or schedule interviews in Los Angeles or elsewhere (maybe a national
  convention in Austin). As networks grow organically, companies, community
  based organizations, college groups etc. will be able to develop programs and
  initiatives for targeted affinity groups. This will promote community
  connectivity facilitating personal and professional growth along with
  employment opportunities.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '400000'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '1000000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Networking is the cornerstone for building productive business and personal
  relationships. A platform that enables these connections improves
  collaboration and facilitates more meaningful relationships. Connected people
  can drive ingenuity, creativity and make a world of difference. This will
  allow people to develop personally and professionally, community organizations
  and businesses can thrive. Our minority-owned business will be one of many
  that will make LA an entrepreneurship and technology epicenter. Our app and
  platform will grow organically and exponentially, as every user recommends
  friends and associates in their network. We are estimating a conservative
  reach of 1M users nationally with 400K here in California.
