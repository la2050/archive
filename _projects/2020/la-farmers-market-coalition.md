title: LA Farmers' Market Coalition
project_summary: >-
  We would like to establish a Los Angeles Farmers' Market Coalition. This
  Coalition will unite farmers' markets across LA, both affluent markets and
  those serving in food deserts, facilitating the sharing of information and
  resources. Markets will unite to address challenges to food access, such as
  COVID-19. To create social media campaigns and share program ideas. In times
  of need, markets will respond to issues affecting consumers, farmers and
  markets with one voice and will connect with Neighborhood Councils for greater
  community integration.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to LIVE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - >-
    County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  During the COVID-19 pandemic Governor Newsom listed farmers' markets as
  essential public services and called on markets to remain open. Despite this,
  many markets across Los Angeles were forced, by landlords and local
  municipalities, to shut down. While markets in affluent ares had the resources
  to fight to remain open, many in low-income neighborhoods and food deserts
  were forced to close. Hundreds of Angelenos have been forced during this
  health crisis to choose between risking travel on public transportation, or
  foregoing fruits and vegetables. Had these markets remained open, this would
  not have been the case. 


  There is no coalition, connecting farmers' markets, facilitating
  collaboration, or generating sharable content. Dozens of markets are working
  independently toward the same goals, efforts are being wasted and vulnerable
  populations remain underserved. Similarly, markets are unconnected to their
  Neighborhood Councils, who's work markets should champion and benefit from.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Sprouts of Promise advocates for farmers' markets and works to connect
  underserved populations with healthy food. During the COVID-19 crisis, Sprouts
  of Promise initiated email collaboration between farmers' market managers
  across the region advocating on behalf of markets, and created social media
  content that was widely shared. Through these efforts, Sprouts of Promise
  connected with many market managers in Los Angeles, becoming aware of their
  struggles and well positioned to facilitate an LA Farmers' Market Coalition.


  Executive Director, Mark Anderson is a former small farmer and current
  operator of farmers' markets for the past ten years. He served on the State of
  California's Certified Farmers' Market Advisory Committee to the Secretary of
  Agriculture for over 6 years.


  Community Development Manager, Aubrey Yarbrough, sits on a sub-committee of
  the North Westwood Neighborhood Council (NWWNC) and is well positioned to
  promote integration between markets and Neighborhood Councils.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  * 90% coalition participation by farmers’ market within LA County

  * Creation of an annual LA Farmers’ Market Week in Spring

  * 50%+ participation of Neighborhood Councils during Farmers’ Market Week

  * LA Farmers’ Market Week would be schedule near the beginning of election
  time for 
    Neighborhood Councils 
  * Increase voting for participating Neighborhood Council Election by 300%

  * Non-interrupted operation of Certified Farmers' Market (outside of weather)

  * Increase of sales at Food Dessert Farmers’ Markets by 25%

  Our vision is to leverage the amazing farmers’ market community in LA County
  to keep local food accessible at all times and especially in food desserts. By
  uniting and partnering with local Neighborhood Councils we can expand farmers'
  markets social safety networks while simultaneously expanding the reach of
  Neighborhood Councils.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '300'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '10000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Across Los Angeles, and especially in low-income food deserts, communities
  will have access to fresh fruits and vegetables without (non weather-related)
  market closures. These communities will have greater access to government
  benefits such as Cal Fresh EBT and they will enjoy the health benefits of
  regular access to fresh fruits and vegetables.  Due to their market's
  increased participation in local Neighborhood Councils, these community
  members will benefit from locally funded programs like community compost
  hubs.
