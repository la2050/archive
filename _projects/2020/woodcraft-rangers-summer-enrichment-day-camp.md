title: Woodcraft Rangers Summer Enrichment Day Camp
project_summary: >-
  A grant from LA2050 will support Woodcraft Rangers’ summer day camp by
  providing scholarships to children from low-income families. Woodcraft summer
  day camps enable 600 students to learn and play together with adult guides
  and  mentors at Rosemead, Salt Lake, and South Gate parks for 11 hours/day
  over seven weeks, maximizing access for working parents. Each day includes
  arts, sports and wellness, STEM and leadership plus hot meals and academic
  support to help prevent summer learning loss.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to PLAY
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - East LA
  - San Gabriel Valley
  - South LA
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >
  Woodcraft Rangers youth live in neighborhoods scarred by years of housing
  instability, substandard environmental conditions, gangs, and violence. They
  attend schools with the state’s lowest academic performance rankings and have
  minimal access to enrichment activities and technological resources. 88% of
  Woodcraft students qualify for free/reduced-cost meals. Many do not have the
  opportunity to play in safe, supervised outdoor spaces during the summer.


  Woodcraft day camps provide these youth with team sports and a wide range of
  engaging and enriching activities that divert them from unsafe activities.
  Camps also help their working parents, who know their children are safe and
  supported while out of school.


  Woodcraft day camp programs are typically subsidized at $85/week, but this is
  a cost that many families can no longer afford. In response to the economic
  impact of the current crisis, we are proposing a new scholarship program to
  provide free enrollment for qualifying families.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >
  With a century-long history of growth and success in expanded learning,
  Woodcraft Rangers is a longtime leader in providing quality afterschool and
  summer enrichment programs. Since 1922, Woodcraft Rangers has brought together
  youth from different neighborhoods and backgrounds, guided by the steadfast
  belief that all young people deserve the joys of childhood and its defining
  developmental experiences. For the past 40 years, Woodcraft Rangers has
  focused exclusively on the highest-need neighborhoods and schools, serving
  youth whose families cannot afford traditional summer camp options.


  In addition to being inclusive and accessible, Woodcraft camps offer a range
  of popular activities like sports, dance and art, along with cutting-edge
  activities like skateboarding, stop motion animation, and robotics. Camp staff
  receive trauma-informed training, and many serve as mentors during Woodcraft
  afterschool programs, providing additional security to young campers and their
  caregivers.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >
  With the support of a partnership with LA2050, Woodcraft Rangers hopes to
  accomplish the following outcomes:


  *Woodcraft day camps will be held at three locations in public parks for 11
  hours/day, 5 days/week over 7 weeks. 


  *Woodcraft will launch a new scholarship program for qualifying families to
  provide free enrollment for up to 600 day camp participants.


  *Woodcraft day camp staff will receive trauma-informed mental health training
  in partnership with Children’s Hospital Los Angeles’ Project Heal. 


  *Woodcraft day camps will maintain a maximum 20:1 student to staff ratio.
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '600'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '600'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  Woodcraft Rangers' long-term aim is to help shift the socioeconomic systems
  that disfavor youth from low-income families (largely families of color) and
  empower them to seek productive and rewarding lives that uplift entire
  communities. Programs are informed by decades of experience serving
  communities where children are traumatized by lack of opportunity, unsafe
  communities and pervasive negative influences including poverty, homelessness,
  gangs, drugs, crime, and violence.  Woodcraft programs help counter these
  negative influences with positive activities and adult mentors, aiming to
  replace high risk behaviors with improved physical fitness, academic
  performance, graduation rates, and cognitive, social and emotional
  well-being.
