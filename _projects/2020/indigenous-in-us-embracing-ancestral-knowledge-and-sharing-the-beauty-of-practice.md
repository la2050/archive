  Indigenous In Us: Embracing Ancestral Knowledge and Sharing the Beauty of
  Practice
project_summary: >-
  The Indigenous in Us: Embracing Ancestral Knowledge and Sharing the Beauty of
  Practice, showcases community-based indigenous wellbeing practices of Native
  Mexica groups (with links to Nahuatl-speaking indigenous ancestors from
  central Mexico) and our local Native American Tataviam nation group, whose
  combined teachings connect the Northeast San Fernando Valley to the past and
  present United States, Mexico, and Central America. Over a 12-months, a series
  of free public cultural events will focus on ancestral knowledge/arts for
  social well being.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CONNECT
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - San Fernando Valley
In what stage of innovation is this project?: >-
  Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects
  or programs)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  Our project highlights Indigenous-based arts and wellness practices for
  self-care and community-care at a time when they are much-needed. Many people
  are not aware of the significance of these ancestral practices, even while
  many may be unknowingly practiced in families for generations. These cultural
  customs involve many types of ceremonies honoring social and natural
  occurrences, the changing of the seasons, or teachings on ways to balance
  one's life or engage respectfully with others. Exposing more people to groups
  and individuals who carry and practice this knowledge would contribute to an
  awareness, understanding and appreciation of other restorative ways. This work
  is an opportunity to connect individuals and our larger LA community to their
  own indigenous traditions that have been disrupted by a history of
  colonization while reminding all people of their shared humanity and diversity
  as expressed in indigenous practices.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  Our practice is rooted in the recognition of the indigenous mindset. This
  project embodies our lived mission of honoring ancestral knowledge and delves
  into the rich history that is the source of today’s expressions of ancestral
  practices. For 18 years we have provided access to cultural traditions such as
  Danza Mexica and Mexicayotl workshops, addressing teachings in Nahuatl
  language, Mexica calendar, and more. We are connected with the local
  Fernandeno Tataviam tribe & its nonprofit Pukuu in ongoing collaboration &
  cultural sharing. Pukuu has been operating since the 1970’s in community
  reinvestment & cultural wellness. This project is a way to fully partner in
  sharing knowledge of our traditions and customs.  Our philosophical statement
  guides our practice: “to incorporate the ancient indigenous mind and wisdom
  within the present actualities of modern life and culture so that every
  person, every family and every community can live deeply rooted, meaningful
  and purposeful lives.” 
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  In collaboration with Pukuu Cultural Community Center, we see that our
  history, customs, cultural and ancestral knowledge gives us the tools and
  skills to remedy and recover what was lost during colonization, and build the
  resiliency to face current tribulations. Continuing this project bridges the
  community to “ancestral literacy” by means of workshops, ceremonies, and a
  final wellness culmination to learn, reflect, and share indigenous-based
  history, lessons, skills and practices. Our vision for success is to engage
  Northeast San Fernando residents, the majority who originate from Mexico,
  Central America, and are of Native American decent, to share dialogue,
  co-learn self-care skills and history rooted in ancestral and indigenous
  knowledge relevant to them by hosting workshops throughout the project period
  at our community centers. The outcome of workshops is to prepare participants
  to put the lessons into action in their daily lives. To evaluate and measure
  this each workshop will include a brief survey to gauge the participant’s
  experience. The anonymous surveys will address questions of facilitation,
  content, personal experience, likelihood of implementation and ask how they
  heard about the workshop. Our vision of success is to reawaken the native
  within through bridging, connecting, and sharing with the greater community of
  Los Angeles that we are present with ancestral knowledge that can help us live
  more meaningful lives. 
Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '1500'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '4000'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  The majority of our community are immigrant residents from Mexico and other
  Central American countries traumatized by poverty, war and violence. Poverty,
  low education levels and depression are widespread in our service area.
  Understanding this, the arts and cultural experiences we offer embrace our
  community’s histories, cultures, and languages to restore and celebrate their
  identities, validate their voices, and foster new options. This project
  promotes the often hidden existing resources of ancestral knowledge to those
  who could benefit from them most. Bringing awareness to indigenous and native
  communities in the Northeast San Fernando Valley and brings cultural equity
  and inclusion to the forefront of the diverse LA demographic.
