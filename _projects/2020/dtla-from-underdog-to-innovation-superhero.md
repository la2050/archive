title: 'DTLA: From Underdog to Innovation Superhero'
project_summary: >-
  The Alliance unleashes the diversity of entrepreneurial talent and ideas in
  Downtown LA (DTLA) by connecting startup founders with the resources they need
  most. We do this by first organizing and unifying key community leaders so
  they can better engage with their local startups. Then, we connect those
  startup founders with critical resources including capital, mentors, corporate
  partners, and peer support. We bring the pieces together to create a stronger
  innovation community that creates jobs and opportunity for all Angelenos.

Which LA2050 goal will your submission most impact?: LA is the best place to CREATE
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - >-
    City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide
    benefit)
In what stage of innovation is this project?: Pilot project or new program (testing or implementing a new idea)
What is the need you’re responding to?: >-
  The potential of Downtown Los Angeles (DTLA) is staggering
  (https://bit.ly/2UXd2Rh). Recent improvements in public transportation have
  made it possible for workers to commute without worry of congestion or cost.
  Disadvantaged and underserved communities can now travel into the city with
  relative ease, opening a world of opportunities not previously available.
  Added to that, DTLA houses an emerging startup community, investors and
  leading institutions. All the building blocks are there for a vibrant startup
  community, yet they’ve remained disjointed and lack the glue to hold them
  together. We are that glue. We’ve done the research
  (https://on.bcg.com/39B4mW5) and we know with all the pieces in place, the
  timing has never been better to build DTLA into the “core” of a super city
  that it was always meant to be. In the wake of the devastating COVID-19
  outbreak, supporting startups and founders and putting talented Angelinos back
  to work has never been more important.
Why is this project important to the work of your organization?: >-
  The Alliance for SoCal Innovation is a non-profit formed in 2017 that serves
  as a SoCal super connector bringing together research institutions, business
  leaders, and investors. We live the ‘it’s who you know’ mentality, and we know
  the right people: our amazing Board of Directors and world-class Advisory
  Council includes distinguished local community and corporate leaders (e.g.
  Edison, Kaiser, Warner Bros), successful entrepreneurs (like Eric Schmidt from
  Google), LA-based venture investors, and the top research universities in
  Southern California (https://bit.ly/3dQ25K1). We create programs that focus on
  connecting and energizing SoCal’s diverse and specialized ecosystems while
  attracting new capital to the region. We have connected over 1,000 people
  through marquis events and personal introductions. We are well situated to
  make an even bigger impact this coming year by engaging this robust network to
  further strengthen the local start-up community.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.: >-
  The Alliance’s activities will enable more startups to be founded, funded, and
  grow here in LA. Over the long-term, our efforts have the potential to
  generate 200K direct jobs in tech and more than 1MM indirect jobs in Southern
  California by 2028. To jump start this effort and provide critical regional
  momentum over the next 12 months, we will focus on strengthening the DTLA
  startup ecosystem by 1) creating greater vibrancy and connectedness 2)
  enhancing awareness and visibility of resources; and 3) strengthening regional
  connectivity.

Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this proposal?: '611'
Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this proposal?: '5800'
Please describe the broader impact of your proposal.: >-
  We estimate that we will indirectly impact 5,800 people which is 20% of the
  29K total employed in the DTLA innovation economy. We will do this by directly
  convening 600 people in MeetUp events and empowering 11 DTLA community leaders
  to drive grass-roots programs designed to engage diverse LA-based innovators
  to work on catalytic projects. These projects support and strengthen the
  community by creating not just quality jobs but also economic stability for
  the surrounding neighborhoods. The DTLA web platform will further enable the
  community to connect with other regions and attract more investment to the
  area. This program will crank the flywheel to generate momentum for a
  community that has the assets to meaningfully transform the region.
