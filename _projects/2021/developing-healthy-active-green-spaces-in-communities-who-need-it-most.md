In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Los Angeles currently ranks 49th out of the 100 largest cities in the country
  for the amount of green space per 1000 residents. While there is a significant
  lack of green and recreational space throughout LA County, low-income
  communities of color fare much worse. A 2016 countywide analysis of green
  space found that communities with very high or high park need were 90%
  predominately communities of color. One’s race, income, and geography have
  come to predict whether that individual has access to a park or garden.
  Additionally, a direct correlation exists between park-poor neighborhoods and
  poor health. There is a 12-year life expectancy gap across LA County, as well
  as higher rates of childhood obesity and premature mortality from
  cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Green space access correlates to public
  health benefits, including lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels, lower
  self-reported stress, lower rates of crime and domestic violence, and improved
  air and water quality.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  A grant from LA 2050 will help LANLT engage and move forward 1-3 prospective
  projects in underserved communities in LA County while maintaining and
  activating the 12 parks and gardens we manage year-round. Core to the LANLT's
  mission and key to its successful model are the equally important pillars of
  organizing, design and development, and stewardship. The first phase of a new
  park, garden or renovation project always starts with deep community
  engagement and stakeholder involvement, where residents help to identify
  spaces and envision the projects by identifying their priorities. Through
  door-to-door outreach, workshops, focus groups, park-based events, and monthly
  meetings, we develop not only residents who engage in their own neighborhood
  vision, but resident leaders who take pride and steward their open spaces. Key
  to our successful model is our Park and Garden Stewardship Program, which
  engages local community residents to be the caretakers of their neighborhood
  greenspaces. This unique approach to operating, maintaining and activating our
  parks and gardens fosters both community ownership and economic development.
  LANLT Stewards help to ensure that our sites are clean and safe so that they
  can continue to serve as welcoming community spaces promoting mental wellbeing
  and healthy lifestyles. Our sites have proven track records of less vandalism,
  increased safety, and high utilization, while our residents are empowered and
  trained to address neighborhood issues.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Our 12 owned or managed sites have consistent year-round care by resident
  caretakers, are active with community events and free programming and have
  proven track records of less vandalism, increased safety, and high
  utilization, while our residents are empowered and trained to address
  neighborhood issues. By developing park and garden spaces that allow community
  members to play, connect, and gain access to fresh produce, we are impacting
  public health and making positive changes that include lower rates of obesity,
  diabetes, heart disease, hunger, and depression. Our parks frequently include
  community gardens that supply fresh and healthy produce and promote vibrant
  neighborhood life by providing a space for colorful celebrations/events that
  unite neighbors and families.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '255000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '500000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  If we are successful at not only managing and activating the 12 parks and
  gardens we manage year-round as well as achieving the ability to move forward
  on 1-3 prospective parks, we will not only have provided clean, safe and
  active green spaces for over 230,000 Angelenos, we will also have engaged
  between 4 and 10 communities that currently have very little access to green
  space for play, rest or fresh food and be on our way to providing these spaces
  for between 5,000 and 25,000 additional LA County residents. This will provide
  physical and mental health benefits as well as empower residents in long
  underserved communities of color beyond 2050.
