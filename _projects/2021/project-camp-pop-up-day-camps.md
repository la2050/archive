title: 'Project:Camp Pop-up Day Camps'
project_summary: >-
  Project:Camp sets up pop-up day camps to support children, parents, and their
  communities in the wake of disaster. We work with community partners to launch
  pop-up day camps when disaster strikes and to prepare them to launch their own
  pop-up day camps in preparation for future disasters.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Disaster response infrastructure is not designed for children; evacuee
  shelters are simply not a great place to be a kid. Disasters have been
  increasing in frequency and severity. The year 2020 was the sixth consecutive
  year with 10 or more billion-dollar disasters in the United States. Yet
  disaster response was not designed to support the needs of children. The
  National Risk Index (FEMA) shows communities that are least equipped to
  respond to disaster also tend to be the same communities with increased rates
  of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE), or traumatic experiences that can lead
  to long-term stress and poor health outcomes in children. Communities need a
  way to support the mental health of children, while providing space for
  parents to rebuild their lives. California Surgeon General Dr. Nadine Burke
  Harris calls for long-term investments in community care to build resilience
  in the face of increasing disasters (Roadmap for Resilience)
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Project:Camp will use funding from LA 2050 to build our capacity to work with
  communities to both prepare pop-up camps prior to disaster and to launch camps
  when disasters strike. We will convene community members to discuss preparing
  resources for children and families in the event of future disasters. This
  funding will also be used to increase our capacity to train volunteers and
  community leaders by engaging in further outreach and hosting more training
  events. Support from LA 2050 will also help us tell our story, developing our
  website and social media presence to amplify this work and the need to invest
  in it prior to disaster instead of waiting for it to strike. As well, though
  currently a fiscally sponsored organization with an Advisory Board, we are
  currently enlisting the first members of our Board of Directors and are
  working with Cooley LLP pro bono to apply for our own 501(c)3 nonprofit
  status. We will use funding from JVPF to support our strategic planning,
  including developing fundraising and organization structure to ensure
  Project:Camp’s stability and success moving forward.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Success means that there are preparations in place across the county to
  support children and their families when regular child care services are
  disrupted. We will be able to show the support given to children by providing
  the amount of campers per day we can serve and the amount of hours and days
  that parents have to return to work or rebuild their lives in response to
  disaster. We will map out resources to support this work across the county,
  enlisting sites pre-arranged to host camps, summer camps that can provide
  volunteers and connect with parents and potential campers. Project:Camp will
  connect the dots and provide the network needed to link together sites,
  volunteers, and families to focus these resources in the event of a disaster.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '250'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '500'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Our vision is that all children have a safe and joyful space during a
  disaster. Our goals are to increase the capacity of community organizations
  across Los Angeles County to provide pop-up day camps in the event of future
  disasters. We will build a network of trained volunteers to support pop-up
  camps. We will identify and sign on sites across the county that are willing
  and able to be used to host camps when the need arises. We will also convene
  community groups and their members to work with parents to have these
  resources ready in the event of disaster. The vision is for Project:Camp to be
  the experts in the room on providing an adaptable, trauma-informed camp model
  and the resources to train volunteers and run camp. We can then work with
  community partners to adapt this work to fit the needs and cultures of the
  communities that we are supporting.
