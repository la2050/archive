  Our new app helps youth in foster care design exciting futures with a
  supportive community
project_summary: >-
  At Stepping Forward LA (SFLA), we empower youth in foster care by leveraging
  the expertise of individuals who have been through the system. Last year, our
  community of former foster youth developed an interactive mobile app to help
  youth build skills, access resources, and get support as they enter adulthood.
  Over the next year, we will guide 400 current and former foster youth through
  our app to gain stability and a foundation to thrive. We will also create 24
  internships that pay former foster youth to continue improving the app.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Applying a proven model or solution to a new issue or sector (e.g., using a
  job recruiting software or strategy to match clients to supportive housing
  sites, applying demonstrated strategies from advocating for college
  affordability to advocating for housing affordability and homelessness, etc.)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Many youth learn life skills – opening a bank account, applying for a job,
  renting an apartment – from family. Youth aging out of foster care don't, and
  the moment they exit, they lose support of social workers, judges, lawyers,
  and group home staff. By age 26, 50% are unemployed and 30% are homeless. SFLA
  helps youth step confidently into the future by filling gaps in the system: 1.
  We put youth in the driver’s seat. In the system, decisions are made for
  youth, keeping them from developing agency. We help them identify what they
  want and build decision-making skills. 2. We emphasize thriving. Youth are
  used to survival mode. Current approaches to helping them exit care emphasize
  housing and jobs – essential but not enough. We help them envision an exciting
  future by exposure to things beyond their current reality. 3. We create
  community. Without support, adulthood is isolating. We introduce youth to a
  network of peers and trusted adults who help them build hope and confidence.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Our one-of-a-kind mobile app, designed by a team of former foster youth, app
  guides youth on a journey to prepare for – and get excited about – their
  future. In addition to improving outcomes for youth, we have an ambitious
  vision for our app: That it transforms the foster care system's current
  approach to helping youth transition from care, providing those who support
  them with a modernized, youth-centered toolkit and format. Most youth we serve
  have access to smart phones and are accustomed to using social media. Our app
  provides an online community and a centralized library of engaging content and
  resources curated specifically for youth exiting care – a "one-stop shop" to
  build skills, get support, and explore opportunities. Given the popularity of
  short-form video as a communication medium, the key vehicle for delivering
  information through our app is short, engaging instructional videos. In
  addition to linking to existing online resources, we provide opportunities for
  volunteers and former foster youth within our community - and eventually app
  users themselves - to produce and share original content. Funding will help us
  engage and guide 400 youth through the app to gather feedback on our beta
  version. We will also establish recurring paid internship positions for youth
  who demonstrate a commitment to their goals and an interest in improving the
  app. In addition to creating 24 job opportunities each year, this will ensure
  our app stays relevant and youth-friendly.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Designed by individuals who know firsthand what youth in foster care need
  most, our app has a strong foundation of viability with our target market.
  Initially, we aim to retain 50% of users through completion of core groups,
  growing over time as our interns survey disengaged users and improve the app
  by adding live events, games, and workshops. With API technology, we can track
  engagement in real time, to answer: Engagement: – How often do youth engage? –
  What factors increase engagement? – Do graduates contribute back to the
  community? Retention: – Do youth stay engaged over time to achieve goals? –
  What incentives or activities keep youth most committed? – What's the average
  time to complete core competency groups? Life Outcomes: – What changes do
  youth experience in knowledge, perspective, behavior, and status as a result
  of our app? – How do their outcomes compare to peers in areas like high school
  graduation, employment, college enrollment, emotional wellbeing, etc?
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '424'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '2000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Our app guides youth through a journey to build skills and community:
  “Discovery”: Youth are invited to explore the app. We help them create a
  customized plan and meet core group coaches – volunteers and former foster
  youth. On a community feed, youth engage with supportive peers and volunteers,
  setting a positive tone for their journey. "Core Groups": Youth in crisis are
  fast-tracked. Otherwise, based on their plan, they are welcomed into:
  education, employment, housing, finances, and self-care. The goal is to move
  them out of “survival mode” quickly by assigning content and small tasks.
  Youth earn points and badges as they advance. "Elective Groups": Youth are
  then eligible to join groups, discussions, and events related to fitness,
  travel, music, and whatever else they wish to learn from our 100+ speakers and
  volunteers. Long term, we aim to: - Increase high school graduation, college
  matriculation, and employment - Improve confidence, connectedness, and sense
  of agency
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  While Stepping Forward LA has taken the lead to develop this app through our
  unique community, we look forward to sharing it with as many organizations as
  possible, creating a centralized hub where service providers can refer youth
  to receive support and guidance, and where they can request access to data
  that helps them better serve their constituents. We expect that key
  beneficiaries of our app will be: 1) Court system: Judges, attorneys, and
  court-appointed special advocates 2) Other youth-serving nonprofits 3) Group
  homes and residential facilities 4) Department of Children and Family
  Services: social workers and youth case managers All partners will be able to
  benefit from the app, which improves the current approach to helping youth
  prepare for and transition from care.
