title: Supporting Angelenos’ Fight Against Cancer
project_summary: >-
  We provide education, support & community to everyone in L.A. affected by
  cancer, particularly through our psychosocial support groups that help to
  create community & a relief from isolation. As part of our multi-year
  strategic plan, we are focusing our efforts on extending programming to the
  most underserved populations, with an eye to particular challenges faced by
  cancer patients & caregivers of color, and those that are LGBTQ+ and have
  disabilities.

  - East LA
  - San Gabriel Valley
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South LA
  - Westside
  - South Bay
  - Antelope Valley
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  There are roughly 1.8 million new cancer diagnoses in the US each year. 5.42%
  of the American population has cancer. In 2017, there were 14,600 cancer
  deaths in L.A. County alone. Each cancer diagnosis brings trauma and stress
  for everyone involved. A survey of cancer in L.A. reveals what CSCLA already
  knows: cancer and its associated financial stress is disproportionately
  visited on Angelenos of color. Black men have the highest incidence rate for
  all cancers among men, and Black women the third highest. Hawaiian/Samoan
  women have the highest overall cancer risk for women, and Hawaiian/Samoan men
  are second among men. Even more discouraging, perhaps, are the outcomes for
  minority patients after diagnosis. Black patients have elevated health risks
  from cancer: Black males have the highest cancer incidence and death rates of
  all major racial/ethic groups, and Black women, despite 7% lower incidence
  rates of cancer, are 13% more likely to die of cancer than their white peers.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  CSCLA’s programs address the trauma and stress of cancer, and improve the
  mental health and mortality rates of cancer patients, through our psychosocial
  support group model. CSCLA’s free-of-charge programs include support groups
  and counseling; healthy lifestyle classes; social activities; educational
  workshops; and, child, teen and family programs—for all ages, all diagnoses,
  at all stages, and for the whole family. Because of the Cancer Support
  Community’s global efforts, these services are now considered to be an
  integral part of quality cancer care. The participants will benefit from our
  evidence-based psychosocial support group model, which is proven to have
  positive effects on cancer patients’ anxiety and depression, especially when
  they had high levels of distress before starting the group. Support groups
  help patients feel less depressed and anxious, and can even improve chances of
  survival. Support groups have also been proven to be beneficial for caregivers
  of cancer patients, improving their self-efficacy for managing patients’
  cancer symptoms, caregiver stress and preparedness for caregiving, coping
  strategies, perception of well-being and quality of life, anxiety and
  depressive symptoms, and others.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  By continuing our programming, we will sustain and expand the effects we have
  seen since our inception in 1982. These effects are measured through the
  number of participants in our programs; number of new participants,
  particularly members of Los Angeles minority groups; and results from our
  CancerSupportSource Distress Screening Survey. The use of CancerSupportSource®
  Distress Screening Surveys is based on our knowledge that routine screening
  for social and emotional distress is a key component to comprehensive quality
  cancer care and is a recommendation of the 2008 Institute of Medicine’s
  Report, Cancer Care for the Whole Patient, Meeting Psychosocial Health Needs
  and also the new patient-centered standards from the American College of
  Surgeon’s Commission on Cancer which state that beginning in 2015, all cancer
  patients must be screened for distress if seen in an accredited cancer center.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '2500'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '40000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  If successful, all residents of Los Angeles county impacted by cancer will
  know of Cancer Support LA’s services, and exercise the option to participate
  in our programs. Our HEART program will reach the area’s most vulnerable, and
  engage those populations in culturally-competent services, in partnership with
  organizations and individuals from those populations. Not only will every
  Angeleno have the option of accessing our services, but that option will be
  for supports that fit their specific needs, with fellow patients and
  caregivers who share their particular struggles. Our virtual services will
  only further connect Los Angeles residents who would otherwise have a
  difficult time attending an in-person meeting, such as busy parents or those
  with disabilities. The Los Angeles cancer community will be educated and
  supported, and all who want it will receive free mental health support, which
  research shows will have a material impact on survival rates and caregiver
  competency.
