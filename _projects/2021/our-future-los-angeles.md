project_video: ''
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Of the 3,007 counties in the county, LA has the worst housing affordability,
  overcrowding, and unsheltered homelessness, and the pandemic has only made
  this more acute. Rampant racial segregation and real estate speculation are
  pushing lower-income Black and Brown families out of their homes and
  communities at an alarming rate. Compounding these challenges are the recent
  failures of our housing market. From 2008-2018 the Metro LA Area lost 200,000
  units that rented for less than $1,000/month and replaced them with 500,000+
  units that rent for more than $1,500/month. In a region that is defined by
  low-wage service sector jobs, this is devastating. Through a painful mix of
  bad tax policies, exclusionary housing preferences, and short-sighted thinking
  we have collectively allowed our housing infrastructure to atrophy and teeter
  on the brink of collapse, while at the same time not investing the resources
  and services our Black and Brown communities deserve.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  UWGLA is playing the role of fiscal sponsor and backbone for this new
  countywide coalition, Our Future Los Angeles, that focuses on building a
  countywide approach to our most pressing challenges: housing affordability,
  low incomes, and shameful wealth gaps. It consists of 50+ local organizations,
  including 22 who are working as a steering committee to coordinate action and
  advocacy that: 1 Helps people stay in their current homes: Hundreds of
  thousands of people are at risk of losing their homes, with little notice or
  support. Our Future’s early priorities include fully funding a countywide
  right to counsel, support for renters at risk of losing their homes, and Ellis
  Act reform 2 Creates more affordable homes: We must allow the speedy
  construction of homes near mass transit and jobs, affordable to people at all
  income levels, without displacing existing renters or segregating our
  population. 3 Ensures every community is resource-rich: People should not have
  to leave their own communities to seek opportunity. We must address historic
  inequities to ensure that all neighborhoods have sufficient public and private
  investment. 4 Creates a single, independent, countywide housing solutions
  agency to fund and approve housing: It’s beyond time for the largest county in
  the nation to have a single, unified approach to housing, with the authority
  and funding necessary to meet our needs, especially for low-wage workers.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  We will measure our success by the incremental goals connected to our four
  priorities as well as the growth of campaign constituents. Our goals include:
  -5,000 social media followers by August 2022 -2,500 email list subscribers by
  August 2022 -One major piece of legislation or policy passed by August 2022
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '2500'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '750000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  We imagine a future where everyone has a safe, healthy and quality
  home–housing for all–in a strong and vibrant neighborhood of their choice;
  where everyone can succeed because we have dismantled the structures that
  create and perpetuate inequities; where everyone is safe because we have
  advanced new strategies that make homes affordable and create new pathways to
  home ownership; and where homelessness is unheard of because we have invested
  in proven solutions.
