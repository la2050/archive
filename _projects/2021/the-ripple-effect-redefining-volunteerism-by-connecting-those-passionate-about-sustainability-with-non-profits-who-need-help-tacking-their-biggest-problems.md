  The Ripple Effect: Redefining volunteerism by connecting those passionate
  about sustainability with Non-Profits who need help tacking their biggest
  problems
project_summary: >-
  In our Pro-bono Consulting Program, we form project teams of local talented
  professionals and connect them with LA-based non-profits to find solutions for
  their largest problems. This program benefits the Los Angeles community by
  amplifying the impact of our non-profits, providing professional development
  opportunities, and increasing long-term volunteerism from untapped
  populations. This grant will allow us to expand our capacity of annual
  projects, community networking, and professional development opportunities.

  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  LA based non-profits are underfunded and often lack the expertise they need to
  tackle their most pressing issues. While they make due with what they have,
  they are unable to optimize their organization to expand their service
  capacity and maximize their impact with the donations that they receive.
  Consulting organizations that traditionally would provide the expertise and
  guidance to overcome these hurdles are extremely expensive, and paying for
  these services is outside the budgets of local non-profit organizations.
  Unable to pay for such expertise, these issues and inefficiencies go
  unresolved and our local non-profit organizations are held back from achieving
  their full potential and making their biggest impact in the Los Angeles area.
  Seed Consulting Group strives to bridge the gap of these issues through
  providing a team of pro-bono consultants that recommend sustainable solutions
  to each organization's most pressing issues.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Seed Consulting Group fills the professional services gap for Los Angeles
  Non-Profits by reimagining what it means to volunteer. By creating unique,
  high-impact volunteer opportunities, we engage portions of the population that
  previously may not have considered volunteering, including the unemployed or
  underemployed, graduate students, and individuals working in demanding
  professions, increasing civic engagement and long term social impact. We
  engage these segments by creating project teams that provide free consulting
  work to help solve LA county non-profit organizations's biggest problems,
  allowing these non-profits to amplify their impact with their existing
  resources. Our Pro-Bono Consulting Cycle is a 10-week program that connects
  volunteer consultants with non-profits. We provide professional development
  for our volunteers by training them with consulting basics, enable them to use
  their individual strengths and expertise as part of a project team. In the
  process, they learn valuable STEM skills, gain relevant work experience, and
  provide networking opportunities which increases their potential for social
  mobility. While upskilling members of our community, they build long-term
  relationships with local non-profits. We perform meaningful work for our
  community's non-profits, amplifying their existing impact in a variety of
  ways, such as increasing effectiveness of their programs, increasing their
  revenue streams, increasing community awareness of their work.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  As the benefits of our program are two-fold, we measure our impact in two
  ways: 1. Non-Profit Impact: We currently have regular client satisfaction
  surveys where our clients indicate the impact that our work has had on the
  operations of their organizations, and actively track the number of clients,
  projects, and volunteer hours provided by our organization. These include: -
  99 nonprofit clients served (30% of clients are repeating client) - 141
  completed projects - 46,000+ volunteer hours donated 2. Volunteer Up-skilling
  & Professional Development Impact: Using onboarding and offboarding surveys,
  we are able to determine the positive impact our program has on core STEM
  skills by comparing the volunteer skills assessment before and after our
  program. These include: - 95% of volunteers report an increase in their
  technical and professional abilities
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '550'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1500'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Prior success from our Pro-Bono Consulting Program is two-pronged: we help
  create a Los Angeles where non-profits are able to do more and positively
  impact a wide variety of members in the community, while increasing the
  social-mobility of minority groups through valuable job experience and
  hands-on training. Our Pro-Bono Consulting Program results in a more efficient
  non-profit community. This leads to increased awareness around existing
  non-profit programs, more people benefiting from those programs, and a greater
  impact on global climate change. Seed also promotes a more civically engaged
  community by creating bonding experiences between professionals and the
  broader field of social and sustainable impact. Program success creates a Los
  Angeles where more people are actively volunteering, unemployed and
  underemployed people learn skills to help them reenter the workforce, and
  under-represented communities increase social mobility through our
  professional development services.
