title: Reestablishing Connection & Confidence For LA’s Youth
project_summary: >-
  PLUS ME uses the art of personal narrative storytelling to empower youth in
  LA. Through our self-reflective journaling and dialoguing process, students
  increase their self-awareness, realize they are not alone, and learn how to
  vulnerably share their stories. Our project will help underserved high school
  youth reconnect with their peers while engaging with diverse role models,
  strengthen their oral and written skills to prepare for college applications
  and job interviews, and build confidence as they transition back to in-person
  learning.

What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  According to UCLA in 2020, over 70% of young people felt isolated or alone.
  Research has shown that the impact of COVID-19 has likely increased this
  number and the need for social and emotional support for teenagers will be
  greater than ever coming out of this pandemic. When youth feel isolated or
  alone, they are less likely to build connections, initiate conversations, or
  feel comfortable expressing themselves to others. This results in youth
  disengagement, apathy, and a lack of confidence for them to pursue their
  academic, personal, and professional goals. As students in LA transition back
  to in-person learning, many will need tools to process through the traumas
  that they faced throughout this pandemic. We must immediately facilitate safe
  spaces where youth have the opportunity to self-reflect on the past year,
  articulate their experiences in group settings where they feel supported and
  celebrated, and gain tangible skills that will support them as they advance in
  their future.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Our program begins by having a volunteer role model share the struggles and
  accomplishments they experienced while navigating through their academic
  journey. Our goals for this five-hour program are to first connect with youth
  by sharing how relatable stories can look, sound, and feel. Second, we empower
  youth by telling them that they have a story that matters. Our intended impact
  here is to plant a seed of confidence and get youth inquisitive about their
  own journeys. Next, we facilitate safe environments by having youth create
  community agreements and defining the space they need to showcase
  vulnerability. Once established, our facilitators direct youth through our My
  Story Matters Journals. These 100-page personal narrative guides won UCLA’s
  2019 Social Enterprise Venture Competition and walk students through
  identifying the characters, settings, struggles, accomplishments, and lessons
  that comprise their stories. Through our self-reflection activities and
  intentional dialogues, students build deeper connections with their peers and
  realize they are not alone. Our program culminates with a community circle
  where students unapologetically own who they are and share their lived
  experiences with their classmates. Through our in-person or virtual program,
  youth increase their self-efficacy, empathy, and confidence while gaining
  practical written and oral skills that will help to strengthen their college
  applications and job interviews.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  We have been measuring impact and gaining participant feedback since we
  launched our program in 2016. Our intended impact is for youth to increase
  their connection with self and others and their confidence toward future
  goals. In 2019, we are proud that 76% of our youth increased self-awareness,
  80% expressed higher confidence, and 93% recommended their peers participate
  in the program. In addition to surveys, we also have conducted interviews with
  participants. Many of our students have claimed that our program helped them
  to realize they had a story that could be adapted into their college personal
  statement. They also raved about how they learned more about their classmates
  that they have known for years and increased their empathy for one another.
  One student shared, “This program not only changed by life by helping me
  understand and vocalize my story, but it saved my life by surrounding me with
  a community of peers that I now can call my friends.”
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '5000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Reestablishing connection and confidence for youth in LA will bring hope back
  to our city in a much needed way. After high school students are given the
  opportunity to self-reflect, empathize with one another, and understand how
  they showcased resiliency throughout this pandemic, LA will be filled with
  more youth who are not afraid to use their voices. There will be an increase
  in engagement at schools throughout the city and youth will feel more
  confident and eager to pursue their aspirations because they will now know how
  to articulate their stories into college personal statements and job
  interviews. Our city will feature a diverse set of storytellers who proudly
  embrace their authentic identities and serve as role models in their
  communities. Together, we will build stronger connections among one another
  and empower future generations to learn how to unapologetically own who they
  are and proudly articulate why they matter to themselves and the world.
