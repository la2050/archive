  FARM addresses the cost and overhead of establishing a brick and mortar food
  business. The CORNER FARM is a business model that supports agriculture
  entrepreneurship and can be scaled and replicated. The CORNER FARM advances
  local food production and reduces last mile distribution and storage costs.
  Food Sector Systems, LLC has researched locations in Urban Agriculture
  Incentive Zones and recognized the corner of Vernon and Slauson Aves in South

  Technologies. Also, the number of community engagements; school participation,
  community collaboration with new foods and traditional indigenous foods, and
