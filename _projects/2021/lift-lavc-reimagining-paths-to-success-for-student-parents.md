title: 'LIFT & LAVC: Reimagining Paths to Success for Student Parents'
project_summary: >-
  LIFT-LA has partnered with LA Valley College (LAVC) Family Resource Center
  (FRC) to break down barriers to post-secondary education attainment for the
  25% of low-income students who are also raising children. We offer student
  parents virtual one-to-one coaching with a trauma-informed MSW intern. Pairing
  LIFT’s virtual coaching model with LAVC FRC’s comprehensive supports
  cultivates an innovative, holistic, and effective model to drive student
  parent success. This partnership ensures a reliable path towards economic
  mobility through education.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  “I’ve met other student parents who face my same struggles. I feel less alone,
  and I really feel like I belong in school now.” Charmaine, LAVC Student Parent
  Helping families build careers is a key lever in disrupting intergenerational
  poverty. Education is a common barrier to career goals and higher levels of
  income. Student parents graduate at less than half the rate of their
  non-parenting peers. For mothers, completion rates within six years are
  between 8% and 18% (respectively for single moms and moms from two-parent
  households), compared to 49% for women who are not caregivers. Single mothers
  are more likely to take a break from their studies due to lack of equitable
  supports and the financial stress of being a parent. When they do complete
  their degree, it can take 6-15 years. While student parents are on a
  tried-and-true path to create brighter futures for their families, their
  limited financial resources, time, and mental bandwidth mean those goals often
  remain out of reach.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  This unique program offers student parents a comprehensive network of supports
  through LIFT’s 1:1 coaching and support provided by LAVC’s Family Resource
  Center. This integrated and holistic approach addresses the complex roots of
  poverty and systemic barriers to higher education. Specifically: Financial
  capabilities: LIFT-LA coaches help members bolster their money management
  skills and connect them to supports to address their basic needs. Members work
  to build a budget, reduce debt, improve credit, build savings, and secure
  family-sustaining careers. LAVC student parents have access to the supportive
  services at the FRC; as well as short-term workforce training academies that
  lead to meaningful and living wage careers, participants can access non-credit
  courses focused on 21st Century employability skills. Personal well-being:
  LIFT-LA works with members to improve their self-efficacy and resilience,
  enabling them to better protect their families from poverty’s detrimental
  effects. The FRC provides parents with parenting classes. An FRC dedicated
  social worker and family therapist support and provide opportunities for
  students to build social capital. Children of students also receive services.
  Social connections: LIFT-LA fosters a safe space for members to develop
  healthy peer-peer and member-community relationships to build social capital.
  The FRC is a community of its own that offers events, workshops, and a virtual
  chatroom where student parents can connect.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  LIFT and LAVC will measure success using the following metrics: Of our
  meaningfully engaged members, 90% will persist or progress in employment,
  finances, or education. Specifically:  - 50% will persist or progress in
  employment - 70% will persist or progress in finances - 50% will persist or
  progress in education - 45% will improve their personal well-being - 80% of
  student parents will successfully complete each semester of this grant - 70%
  of students will receive a certificate in a non-credit 21st Century Skills or
  Parenting Course. Our vision for success in this project is that student
  parents will be given the resources they need to enroll in classes, achieve
  their academic goals, persist in their education journey, while getting
  support that is attuned to their non-academic and unique needs to break the
  cycle of poverty. This includes building savings, reducing debt, finding
  secure employment, increasing their income, and improving their overall
  well-being.

'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '200'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Student parents are challenged by demanding roles placed on them by academic
  and family responsibilities, and services targeting their success are rare.
  LIFT and LAVC will employ an innovative two-generation approach that addresses
  student parent issues holistically and clears a path to economic mobility for
  their families. Through one-on-one financial and career coaching and personal
  well-being supports, LIFT and LAVC are dismantling the systemic barriers that
  too often prevent student parents from meeting their educational and financial
  goals. The model we are building will be codified and can be replicated in
  community colleges across the county. Fundraising has begun to replicate FRC’s
  at the eight other colleges in the Los Angeles Community College District.
  Ultimately, this project will blossom into a larger movement that will break
  generational cycles of poverty and make LA County the blueprint for student
  success—opening doors for low-income parents to rewrite their future.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  The FRC is the first and only center on a community college in California. It
  provides student parents with a community and set of resources on campus to
  help them succeed. The FRC provides for parents (parenting classes, virtual
  cafes, workshops, mentorship, stipends, textbooks and school supplies,
  community resources, academic counseling), children (diapers and children’s
  goods, socialization/activity groups, and early intervention services), and
  families (playgroups, family tutoring, food pantry, kid-friendly study
  lounges). Participants in this collaboration can also enroll in the New World
  of Work 21st Century Communication Skills Course as well as a parenting
  course. Through these classes, participants become LAVC students and learn
  employer-driven transferrable skills.
