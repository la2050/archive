What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  LGBTQ inclusive and diverse entertainment promotes acceptance within the
  community. However, for LGBTQ characters in the entertainment industry,
  opportunities continue to be limited. GLAAD 2020-21 “We Are On Tv” report
  found that there’s a lack of diversity, people of color, and a complete
  absence of trans characters in the film industry highlights the real need for
  representation on screen. Thai Fan Meet USA strives to make LA the best place
  to CONNECT by increasing visibility for people of color in the entertainment
  industry. Through events, education, and advocacy, TFMU works to ensure
  characters with diverse stories are shared and different cultures are
  celebrated. . With support from LA2050, Thai Fan Meet will host an inaugural
  BL Drama festival, celebrating people of color in entertainment. BL
  programming offers more than 150 dramas available on popular streaming
  platforms. Attendees can explore culture through food, music, dance, and
  informative discussions.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  The Thai Fan Meet USA (TFMU) presents programming that showcases the many
  talented and diverse stories being told in the Asian community. TFMU is a
  newly established intersectional company that focuses on people of color in
  the entertainment industry. Sharing stories around food and entertainment
  allows people from all races to gather in a common goal of having a good time
  and learning about our similarities rather than focusing on our differences.
  The drama festival will host a free to low-cost event at an L.A. theater
  space, providing interactive experiences, and educational panels that discuss
  the current entertainment issues facing the Asian and LGBTQ+ communities.
  Providing a safe space for attendees to create new works of art crafting paper
  origami, cook Thai desserts, and participate in dance challenges, and games.
  The panel discussions will focus on boys love programming, and will have a
  thoughtful dialogue about race, sexual orientation, and discrimination in
  media, and plans for future actionable steps. TFMU is applying to LA2050 to
  garner initial funds to help host an event and bring artists from various
  countries in Asia to Los Angeles. This $100,000 would serve to fund TFMU’s
  drama festival permits, licenses, and marketing for any necessary programming
  activities. We would work collaboratively with other non-profits in the LGBTQ+
  and Asian-American communities who would also showcase entertainment, culinary
  and cultural activities.

Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  TFMU primarily serves the LGBTQ+ and the Asian American communities who are
  minority groups, fees for the event will be offered as low as possible. Many
  of the activities will be offered free of charge; meet and greets activities
  will charge a modest fee for one-on-one hi-touch events. As a result,
  individual donations and foundation grants are necessary to bridge the gap
  between the costs of providing quality programming. Raising funds from
  individuals and foundations ensures Thai Fan Meet USA is poised to continue to
  provide quality cultural events and services to the county’s underrepresented
  residents while addressing the pressing need to develop and implement programs
  that serve the LGBTQ+, and people of color communities.
