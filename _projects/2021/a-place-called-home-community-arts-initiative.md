title: A Place Called Home - Community Arts Initiative
project_summary: >-
  Arts and Creative Expressions (ACE) at APCH harnesses the power of creativity
  in South Central, Los Angeles to nurture healing, positive communication, and
  individual self-determination for young people, strengthen our community, and
  advance social change. Through our Community Arts Initiative we will expand on
  more than 200 classes a year in music, theater, dance, visual arts, and
  digital media to bring the voices of South Central young artists to the world
  and leading industry creatives to South Central through more than 50 public
  events.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - South LA
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  In LA, where creative industries generate 1 in 7 jobs, arts education is a
  vital pathway to employment. However, workers across these industries do not
  reflect the racial and ethnic diversity of our youth, who are primarily LatinX
  and Black/African American. To make greater gains in racial equity, it is
  vital to nurture and arm marginalized youth with tools to access and
  sustainably thrive in creative industries. Unfortunately, when 87% of APCH
  families live below the federal poverty line ($26,500/family of four),
  artistic pursuits are seen as a luxury and not an important opportunity for
  economic/social mobility. COVID-19 has drastically impacted the LA creative
  landscape where artists must now be multi-disciplinarily, digitally, and
  technologically fluent to be competitive in an oversaturated market. Community
  arts events at APCH will provide our members with valuable industry exposure,
  an equitable creative landscape, and a platform to share urgent issues within
  their community.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Our Community Arts Initiative will produce 50 virtual, onsite, and hybrid
  public arts events to provide cultural enrichment, community engagement,
  professional performance opportunities, access to wider audiences, and entry
  to creative industries for South Central residents. These events are produced
  and run by staff and youth members - valuable opportunities for our young
  people to build 21st century job skills. Hundreds of members will present
  creative work and have recorded material to add to their portfolio for
  professional and postsecondary pursuits. Alternatively, more than 100 creative
  professionals will perform, collaborate, and teach through these events.
  Events will include: The LatinX Theater Festival; Comic, Art, and Literacy
  Expo (CALE); APCH Studio Album; The Moondance Film Festival; public recitals;
  First Film Friday’s; virtual art exhibitions; and virtual theater productions.
  Since 1993, APCH has offered after school arts education through its no-cost
  program model to youth ages 8 - 24. Our creative avenues introduce the arts to
  members, guide them towards professional careers, and leverage our community
  partnerships with movie studios, nationally renowned artists, musicians,
  actors, agencies, and more, to provide invaluable industry exposure. We are a
  community hub for youth development with a 32,000 sq. ft. center that includes
  instructional spaces, a dance studio, a state-of-the-art theater, an art
  gallery, and a professionally equipped recording studio.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  This Initiative will incorporate both ongoing events and ambitious new
  projects that will directly engage more than 500 youth and 5,000 community
  members at a time when people feel more disconnected than ever before due to
  COVID-19. APCH will track and record the following criteria as a method of
  evaluation: 1) The number of public events and expositions produced 2) The
  number of members, families, and community members who attend each event 3)
  The number of youth projects completed or showcased through each event 4) The
  number of professional artists, performers, creatives, companies, and
  organizations that we partner with through each event. High level indicators
  of Initiative success will include: 1) An increase in ACE class enrollment 2)
  Member matriculation to artistic post-secondary or vocational pursuits 3) An
  increase in LA County institutional partnerships and/or engagement. 4)
  Referrals for other APCH services from CAI events.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '500'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '10000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Investing in the art of marginalized youth strengthens, innovates, and
  diversifies the LA creative economy, currently about 10% of LA's gross
  economic output. Elevating the art of young people will share rich and diverse
  cultural experiences to help drive social change. We are generating critical
  pathways in professional artistic development for South Central, a notoriously
  underserved area. These platforms will bring art, industry professionals, and
  meaningful education to people in our community who will not only gain the
  greatest benefits from the opportunities, but may not be able to attend
  similar events due to socio-economic barriers. APCH predominantly serves
  low-income families, where a high percentage of residents are immigrants. We
  open our events to community members, providing access points to connect our
  families to essential services we provide for food and financial insecurity -
  additionally and critically important for COVID-19 recovery in LA.
