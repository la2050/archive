  Help Reduce Elementary Grade Students Math Skills Erosion Due To Covid-19
  Closure
project_summary: >-
  Most students showed growth in math achievement since the onset of COVID-19
  disruptions, but math growth was lower than in a typical year. A higher
  percentage of underserved and under-resourced communities need equitable
  access to high-quality math instructors.Even if returning to school this fall
  is successful, we are looking at a gap of 2 to 3 years before interrupted
  education is repaired (GSBSF) will provide enhanced enrichment classes in math
  this summer and fall for the under-resourced communities throughout the county
  of Los Angeles.

project_video: ''
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
  - South Bay
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Most students showed growth in reading and math achievement since the onset of
  COVID-19 disruptions, but math growth was lower than in a typical year. A
  higher percentage of underserved and under-resourced communities of African
  Americans and Latinos need equitable access to high-quality math instructors.
  Damage cannot be calculated because there are scores of students not attending
  online classes for various reasons. There is an urgent call for intervention
  in these communities because of the severity of the problem. Disillusionment
  with education will lead to low academic performance in high school will stem
  from the covid-19 school Closer and Interrupted learning. Even if returning to
  school this fall is successful, we are looking at a gap of 2 to 3 years before
  interrupted education is repaired.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Computer science makes math interactive. Math on some levels can be boring.
  Our program effectively introduces CS to students, inspiring and engaging them
  to partake in math. Computer Science and Mathematics are intertwined.We do
  this by incorporating coding and robotics. Coding helps students visualize
  abstract concepts in math and builds critical-thinking skills.This leads to a
  deeper understanding of concepts. Robotics facilitates math through modelling,
  planning, and execution. Each student is mailed a robotics kit (STEM in a box)
  and lessons are conducted by a live instructor once a week for 1 hour.We also
  have a Virtual Academy where students can learn self paced courses on the same
  platform as LinkedIn learning and Skill share. With our ability to deliver the
  content electronically through streaming services amazon fire and roku Video
  on demand. We can deliver to any student, at any place and time. This is a
  more comprehensive result than a zoom call. Students are encouraged to
  participate, ask questions, troubleshoot and work together as a team.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  All parents and children are entered into our database and contacted at least
  once a year. We track students progress with exam scores from the challenges
  that are fed into an algorithm which determines the students' weaknesses. This
  AI (Artificial intelligence) engine will generate a particular course of
  action to help the student in math. We tracked the children from elementary
  school through Middle School all the way to high school to keep tabs on their
  progress. We employ a quality-improvement process that is continuously
  upgraded and reformed by the board of directors and the engineering community.
  Our board of directors are composed of credential teachers in the area of STEM
  and special needs.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '4800'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '7350'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  If our work is successful we are going to see a marked increase in students'
  comprehensive understanding of math and the erosions of lost math skills due
  to the covid 19 school closures. An increase in common core math standards in
  undeserved and under-resourced communities. More inclusion of children wanting
  to have careers in STEM. With success we can expand this initiative throughout
  Los Angeles County school districts Within five to seven years Los Angeles
  County could have home grown STEM professionals from the inner cities of Los
  Angeles county. We already have had success with our first high school
  interns. One was accepted into Caltech Majoring in computer science,the other
  intern was accepted to Cal Berkeley. This will lead to a more sustainable
  future for Los Angeles with high-tech professional jobs.It will also lead to
  more inclusion in under-resourced and underserved communities. That will
  reverberate throughout the county of Los Angeles.
