title: RE-ACH! Boots for the New American Dream
project_summary: >-
  Ezrach Brain Trust Association is excited to partner with ArtCenter College of
  Design and Social Innovation department, Designmatters to develop the RE-ACH
  Boot. Responsibly made footwear that will reduce the carbon footprint and
  support our initiative to provide professional workforce development
  throughout the South LA community. This will serve as a strategic blueprint to
  surge economic growth and leverage the resources of community and faith-based
  organizations. This initiative will provide boots for the “New American

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': Research (initial work to identify and understand the problem)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Ezrach seeks to address climate change and unemployment with focus on the
  circular economy as it relates to fashion and eliminating waste in Leimert
  Park and South LA. In 2018, the fashion sector was responsible for 2.1 billion
  metric tons of greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions. Moreover, high unemployment
  rates have been linked to the lack of hard and soft skills. Ezrach’s goal is
  to bridge the skills gap in youth and the aging workforce by providing
  technical and soft skills training. LA County’s unemployment rate hit 12.7% as
  of January 2021. African Americans only hold 4% of household wealth, while
  White households hold 84% of household wealth (Moss et al., 2020). Leimert
  Park is located in Service Planning Area 6, which makes up the 80th percentile
  (25% highest scoring census tract) of poor air quality according to the
  CalEnviroScreen. Ezrach seeks to provide education in Leimert Park and South
  LA about the harmful impact of carbon emissions.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  The American Dream has long been seen as a set of ideals in which freedom
  includes the opportunity for prosperity, success, and upward social mobility
  for everyone, achieved through hard work with few barriers. Ezrach Brain Trust
  Association recognizes that this American Dream does not represent what many
  disenfranchised communities are able to sustain and achieve. With the design
  and production of the RE-ACH Boot, Ezrach will provide programming, employment
  opportunities, and reduce the carbon footprint in Los Angeles County Service
  Planning Area 6 (SPA 6). With support from LA 2050, the RE-ACH Boot will
  increase workforce development by sourcing our materials locally; create a
  sustainability and environmental education program; create infrastructure to
  identify resources available to Los Angeles’ most vulnerable residents to
  reduce emissions; and create community engagement programming. Ezrach’s
  partnership with ArtCenter College of Design/Designmatters will provide access
  to top student product designers that bring a dynamic and entrepreneurial
  approach and serves as a vibrant hub for social impact through innovation.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Ezrach will host educational webinars to provide circular economy education.
  Ezrach and ArtCenter College of Design will provide pre and post surveys to
  stakeholders in the community to measure success of the project. Short-term:
  Carbon Footprint and Product Development Education 25% increase in carbon
  emission awareness 25% increase in food waste pollution and composting
  awareness 25% increase in how to identify responsibly sourced materials and
  products Community Engagement: 250 community members will attend the ABC’s
  Education Courses 750 households and businesses will adopt sustainability
  practices i.e. composting, purchasing sustainable products. Long Term:
  Workforce Development Training and Job Creation 25 participants complete first
  workforce development training (i.e. smart manufacturing, supply chain and
  logistics, project management) 20 participants complete the second cohort of
  workforce development training. 50 green jobs created in Los Angeles County.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '250'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '750'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Ezrach is committed to protecting underserved communities and improving the
  public health and environment of Los Angeles County. The battle against
  climate change is a moral imperative, an environmental emergency, and an
  economic opportunity. With the RE-ACH Boot, South Los Angeles will move a step
  closer toward a low-carbon, green-energy future. Furthermore, creating green
  employment opportunities will improve the trajectory of underrepresented
  groups in Los Angeles County by providing upward mobility. Our vision for the
  project is to produce a working prototype of the RE-ACH Boot and engage the
  community in educational workshops. The boot will undergo initial user
  evaluation and refinement. When ready to go to market, the boot will be
  manufactured locally. Through strategic partnernships, Ezrach’s goal is to
  create over 50 green jobs, bridge the wealth gap, and reduce carbon emissions
  in Leimert Park by 20% in the first year of the boots release.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  Ezrach Brain Trust Association will be the lead organization for the
  collaboration. Ezrach will be responsible for grant administration and
  providing guidance and thought leadership for the workforce development and
  community impact component of the project. Ezrach Brain Trust Association will
  provide workforce development training to equip participants within South Los
  Angeles for highroad employment opportunities. ArtCenter College of
  Design/Designmatters will collaborate with Ezrach to lead the development of
  the RE-ACH Boot from ideation to product development to market. ArtCenter
  College of Design/Designmatters will provide in-kind research, development and
  implementation necessary to reach desired outcomes.
