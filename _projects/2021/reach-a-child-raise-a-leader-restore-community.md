In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - San Fernando Valley
  - LAUSD (select only if you have a district-wide partnership or project)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  We are seeking to address youth unemployment and access to higher education
  for Black and Brown students. Our StreetLeader Program employs local high
  school students as counselors, tutors, and mentors for the children who attend
  our programs. Our programs are led by trained, high school students seeking to
  make an impact in their own communities. The heart of the StreetLeader Program
  is challenging teens to use their influence to make positive changes in the
  lives of our students, in their own lives, and throughout their communities.
  Our StreetLeaders live in the same neighborhoods (Canoga Park) as the campers
  they serve. UrbanPromise Los Angeles provides StreetLeaders with extensive job
  training, tutoring (academic standing is directly tied to the number of days a
  StreetLeader may participate in the program), college preparation, and
  mentoring to help them succeed in and outside of the program.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  The StreetLeader Program employs Canoga Park High School students as
  counselors, tutors, and mentors for the children who attend our AfterSchool
  Program and Summer Camp. Through our Friday trainings, UPLA provides
  StreetLeaders with job training, tutoring, help in the college application
  process, and mentoring to help them succeed beyond the program. The heart of
  the StreetLeader program is challenging teens to use their influence to make
  positive changes in the lives of these children, in their own lives, and
  throughout their communities. Our ultimate goal is to equip our StreetLeaders
  to be ready for leadership on their college campuses, with a passion to
  eventually return to their community to live a life of prolonged
  servant-leadership in their respective fields.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  - College acceptance is the biggest metric for gauging the success of our
  StreetLeader Program. Amongst other things, growth in reading and literacy is
  how we evaluate the success of our Summer camp. - UrbanPromise uses an
  assortment of methods for evaluation. For the StreetLeader Program, teenagers
  are evaluated weekly on job performance and conduct in the workplace. High
  School Graduation rates are also factored into the evaluation process, as are
  college applicants. On-the-job evaluation is always done in the context of a
  mentoring relationship. - Summer camps and after school programs are evaluated
  on the basis of attendance, consistency of participating children, numbers of
  children fed through the feeding program, grade monitoring, and informal
  surveys done with parents.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '60'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '100'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  The holistic approach of UrbanPromise - social-emotional, spiritual, and
  academic development - is how we reach a child, raise a leader, and ultimately
  restore community. Although a variety of services exist for LA’s youth, these
  services lack UrbanPromise’s commitment to involving teens in the process of
  transforming their neighborhoods through the tutoring and mentoring of the
  younger children in their communities. We believe through the UrbanPromise
  model, a new generation of young leaders will develop and affect positive
  change in their neighborhoods and the city. We believe that the “city of
  angels” can be radically transformed through this type of intentional
  discipleship and development.
