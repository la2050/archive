title: The Shower of Hope
project_summary: >-
  With over 66,000 individuals experiencing homelessness in LA County, The
  Shower of Hope aims to not only provide shower services to assist individuals
  experiencing homelessness, but also to build community resource hubs in
  partnership with other service provider agencies (mental health, substance
  abuse recovery, housing) where individuals in need can receive hygiene, meals,
  dignity, and a path out of homelessness.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Applying a proven model or solution to a new issue or sector (e.g., using a
  job recruiting software or strategy to match clients to supportive housing
  sites, applying demonstrated strategies from advocating for college
  affordability to advocating for housing affordability and homelessness, etc.)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Los Angeles is home to one of the largest communities of individuals
  experiencing homelessness; when people lose a home it’s more than the loss of
  a roof over their heads. For many, experiencing means losing access to
  sanitation and hygiene, which leads to a lack of self-worth and lowered sense
  of dignity which in itself creates another obstacle towards ending their cycle
  of homelessness.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  With the Shower of Hope, we believe in the importance and power of having
  access to a shower for not just sanitation and health purposes, but in
  building a sense of self-respect and dignity that is critical to building a
  path out of homelessness. Working within the communities we operate in, we
  ensure that every unhoused guest who comes to our shower sites has access to
  meals, clothing, showers, hygiene items, and most importantly, case
  management. Through our 25 community resource hubs, rather than an unhoused
  individual having to navigate a difficult network of public transportation and
  service centers, our community hubs serve to bring the services, hygiene and
  dignity to our unhoused Angelenos. A $100,000 grant would allow us to open two
  new community resource hubs in service deprived areas of LA County allowing us
  to serve an additional 80 Angelenos weekly.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  As of the first quarter of 2021, we have partnered with Occidental College’s
  Department of Critical Theory and Social Justice to examine the impact and
  well being of guests at 6-7 of our shower sites in order to fully gauge their
  behavior and the impact of our services. We measure a wide range of KPIs to
  understand and measure success in the following areas: Distance travelled to
  attend a shower site Self-reported satisfaction before and after a shower
  Reported statements on next action (e.g. are you going to see a case manager
  after the shower?) We also measure success by daily showers provided at each
  side in order to gauge how many individuals we are able to provide showers
  with on a daily and monthly basis. We want to ensure that we are setting our
  Organization up where we are truly needed and where we can meet our unhoused
  neighbors who have been overlooked.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '4000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '66000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Since our launch back in 2017, we have expanded operations across LA county
  and the wider Southern California region to provide services to our neighbors
  experiencing homelessness. At over 3,000 showers a month, we have provided
  36,000 showers to individuals experiencing homelessness in 2020 in the wider
  LA region. Despite these numbers, we know there is work to do to continue to
  provide direct access and care for Angelenos experiencing homelessness.
  LA2050, by helping us fund 2 new shower sites, can help expand access to those
  66,000 individuals. In the long term when our work is successful, we will be
  able to not only provide individuals experiencing homelessness with showers,
  but dignity that showers can entail. Through our community engagement, we
  believe that our shower sites can become a critical spoke in connecting case
  managers with individuals experiencing homelessness to build an effective
  solution towards ending homelessness in our county.
