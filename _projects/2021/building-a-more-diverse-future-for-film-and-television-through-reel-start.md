In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Reel Start is working to address the lack of entry points to the entertainment
  industry available to the diverse youth living within the city of Los Angeles.
  A 2018 study by the Center for Competitive Workforce found more than 306,000
  direct jobs in the entertainment industry, and while 49.7% of the county
  identifies as non white, a 2019 UCLA study found that women and minorities
  remain drastically underrepresented both in front and behind the camera. There
  are a multitude of causes for the issue but the Reel Start focuses on three
  main barriers. 1. Introduction of Opportunity: Unless you come from an
  industry background it's difficult to comprehend the vast number of careers
  available in the entertainment industry. 2. Entry Barrier: A lack of soft
  skills and inability to take low paying internships that block many from being
  able to get in the door. 3. Lack of Guidance: Lack of personal connections and
  professional mentors
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Reel Start is an experiential learning program designed for high schoolers
  between the ages of 16 and 20. Using an application distributed at LAUSD
  schools Reel Start recruits twelve students to form a cohort and we take that
  group through the production of their own short film in collaboration with a
  wide array of industry professionals. Over the course of the program, our
  students learn about the many elements that go into creating a film. Students
  work together to decide on an issue they want to focus on, and develop the
  idea for their film. Once the idea has been chosen, students collaborate with
  a professional screenwriter and producer to create a first draft of a script.
  They then attend hands-on workshops, visit major film and television sets, and
  meet with A-list guest speakers. It culminates with the production of their
  own short film. When Covid struck Reel Start was able to pivot to a virtual
  classroom and animation production the Los Angeles program encountered a major
  technology gap. While our students were eager the lack of access to broadband
  and laptops meant we had to suspend the LA2020 program. These same technology
  short comings were not experience by our Toronto program which lead to the
  successful piloting of our virtual program there. We now look to bring this
  virtual program to LA by addressing the technology gap head on with our LA2050
  proposal.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Reel Start is entering its 5th cycle this fall. As a young program, we are
  just beginning to see meaningful impact data as our original cohort completes
  their degrees and prepare to enter the work force. To track data and impact we
  actively keep in touch with our alumni and have been polling them each year
  year. We track a number of data points but our primary success indicators are
  the following: Percentage of Reel Start Alumni that have completed high school
  Percentage of Reel Start Alumni Enrolled in College: Percentage of Reel Start
  Alumni Pursuing Entertainment Based Degrees Percentage of Reel Start Alumni
  Who Complete College Alumni Employed in Entertainment Industry
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '24'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': ''
