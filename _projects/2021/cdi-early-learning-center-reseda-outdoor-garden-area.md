title: CDI Early Learning Center Reseda Outdoor Garden Area
project_summary: >-
  The CDI Early Learning Center (ELC) in Reseda Outdoor Garden Area will provide
  children ages 0-6 and their families in this underserved community with a
  multipurpose space to play and bond with other children and families, and
  participate in classes that promote children’s healthy development and
  parent-child attachment. Families will also have access to CDI’s free child
  developmental screening and food programs. This resource will be critical for
  helping families – primarily low-income and Latinx – recover from the COVID-19
  pandemic.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - San Fernando Valley
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Optimal brain development requires a stimulating and enriching environment,
  adequate nutrition, learning opportunities and social interaction with
  attentive caregivers. The pandemic’s disruption to everyday life has severely
  restricted access to these opportunities, compromising the healthy
  developmental trajectory of many young children (UNICEF). The families most
  impacted are those who are economically poor and unaware of the resources that
  can help them through this challenging time. The vast majority of the families
  CDI serves are low-income and Latinx. These families commonly have language
  barriers and a distrust of government agencies, which can affect their
  willingness to seek out services. Many live in dense housing areas, often in
  apartments without access to safe, developmentally appropriate play spaces.
  Our ELC is uniquely positioned to reach high-risk families who might otherwise
  shy away from formal support programs with resources to support healthy child
  development.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Replicated after our successful ELC model in Canoga Park, CDI’s new Early
  Learning Center in Reseda will connect underserved children ages 0-6 and their
  families to a multiplicity of free child development services. The Center has
  a large outdoor area, with 16 raised garden beds, that is ideal for safely
  welcoming families as we recover from the pandemic and begin to allow
  in-person activities. The outdoor garden area will provide many opportunities,
  including: 1) Safe play and leisure space. Our large, enclosed outdoor area
  will allow for children to play and for families to connect, while providing
  space to physically distance, as necessary. 2) Gardening classes. Classes will
  cover such topics as growing your own food, nutrition, cooking, and
  composting. 3) Other parent-child activities. We will offer other structured
  activities that engage children in reading, singing, movement, and sensory
  stimulation, while helping parents develop tools to support their child’s
  development. Families will also have access to CDI’s free developmental
  screening and food distribution programs. We expect most activities in our
  outdoor garden to be led by our corps of 100+ volunteers, which includes
  university and high school students, young adults with special needs,
  retirees, and others. This infusion of volunteers from different ages and
  backgrounds creates intergenerational opportunities and a shared purpose in
  building a community that is truly supportive of healthy child development.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  CDI will track quantitative data, including the number of people served;
  family participation in activities; the number of children who receive a
  developmental screening; and the number referred for additional services. We
  will also gather qualitative information on families’ behaviors, experiences,
  and perceived benefits from using the ELC. We expect outcomes similar to our
  ELC in Canoga Park. Prior to the pandemic, that ELC had grown to serve 8,000
  children and their families annually. According to an independent survey, ELC
  activities had a positive influence on families’ development of protective
  factors, even more so for regular ELC visitors who account for 80% of
  families. Over 90% of parents reported the center helped them better
  understand their child’s development. Moreover, through the ELC, we have
  provided over 1,000 developmental screenings, linking hundreds of children
  with a potential delay to additional services during a critical window for
  early intervention.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '5675'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '7500'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  This project is driven by CDI’s vision that all children will thrive in the
  care of families and communities where their needs are respected and provided
  for in culturally congruent and developmentally appropriate environments. All
  programs and services provided through this project will be based on
  Strengthening Families, an evidence-based approach that focuses on building
  five protective factors in families: parental resilience, social connections,
  concrete support in times of need, knowledge of parenting and child
  development, and social and emotional competence of children. Research has
  shown that when these protective factors are well established in a family,
  family strengths are increased, child development is enhanced, and the
  likelihood of child abuse and neglect is reduced. Our intended impact is to
  build protective factors in families; promote the development of children of
  all abilities; and ensure early identification and intervention for children
  with special needs.
