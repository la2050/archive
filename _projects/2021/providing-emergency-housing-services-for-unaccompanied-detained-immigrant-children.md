  conditions. We secure the release of minors and provide family reunification
  services, social and legal services, case management, and educational testing

  Constitutional Law Foundation, represents all detained minors and can gain
  their release to Casa Libre.

What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  In recent years, there has been an unprecedented increase in the number of
  unaccompanied children coming to the United States, fleeing violence and
  poverty in Central America. Today, thousands of children are temporarily
  housed in overcrowded border patrol and HHS facilities. Los Angeles has also
  seen a rise in inner-city homeless immigrant youth. Our sister organization,
  CHRCL Foundation, represents all detained minors nationwide in the Flores.
  case and is the only organization that can win the release of minors from
  federal custody. In their home countries, the minors we serve have often been
  abused or abandoned, and often are fleeing endemic violence. We seek to secure
  the release of minors, to help them reunite with their families, and to
  address their need for continuing education, help to legalize their
  immigration status, and case management and social services to address their
  most immediate emotional and daily needs.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Our sister organization, CHRCL Foundation, is the only organization in the
  country with the right tot access facilities where minors are detained through
  the Flores federal court case. It identifies children with no sponsors or
  sponsors who have been rejected by the Government and can secure the release
  of these minors to Casa Libre. At Casa Libre we provide a medical,
  educational, social, and legal assessment of all new residents. Our staff is
  experienced dealing with unaccompanied minors. We have collaborative
  agreements with numerous community-based organizations that help us deliver
  services to Casa Libre residents. Academic supportive services begins with an
  in-depth assessment of each new resident and their needs. The participation of
  the client in goal setting regarding their education is a critical component
  of the program. We provide family reunification services when this is a
  feasible and realistic option. We assess each resident's immigration status
  and our sister org, CHRCL Foundation, provides legal services for all
  residents. 90% of all residents win legal status. We provide medical
  assessments and treatment as needed through a partnership with the Oscar
  Romero Clinic. When family reunification is not possible, we provide services
  to transition residents to longer term safe housing in local transitional
  living programs. for youth. We provide ongoing social and legal services after
  residents leave our program.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  The shelter evaluates its effectiveness based on the number of clients
  successfully transitioned from federal custody or street living to safe and
  secure living situations, in comparison with the total number of clients
  served. We also measure our success using numerous metrics, including the
  number of residents who resume their education, the number who complete high
  school, the number reunited with families or transitioned into safe and more
  permanent housing, the number who stay drug and alcohol free, the number who
  successfully legalize their status. We measure these metrics both while minors
  are residents as well as after they graduate from the program.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '27'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '200'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Through our work LA County is a place where unaccompanied minors can land in a
  safe place while arrangements are made for family reunification or transfer to
  a transitional living program. Our program also addresses homelessness within
  Los Angeles by transitioning residents into stable living situations. Many
  detained minors have relatives living in Los Angeles who are afraid to sponsor
  the release of the child because their information may be shared with ICE and
  they may face arrest & deportation. Others may not be approved by the
  Government because of minor old arrest records or prior deportation orders.
  The services provided by Casa Libre attempt to address the gaps in healthcare,
  education, and legal representation that our residents have faced. Our program
  helps make Los Angeles a diverse community that extends a welcome hand to
  unaccompanied minors who will otherwise languish in federal custody for months
  and may eventually be deported to situations that are highly dangerous.
