title: 'Aural Atlas: Soundwalks throughout Los Angeles'
project_summary: >-
  The LA Soundwalk is your musical soundtrack to self-guided exploration of five
  of the city’s physical and human landscapes: beach, canyon, harbor, hills, and
  urban core. Through collaborations with community members, emerging composers,
  and local performers; sonic portraits of these diverse regions connect people
  with place, incite curiosity, and foster community. Anyone with a smartphone
  and headphones--from students to families and visitors--can immerse themselves
  in innovative music that sustainably interconnects, inspires, and empowers.

  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  The city of Los Angeles is vast, making it difficult for communities to feel
  connected and for citizens to connect with those in other regions and with
  backgrounds unlike their own. Visitors to the city often only superficially
  experience the incomparable mosaic of human and physical landscapes that make
  our city unique. Los Angeles is rich in diverse topographies and the diverse
  human experiences that shape them, yet incentives to leave our own
  neighborhoods or to stop and enjoy the beauty around us can be difficult to
  find, monotonous, or costly. While curricula across the city’s schools teach
  the history and culture of this place, experiences outside the classroom can
  feel uninspired or unattainable. Further, young composers, performers, and
  creatives lack opportunities to authentically showcase their work, and
  experimental choral music itself can appear esoteric and unattainable despite
  its ability to encapsulate the hybridity and complexity of the city’s history
  and inhabitants.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  The LA City Soundwalk allows both residents and visitors an ongoing, free, and
  unique opportunity to explore the various and diverse regions and communities
  of the city through interactive, self-paced sonic experiences that are based
  on and developed by the citizens of those regions. Tentative regions = Canyon:
  Franklin Canyon, Hollywood; Beach: Santa Monica Pier, Westside; Harbor: San
  Pedro, South Bay; City: Urban Core, Downtown; Hills: Kenneth Hahn Park,
  Mid-City. Anyone with a smartphone and headphones can travel to one of the
  Soundwalk sites and immerse themselves--on their own time and in their own
  way--in the multifaceted places that make LA special. Teachers can utilize
  this free resource to enhance pre-existing curricula, and community leaders
  can offer it to highlight the unique spirit of their neighborhood. Launch
  parties, staggered throughout the year, sustain interest and ensure that
  people of many backgrounds engage in the opportunity to connect with others
  and with the land. The music itself will interconnect and hybridize
  techniques, genres, and performance styles, using innovative technology to
  uplift experimental choral music and engage new audiences through accessible
  compositions and immersive experiences. Through targeted outreach and
  collaboration, not only will the experiences authentically leverage the
  diverse voices of the city, but they will also transform the city into a
  platform to showcase young talent through innovative, sustainable public art.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  We are currently hosting SOUNDWALK in Griffith Park. Ticket sales are one key
  indicator, in addition to feedback collected from participants, composers,
  performers, and collaborators. A short documentary will depict some of this
  feedback, and basic demographic information collected in registration allows
  for evaluation of outreach. The quality of the works themselves also reflects
  the fulfillment of an ambitious musical goal. The extension of this project
  will include additional methods of measuring impact. Data from registrations
  in both launch parties as well as ongoing, self-guided experiences will
  measure the scope of impact. Some pieces may include interactive elements in
  which participants reflect on their observations and share through a public
  installation or online forum. Partnerships with music educators and other
  creators in the city will also indicate the possibilities provided by the
  endeavor. We may also produce an album and collect data on streaming this free
  resource.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '6220'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '10000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  These organic, authentic creations will cause participants to feel a deeper
  connection to the city and its inhabitants, sparking curiosity and fostering
  empathy. The music uplifts diverse voices through collaboration and the
  elevation of emerging composers and local performers. Pieces intentionally
  reflect the character of varied neighborhoods, enticing both residents and
  visitors to explore beyond the habitual and superficial. The LA City
  Soundwalks will become a lasting way in which individuals and communities
  connect with their city and with one another. The Soundwalks can live on in
  perpetuity, free of charge, and visitors can return and experience the piece
  and place in a unique way each time. The Soundwalks will become opportunities
  to learn about the city and about experimental choral music. Launch parties
  will bring people together. Lesson plans based on the Soundwalks will address
  the history and culture of the place as well as the collaborative, innovative
  artistic process.
