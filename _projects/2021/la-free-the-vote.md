title: LA Free the Vote
project_summary: >-
  LA Free the Vote is an initiative to civically engage the justice system
  impacted community. We inform individuals of their rights, register them to
  vote, and educate voters on salient policy issues, particularly those related
  to criminal justice reform. By helping to bring this community to the polls,
  we are building the power of those who have been disenfranchised, restoring
  formerly incarcerated individuals’ sense of integration into society and
  advocating for policies that promote racial justice and economic opportunity
  for all.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Recent legal reforms now enable more people with a felony on their record in
  Los Angeles County to be eligible to vote. However, most of the nearly 36,000
  probationers in LA County are unaware of their eligibility and are unlikely to
  show up to vote without encouragement. Among this population, 16% are ages
  18-24 and 77% are people of color, making this an issue of not only access,
  but racial equity. The voices of those impacted by the criminal justice
  system, who are disproportionately Black and Brown, are critical to our
  democracy. Voting provides a sense of belonging and agency within society and
  can therefore be a transformative piece of an individual’s reentry process.
  More, decisions that maintain oppressive structures and systems too often
  exclude the input of those who have been harmed by those systems. For true
  criminal justice reform to occur, the people most impacted by the unjust and
  racialized systems have to be at the center of decision making about where we
  go from here.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  LA Voice will implement a civic education and engagement strategy that will
  educate 1500 justice-involved individuals about their eligibility to vote and
  why voting matters, register 1000 justice-involved individuals, and get 1000
  justice individuals to commit to civic engagement around criminal justice
  policies and voting in 2022. To achieve these goals, we will develop
  leadership among justice involved community members, training them to work
  alongside LA Voice organizers in conducting outreach with partner
  organizations, the Office of Diversion and Reentry (ODR) and other county
  agencies, churches and other community spaces. Our team will focus on voter
  registration and voter education drives in LA County. Additionally, we will
  host a townhall event featuring significant participation by big names in the
  criminal justice reform space in November for National Voter Registration Day.
  Based on our success in 2020, we know that this work makes a real impact in
  elections. We need now to build engagement in interim elections and remain in
  contact both with those system impacted individuals who voted and those who
  did not. We must continue to build our community’s power to hold lawmakers
  accountable. The California state legislature is proposing several bills
  around criminal justice, and we have the opportunity now to build awareness of
  the initiatives that will create alternatives to incarceration, usher in
  police reform, and restore dignity to individuals and communities.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  LA Voice has played a crucial role in the nonpartisan LA County voter
  engagement infrastructure since 2011, turning out tens of thousands of
  low-income voters, people of color, and returning citizens. Through our Free
  the Vote work in 2020 in partnership with ODR, we turned out 580 justice
  system impacted individuals at the polls who otherwise might not have voted.
  We achieved this feat despite the challenges of a global pandemic through
  activities like public events, workshops and trainings, phone banking,
  in-person outreach, and social media. We track and report all data related to
  outreach efforts, civic engagement activities, and voter registrations with
  two tools: PDI and BLOCS. Based on our data, we know that LA Voice voters turn
  out at a rate at least 10% higher than the average voter in LA County. This is
  due to our highly effective model of relational organizing, which builds on
  relationships in communities and local leadership to mobilize high rates of
  civic engagement.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1500'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '6000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  At LA Voice, we are dedicated to increasing the number of justice involved
  individuals who are aware of their right to vote and committed to exercising
  that right. In the short term, LA Free the Vote aims to get 500 system
  impacted individuals to the polls, armed with the information they need to use
  their voice in legislative decisions that impact their lives. We aim to
  empower more folks like Karl, a justice system impacted individual who voted
  for the first time at age 56. “LA Voice helped me understand what was on the
  ballot in layman’s terms. I knew what I was voting for and the results that I
  was looking for.” We work to awaken people to their power through action and
  education so that our systems reflect the needs and interests of our most
  vulnerable citizens. When all members of a community have a say in the systems
  and services available to them, lives are transformed, recidivism is reduced,
  and democracy is strengthened, leading to a stronger, more connected Los
  Angeles.
