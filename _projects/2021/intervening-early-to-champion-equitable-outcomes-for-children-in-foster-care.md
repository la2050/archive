title: Intervening Early to Champion Equitable Outcomes for Children in Foster Care
project_summary: >-
  The Alliance for Children’s Rights is dedicated to promoting change that will
  make life better and more equitable for children and youth in foster care,
  including ensuring that trauma-sensitivity is integrated into learning
  environments for children recovering from neglect or abuse. With this project,
  the Alliance will focus on early intervention, prevention, and education
  efforts that can improve outcomes for those impacted by Los Angeles’s child
  welfare system. Better outcomes for our community’s foster youth will lead us
  to a better L.A.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Children in the foster care system face unique challenges that impact their
  access to an equitable education. Of the 38,000 children in the foster care
  system in L.A., the majority live in poverty, 80% are children of color, and
  50% have disabilities. The trauma they have experienced – through no fault of
  their own – increases the likelihood of learning and behavioral problems,
  lowers academic outcomes, and causes difficulty in regulating emotions.
  Children of color in foster care with disabilities face biases that cause over
  and underrepresentation in special education and harsh school discipline. This
  often results in poor outcomes for these youth. In fact, California’s foster
  youth have a 56% graduation rate compared to 85% of all students. The Covid-19
  pandemic has further heightened the need to address the wide equity gap that
  exists in our education system. For those birth to age 5, the impacts and
  risks are even more acute during this critical window of child development.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  We seek to utilize an innovative and unique combination of direct advocacy,
  caregiver engagement, and professional training to ensure children in foster
  care are heading toward a better future, and our community is heading toward a
  more equitable L.A. Our Education Program will advocate for babies and
  toddlers, during this critical window where 90% of brain development occurs,
  to access life-changing early childhood education. We will ensure that they
  are getting assessed to identify their special needs, enrolled at regional
  centers and school districts for early intervention services, and receiving
  any compensatory services due to Covid-19 closures. We also will educate the
  families with these young children in their care, on the importance of early
  childhood interventions to mitigate the effects of trauma and developmental
  delays in babies and toddlers. We will teach these caregivers and parents to
  identify and understand developmental milestones and how to navigate the
  complex system of early intervention services for their children. At the same
  time, to promote equity and improve the educational systems these children
  will soon enter, we will train school professionals on identifying and
  reducing racial bias in school and on how to create trauma-informed learning
  environments that meet the needs of foster children so they can remain in the
  classroom, heal, and learn.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  We document and evaluate our work through detailed case files that track
  issues presented, services provided, and demographics for all cases. Through
  weekly case reviews, the program director meets with staff to troubleshoot
  individual cases, streamline and improve processes for service delivery, and
  identify new areas for training and resource development. For the education
  and training sessions we conduct (remotely when necessary), we measure impact
  by number of participants and estimate from there the number of children we
  will reach. To evaluate progress towards proposed outcomes, we will monitor
  the following indicators and benchmarks: 1. Number of children receiving
  services and support to obtain early education interventions. 2. Number of
  caregivers educated on the importance of early childhood interventions. 3.
  Number of professionals trained to identify and reduce racial bias in
  education and to create trauma-informed learning environments.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '500'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '3000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Within the one-year grant period, we hope that: 1. At least 100 children age 0
  to 5 will receive advocacy services and support from our team of staff and
  volunteer attorneys to obtain critical early education interventions,
  including compensatory services necessitated by the pandemic, to prepare them
  for kindergarten and beyond. 2. 100 caregivers will be educated on the
  importance of early childhood interventions to mitigate the effects of trauma
  or developmental delays in babies and toddlers; how to watch for signs of
  developmental delay; and how to navigate complex early intervention systems to
  access services for their children. 3. 300 professionals will be trained to
  identify and reduce racial bias in school and to create trauma-informed
  learning environments that reduce disparities and promote equity. In achieving
  these, we will be making meaningful gains for those impacted and toward our
  vision of a more equitable and racially just education system in L.A.
