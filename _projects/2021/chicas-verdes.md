title: Chicas Verdes
project_summary: >-
  We want to help create a world where young people understand the connection
  they have to nature and each other and are prepared to live up to the
  responsibilities of being a good global citizen. We bring students into
  community gardens where they can establish roots and develop as socially
  minded leaders so that they can spread their positive influence wherever they
  go.

What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Chicas Verdes brings kids into nature who would otherwise not have access to
  green space because of the zip code they live in. We believe that a connection
  nature is pivotal in order to create the future leaders we need. By providing
  students with access to nature, they have the opportunity to play and
  experience joy, which promotes physical and mental health. Once students have
  a healthy base, they develop the self-esteem and self-awareness necessary to
  foster healthy relationships. From there, students develop a sense of
  community and trust among one another. This sense of community and trust is
  pivotal if we want students to take advantage of opportunities to learn and
  develop. Oftentimes, students experience an affective filter that prevents
  them from taking advantage of these opportunities. It is our goal to strip
  them of these barriers so that they can achieve their full potential and
  develop into our future leaders.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Chicas Verdes is an innovative after-school program that provides: A community
  garden where students can play, experience joy, and appreciate beauty
  Knowledge on how to strengthen one’s mental and physical health Guidance on
  enhancing one’s self-esteem and self-awareness Team-building activities that
  foster healthy relationships A platform for engaging local communities and
  generating trust among fellow humans Access to new learning and development
  opportunities Role models that can mentor students as they strive to create a
  better future Chicas Verdes students meet in a garden after school for three
  hours twice a week and experience a three part curriculum that covers self,
  nature, and society. During the first 30 minutes of our time together,
  students learn about self. We discuss nutrition and self care, get to know
  each other and build trust through team-building activities, and have time to
  play and develop social and emotional skills. The next hour is spent on
  nature. Students work in the garden and learn about agriculture and
  horticulture, ecosystems, and appreciation of beauty. The last 90 minutes,
  students learn about society. Students discuss social justice, environmental
  justice, and leadership and entrepreneurship. During this time, students hear
  from guest speakers and implement community based solutions to the societal
  problems they learn about. Students run weekly food giveaways and monthly
  community workshops about healthy, sustainable living.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Impact is measured through qualitative testimonials and quantitative data.
  Students in the program complete quarterly assessments that measure
  self-esteem, self-awareness, sense of community, and the impact they believe
  they have in the community. Students also provide testimonials that showcase
  the impact of our work. Here's what some of our students have to say: “Chicas
  Verdes makes me feel like I’m wanted somewhere. I’m not alone, and I’m enough
  for being who I am”; “When I put my hands in the dirt, the first thing that
  comes to mind is how I can change my life to be, just, happier”; “Chicas
  Verdes taught me that if I truly believe in something, like making a change,
  it can actually happen”. We also track the impact of the projects students are
  implementing in the community. For example, since May of 2020, students have
  worked with over 150 volunteers to distribute over 1.3 million pounds of
  produce and 1000 masks to 47,000 families through our weekly giveaway program.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '60'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '47000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  If our work is successful, LA students will be equipped with the social and
  emotional support necessary to become socially minded leaders who promote
  volunteerism and community connection within their neighborhoods. There will
  be a greater sense of community and care for one another that is developed
  through community workshops and community service projects. LA students will
  have a personal connection to nature and in turn will care for the environment
  and make personal choices that will help us create a healthier world for all.
  Students will be equipped with the skills, knowledge, and resources necessary
  to live a healthy sustainable lifestyle. They will become stewards of our
  mission and share their love of nature and their community with others.
