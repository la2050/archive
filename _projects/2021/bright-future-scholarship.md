What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  These stunning statistics show the reality of college education for homeless
  and foster youth: 87% of homeless youth are more likely to drop out of college
  than their non-homeless peers and less than 4% of youth raised in foster care
  will graduate college. Furthermore, more than 95% of jobs created during an
  economic recovery have gone to workers with at least some college education,
  while those with a high school diploma or less are being left behind. While
  homeless and foster youth may wish to pursue higher education, the stark
  reality is they lack funds to do so. They also lack a network of support and
  an awareness of resources to see their dreams through. Other barriers include
  limited financial means to live independently and safely, and connection with
  adults or agencies that could help. Education is key to breaking the cycle of
  poverty and establishing economic mobility. It is the only way to prevent
  today’s homeless youth from becoming the next generation of homeless adults.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  BFS is the only scholarship program in existence solely for homeless and
  foster youth for LAUSD students. This reflects the League’s commitment to
  create programming with there is the greatest need in community and establish
  long range programming. The League wants homeless and foster youth to not only
  attend college but also to graduate. Therefore, scholarship awardees receive
  funding throughout their college career, either for two-year or four-year
  programs. Students are typically awarded $1,500 per year and continue to
  receive scholarships as long as they provide proof of college enrollment and
  maintain a 2.0 GPA. Members of the League’s Board of Directors serve as the
  Scholarship Committee and select the recipients to be awarded using a rubric
  with criteria based on need and character. Selections are made without
  discrimination or bias toward ethnic, racial, national, cultural, sexual, or
  physical differences. All applicants must have a strong academic record and
  demonstrate a commitment to their community. The application requires high
  school transcripts, a personal statement, and written recommendations on
  behalf of the candidate. Awards are issued either directly to the college for
  tuition, or to the awardee for their school supplies, books, or general
  expenses such as food. As 36% of college students polled nationwide report
  that they struggle with having enough money for necessities such as food and
  housing, BFS money can be used at the student’s discretion.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Bright Future Scholarship has been in existence since 2017. We measure the
  success of our program by the number of awardees remaining in college and
  graduating. We have awarded 48 students with scholarships and the first 12
  student awardees of this program will be graduating this year with a
  bachelor’s degree. The other 36 students are still enrolled in college. That
  is a 100% success rate! The League has been informed by the director of
  LAUSD’s Homeless Education Office (HEO) that we offer the only program of its
  kind specifically for homeless and foster youth. Additionally, our program is
  even more unique because we continue to remain in contact with the students
  throughout their two or four-year education, sending letters of encouragement,
  providing gift bags, and offering continuous support. If a student should need
  to temporarily drop out due to various life challenges, BFS is flexible and
  will continue to provide support once they return to college.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '20'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  L.A. County will have 20 fewer homeless and/or aged-out foster youth on the
  streets who need social services. Formerly homeless or foster youth can
  positively impact family, friends, partners, children, educators, employers,
  businesses, and government agencies and become contributive community members.
  A prime example is Jacqueline who, thanks in part to her BFS award, graduated
  college without student loans and with a BS in business management. In foster
  care from the age of five due to an alcoholic mother and father in prison for
  life, she was recently accepted to UCLA’s Master’s in Public Policy program.
  She wants to work at the state/federal level to create, change and implement
  policies that directly impact the child welfare system. She also wants to open
  a non-profit to focus on higher education for foster youth. The positive
  affect of Jacqueline’s efforts will be far-reaching locally and nationally she
  when implements her vision to create a brighter future for foster youth.
