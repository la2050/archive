'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Applying a proven model or solution to a new issue or sector (e.g., using a
  job recruiting software or strategy to match clients to supportive housing
  sites, applying demonstrated strategies from advocating for college
  affordability to advocating for housing affordability and homelessness, etc.)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  A shocking 70% of California’s community college students fail to graduate or
  transfer. A new study conducted by the Institute for Higher Education
  Leadership & Policy at Cal State Sacramento and reported by the Los Angeles
  Times found that the large majority of community college students failed to
  obtain a degree or transfer to a four-year institution. These students
  typically dropped out – some with a significant amount of debt and no degree
  to help them. According to a report at the Los Angeles Times, the study showed
  that about one-fifth of full-time college students who enroll in school do not
  make it to their second year. No degree and a whole lot of debt. Many of those
  students are recipients of federal and state grants, as well as other
  government appropriations that ultimately come out of the taxpayers’ pockets.
  The main problem is that high schools do not have enough college and career
  counselors for all the students who need a written plan to succeed.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Studies show that this problem is mostly affecting Latino and African American
  students in low-income and underserved communities throughout Los Angeles
  County. It is important to increase the number of residents who have a
  bachelors or higher education since lack of higher education degree has a
  direct relation with unemployment, lower income potential, higher delinquency,
  and incarceration rate in Los Angeles County. Researchers cite parent-family
  community involvement as a key to addressing the school dropout crisis and
  note that strong school-family-community partnerships foster higher
  educational aspirations and more motivated students. The evidence holds true
  for students at both the elementary and secondary level, regardless of the
  parent’s education, family income, or background—and the research shows parent
  involvement affects minority students’ academic achievement across all races
  including their ability to graduate from a college with a degree. Our
  innovative program addresses the key issues that causes that residents of Los
  Angeles County do not graduate with a bachelor's or high degree. 1. Parent
  involvement in schools. 2. Parent, Student and College and Career Counselor
  involvement in the planning of higher education. 3. Guidance that support the
  student during the first years of college.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  We have a track record of success in educating families and students at LAUSD
  and schools located in Los Angeles County. During the past 14 years, we have
  been working hard to provide college planning education at schools through our
  interactive parent/student education workshops. We have come to the conclusion
  that in order to increase the number of students who graduate with a
  bachelor's degree or higher, it takes having a written plan. It takes the
  guidance of a caring and knowledge College and Career Counselor who the
  student and parents can relate to.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '2500'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '5500'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  By addressing the key factors that contribute to residents of Los Angeles
  County not graduating with a bachelor's degree, we will make Los Angeles a
  better place for all. We are confident that the implementation of our proven
  and innovative program will contribute to a significant increase in the number
  of students who graduate from college with a degree. It is often said that it
  takes a village to raise a child. When it comes to college planning, the vast
  majority of parents and students in low income and underserved communities are
  clueless about how they will make it happen. College and Career Counselors at
  the schools are totally overwhelmed and at best they can only provide basic
  guidance. By providing personalized one-on-one guidance to the parents and the
  students are experience has shown that the number of students who graduate
  from college or a university increases greatly.
