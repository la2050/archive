title: >-
  What did $4.3 billion in public works and transportation dollars buy the City
  of Los Angeles? No one really knows.
project_summary: >-
  Many officials point to a lack of funding to explain the disparate and
  dilapidated state of the City’s streets, sidewalks, crosswalks, street
  lighting, bus shelters, and public transit options. But we are not sure that’s
  the answer. Since 2014, over $4.3 billion have gone to transportation and
  public works projects in the City of Los Angeles alone. Where is our current
  funding going, and how is that funding being prioritized?

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Los Angeles is the only large city in the US that currently lacks a capital
  infrastructure plan. No one has a clear picture of where billions of public
  works and transportation funds have gone over the years, and there is no
  public accessible funding plan for future investments.The lack of transparency
  leaves Angelenos in the dark about projects that would benefit their
  neighborhood, as well as what is budgeted by policymakers. Transportation is
  more than just how we get around, it is one of the primary determinants of
  whether Angelenos can access opportunities across the region. However, current
  transportation infrastructure does not adequately address the needs of the
  diverse communities and cultures that make up Los Angeles. Transportation
  policies in Los Angeles continue to foster inequities, which will only worsen
  without an affirmative commitment by the City to reorganize our transportation
  networks around racial justice, procedural equity and community-led solutions.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Our plan is to 1) work with the City to get an breakdown of how they currently
  allocate and spend public works and transportation funds 2) identity the needs
  and prioritize the basic infrastructure needs first not last, and 3) work
  together with advocacy, organizing groups, and community members to support a
  budgeting process that allows investments to be centered around social and
  racial justice, procedural equity, budget transparency and accountability, as
  well as long-range planning. This effort would provide transparency on how
  funding has been distributed over the years, as well as included
  recommendations and strategies for change. We plan to track the transportation
  and public works funds that the City receives, the majority of which comes
  from hundreds of millions allocated to Los Angeles every year from our four
  countywide transportation sales taxes. This new information and analysis on
  where the City is prioritizing public works and transportation funding will
  serve policymakers and staff, and community organizations by co-creating, for
  the first time, a public works and transportation budget for the City of Los
  Angeles. Our research and advocacy will include learning from other cities. We
  will collaborate with allies inside and outside City Hall to share our
  findings and to dialogue with partners to shape a series of recommendations.
  Our project is also focused on co-powering processes with other community
  groups looking to engage in budget advocacy in the City.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  The City of Los Angeles’s lack of a capital infrastructure plan and lack of
  transparency for public works and transportation budgets has repeatedly come
  up through our work in advocating for accessible and safe sidewalks, bus-only
  lanes, bus shelters, Vision Zero, and our Moms and Mobility campaign. We have
  been addressing this issue on our blog posts since 2017. In 2020, we asked
  alongside 20 moms across the City for budget information on projects including
  Safe Routes to School, Vision Zero, the Sidewalk Repair Program, etc. The
  tragic response from City staff: no one had that information available. We
  support strong community organizing and advocacy within the City to see public
  works and transportation investments that meet the needs of our neighborhoods
  and communities, and a key part of that is improving how people can engage
  with the City budget and capital planning processes. To be successful, we need
  to know where our funds have gone to plan where they should go.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '200'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '3000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Success means that Los Angeles will be a place where transportation and public
  works budgets are transparent and accessible, where people will have the tools
  to effectively engage with the City around public works and transportation
  funding decisions. Success means seeing the City of Los Angeles develop a
  publicly accessible capital infrastructure plan, one that dramatically
  improves coordination between departments and with public safety, public
  health, and transportation outcomes in the public right of way. Our vision of
  success is grounded in the goal of dramatically increasing procedural equity
  and embedding racial justice in Los Angeles public works and transportation
  funding decisions. A public policy process that values procedural equity has
  the potential to support inclusive, accessible and authentic engagement with
  decision making processes, as well as accountability for historical and
  ongoing inequities on the current process.
