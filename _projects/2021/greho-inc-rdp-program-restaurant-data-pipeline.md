title: GREHO Inc. - RDP Program (Restaurant Data Pipeline)
project_summary: >-
  Impact through Data Literacy: Food service is one of LA's biggest industries
  and economic contributors. In a critical post-pandemic phase, our restaurants
  need all the tools they can use to sustain themselves. Data utility or its
  lack thereof has critical real world implications for restaurants. The RDP
  Program will help restaurants learn how to use data and: 1.) Receive
  personalized data training and mentorship 2.) Design, Build and Deploy their
  own data pipeline The goal is to facilitate business success through data
  based skill-building

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - East LA
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  There are over 25,000 restaurants in LA County and many more in the
  surrounding neighborhoods. They are an integral part of our community and can
  be considered the cornerstone of the small business economy. Given the
  pandemic, many of them have unfortunately had to close permanently or face
  loan debt and foreclosure due to dwindling sales and business restrictions.
  GREHO aims to empower these restaurants with the knowledge and capability to
  learn the basics of data, how it can be used to better understand their
  business, and potentially use that understanding to improve their sales. The
  families that run these restaurants depend on their businesses for their
  livelihood and it’s our community’s responsibility to reach out to them and
  help them as much as we can in these difficult times. At this critical point
  in time, restaurant owners are struggling to stay afloat and pay their
  employees. This has only gotten worse with the pandemic’s surge and the key to
  solving it may lie in data.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  The GREHO RDP (Restaurant Data Pipeline) Program is a community based
  initiative to assist restaurants and introduce them to data frameworks and
  business problem solving through data. The effects of the pandemic have been
  catastrophic for the restaurant industry. Our program will be driven by
  knowledge transfer, training and skill building. Through the different sprints
  of the program, GREHO aims to help the participating restaurant teams learn
  the basics of data, how data can be utilized to better understand their
  business and how data pipelines can be initiated and deployed. The hope is to
  educate and train the restaurant teams to help them become self-sufficient
  enough to build their own data pipelines post completion of the program.
  Program Sprints: - Sprint 1: Introduce restaurant to data pipelines, data
  analytics strategies and pipeline implementation lifecycles - Sprint 2:
  Identify existing data pipeline frameworks for restaurants if any - Sprint 3:
  Initiate the set up and implementation of highest priority data pipeline for
  restaurants with recommendations and consulting When data analytics is
  utilized to solve problems, it results in interesting learning, development of
  problem solving acumen and a data rich environment that can be used to
  understand and engage better with challenges. By training restaurants in the
  basics of data and data utility in business, we are equipping them with a
  business skill that’s critical for their survival and success.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Success Definition: Our success definition is very straightforward. We measure
  the restaurant’s performance and growth before and after the RDP program
  implementation. Success Measurement: How we measure success varies from
  restaurant to restaurant and the type of food service that the restaurant
  offers. Another variable that drives success measurement is the type of data
  pipeline that the restaurant chooses to implement. Qualitative Reference
  Metrics/Outcomes: Order Metrics: - Avg Order Count/day/week - Average Order
  Amt/day/week - Total Order Amt/day/week/month Finance Metrics: - Daily
  turnover - Monthly Revenue - Operational Costs/day - Sales/qtr Kitchen
  Metrics: - COGS (Cost of goods sold) The long-term outcomes of the project
  will be (1) increased self-sufficiency across restaurants leading to
  generational economic advancement for owners, employees and their families (2)
  a skilled and technologically advanced workforce (3) a smarter and more
  successful Los Angeles.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1250'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '40000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Restaurants form the cornerstone of the economic strength and cultural
  influence that LA County has globally. People from all over the world travel
  to LA to experience our eclectic and diverse mix of cultures and a huge part
  of that cultural mix are our restaurants and the food they serve. We’ll be
  able to help prevent foreclosures of hundreds of restaurants and aid the
  sustenance and success of the surviving restaurants through this program.
  Restaurants will not only be able to gather data, but effectively interpret
  and put that data into action so they succeed in understanding and meeting
  diners’ expectations. The restaurant industry in LA will benefit from program
  skills that teach owners to capture, structure, interpret and apply data to
  their businesses. It can also provide restaurants with effective solutions and
  game-changing strategies, whether that’s a taco truck or an ice cream store.
  Success and growth of restaurants will lead to increased revenue and job
  creation.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  Our partner organization “ Quien Es Tu Vecindario” is our fiscal sponsor for
  this application. Since we are a recently formed nonprofit and it is going to
  take us a while to receive our exemption status certificate, our partner
  organization has volunteered to help us out with that part. It is owned by one
  of our board members and the goals of both organizations are well aligned
  serving the communities of East Hollywood. We believe that our team has the
  potential to successfully deploy this program and drive some real world impact
  that results in the success and growth of restaurants in LA County.
