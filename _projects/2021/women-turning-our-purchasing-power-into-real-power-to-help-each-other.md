  Women made $7 trillion of US consumer and business purchases, over 85%, while
  women founders got only 2.2% of venture capital. It’s time we aggregate our
  purchasing power back to ourselves. This is the path to maximize impact, women
  were disproportionately impacted by the pandemic and its time we take control
  of our main source of power, our purchasing.

  Reimagining shopping with story driven commerce We are first to market with
  the new format mixing shopping, entertainment, community and empathy to propel
  women founders and their brands forward, selling to gen x and millennial
  women. A number of factors make this timely: POLITICAL FACTORS Largest amount
  of women in Congress in history and first female VP gives an opportunity to
  create policies to bring about more equality. SOCIAL FACTORS The #Metoo and
  Women’s March movements have emboldened women to speak out about the
  inequality they experience in their lives. ECONOMICAL FACTORS 5 million women
  lost their jobs, venture funding to women founders dropped to 2.2%, while
  women made $7 trillion in consumer and business purchases in US alone.
  TECHNOLOGICAL FACTORS E-commerce has grown 44% in last year with live video
  commerce driving 14% of e-commerce sales in China. Daily Shows & Live Streams
  and Showcase Events will highlight diverse founder stories, creating economic
  and cultural empowerment for women.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  We will define success by success of our founders and alignment with their
  interests. By driving revenue, showcasing diverse founders, and helping with
  resources and audience, we will help our founders be successful and leverage a
  much larger pool of resources to drive purchases.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1500'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '150000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  We leverage edutainment to help other women launch their own businesses, in
  the vein of how early tech company employees see how its done and can start
  their own (think the PayPal mafia). We are in a unique position as a city to
  leverage our incredible storytelling (Hollywood), retail/CPG expertise
  (fashion district), and tech (Silicon Beach). But rather than isolating one
  physical location, we can bring this to the entire city, and create much
  needed empathy across different cultures, industries and socio-economic groups
  by showing diverse women founders in leadership roles that are not portrayed
  currently by mainstream media.
