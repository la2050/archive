title: '#MicroFoodFarmGardens For LA Residents'
project_summary: >-
  Our project transforms unused, vacant, and or distressed spaces around LA &
  South LA into green equitable, fresh food access spaces we call
  (MicroFoodFarmGardens). These FoodFarmGardens provide LA residents a healthier
  and more food secure way of accessing high-quality natural produce locally.
  With local food deserts rising, and declining access to affordable natural
  foods, it’s left Los Angelenos food insecure and without sustainable options.
  The Niles Foundation is changing the way we all live.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - South LA
  - South Bay
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  #1 The CDC's “preventing chronic disease” study on The Food Environment in 3
  Neighborhoods in South Los Angeles found that food access, availability,
  quality, and marketing practices in south LA are health, wellness, and food
  access problems, solutions exist. #2 According to the LA Almanac, West Los
  Angeles and El Segundo’s household income levels exceed or meet the median of
  63k by almost 30%, while LA, South LA, and subdivisions like Inglewood at
  29.3k-45.k per household income are 28-46%. Solutions CDC found that we the
  Niles Foundation have begun implementing, is converting LA's corners and
  unhealthy food sources into food farms and food gardens. This helps to prevent
  chronic disease, increase food access, and food security, which USC’s
  Dornsiife’s recent study on LA residents and food insecurity shows that one in
  four individuals can't afford to pay for food. We're changing the narrative
  for South LA with food access and security, better air, and increased
  community equity.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  We’re creating MicroFoodFarmGarden Sites in LA & South LA where food deserts
  are increasing, transforming their rooftops, yards, lawns, unused, or vacant
  lots into local neighborhood food access and food secure spaces. Our program
  maintains our environments through preservation, support, and awareness by
  increasing our green spaces, and development for the County of Los Angeles.
  The education and research of pollinator species and plants, as well as herbs,
  have become essential to our site's ecosystem balance and therapeutic
  purposes. Our program promotes healthy living through fresh food access,
  increasing food sovereignty, and addressing food desserts through
  project-based learning. We're training members on how to grow their own food,
  and providing access to other sustainable quality food options. Our programs
  increase life skills through gardening, farming, and cooking have been
  integrated into training offered to families, as part of our program
  activities. We’re employing our local residents with good quality jobs and
  planting anti-smog trees for better air quality. In addition, it provides safe
  CDC standard guidelines for community engagement of all residents, volunteers,
  schools, and businesses, to become growers and trainers alongside families in
  our programs. All activities of this project increase individual and community
  equity while creating a more well-balanced option for the long-term wellness
  and health of LA and South LA residents.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  1. Increased air quality of multiple South LA areas 2. Healthier Families 3.
  Awareness of the benefits of urban agriculture 4. Employment for local
  residents 5. CDC Safety Covid-19 followed guidelines for food distribution 6.
  Thousands of pounds of food produced. 7. Hundreds of families food secure per
  site. 8. Chemical Free Vegetation Locally Our long-term solutions produce
  roughly 1000-10,000 lbs of locally grown fresh food per site, per year. We’re
  increasing the overall health of our residents, living environments,
  stimulating education, awareness, and economic development directly and
  indirectly. Without continuous converted unused spaces, for sustainable fresh
  food, what will LA look like? We must build more food stable, food secure,
  food affordable, and food accessible neighborhoods because this is what our LA
  residents want.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '5000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '20000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  We’re creating MicroFoodFarmGarden Sites in LA & South LA where food deserts
  are increasing, transforming their rooftops, yards, lawns, unused, or vacant
  lots into local neighborhood food access and food secure spaces. We grow our
  seedlings with all-natural and harmful free pesticides. We conserve water by
  using water-conserving soils and recyclable natural and biodegradable
  materials. We’re increasing volunteer hours virtually and in-person CDC
  Covid-19 standards safely. We’re providing long-term sustainable solutions
  that can produce roughly 1000-10,000 lbs locally of fresh food per site, per
  year. We’re increasing the overall health of our residents, our living
  environments, and stimulating education, awareness, and economic development
  directly and indirectly. Our success feeds nearly three cities in South LA
  alone, for food security, tens of jobs are created for local food desert area
  residents, increased air quality for all, and more beautiful sustainable
  spaces.
