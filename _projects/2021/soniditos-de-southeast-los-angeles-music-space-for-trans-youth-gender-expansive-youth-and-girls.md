  Soniditos de Southeast Los Angeles: Music Space for Trans Youth, Gender
  Expansive Youth, and Girls
project_summary: >-
  Chicxs Rockerxs South East Los Angeles (CRSELA) aims to create a space where
  trans youth, gender expansive youth and girls can access resources,
  mentorship, and music education in Southeast Los Angeles. We envision an
  after-school space where participants can grab a snack after music lessons and
  receive homework help before going home. An inter-generational space where
  trans, gender, expansive, and women musicians, artists, and activists can
  teach the next generation of southeast LA youth.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - South LA
  - 'Other:: Southeast Los Angeles'
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  There is currently no geographically and financially accessible space for
  music education in Southeast LA that aims to increase the visibility of women,
  Trans and gender expansive musicians of color in music. From 2012 to 2018,
  only 9.7% of commercially successful artists were women of color (WOC). It is
  more difficult to assess that of the LGBT+ community due to a lack of
  research/documentation. LGBT+ youth also experience higher rates of suicide.
  According to the CDC, 70% of Latino LGBT girls felt sad and hopeless almost
  everyday. 95% of Southeast LA identifies as Latino and the median household
  income is two-thirds of the LA County average. 56% of households have a higher
  housing cost of burden than the California average. Research shows that those
  same households spend less on food and other essentials meaning many families
  cannot afford to purchase basic gear for their children to pursue an interest
  in music-making, much less pay for private instruction.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  A physical location in Southeast Los Angeles will provide a consistent space
  for our free and sliding scale programming to call home. Our space will be
  used for music and workshops to encourage creativity, critical thinking,
  conflict resolution, teamwork, self-confidence and leadership. Music lessons
  through our Soniditos program will offer weekly instrument lessons for
  participants ages 8 to 17. Beginner or advanced classes will be offered on
  guitar, bass, vocals, drums, and keyboard. Lxs Sobrinxs, our youth organizing
  team, will use the space for meetings, workshops, or to host events they want
  to see throughout the year. Once a month, our Future Me! series will offer
  workshops and hold space for teens to talk about college, careers, and
  planning for their futures. Since our programming will take place after school
  during dinner hours, providing dinner and snacks is essential to ensuring
  participants can focus on learning their instrument, organizing, or planning
  for their future. Additionally, after school programming oftentimes conflicts
  with working class parents' work schedules, so early drop off and extended
  pick up hours are imperative to offering fully accessible programming.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  We will define and measure success with pre and post programming surveys from
  our youth participants as well as from their parents/guardians. These surveys
  are anonymous and include questions on participant self-confidence,
  satisfaction of programming, suggestions, and likelihood of participating in
  the future. Volunteers will also submit post-programming surveys on their
  experience and year-round employees will participate in self-evaluations. To
  show the demand of our program, we will track participant enrollment and
  retention as well. We already have surveys from our Soniditos Saturdays
  lessons and Summer Camp that we can adapt for our Sobrinx and Future Me!
  Series. Results from our past surveys have already provided some insight on
  our programming’s positive effect on our participants and request for more
  frequent programming.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '100'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '2000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  If our work is successful, Los Angeles County will have a transformative space
  where trans youth, gender expansive youth, and girls can access resources,
  mentorship, and music education in Southeast Los Angeles. An
  inter-generational space where trans, gender, expansive, and women musicians,
  artists, and activists can teach the next generation of Southeast LA youth.
  Our short-term goal is to use the space for our current Soniditos music
  lessons, Sobrinx youth organizing, and Future Me! workshops as well as an
  after-school space for our participants. We hope to grow alongside our
  participants and be a consistent resource as they transition to the next
  generation of music-makers, leaders, and mentors at Chicxs Rockerxs Southeast
  LA.
