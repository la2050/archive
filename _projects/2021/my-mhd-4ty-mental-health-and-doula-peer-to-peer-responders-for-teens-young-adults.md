  Teens who become pregnant face a different set of challenges when accessing
  and receiving health care services as compared to adults who become pregnant.
  Teens may be uncertain how to obtain health care services related to their
  pregnancies. They may need confidentiality, financial assistance, or
  information on whether they need permission to obtain certain types of health
  care, such as prenatal or abortion care. This issue brief addresses using
  /obtaining health coverage, including consent and confidentiality issues,
  using parent’s health insurance, public insurance options, and health coverage
  for newborns. It also covers specific access issues for teens in foster care
  and teens who are undocumented immigrants. "The mental health impact of the
  pandemic is much larger on younger adults," said Dr. Shaker Saxena of The
  Harvard School of Public Health. According to the National Alliance on Mental
  Illness, 50% of all lifetime mental illnesses develop by age 14, and 75%
  develop by age 24.
