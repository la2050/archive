What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  New Earth serves system-impacted and justice-involved youth ages 13-25. The
  youth served by New Earth are almost exclusively low-income and high risk for
  entering or reentering the juvenile justice system. 58% have had past
  expulsions or suspensions, 62% have had past arrests, 41% have had past
  incarceration, and 38% are on probation at entry. Our High School Education
  Programming model is designed to meet the ongoing needs of students who want
  to recover credits, make additional progress towards graduation, or are
  interested in a specialized, individualized project-based learning model when
  their traditional schools have failed them or are unsafe to return to. The
  program is uniquely equipped to meet the specific needs of system-impacted
  youth. In addition to academic enrichment, each student is assigned a case
  manager who builds a case plan based on students' unique needs, providing
  social-emotional and mental health and wellness support.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  New Earth and Da Vinci RISE provide young people with the opportunity to earn
  a High School Diploma through a highly responsive, holistic, and integrated
  educational model that meets the unique needs of youth navigating foster care,
  housing instability, probation, and/or other circumstances that have caused
  disruptions in their academic journeys. Through a flex-scheduling, credit
  recovery model, students are given the voice and choice needed to accomplish
  their academic goals while honoring the additional responsibilities they have
  in their lives. By engaging students through a relationship-focused learning
  experience we help them overcome individual obstacles and systemic barriers. 
  Given inequities in learning environment, safety, security and resources, New
  Earth RISE students are high risk for learning loss during pandemic related
  campus closures. The partnership between RISE and New Earth in this
  educational program works to continue learning and wraparound services, mental
  health support, vocational training, arts and enrichment programs, nutritional
  support, and other resources. Programs include our F.L.O.W. poetry and music
  program, which promotes literacy and enhances writing skills based on the
  California Language Arts Standards of education. Our job training program
  allows students to gain experience and skills while contributing to the
  community through our People’s Market no-cost food distribution program which
  was designed to address food insecurity.

Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  New Earth is leading the way in juvenile justice reform and mental health
  supportive wrap-around services for system-involved young people by providing

  have a history of positive results in the overall well-being of students and
  social-emotional growth and development. 93% of clients do not recidivate and
  83% have positive youth development outcomes. The success of this program will
  directly impact the metrics of lowering suspension and expulsion rates and in
  engaging opportunity youth in Los Angeles County; 82% of New Earth Rise
  students graduate High School or are currently enrolled. Short-term goals
  include mitigating educational inequities, particularly the effects of the
  pandemic; improving academic achievement; and providing holistic support for
