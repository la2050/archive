title: EnCorps STEMx (Expert) Tutors
project_summary: >-
  We train and support STEM professionals from fields such as biotech, aerospace
  engineering, information technology, and medicine to become tutors, guest
  teachers, and fulltime teachers who transform learning as they gain the
  respect of students with their real-world experience. STEMx (Expert) Tutors
  will provide one-one-one virtual math tutoring to grades 6-8 students.
  Identified students cannot make sufficient progress without intervention. Our
  goals are to improve academic achievement in math AND to develop a STEM
  identity for these students.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - East LA
  - South LA
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  A high-quality STEM education can set students on a path towards upward
  economic mobility, but persistent access and literacy gaps continue to
  disproportionately and unjustly limit children of color and low income student
  opportunities. COVID-19 has further disrupted learning and progress toward
  improving student outcomes. Public Policy Institute of California (Jan 2021)
  reports that only 54% of current ninth graders in low income communities will
  attend college; only 20% will earn a bachelor's degree. Critical shortages of
  math and science teachers compounds the problem. Districts with a majority of
  students of color and students living in poverty struggle to attract and
  retain qualified STEM educators. We believe that the unequal distribution of
  quality instruction is not only a function of the allocation of scarce
  financial resources, but also an attribute of the systemic equity issues that
  reflect the unspoken and widely held traditional normative values that we aim
  to change.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  STEMx (Expert) Tutors will serve as mentors and provide academic assistance to
  middle school students currently under-performing in math. We aim to prepare
  students for the rigor of high school mathematics that will provide them
  access to education that will help them break the cycle of poverty, pursue
  higher education, and secure jobs in the 21st century. The program will be
  overseen by an EnCorps Program Coordinator who will recruit STEMx Tutors and
  conduct training in collaboration with Site Coordinators at each school. Site
  Coordinators will ensure resources and connectivity for students, collaborate
  with STEMx Tutors and EnCorps staff, and be responsible for reporting program
  success via students' outcomes over the academic year. Working with teachers,
  Site Coordinators select students based on their sub-standard proficiency in
  math. Although all tutoring will be virtual, a "Site Orientation" will take
  place. STEMx Tutors will learn about the school community in which they will
  serve, including student demographics, school history, school culture and
  other relevant information. Throughout their service, they will receive
  multiple trainings which will help them to incorporate culturally responsive
  teaching strategies and STEMx Tutors will learn to foster an inclusive culture
  where different backgrounds, talents and capabilities are welcomed and
  leveraged for learning.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  EnCorps STEMx Tutors will be responsible for increasing students' math
  literacy as evidenced by 1.) homework completion and 2.) improvement in
  overall math achievement as evaluated by students' classroom teachers within
  one academic year. School Site Coordinators will be responsible for supplying
  this data to EnCorps. Separately, EnCorps will be partnering with The
  Partnerships in Education and Resilience (PEAR) Institute, utilizing its
  assessment tools with our students to measure STEM related attitudes including
  career knowledge and interest over time AND the development of 21st century
  skills and socio-emotional learning such us perseverance and critical
  thinking. We will also gather data about our educators and their attitudes
  about the impact of their demography, degree of self-efficacy and perceptions
  of student outcomes.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '380'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1140'

  EnCorps STEMx Tutors VISION for SUCCESS By providing academic enrichment,
  tutoring and mentoring to our target population of middle school children
  educationally and economically under-resourced communities, we believe that we
  ensure equity and access to quality math and science education out of school
  via STEMx (virtual) Tutors' and we empower students and families to advocate
  for and pursue further STEM education. In the short term, we will create
  greater confidence and interest in STEM subjects. This will result in improved
  academic achievement, and subsequently, higher graduation and college
  attendance rates, and more graduates entering STEM-related fields.
