  #RestaurantBailout: Bridging the Digital Divide for South Los Angeles
  Independent Restaurants Owners & Operators
project_summary: >-
  The COVID-19 pandemic heightened the already existing challenges restaurant
  owners faced owned by people of color, which lead to the closures. These
  closures not only affected the owners but their employees, vendors, and
  landlords. Food Tribe wants to offer free or reduced rate technology software
  to minority-owned businesses in Los Angeles County.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  In 2020 there were ~3000 independent minority-owned businesses in South Los
  Angeles. Of the 3,000 restaurants, 340 (33%) shut their doors at the end of
  2019 and approximately 500 (25%) closed their doors at the end of 2020. It’s
  anticipated that another 500 (28%) restaurants will close their doors by the
  end of 2021.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  McKinsey reports that minority restaurants were at a higher risk of closing
  their doors due to "at risk" or "distressed classification. The Independent
  Restaurant Coalition surveyed 2000 independent restaurant owners and 3/4
  admitted to assuming at least $50,000 in new debt. Three areas affect
  operators including access to business training, affordable and reliable
  restaurant technology, and funding. By joining the Food Tribe network, small
  minority-owned restaurants will be able to compete with large and or chain
  restaurants by remaining in business and maintaining a successful sales rate.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Food Tribe will Support adaptable and business initiatives by: (1) offering
  training, workshops, coaching, and 1on1 technical support; (2) recruit
  eligible businesses to offer the program through the use of tech + social
  media platform and outreach; (3) provide ongoing educational + technological
  support. Food Tribe has elected to focus on using technology and development
  as the way to support small minority-owned restaurants due to the direct
  correlation between business success and technology and social media use and
  presence known as the digital divide. Food Tribe used industry research on the
  best practice for managing the Digital Divide for Independent Restaurants and
  found the following methods yield the desired results: - Bring Operations
  Online - Focus on Analytics - Optimize Staffing Analytics - Point of Sale -
  Customer Focused Marketing - Data Integration - Online Ordering, Pick Up +
  Delivery - Customer Loyalty Program

Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  At least 360 restaurants and their owners, employees, and the communities in
  which they reside will see a positive impact as a direct result of the
  restaurant's success. Food Tribe will onboard small minority-owned restaurants
  to digital and social platforms that will increase visibility and serve as a
  hub for business and economic development for the city of Los Angeles. Small
  minority-owned restaurants will see a 50% decrease in restaurant closures and
  a 47% increase in sales over the course of one year from enrollment and
  participation in the Food Tribe network. Food is the one common denominator
  amongst all humans on earth. It’s a way to bring a community together, an
