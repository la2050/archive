title: Housing First for Survivors of Domestic Violence
project_summary: >-
  The rates of individuals and families experiencing domestic violence and
  homelessness have risen significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic. House of
  Ruth uses an evidence-based model to address these issues. The Domestic
  Violence Housing First model is an innovative approach that focuses on helping
  survivors obtain safe and stable housing as quickly as possible with the use
  of flexible funds, while providing ongoing supportive services to improve the
  overall safety and well-being of domestic violence survivors and their
  families.

What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Domestic Violence (DV) directly impacts 1 in 4 women, 1 in 7 men, and 1 in 3
  teens. According to the National Coalition Against DV, over 10 million people
  report being abused by their intimate partner every year, making up 15% of
  violent crimes reported in the U.S. On any single day in California, DV
  advocates will respond to an estimated 5,644 requests for services, 1,236 of
  those requests going unmet because of lack of resources and support, reported
  by the California Census of DV Services in 2019. Over half of these unmet
  requests are for emergency shelter and housing, the most critical safety
  service for survivors and their families. Domestic violence is a leading cause
  of homelessness for women and children in the U.S. House of Ruth saw an 80%
  increase in hotline calls during the initial months of the pandemic, most
  callers needing to find a safe place to live. We start with housing because we
  know a person can only start to heal from their trauma when their basic needs
  are met.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  The Housing First model is built on three pillars: Survivor-Driven,
  Trauma-Informed Mobile Advocacy; Flexible Funding Assistance; and Community
  Engagement. Advocates focus on addressing the needs identified by survivors
  rather than on pre-determined needs promoted by agencies. Advocates are mobile
  and are trained in trauma-informed practice. Many survivors need not only safe
  and stable housing, but also temporary financial assistance. They may need
  assistance with issues directly related to housing or funds that are critical
  to housing stability. Funds are targeted to support survivors so they can
  rebuild their lives. Proactive engagement with housing providers, other
  service providers and community members changes how the community responds to
  domestic violence. The model acknowledges participants have different needs to
  secure stable housing. Low need is a one-time funding request including food,
  childcare, utility bill assistance and one-time emergency assistance such as
  car repair costs, lock changes, limited vocational costs, healthcare costs and
  transportation. Medium need assistance includes any items in the low need
  category, rental security deposit, and up to 6 months of rental assistance.
  High need assistance includes all aforementioned items with up to 24 months of
  rental assistance to provide the opportunity to build savings, increase
  employment readiness through vocational or educational programs, and address
  trauma or other mental health needs during this time.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Since 2016, several domestic violence shelters in California have adopted the
  Housing First model, including House of Ruth. Impact is measured in several
  ways with the primary measure being number of participants who remained in
  stable housing upon exiting the program. Additional indicators of success
  include participants reporting that they learned more ways to plan for their
  safety and felt more hopeful about the future. These last two indicators may
  seem like small goals, but due to the nature of domestic violence,
  understanding safety planning and feeling hopeful about one’s future are
  critical indicators of a survivors continuing to live a life free of violence.
  Last year, out of the 40 participants in the Housing First Program, 17 found
  permanent housing and 23 received financial support to remain in stable
  housing. Upon exiting the program, all 40 participants remained in stable
  housing and avoided homelessness. 100% of participants learned more ways to
  plan for their safety.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '40'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '200'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Our vision and hope for every person we serve is for them to live a life free
  from violence. Survivors fleeing from domestic violence should not lose their
  housing as a result. Too often this is a reality for families impacted by
  domestic violence. Implementing the Housing First model in Los Angeles County
  means more financial and emotional support is available to survivors and their
  families. It will result in less homelessness as a direct result of domestic
  violence and reduce the likelihood of survivors returning to an abusive
  relationship out of desperation. When survivors have the financial support to
  secure their basic needs, while having access to mental and emotional support
  to start to heal from their trauma, they are much more likely to continue
  making healthy decisions for themselves and their families. Domestic violence
  is more than a familial issue; it is a public health issue impacting all of
  us. When individuals and families thrive, our communities thrive as a result.
