  23% of women and 9% of men report forced sexual activity ever in their

  100,000 person has experience sexual violence. This trauma can result in
  severe physical and emotional trauma. Deploying targeted psychotherapeutic
  treatment that is individualized for the survivor is important to achieving
  optimal patient outcomes. There are several valid and evidence-based
  treatments available for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and
  interpersonal difficulties that can result from sexual abuse and assault.

  and focus on survivor rehabilitation and healing. stereotypical of victimhood
  and powerlessness is of the past. We aim to dismantle and reconstruct the
  notion. VBA has employed an intersectional approach with radical inclusion.
  Sexual violence must be addressed because of the society-wide damage it has
  done and continues to do to date.

  Voices Beyond Assault believes in the power of healing, the power of
  connecting and a network that is empowered by survival. We have based our
  organization around innovative ways of healing such as yoga, meditation,
  boxing, pole dancing, self-care activities, etc. The programs are innovative
  and unique to healing. We recognize that a conscious relationship with your
  sexuality after sexual abuse is essential to a happy, healthy life. That’s why
  we address this as a key component. We assist by creating a safe environment
  to heal, examining beliefs built around your trauma, empowering survivors to
  live fully and successfully. The Survivor Retreat builds a community of
  survivors which can encourage collective healing and honor the inherent beauty
  of our diverse survivor community. We will create a network of empowered
  survivors who will support one another and become future leaders in the fight
  to end sexual violence. We want to completely abolish the old stereotypes
  perpetuated.

  Sexual assault results in neurobiological impacts on survivors of sexual
  violence that creates PTSD, anxiety, violence, drug use and possibly suicide.
  All of the effect will determine a person effectivity within their community.
  Incorporating healing modalities that address the impact of sexual trauma on
  one’s body, mind and spirit allows survivors to fully address the fullest
  depth and scope of their wounds, while regaining a deep sense of wholeness
  that enhances their way of life. Our core belief is that "healing looks good
