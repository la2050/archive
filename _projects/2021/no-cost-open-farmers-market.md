title: No-Cost Open Farmers Market
project_summary: >-
  Our goal is simple: to feed our community and do so with dignity, integrity,
  and with the ultimate goal of food sovereignty. Our No Cost-Open Farmers
  Market program will provide food access to hundreds of individuals in our
  community. The program will create a triad of good, by diverting food from
  landfills, creating jobs for marginalized populations, and engaging the
  recipients of our food program in activities and workshops that will
  ultimately empower them to directly influence their food system.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South Bay
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  The food access issue in Westside Long Beach is one that plagues many LA
  County neighborhoods with similar demographics - there is no food sovereignty.
  Food sovereignty is the idea that people should have ownership and input into
  the food system, rather than being subject to the systemic and economic
  drivers that lead to the conditions that create food deserts and geographic
  disparities. Everyone is entitled to culturally appropriate, healthy food
  choices that support their communities. A food system should not be driven
  completely by outside forces beyond people’s understanding or control. Rather,
  people deserve to understand deeply the roots of their food and to experience
  the dignity of choice and quality in their food supply. Our innovative
  approach to food distribution will pave the way towards true local food
  sovereignty in Long Beach by empowering local residents, especially those
  traditionally disenfranchised from local food systems, to create the future of
  food in our city.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Access to culturally appropriate healthy food is a universal right. To build
  food access in a dignified manner while promoting food sovereignty, our
  program will provide a No-Cost Open Farmers Market to the community where our
  Urban Farm is located. We are in an area of Long Beach that is considered a
  food desert according to the USDA, and is impacted by high levels of food
  insecurity due to low incomes. This program will provide free access to
  healthy food grown on our farm. We've also partnered with a food rescue
  organization to divert good food from the landfill. We will also provide
  recipients with tools to incorporate produce into their diets through
  nutritional education, cooking demonstrations, and recipes. We will provide
  information on CalFresh and help with the application process to further
  improve food access and security. Our Market will be run by Sowing Seeds Of
  Change vocational program participants, who are individuals with disabilities
  and foster youth aged 18-24. Thus, our proposed market program will not only
  improve food access in the neighborhood, but provides employment opportunities
  to local marginalized youth with historically low employment outcomes. Our
  vocational program will provide on-going mentorship to our participants to
  ensure they are able to carry out all the duties necessary for a successful
  weekly market. Our model will develop community around food by empowering our
  youth participants to serve as food ambassadors for their community.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  We will measure: a) number of pounds of healthy food distributed weekly b)
  number of weekly repeat recipients by keeping a digital registry of names, and
  contact info, and demographics c) number of recipients who utilized healthy
  food recipes provided with their groceries via periodic surveys taken in the
  no-cost market check out process d) number of participants employed in our
  no-cost market e) number of recipients who accessed additional resources such
  as Calfresh For above metrics, we define success as: a) distributing 200
  pounds of fresh produce each week b) providing food to 6,900 target
  participants, 50% of those participants returning to the market at least once
  c) 50% of participants try the healthy recipes d) employing at least 5
  employees aged 18-24 referred from Special Education services and/or the
  foster system e) ensuring 100% of our participants are aware of additional
  food security resources like CalFresh
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '6900'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '10000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  The Sowing Seeds of Change model is intended for replication. We have made
  connections with non-profits who are supporting our No-Cost Farmers Market
  initiative; including Food Finders and Armanda Unified. We are creating a
  network of vested agencies who will be able to replicate the program. The
  impact of our No-Cost market can be multiplied exponentially. The low cost of
  starting a farm on properties owned by local jurisdictions allows for ease of
  start-up relative to the potential impact of each farm. Pairing produce grown
  on-site with diverted food waste improves food system efficiency. We envision
  LA County where everyone has a farm within walking distance. We will create
  green public spaces that facilitate sharing food knowledge, so that people
  develop a sense of ownership leading to food sovereignty. Our initial goal is
  to start by creating no-cost markets in all of Long Beach's food desert
  neighborhoods then extending it to Wilmington, Carson and beyond.
