title: Virtual Platform to support children impacted by cancer
project_summary: >-
  Walk With Sally transformed the virtual community, based on cancer's shared
  experience to improve health outcomes, specifically better psychological
  well-being, for cancer-affected families. Our pivot during the pandemic to
  meet the urgent needs of our families demonstrated deep impact through art
  healing, mindfulness, enrichment programs, deepening relationships through
  activities, roundtables, and workshops. Knowing we could not break our promise
  to the families we serve, we created an innovative virtual community.

What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Our youth-initiated mentoring model is based on the power of cancer's shared
  experience, bringing an immediate, long-lasting bond to relationships; our
  goal is to share our virtual platform with every child who needs our services.
  When our kids were compelled to adapt to virtual learning and cope with
  isolation, mentoring and community became more critical than ever. Our kids
  impacted by cancer need a positive community to connect with, as many of them
  have lasting social isolation issues, anxiety, in addition to being in
  immunocompromised homes. Worry and isolation will only increase long-term
  mental health problems. Our mentors and the team have stepped up and are
  providing a positive and healthy relationship and connection. Technology
  allows us to continue to bring our community of kids impacted by cancer
  together and be an essential part of our kids' well-being. We want to bring
  that collective story of cancer together in a positive healing way, more
  globally than we have before.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  As the world changed around us this past year, we set goals to ensure the
  pandemic's effects would not impact our program and expanded with fewer
  monetary and staff resources. Our demographic is historically underserved, and
  the pandemic only magnified the disparities and racial divides. We learned to
  do more with less money and staff; however, our immunocompromised families
  will be forever devastated by job loss, anxiety, poverty, and isolation.
  During an exploding demand for service, our programs are being thought of on a
  continuum of care, falling somewhere between more intensive professional care
  and an exceptional teacher's informal support. We saw an immediate need to
  bring our community together virtually and exist as the hub of urgent
  resources and basic needs. We took action to move our communities into the
  Zoom space through meditation, art healing, dance parties, and mentor
  connections. Our goal is to aggregate the Walk With Sally’s mission through a
  global network in order to recruit more families and mentors, as well as serve
  those who wouldn’t otherwise have access. We are keenly thinking of
  demographics we are not reaching due to overwhelming obstacles and removing
  those through technology. Potential to create a new pod of community while
  changing the model for efficiency and cost savings through analytics.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Cancer changes everything for families and can have a significant impact on
  children and teens. These high rates of post-traumatic stress among siblings
  included emotional reactions such as fear, worry, sadness, helplessness,
  anger, guilt, and social and academic difficulties. Our surveys include
  questions about academic performance, emotional and behavioral development,
  and the mentee's future goals as a result of their Mentor relationship and the
  WWS program. Results demonstrated that since being in our program, 83% of
  mentees have opened up about their feelings, 72% felt more confident, 89% felt
  less lonely, 89% felt like they now had a support system, 67% felt better able
  to control their temper or outbursts, 78% were interested in volunteering, 44%
  were interested in leadership roles, 78% felt better able to cope, 89% felt
  less stressed or anxious, and 100% were more often in a better mode and better
  able to handle change.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '600'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '2400'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  As our youth struggle with isolation due to immunocompromised family members,
  challenges, and hardships related to the pandemic, youth mentoring is more
  critical today than at any other time in recent history. Safe, stable, and
  nurturing relationships and environments can be protective for kids who are
  experiencing adversity. Sometimes it only takes is one person to make a
  difference in that child's entire future. Our families need consistent love,
  nurturing, and support to combat the trauma our families face. When one person
  mentors, two people benefit, there is a radical transformation and our
  community becomes infinitely stronger. A mentor can be a critical healer of
  adverse childhood experiences that have proved to be responsible for so much
  pain in a child's cancer journey. Our vision is to positively lift and impact
  all those in need throughout Los Angeles County, and ensure no child walks
  alone in the face of a loved one's cancer.
