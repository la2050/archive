title: Esperanza’s Promotores de Salud (Community Health Promoters)
project_summary: >-
  Esperanza’s Promotores de Salud (Community Health Promotors) provide
  life-saving culturally accessible in-home health education, primary prevention
  and advocacy to families in South LA. Our nationally recognized Promotora-led
  model increases access to health services and decreases preventable ER use for
  patients in low-income communities of color. Through our Promotoras Leadership
  program, we have trained over 500 community health workers, and are providing
  opportunities for meaningful careers in health for low-income women of color.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  The Covid-19 pandemic has reinforced the ways that South Central Los Angeles
  communities are marginalized. Due to historic disinvestment, South LA is
  under-resourced in basic care, preventative, and mental health services. Over
  the past year, South LA families have faced rates of infection that are 40%
  higher than the rest of the county, and we have had higher rates of job and
  business losses than wealthier communities. We have seen that many residents
  have had to choose between foregoing work and face homelessness or continuing
  to work and putting their lives and loved ones at risk. This project will
  support Esperanza’s Promotores De Salud. It is an effort to improve community
  health and reduce the collateral effects of the Covid-19 pandemic due to the
  global economic downturn, high rates of infection, social isolation, increased
  slum housing conditions, and movement restriction measures that are unequally
  affecting people in underserved communities like South Los Angeles.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  South Central Los Angeles has been hard hit by systemic racism and economic
  inequality, and the Covid-19 pandemic has put that in sharp relief. Our goal
  is to improve community health and reduce collateral damage caused by the
  Covid-19 crisis. A secondary goal is to expand the evidence base for our
  Promotora model, ensuring health and wellness for South LA residents in the
  near term, and increasing job opportunities and equitable pay for Promotores
  in the long term. Through our nationally-recognized model, Esperanza will
  provide support services to families in South LA. This approach is effective
  as it builds upon the expertise and knowledge of the very people impacted by a
  problem to know what is needed to create meaningful systemic change. Our
  Promotora training supports career wage employment in the health field and
  last year we connected more than 40 Promotoras to COVID-related outreach,
  education, and contact tracing jobs. The outreach program will serve 350
  families in the project period. Over the next year we will: 1) increase access
  to health care services, conduct vaccine awareness and referrals, and reduce
  the number of patients returning to the ER for acute asthma care 2) improve
  community health through primary prevention measures 3) Increase access to
  other vital services, including mental health and tenant rights clinics We
  measure the project’s success by analyzing in-home health surveys, follow-up
  assessments, and periodic community health surveys.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  In 1996 we pioneered the Promotores de Salud model, a strategy for reducing
  health disparities and increasing access to health services for low-income
  communities of color, while building a powerful cadre of community health
  leaders. Promotores conduct free life-saving home health assessments that
  provide education and resources to low-income households, and connect families
  to important services. Through our program’s education and environmental
  assessments, ER visits by clients for asthma decreased by 77% last year. This
  significant reduction in ER visits results in health improvements for patients
  and invaluable cost savings for community hospitals and clinics who are
  already overloaded with COVID-19 patients. Promotores provide culturally
  accessible health education, primary prevention, and advocacy to families and
  children. Esperanza has advanced city-wide and national policies on housing,
  habitability, code enforcement, workforce development, and asthma home
  visitation.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '350'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1200'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  This project will support the healing and just recovery of South Central’s
  most vulnerable communities. The Promotora Model is a successful strategy in
  targeting disparities and increasing access to health services for community
  residents and building community trust through home visits and mentoring.
  Through this work, we will ensure more holistic, quality care for South LA
  residents as well as expand our evidence base for our Promotora home health
  model; and we will increasing respect, job opportunities, and pay for
  Promotoras in the long term. Esperanza’s goal for this project is to ensure
  that community health promoters are more fully integrated into healthcare
  teams, and institutionally recognized and funded by the state. Esperanza is
  working at the local and state level to secure a State Plan Amendment (SPA) to
  allow qualified non-licensed professionals such as community health workers
  (CHWs) and promotores to provide reimbursable primary prevention and education
  services.
