  Teen Talk App, It's OK to Not Be OK Campaign: Normalizing teen mental health
  struggles through peer support
project_summary: >-
  Teen Talk App creates an accessible, safe, anonymous space for teens to
  receive support from trained peers. The “It's OK to Not Be OK” digital
  marketing campaign aims to normalize and destigmatize experiences of
  depression, anxiety, isolation and loneliness among teens in Los Angeles by
  driving new users to the app. Growing awareness of the Teen Talk App allows
  teens who otherwise might lack mental health support to connect with peers,
  feel seen and heard, and resolve crises in a safe and supportive environment
  right from their cell phone.

  Mental health struggles among youth in LA County continue to climb. According
  to the 2019 Suicide Prevention Report to the Community, between 2013 and 2015,
  about 19 percent of California high school freshmen seriously considered
  attempting suicide in the previous year. According to the 2021, The State of
  Mental Health in America Report, the rising number of teens in crisis is met
  with a lack of intervention and treatment, 60% of youth with major depression
  did not receive any mental health treatment in 2017-2018. A national survey
  sponsored by Hopelab and Well Being Trust finds that 59% of teens have
  searched online for information about mental well-being, including stress
  (44%), anxiety (42%), and depression (39%). Teens and young adults are using
  digital resources to search for answers and support and fill the gap that
  traditional mental health services are not meeting. When it comes to mental
  health, teens are reaching for their phones, and we need to be there when they
  do.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Teen Talk App provides a free, anonymous, safe space for teens to request
  support and learn from others with similar experiences. The free app is
  available to download on iOS and Android devices to teen users 13-19 years old
  who can post 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Posts range from a bad breakup or
  first panic attack, to self-harm, suicidal ideation, and child abuse or sexual
  assault. Posts can only be responded to by our trained volunteer Teen
  Advisors, who are supervised during app hours (nightly 5-10 pm PST) by
  licensed mental health professionals. Prior to signing up for shifts
  throughout the month, Teen Advisors undergo a 50-hour training on empathetic
  reflective communication, values and bias, and mental health basics. Teen
  Talk’s “It’s OK to not be OK” campaign will increase our digital marketing and
  outreach to teens across digital platforms they already use, including
  Instagram, TikTok and YouTube. The marketing campaign will focus on reducing
  mental health stigma while driving users to the app as a low barrier,
  anonymous and safe mental wellness support. We will directly target our
  campaign to teens across LA county and specifically to communities with lower
  rates of engagement in traditional mental health systems. Teen Talk’s goal is
  to create a network of teens supporting each other, recognizing their common
  struggles, and making it OK to ask for help.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Appraisal of both the end user experience and volunteer teen advisor
  performance are critical in the achievement of Teen Talk’s goal to provide a
  responsible and inclusive digital environment. To evaluate Teen Advisor
  effectiveness, we analyze the impact of Teen Talk Training on Teen Advisors.
  Current results demonstrate significant increases in knowledge of mental
  health concerns, and how to support someone in crisis, increased awareness of
  privilege and increases in cultural humility. To evaluate our end user
  experience, we analyze return user activity and satisfaction ratings from
  teens who have received support (thumbs up, thumbs down), with a current
  positive rating of over 88%. Return user activity enables us to understand
  trends in the types of support teens are interested in, and the types of
  responses they are most likely to engage in. Ongoing evaluation positions us
  to provide an environment where teens can thrive and feel safe.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '40'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '20000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  The period of adolescence will forever be an exciting and at times frightening
  part of growing up. The more we learn about this period of development the
  better we understand the need for nonjudgmental, accessible, safe spaces for
  young people to explore their feelings and find unique ways to connect with
  their peers. At Teen Talk App we envision an LA County where all young people
  have those safe spaces in their families, schools, communities and on their
  phones. The positive peer support users experience on the Teen Talk App
  fosters a safe landing place for a young person's deepest fears and worst
  days. By experiencing unconditional positive feedback and empathy in response
  to the thing they are afraid to tell anyone, teens feel more confident to
  reach out to those around them. LA County needs spaces for teens that feel
  they have nowhere else to turn, Teen Talk will be that space.
