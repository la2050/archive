title: Upgrading My Game and My Brain
project_summary: >-
  At Books and Buckets, we will empower Washington Neighborhood Youth with a
  Basketball Academy, Guided Reading and Comprehension Help, and Mentoring. Our
  program aims to provide student-athletes with the fundamental skills that
  empower them to succeed on the court, in the classroom, and in their
  community. Our academy undertakes place-based change that focuses on a
  neighborhood impact, with an aspiring and promising community of strong and
  powerful Black and Brown youth who have been historically underserved.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South Bay
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  We are seeking to address gang violence and youth engagement. The Washington
  Neighborhood of Long Beach has one of the highest rates of gun violence,
  adding to 40% of the city’s firearm assaults and murders. Nearly half of
  Washington School students are not adequately prepared to attend high school.
  The Washington Neighborhood is one of the only neighborhoods in Long Beach
  without a community center that youth can turn to. The 14th Street park needs
  are classified by LA County as “very high” and the infrastructure as “poor.”
  Gang violence is common, and the gang recruitment efforts have forced the
  community to respond and even walk Washington students to school. Students are
  forced to avoid gang territory streets and at many times approached by
  transient individuals on their way to school. Long Beach is over 80 square
  miles, yet the Washington Neighborhood has accounted for over 10% of all
  violent crime in the city, despite covering less than half of a percent of the
  city.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Our project involves implementing a Youth Empowerment Academy that will allow
  neighborhood youth to take charge of the issues in their community. It will
  incorporate an academic curriculum that involves reading, mentoring, and
  engaging the youth to take on issues that affect their life, family, and
  community. The reading component will be achieved through guided and assigned
  books that can inspire them to think for themselves and their community. The
  mentoring will be achieved through community mentorships of local residents
  mentoring the local youth in the community they serve. The engaging component
  will be achieved through guest speakers and civic engagement in local policy.
  Youth will be actively involved through the Atheltic Academy, a high-quality
  basketball academy offering an outlet to all the problems they have to face on
  a daily basis. This academy will incorporate a skills clinic that challenges
  their abilities while also training their mind. This project is a place-based
  program led by residents from the Washington Neighborhood. It will take
  systems change and collective impact into the complexities and constraints of
  the neighborhood. Sustainability will be achieved through the fact that local
  residents are initiating the program. This is not an outside-in program, it is
  an inside-out one where community members are coming up with solutions for
  dealing with the problems facing their community while relevant partners
  provide support.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  We will define and measure success through youth surveys, parent surveys,
  community surveys, neighborhood crime rates, gun violence rates, illegal gang
  activity rates, and local school performance. Youth surveys will serve as a
  benchmark of the growth mindset of our student-athletes regarding their
  futures and community. Parent surveys will serve as a benchmark for perceived
  community safety through active parks. Community surveys will measure
  perceived community safety and school reputation. Neighborhood crime rates are
  being gathered by the local justice department for specifically the Washington
  Neighborhood corridor. School performance is gauged through a partnership with
  the local school district and the families involved in the program.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '30'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  This project will serve as a model for other neighborhoods, as the Washington
  Neighborhood is currently one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in LA
  County. Effective efforts in our community can serve as a model of place-based
  change focused on the culture of a neighborhood. Empowering local youth and
  removing the lifeline of gang violence will function as a systems change
  effort that changes the power dynamics of a community. This project will also
  serve as a model of resident sustainability, where local community leaders
  take on a solution to a problem and sustain that process along with their
  neighbors to ensure a powerful and united community. LA County neighborhoods
  differ drastically, however, some of the most underserved ones face similar
  problems and have similar demographics. If one neighborhood can overcome the
  historical and racist challenges facing their community, then those techniques
  and processes can be replicated throughout the county.
