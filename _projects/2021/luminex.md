title: LUMINEX
project_summary: >-
  An immersive digital art experience, LUMINEX transcends the physical to evoke
  the healing power of art. This video art collaboration, from six renown
  artists, projected in large scale-format across the facade of various downtown
  buildings, illuminates the importance of accessible public art, while speaking
  to themes pivotal at this moment in time: voids and shattering realities,
  inclusion and diversity, the healing nature of water, sustainability and our
  environmental future, and local-global interconnectedness.

project_video: ''
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Los Angeles has always been a city of artists, and the light they shed
  supports our collective transition through the end of this pandemic and into
  the future. We feel that we have a responsibility, not only to ourselves and
  our loved ones, but also to our City, and our local artists. We have a
  responsibility to create space for the community, to provide a sounding board
  to experience the work and messages of these profound artists. This is a love
  note to Los Angeles. We want to address the need for cultural vitality, for
  residents and creatives alike, and come together collectively to heal
  ourselves with the power of art. The role of art in our everyday lives is much
  more vital than is realized. Whether it’s a pandemic, the growth of a city, or
  the nature of institutions, accessible public art has slowly eroded. Our hope
  is to change this. Our hope is to be a springboard for a new vision. Our hope
  is to be one part of the solution.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  On the evening of Saturday, April 10, 2021, the Los Angeles community is
  invited to experience LUMINEX, an outdoor walkable digital art exhibition
  taking place in the South Park district of DTLA. The exhibition will run 7:30
  pm to 11:30 pm and is free to the public. Curated by NOW Art Foundation,
  LUMINEX is an exhibition of six internationally acclaimed Los Angeles artists:
  Refik Anadol, Nancy Baker Cahill, Sarah Rara, Carole Kim, Luciana Abait, and
  Akiko Yamashita; supported by a collective of community sponsors. Using our
  Downtown buildings as backdrops, these Los Angeles artists will use cutting
  edge digital art to reflect upon the past year, re-inspire our cultural
  connection, and spotlight the healing power of art. This site-specific
  exhibition will feature six massive architecturally distinct walls within a
  5-block walkable radius (W. Pico Blvd, S. Olive St, W. 11th St, S. Hope St,
  Flower St). Each local artist will transform their site, projecting a
  different story or “dialogue of light”, using video and sound. These digital
  installations speak to themes pivotal at this moment in time: voids and
  shattering realities, inclusion and diversity, the healing nature of water,
  sustainability and our environmental future, and local-global
  interconnectedness. Some installations will include live performances,
  augmented reality, multi-channel video art, and immersive experiences.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  In terms of project success, with events that are freely accessible to the
  public, the greatest metric one can aspire is legacy; do people remember the
  event, were they inspired by the works, did it inspire even better works and
  even better projects, did it create discussion, did it create action, did it
  become part of the culture of the city, thereby turning into a event that is
  repeated or even emulated. If a person sees these works and thinks to
  themself, ‘maybe I can do that’, and ‘I can do that a bit better’. If it
  provides a sense of joy, pride, or thoughtfulness. If only one of these comes
  to fruition, then this event will have been everything that any artist could
  have hoped.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '50000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1000000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Los Angeles is a city that is based around creativity, innovation and culture.
  With the pandemic and the closing of innumerable venues, galleries, and
  museums, our residents experienced a silence where there would otherwise have
  been a flurry of creation and excitement as is typical of the Los Angeles arts
  and culture scene. Our success will be bringing cultural vitality and access
  to public art back to the residents of downtown Los Angeles. We want to expand
  the scope of this initial project and to be able to continue to bring public
  art exhibitions to the citizens of LA free of charge, while promoting Los
  Angeles to the forefront of culture. Our intended impact is the recognition of
  this city, and it’s artists, and it’s communities, as part of a vanguard that
  prioritizes and supports the fundamental nature of creativity and it’s
  expression.
