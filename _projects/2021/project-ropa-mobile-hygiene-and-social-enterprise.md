title: Project Ropa Mobile Hygiene and Social Enterprise
project_summary: >-
  Project Ropa recycles more than 35,000 pounds of clothing, shoes and textiles
  every year and distributes them locally to more than 14,000 unhoused and
  low-income individuals and families through our Mobile Hygiene Services and
  Community Partnerships. To further our mission and help break the cycle of
  homelessness, we have created a social enterprise that provides job
  opportunities for formerly homeless and incarcerated individuals, which also
  empowers lives and protects the environment by reducing the textile waste that
  is going into landfills.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - South LA
  - Westside
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  More than 66,000 people are currently experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles
  County. This number is expected to increase by 86% in 2023. People who are
  homeless, especially the chronically homeless (76% of LA’s homeless
  population), have significant barriers to finding and keeping clothing that
  fits and meets their needs. They often wind up wearing dirty and wet clothes
  for long stretches of time out of necessity, making them vulnerable to the
  spread of transmissible diseases. Meanwhile, an estimated 371,000 tons
  textiles ended up in Los Angeles landfills and waterways last year.
  Approximately 95% of this waste was of recyclable and reusable clothes, shoes,
  and other fabric. At Project Ropa, we find this situation unacceptable. We
  must do more to direct textile resources to those who need them and away from
  our precious land and water. (Sources: KNBC, 2020 Greater LA Homeless Count,
  EPA, Rubicon and Cal Recycle Landfill Tonnage Report, World Resources
  Institute.)
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Project Ropa is the only nonprofit organization of its kind in Los Angeles. To
  reduce our carbon footprint, we work directly with manufacturers, retailers,
  corporations, nonprofit organizations, and individuals to stock our closet
  with surplus supplies that would otherwise end up in landfills or shipped
  overseas. We sort these items for use in our Mobile Hygiene Service - a
  retrofitted van that serves as a walk-in closet with neatly displayed
  clothing, shoes, accessories and more. This is in contrast to many other
  donation sites where clients must pick through piles of clothing. We take the
  time to get to know each client and help them find what works for them. Due to
  the COVID-19 pandemic, this means staff individually select items for clients
  in a socially-distant manner. Finally, we provide hygiene kits, PPE, food, and
  water, and we typically operate in tandem with mobile shower providers to
  provide the opportunity for a complete refresh. Last year, we began accepting
  fabric rolls in addition to overstock, discontinued and misprinted clothing
  from manufacturers. Beginning in 2021, we will begin upcycling the textiles,
  as well as fabric from clothing inappropriate for distribution, into items to
  sell to the public in support of our direct care services. We will use local
  crafters for production, and this project will provide new job opportunities
  for people with significant barriers to employment, including the homeless,
  formerly incarcerated individuals and veterans.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Project Ropa has seen a threefold
  increase in the number of people we are serving every month (800 to 2,500).
  Experts predict Los Angeles County will see an 86% increase in homelessness in
  the next two years (Economic Roundtable). We need to grow to meet this
  predicted increase in need for hygiene services. And, we need to use the
  untapped, underutilized resources already available to us to do so. Project
  Ropa will know we have achieved this when: - We have additional financial
  resources to consistently serve more people every month through our Mobile
  Hygiene Services and Community Partnerships compared to 2020 - We are able to
  recycle or upcycle more textile waste compared to 2020 - We are able to
  increase our Mobile Hygiene Service locations - 75% of our staff are from
  populations with significant barriers to employment
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '3000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '17500'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  We envision a Los Angeles where hygiene is a human right, where all people can
  access clean clothes, and where excess textiles are given new life in support
  of our community. Our social enterprise program will help us achieve this
  vision in the short term by supporting our ongoing direct services and by
  keeping more textile waste out of our landfills and waterways. More of LA’s
  unhoused people will have access to clean clothing and hygiene supplies, which
  will help them achieve their employment and housing goals. It will also mean
  less risk of communicable and hygiene-related disease and improved mental
  well-being among Los Angeles’ unhoused residents. In the long term, our
  project will support a cleaner, healthier LA for all people. When we help even
  one person access proper hygiene, the whole community benefits. In addition,
  as we are able to serve more and upcycle more textiles, we will be reducing
  the environmental impact of textile waste in Los Angeles.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  Although this proposal is not for a collaborative project, partnerships and
  collaborations are an essential part of our work in Los Angeles. Our weekly
  Mobile Hygiene Service, which alternates between Echo Park and Downtown Los
  Angeles, works alongside mobile shower service providers Shower Stop and LA
  City CARE Mobile Station, as well as providers that offer hot meals and
  housing and employment resources. We also work with community providers who
  serve other Los Angeles communities to provide clothing and hygiene kits to
  help support their outreach programs, indirectly serving more than 12,000
  people each year. Our community partners include: Community Loving, Food on
  Foot, Genevieve’s Garden, Lava Mae, SELAH, St. Francis Center, The Sidewalk
  Project, WaterDrop LA and Worthy of Love.
