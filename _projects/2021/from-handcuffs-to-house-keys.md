title: From Handcuffs to House Keys
project_summary: >-
  From handcuffs to house keys, Jovenes is showing a new opportunity for social
  justice, one that de-prioritizes incarceration and instead focuses on helping
  youth meet their basic needs and reintegrate into our community, through the
  transformation of former Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall. What was once a place of
  juvenile incarceration is now a home for homeless young women. Opened in
  January 2021, this program creates much needed crisis/bridge housing in
  Southeast LA County to help youth meet their basic needs and reintegrate into
  our community.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:

  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Our program at Los Padrinos seeks to address the lack of housing for homeless
  youth, and the overbuilt environment of incarceration in our community.
  Jovenes is transforming a former place of incarceration into a much needed
  housing and supportive services program for young women who are experiencing
  homelessness. There are high rates of homelessness alongside unused and empty
  buildings, resulting in our motivation for creative housing solutions.
  According to the 2020 Homeless Count 4,673 youth are experiencing homelessness
  on any given night in Los Angeles County, with 19% residing in Jovenes’
  geographic area alone. Although the youth we serve come from diverse
  backgrounds, four common barriers to a stable future are found throughout our
  target population: barriers to safe, supportive, and affordable housing;
  difficulty accessing basic benefits and health services; limitations to
  educational advancement and economic development; and overcoming trauma.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Jovenes is seeking support to address the crisis of youth homelessness through
  our emergency/bridge-housing program at the former Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall.
  We are seeking to enhance the services we are able to provide with this
  program so our youth have the best opportunities to end their personal cycle
  of homelessness. Though there are other jail conversion projects taking place
  in Los Angeles, this is a first-of-its-kind program and one-of-a-kind to
  address the needs of the specific community that we serve, as there are no
  crisis/shelter housing beds dedicated to female youth in Southeast LA County.
  Up to 20 women can be housed in this program at a time, with an anticipated
  length of stay between three to six months. Through housing and supportive
  services/case management, we seek to provide youth with the resources and
  support they need to access vital benefits and physical/mental health care,
  gather personal identification documents, obtain employment, further their
  education, and ultimately move into longer term stable housing. From handcuffs
  to house keys, this program directly shows how de-prioritizing incarceration
  and focusing on helping youth meet their basic needs can help youth
  reintegrate into our community. A grant from My LA2050 will help Jovenes
  provide all the young women at Los Padrinos with the case management and
  resources necessary to achieve not just immediate needs, but also a long-term
  solution to end their personal cycles of homelessness.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Jovenes tracks the number of clients served at Los Padrinos, the services
  accessed, exit destinations, public benefits, and employment obtained. This
  allows us to evaluate the overall success of the program, as well as the
  success of subpopulations with specific needs and/or personal experiences. We
  communicate directly with clients to track our success in a qualitative manner
  to gain a first-hand perspective on the overall quality of our program. The
  feedback our youth provide to us helps us evaluate our program, track
  challenges each youth faces, & measure success as they overcome challenges.
  Since opening our doors in January 2021, we have already seen heightened
  success in our program, as we are operating at full capacity, and have already
  began to transition youth into longer-term housing.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '50'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': ''
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Our program at Los Padrinos is incredibly impactful to Los Angeles County,
  with the potential to create lasting change, as there is now a template and
  standard for these kinds of conversion projects. Other conversion projects
  have seen incredibly long timelines due to budgetary issues halting work and
  preventing completion. That is not the case with our work, in which LA County
  approved our project in late October 2020, and we had our first residents move
  on New Year’s Day, showing our rapid and effective development and
  implementation. There is a future for decreased incarceration, and increase in
  community support because we have ensured it is possible by providing a safe
  and stable place for homeless young women to live and thrive, by helping our
  youth become self-sufficient, which enables them to integrate back into their
  communities independently as empowered young adults.
