title: STWF - ED Center
project_summary: >-
  A grant from LA 2050 will allow the STWF Ed Center to directly combat food
  deserts in South LA. 1) Secure a local undeveloped plot of land, (city-owned)
  to initiate the STWF Organic Urban Farm 2) Expand Young Gardener’s program to
  tend the urban farm. 3), Develop a Young Food Entrepreneurship program
  teaching the business of food. 4) Market produce and fruit from the urban farm
  at local farmer's markets. Over time, this program creates a recurring revenue
  source for the self-sufficiency of all programming.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Many of the residents of South Central Los Angeles suffer some of the greatest
  rates of income disparity in the country with 25.8 percent of residents within
  a 5 mile radius living below the poverty line. The average per capita income
  is 18,337 dollars a year, about half the average per capita income in the
  United States overall. Due to the soaring costs of housing and transportation
  in LA County, many people who work full time, even families with two incomes,
  often cannot make ends meet or put enough food on the table. Before the
  pandemic, an estimated 1 in 5 people in Los Angeles County lived with food
  insecurity, but after the COVID-19 outbreak, the number of people needing food
  assistance has increased markedly. It is estimated that 1 in 4 of our
  neighbors faces food insecurity. Food insecurity is one of the main issues
  that the STWF Ed Center addresses through its programming.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  1) Secure a local undeveloped plot of land, (city-owned) to initiate the STWF
  Organic Urban Farm 2) Expand Young Gardener’s program to tend the urban farm -
  this will be a paid afternoon activity for 15-18-year-olds. 3), Develop a
  Young Food Entrepreneurship program teaching the business of food. 4) Market
  produce and fruit from the urban farm at local farmer's markets. The strong
  response to both our “Monthly Food Giveaways” and “Young Gardeners Program”
  confirmed the need. People want to learn how to grow their own produce and
  have access to healthier eating. Families are tired of living in a “Food
  Desert” and waiting to get the access they deserve to healthy, nutritional
  food in this neighborhood. They prefer to take matters into their own hands
  and become more self-sufficient. By educating themselves on growing food and
  plants native to Los Angeles, they are able to better meet their own needs.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  STWF Ed Center Tutoring Program stats on the difference tutoring makes for
  young folks. Over the past 5 years, information and data from our tutoring
  programs are cataloged to gain a better understanding of who we are assisting
  and how the program is benefiting our students. The young gardeners program is
  in the early stages of development. The program launches on April 10th and we
  expect to have data showing how much our young gardeners have learned during
  the 6-week program. We also expect feedback from all of our families to help
  improve and develop the ongoing gardening program. In future courses, students
  will have the option to join our beginners or intermediate gardening course.
  The idea behind the Young Gardeners program is to teach kids how to grow
  healthy foods and the connection between clean air, clean water, and
  nutritious eating habits.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '5000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': ''
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  The Entrepreneurship component of our proposal will be aimed at high schoolers
  and young adults. We believe the impact of a hands-on holistic urban farming
  and food business program will have a ripple effect of positivity throughout
  the community, the County, and beyond. If proven to be successful we expect
  our food giveaway and young gardeners program to decrease the number of
  families who do not have access to nutritional healthy resources and gain the
  knowledge to grow their own produce. Healthier eating habits ensure that
  families' chances of contracting health issues such as obesity, heart
  problems, and diabetes decrease significantly.
