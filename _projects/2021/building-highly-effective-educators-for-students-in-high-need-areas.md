title: Building Highly Effective Educators For Students in High Need Areas
project_summary: >-
  The Center builds the capacity of teachers and schools in high-need areas so
  they can better prepare student of color and low-income students to access
  rigorous education, opportunity pathways, and be college and/or career ready.
  By boosting social-emotional and culturally responsive practices, students
  realize their value, develop their strengths, and are prepared to fulfill
  their full post-secondary future. This whole-child approach is an essential
  step to building systemic educational equity in Los Angeles schools.

project_video: ''
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Applying a proven model or solution to a new issue or sector (e.g., using a
  job recruiting software or strategy to match clients to supportive housing
  sites, applying demonstrated strategies from advocating for college
  affordability to advocating for housing affordability and homelessness, etc.)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  In LA, the number of low-income students and students of color are threatened
  by the lack of rigor and cultural insensitivities in public schools in
  high-poverty communities. Statistics demonstrate that these students have
  consistently faced systemic barriers and lacked the supports necessary to
  access higher education, opportunity pathways, and navigate successfully to a
  four-year degree. This marginalization is most evident in disparate rates of
  graduation, incarceration, and unemployment.  Distance learning has
  significantly exacerbated learning loss among low-income, Black, and Hispanic
  students. In addition, the virus has disrupted many of the supports that help
  vulnerable youth stay in school. It is anticipated that these challenges will
  lead to an increase in high school dropout rates, academic performance gaps,
  socio-emotional challenges, and even more students leaving school unprepared
  for college and/or career, inhibiting their potential to achieve stable lives.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  The Center supports teachers’ efficacy to address barriers to student
  achievement and illuminate postsecondary opportunities, creating a clear path
  from high school to college/career success. To accomplish this, the Center
  collaborates with school administrators and instructional leadership teams to
  custom design and implement a combination of professional development,
  technical assistance, and assessment protocols. Our approach leverages best
  practices from applied research and collaborative partnerships in the public
  sector. We focus on improving the region’s lowest-performing schools to ensure
  1) Teachers are equipped to meet the needs of each student in their classroom;
  2) Students are well-known, valued, and challenged; 3) Curriculum is relevant
  and rigorous; and 4) Every student has the skills and knowledge that places
  them on a trajectory for college, career, and life success.    The Center’s
  student support programs are critical components in transforming school
  systems’ ability to provide high-quality education. It is through these
  bespoke programs that students of color have access to opportunities to the
  social-emotional learning that will support them in overcoming barriers to
  future success, as well as to discover and explore college and career
  possibilities for their future. With this whole-child approach, students of
  color realize their value, develop their strengths, and imagine pathways that
  prepare them to fulfill their full post-secondary future.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Students of schools and districts that have participated in the Center’s
  professional development training have increased their performance across
  multiple college and career-readiness metrics, including: A-G completion, 11th
  grade English and math standardized test scores, attendance, graduation rates,
  and other California Department of Education data, including the
  College/Career Indicator. On average, students of schools and school districts
  whose teachers have participated in the Center’s training have a graduation
  rate of 84%, as compared to the 75% graduation rate of non-Center trained
  schools and districts.  Over the past 18 years, the Center has helped improve
  the practice of more than 3,500 educators, helping more than 500,000 students
  in underserved communities attain the skills and outcomes that support them in
  successfully preparing for postsecondary educational and career opportunities.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '400'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '11500'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  An equitable community is one where everyone is included in the full benefits
  of society. In such a community, everyone is treated with fairness and justice
  and empowered to participate fully in social, cultural, and economic life. For
  Los Angeles youth, this means putting systems and supports in place to ensure
  that every child has an equal chance for success. That requires understanding
  the unique challenges and barriers faced by students of color and low-income
  students to help them overcome those barriers. While this in itself may not
  ensure equal outcomes, we all should strive to ensure that every child has
  equal opportunity for success. With the empowerment from equitable education
  benefits everyone in Los Angeles County through higher rates of economic
  stability, lower crime, healthier lifestyles, reduction in poverty, higher
  civic involvement, and a stronger sense of inclusiveness. This is the Los
  Angeles the Center envisions through its work.
