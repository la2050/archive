title: 'Students Helping Others: UCLA Volunteer Day 2021 & One Bus/One Cause'
project_summary: >-
  The UCLA Volunteer Center connects students to the LA community through
  volunteer opportunities. Annually, we connect thousands of students to service
  through our two largest programs: One Bus/One Cause & Volunteer Day. Both
  programs introduce the UCLA Community to service opportunities and the need
  for volunteers in LA. Receiving this grant would provide opportunities to
  students in hopes of creating lifelong volunteers to enrich the LA community.
  Note: as COVID restrictions shift, we are prepared to host in-person, online
  or hybrid programs.

What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  According to the Corporation for National Community Service and LA2050, in
  2018, 24.1% of LA-area residents volunteered at least once annually. The LA
  region is now ranked 46th for its volunteer rate out of 50 major metropolitan
  areas in the nation. The UCLA Volunteer Center expects more and we strive to
  engage the UCLA community in the Los Angeles neighborhoods. The UCLA Volunteer
  Center supports LA2050’s target of having 65% of residents in the region
  volunteer formally at least once annually. Through our annual UCLA Volunteer
  Day and bi-monthly One Bus/One Cause events; we continue to introduce UCLA
  students to service work in LA to become lifelong volunteers. We know that
  COVID is a real concern, yet that has not slowed our commitment to service. We
  have adapted our service projects to an online format for the past 1.5 years.
  In Fall 2021, we are prepared to continue service in a COVID safe model,
  whether that is online, in-person or hybrid.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  The UCLA Volunteer Center coordinates service projects throughout Greater LA
  to inspire the UCLA family to give their time and talent. UCLA provides two
  large-scale projects to give back to the community: UCLA Volunteer Day & One
  Bus/One Cause. The UCLA Volunteer Day was founded in 2009 as the nation’s
  largest service project for new university students. Volunteer Day has become
  a cornerstone of the UCLA experience. The annual day of service is when UCLA
  students, faculty, staff, alumni, parents & community members come together to
  provide service at sites in LA County. The project, which began with 4,000
  volunteers & 8 service sites, has now grown to more than 7,000 volunteers at
  200+ sites. Thousands of service hours are completed on this day with an
  impact on hundreds of organizations in LA. The UCLA One Bus/One Cause Project
  sends a bus filled with 50 UCLA staff, faculty, students, alumni & community
  volunteers into LA to address a specific need. This program occurs bi-monthly
  to address an organization's needs in a small impactful way. With two projects
  a month, our One Bus/One Cause Project records hundreds of service hours to
  worthy non-profit organizations. Note: From March 2020 until today, we
  transitioned all service programs into a virtual format to comply with COVID
  protocols. In Fall 2021, we are prepared for a virtual, in-person or hybrid
  format.

Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  “I had such a good time and really felt that I was contributing my time to a
  good cause;” “I liked that different service groups volunteered together-it
  added a sense of community because people knew each other already.” These
  testimonials are from UCLA students who participated in Volunteer Center
  programs. Through our projects, we offer LA County a group of eager and
  committed volunteers that work to create a community of growth and civic
  engagement. Our success is shown through our volunteer metrics; we have worked
  with 646 non-profit sites, 62,062 student volunteers, 49,142 first-time
  student volunteers and completed 346,092 service hours. If we secure funding,
  our goal is to increase our volunteer numbers by 10%. With 40,000+ enrolled
  students, a workplace of 42,000+ employees, we have the people power and
  connections to help push LA to lead the nation in voting and volunteering
  rates.
