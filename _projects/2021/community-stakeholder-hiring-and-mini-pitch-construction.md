title: Community Stakeholder Hiring and Mini Pitch Construction
project_summary: >-
  This grant will support Street Soccer USA's Los Angeles chapter in building
  highly accessible futsal courts on unused land, and hiring and retaining
  coaches, site managers and administrators from within the Watts and Long Beach
  communities. By providing specific access to these employment opportunities
  and safe play spaces for community stakeholders, we will ensure the continued
  growth and autonomy of the communities where programs are being provided.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - South LA
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
  - LAUSD (select only if you have a district-wide partnership or project)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  At SSUSA - LA, we seek to address a variety of problems, from assisting the
  unhoused and underserved through transitional avenues like weekly practices
  and employment opportunities to increasing awareness in health, nutrition and
  physical activity. Though these problems are all deeply rooted and deserving
  of our time and resources, our main goal is to provide access to an otherwise
  restricted environment of soccer engagement. The U.S. has a long history of
  pay to play, and we are here to change that. We are here to identify
  convertible spaces that will be used to build mini futsal pitches and expand
  unfettered, free access to communities that for far too long have been priced
  out of the sport, and subsequently been led to believe that they are not
  invited. We've found that the most effective way to bridge this equity gap is
  by employing those from the same communities that we service, so that when the
  project is at its peak, leadership will be in the hands of those same
  communities.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  As mentioned in Question 7, we've found that the most effective way to bridge
  this equity gap is by employing those from the same communities that we
  service, so that when the project is at its peak, leadership will be in the
  hands of those same communities. In order to that, though, we need to raise
  the funds necessary to build these spaces. It's one thing for an organization
  to come into a community and build, or activate a space. It's a completely
  different task to fill those organizational positions with people who
  understand the nuances, and social and cultural dynamics that are involved in
  the everyday happenings of the communities where these spaces are created. By
  doing just that; by providing the opportunities to take ownership of programs
  and operations in stakeholders' hometowns and communities, an infrastructure
  is created so that regardless of who is "in charge" at the present moment, the
  power and trajectory of the programs will always be in the hands of the
  community, not outside influences. The model involves identifying adult aged
  applicants, preferably past participants who are familiar with the structure
  of programs, vision and mission and training them to take over all operations
  on a community level. In turn, these employees will identify the next
  generation of leaders and be primed to have a self sustaining community
  operation that is so much more than a soccer club, but a space of safety,
  inclusion and community pride.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  With a combination of partnerships with 3rd party organizations, such as
  Salesforce and UpMetrics, we currently track participation, retention, age,
  gender, ethnicity, and school location. Though new, we have recently started
  to integrate our Salesforce data into the UpMetrics system in order to
  correlate participation and retention rates in programs with retention and
  graduation rates in academic settings. Furthermore, we will enhance the
  specificity of these metrics by leveraging our partnerships with LAUSD so that
  we can track and correlate participation and retention rates with academic
  performance.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '150'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '300'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Globally, soccer is an urban sport; domestically, the pay to play structure
  has made it increasingly an affluent, suburban sport, particularly at the club
  level. Our vision entails creating multiple community clubs across public
  housing developments and shelters in Watts, Long Beach, Crenshaw, West Adams,
  Willowbrook, Compton and Inglewood. We are currently operating in two
  locations in Watts, at the Imperial Courts, and Ted Watkins Park (with
  Gonzaque Village soon to come); Crenshaw and West Adams through LAUSD
  partnerships at Audubon Middle School and Cochran Middle School; and on Skid
  Row at the Union Rescue Mission. Our work will be successful when we can
  provide a community club in each of these target neighborhoods and hold
  numerous weekly practices at each site (with academic tutoring resources
  available onsite) and weekend Street Leagues where participants can
  confidently and proudly compete and represent their respective communities in
  a safe and healthy fashion.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  ThinkWatts is a dedicated partner and community based organization truly
  representative of and committed to the promise of social and economic change
  in Watts. Led by local activist and rapper Stix, ThinkWatts provides a
  multitude of resources for the community, from STEM coding labs, to creating
  open spaces for play. We are proud to collaborate on this project, as they
  will act as the primary site for where a community pitch will be located. We
  will work together to identify the most at need participants. We currently
  work with ThinkWatts in activating a number of other projects that they have
  in the works, and this pitch will present a HUB location for both ThinkWatts
  as a recreation and tutoring space, as well as one for free developmental
  soccer programs on behalf of Street Soccer USA.
Which of LA2050â€™s resources will be of the most value to you?: >-
