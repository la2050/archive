title: 'The Foto Forum: A Creative Advocacy Space for Teen Girls'
project_summary: >-
  Our vision is to provide a new platform for young women who are using their
  photography as a means to advocate for their communities. Turning the outdoor
  space of our new gallery into an outdoor exhibition space where young women
  can display their photo essays that highlight injustices found throughout
  their communities will also provide the community a safe forum to use these
  images as a catalyst for dialogue and advocacy for issues from housing to food
  insecurity and economic equity.

'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing

What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Los Angeles County BIPOC residents have been historically marginalized by
  institutions and systems. Adverse effects of this systematic disempowerment
  may include health disparities, stigma, limited resources for wellbeing, and
  limited outlets for youth-centered leadership. These disparities have been
  further exposed by the toll the pandemic has taken in these communities and
  the subsequent inaccessibility to the vaccine as it became available. In
  contributing to the transformation of what is deemed as equitable and
  inclusive, greater steps need to be taken to ensure that institutions and
  those in office are implementing such a change. By adapting an
  evidence-informed public health promotora (advocacy) model, credible youth
  leaders who participate in the Las Fotos Project Digital Promotora program,
  and who are trusted by the community can create innovative partnerships to
  gather and share stories, dismantle stigma, challenge misinformation, and
  share resources.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Since our founding in 2010, the organization has not only helped empower young
  girls through photography, but has given them the opportunity to explore a
  potential career path and as a tool for self-expression and exploration. To
  help further our mission, we have begun to establish a studio space for young
  creative entrepreneurs, which will act as an incubator for their own small
  businesses and launch pad for their future careers. This process, coupled with
  the impact of COVID19 on our communities, has surfaced the need to provide a
  similar space for young creative advocates. Our new studio location also has
  the capacity to create an outdoor exhibition & community space which would
  allow for community members to safely gather and host intentional exchange
  ideas. Our project, The Foto Forum: A Creative Advocacy Space for Teen Girls,
  will build on our existing Digital Promotoras program which works with youth
  leaders to use social media, photojournalism, and multimedia to promote
  awareness of social inequities facing their community. Their projects serve as
  first-person digital narratives that inform audiences of available health
  resources and the actions being taken to create healthier neighborhoods,
  families, and communities. The Foto Forum will amplify our students’ voices
  and their calls to action by actively engaging community members in
  solutions-based dialogue, an opportunity that is rarely experienced in
  traditional gallery spaces.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  The organization’s mission of empowering young girls from communities of color
  is rooted in our three core programs: Esta Soy Yo, Digital Promotoras, and
  Creative Entrepreneurship Opportunities. The Digital Promotoras program,
  started in 2014 is modeled after the culturally and linguistically competent
  community-based health education “promotora” model with an infusion of
  artistic expression through participatory photography and digital media
  storytelling. For the past 7 years, we have successfully adapted a proven
  model for improving health outcomes in multicultural communities and
  repurposed it to document social issues through creative expression. Our
  previous project, a ‘Girl-Powered Foto Studio by Las Fotos Project’ centered
  on providing students with resources to advance their creative careers. While
  building out the studio, we saw the opportunity to provide a physical
  community creative & advocacy space, flexible enough to adapt to ever-changing
  COVID19 protocols.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '150'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '2000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Work that our students complete through our Digital Promotoras,
  photojournalism classes highlight communities and social injustices that are
  embedded in their daily lives. Given the equipment & resources to participate,
  our students go on a semester-long journey that invites them to delve deeper
  into their communities and examine inequalities that have been embedded in
  their own neighborhoods. Through our proposed project, teenage girls in the
  Los Angeles community will have the space to have their voices amplified as
  they identify challenges within their communities and the proposed steps that
  their communities can take to come together and enact change. With youth
  highlighting their communities and placing issues important to them at the
  center of their photography, residents & communities throughout Los Angeles
  will have their stories told, all the while having a space where they can come
  together, connect with other community members and build dialogue & action
  through photography.
