title: Helping Grievers in Los Angeles County Find Hope and Healing After a Death
project_summary: >-
  Los Angeles is grieving. More than 23,000 people in our community have died
  from COVID-19, and countless others have been impacted by accidents, cancer,
  heart disease, and an increasing number of homicides, suicides, and
  drug-induced deaths. OUR HOUSE Grief Support Center helps grieving children,
  teens, and adults find hope and healing in English and Spanish after the death
  of someone close through grief support groups, education, and resources. All
  programs are currently offered online to support and connect grievers during
  the pandemic.

  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  After the death of someone close, a griever’s world turns upside down.
  Unsupported grief can lead to physical, emotional, and social risks, such as
  depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and even violence, gang activity,
  incarceration, and early death. Children and teens may disengage from school,
  and adults from workplace and communal endeavors. Grief support is especially
  needed during the COVID-19 pandemic, which, in addition to causing more than
  23,000 deaths in L.A. County, has complicated the grieving process by
  interrupting mourning rituals and isolating grievers through physical
  distancing. This is compounded by the explosion of recent traumatic deaths,
  with noted increases in drug-induced deaths, suicides, homicides, and families
  experiencing multiple deaths from COVID-19. Furthermore, there are few to no
  grief support resources for children and non-English speakers in Los Angeles,
  leaving high-need communities without the tools they need to overcome this
  adversity and thrive.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  OUR HOUSE Grief Support Center offers a variety of grief support resources to
  address this urgent need in Los Angeles and make sure that grieving children,
  teens, and adults have the opportunity to safely process their grief feelings
  and find healing. Our model, adapted from the research of grief expert J.
  William Worden, PhD, helps grievers accept the reality of the death, process
  the pain of their grief, adjust to a world without the person who died, and
  foster an enduring connection with them. Our programs have grown with the
  needs of our community, serving a diverse population of grievers throughout
  Greater L.A. We are committed to making grief support available to grievers
  with limited financial and transportation resources, as well as other life
  challenges, particularly in our programs that serve children and
  Spanish-speaking adults, most of whom are from low-income households. OUR
  HOUSE grief support groups are age- and relationship-specific, building
  communities based on shared, lived experiences. For adults, we provide groups
  for young, mid-life, and later life widows and widowers, parents grieving an
  adult child, young and mid-life adults grieving a parent, and sibling
  bereavement, in addition to Spanish-language grief support groups. For
  children and teens, these groups are organized as “Littles” (Elementary
  School), “Middles” (Middle School), and “Teens” (High School), serving youths
  at our centers, public schools, and at our Camp Erin L.A. summer grief camp.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  OUR HOUSE measures the impact of our programs with evidence-informed outcomes
  based on years of tracking and best practices in the bereavement field.
  Evaluation tools include: (1) Insights from initial pre-group appointments;
  (2) Psychosocial questionnaires; (3) Mandatory clinical supervision of group
  leaders; and (4) Insights from group activities. All grief support programs
  have demonstrated statistically significant impact in achieving the following
  outcomes. Children and teens increase their ability to name and express
  feelings related to their grief, learn healthy coping strategies, understand
  that they are not alone in their grief, and find comfort in speaking with
  grieving peers. Adults feel more comfortable expressing feelings about their
  grief, increase their ability to ask others for support, believe that they can
  lead a fulfilling and meaningful life without the person who died, and feel
  less alone after speaking with other people their age who are grieving.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1926'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '13482'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Thousands of grieving L.A. County residents benefit from the social and
  emotional support provided by OUR HOUSE’s grief support groups each year. Our
  programs normalize the isolating experience of grief and provide a toolkit of
  healthy coping skills, helping grieving individuals and families overcome the
  trauma and adversity caused by the death of a loved one. As Vanessa, a
  15-year-old, wrote: “My group showed me that it’s okay to feel angry, guilty,
  confused, etc. If I want to cry, then I can. I met new people that feel the
  same way I do. I’m not alone.” Volunteerism is another key facet of OUR
  HOUSE’s positive impact in Los Angeles. OUR HOUSE is a volunteer-driven
  organization, annually accounting for more than 500,000 donated hours of
  service. Many of our volunteers are alumni of our grief support groups. After
  experiencing the life-saving impact of grief support, these resilient
  volunteers chose to help others find their own path to hope after the death of
  someone close.
