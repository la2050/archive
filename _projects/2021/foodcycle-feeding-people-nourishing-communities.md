title: 'FoodCycle - Feeding People, Nourishing Communities'
project_summary: >-
  FoodCycle believes that there is no reason that edible food should be wasted
  while people are going hungry. The problem of hunger is not due to scarcity.
  For 15 years, FoodCycle’s community-based volunteers have recovered food that
  would have been thrown away by grocery stores, bakeries, farmer’s markets, and
  restaurants and delivered it to organizations serving the hungry. We use
  innovative technology to better recover and connect food with vulnerable
  populations in LA. Our organization works to ensure that people, not
  landfills, are fed.

'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  An estimated 40% of all food produced is wasted; this wasted food is thrown
  into landfills where it releases methane gas, which is known to be 20 times
  more harmful than CO2. Additionally, nearly 25% of California’s fresh water
  supply is used to produce wasted food. Meanwhile, nearly 1 in 8 Angelenos
  qualify as food insecure—that’s over a million people who don’t know when or
  where their next meal is coming from. The scale of the problem, already
  enormous, was compounded by the Covid19 pandemic. The food banks and food
  pantries that we support experienced dramatic increases in the amount of
  people they served. Furthermore, the issue of food insecurity
  disproportionately affects minorities and people of color. The lack of access
  to fresh produce has created "food deserts" in many areas of Los Angeles. By
  distributing excess food to ensure no food is wasted, we can reduce the impact
  on the environment as well as feed those who need it.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  In addition to our regular recovery and distribution of excess food, FoodCycle
  has used the latest in food rescue technology to create “food maps” of LA. We
  are able assess the capacity of an organization to donate food and we can also
  use the database to direct more food to areas we’ve identified as food deserts
  as well as create an efficient mapping system that allows us to efficiently
  route and distribute food into these zones. We’ve also expanded our outreach
  to businesses in order to secure additional donations to serve the areas we
  see experiencing an increased need. We believe that by collaborating with and
  supporting community-based nonprofits and sharing resources, we can best help
  expand access to food in neighborhoods experiencing food insecurity. The bulk
  of grant funds will be used to provide infrastructure to connect new donors to
  nonprofit partners. We will provide drivers and transportation to pick up
  donations and connect them with the distributions that we identify. When
  nonprofits have transportation capacity, we will first work to develop a
  successful partnership with donating businesses and then work with the
  nonprofits to smoothly transition over to them picking up directly from stores
  and other donors. The remainder of the grant funds will be used to identify
  new non-profit partners and conduct outreach and education to potential donors
  (that is, we will find more organizations who can either donate food, or use
  donated food to feed the hungry).
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  FoodCycle has the ability to track the impacts of food recovery in terms of
  people fed as well as track the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The use
  of technology, including a food recovery app, has allowed us to keep detailed
  records of these impacts and show that our existing program has resulted in
  1,743,585 meals served in 2020, and 2,092,302 pounds of food waste diverted
  from landfills, we kept 2,176 metric tons of greenhouse gases from being
  released as a result of our program. By creating a collaborative network of
  existing resources and using technology in innovative ways, we were able to
  grow 1,250% in 2020. We have increased our network of collaborating nonprofits
  from 34 in 2019 to over 140 in 2020. We anticipate being able to continue to
  grow at a rapid pace with the support of this grant and due to the local and
  state new policies that will be implemented in 2021. By continuing to harness
  technology we can clearly demonstrate our successes.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '2300000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '3300000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  FoodCycle provides a way for hungry people to have better access to free,
  healthy food in their own communities. By the end of the grant, we will have
  expanded our services and created a comprehensive food map/database that
  connects excess food with hungry people. We will have demonstrated a
  leadership role by reducing food insecurity in LA, but will mitigate climate
  change through a reduction of food waste. Innovations afforded by this grant
  will result in less food insecurity, a cleaner environment, and an increased
  revenue for the businesses that are integrated into these efforts.
  Community-based organizations will be supported to better serve their
  neighbors, and will be provided with the important resources they need to help
  build resilient communities. People throughout Los Angeles will also have more
  opportunities to volunteer to help support their communities. We also hope
  during our database expansion to include food from backyard and community
  gardens.
