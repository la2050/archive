title: City’s First Marionette Mobile to Unify a Post-Covid LA
project_summary: >-
  An LA2050 grant will support the launch of a county-wide Marionette Mobile run
  by the Bob Baker Marionette Theater to bring self-contained, COVID-compliant
  puppet performances to every corner of Los Angeles. Each show will serve to
  connect intergenerational communities through the art of puppetry– and focus
  on the emotional and healing impact puppets can have on children and young
  adults.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  As we surpass a full year of social isolation, studies show that youth are
  experiencing higher rates of depression and anxiety than any other age group.
  Even upon re-entry to a pre-pandemic manner of living, research predicts that
  there will be long-term emotional and behavioral implications resulting from
  routine disruptions; family stress due to financial pressures; loss; and even
  more time away from classrooms, friends and social groups. For nearly a
  century, the Bob Baker Theater and our collection of historic marionettes have
  been a cornerstone in the LA arts community, as both a child’s first exposure
  to live theater and a vehicle through which they can understand and articulate
  their emotions. It’s our mission to address this new reality of heightened
  anxiety by providing a joyful, accessible arts experience that will help young
  people better communicate both their internal struggles and creative
  imaginings through the unifying, time-old medium of marionette puppetry.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  We envision a county-wide expansion of our Bob Baker Marionette Mobile series,
  which will bring free performances and activities into low-income LA
  communities that have been hardest hit by Covid-19. With your support, Bob
  Baker will offer a full roster of programming in neighborhood parks/parking
  lots, with each stop-over consisting of a 30-minute performance followed by an
  activity in which youth interact with a wide array of puppets. In the event of
  another safer-at-home order or lockdown, the Marionette Mobile is fully
  viewable in drive-by format, even from the safety of ones home and bedroom
  window (inspired largely by drive-by parades and graduation celebrations). Our
  project takes inspiration from puppet trucks throughout history, such as the
  “Mobile Recreation Program” implemented in New York City in the 1960s, which
  sought to restore morale after an escalation of Civil Rights riots. Today,
  research shows that puppetry has the power to increase Social and Emotional
  Learning (SEL) skills in children, significantly elevating confidence,
  self-awareness and coping skills in those who experience and interact with the
  art form. Our request aims to empower and enliven youth to further explore the
  arts, while imbuing a sense of wonder and magic.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  We plan to measure the impact of the program both qualitatively and
  quantitatively. Qualitative data will be tracked via surveys, readily
  available to audience members on their mobile devices and as a print-out (in
  Spanish and English). Our intended outcome is for youth to report 80% or more
  improvement in social and emotional wellbeing. Surveys take under a minute and
  are designed by the Theater’s partner Hello Insight, an evaluation tool that
  helps youth development organizations prove impact and improve programs, with
  pre-built surveys, predictive analytics, and automated reports. Quantitative
  data will be tracked by program administrators, who will report on the
  following questions: 1) How many communities were served? 2) How many of those
  communities were in the 90th percentile of impoverished, Covid-impacted areas
  of Los Angeles? 3) Did the performance foster long-term engagement with
  arts-devoid communities?
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1500'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '5000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Our project aims to safely re-introduce live arts and theater to a community
  that has been devoid of in-person arts experiences since 2020. As the Los
  Angeles community has transformed to adapt to Covid-19 regulations, so has our
  programing; we’ve worked tirelessly to ensure our programs are responsive to
  community needs, both in terms of racial equity, safety and the emotional
  needs of the public. This project is a step in that direction. Furthermore, it
  represents a much-needed opportunity to unite intergenerational audiences,
  giving families a new avenue to engage restless youth, as parents now spend
  more time on childcare than ever before. Our intended impact is to increase
  the social and emotional wellbeing of youth, while re-establishing the arts as
  an extraordinary, motivational and essential part of public life in
  neighborhoods that historically lack arts opportunities.
