title: CivicASK - A Platform Connecting Civic Needs with Community Resources
project_summary: >-
  “CivicASK” is a platform connecting civic needs with community resources.
  LA2050 funds will help Civicas develop, manage and market an accessible,
  targeted and transparent website with infrastructure for individuals,
  organizations and government to build connections that are more responsive to
  community needs. Public sector ASKS (menus of civic opportunities) linked with
  Private sector OFFERS (people, businesses & groups with resources: services,
  expertise, materials and/or financial support) will engage more equitable,
  effective civic action.

project_video: ''
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  We need equitable and accessible infrastructure connecting civic stakeholders
  to better solve civic challenges. Individuals, community organizers, experts,
  businesses, funders and governments may share civic goals, though limited
  access to program staff creates inefficiencies and inequities, preventing
  initiatives from accessing available resources to maximize outcomes, scale and
  value. The CivicASK platform is a transparent tech bridge to improve
  communication, partnership and responsiveness between local governments,
  residents, communities and organizations. It will offer organized, prioritized
  opportunities to address civic challenges by filling existing gaps in
  outreach, materials, support and expertise. People can create a
  “recommendation engine” by directing others to opportunities and resources
  too. Connecting stakeholders with access to community resources (goods,
  services, funds, volunteers) will add value and amplify the reach of our City,
  County, nonprofits, and foundations.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  LA2050 funds will support developing “CivicASK”, an online “menu of civic
  opportunities” connecting civic challenges with private resources to help Los
  Angeles better serve community needs. Civicas will coordinate a team to
  develop, brand, market and manage the website. A project manager will engage
  local governments, nonprofits, foundations, neighborhood groups, businesses,
  networks and individuals to populate a platform with ASKS and OFFERS for
  potential partnerships. Civic-minded networks, organizations and residents
  across sectors, professions and demographics making OFFERS of goods, services,
  funds, volunteerism will link to ASKS from government agencies, civic networks
  and community participants. L.A. City’s Al Fresco program is a catalytic
  example of convening government departments to serve immediate needs which
  will inform the design/build of a scalable, transparent platform. Access,
  efficiency and value will be increased with better connections between the
  public and existing initiatives like these: Dept of Transportation's Al Fresco
  program Procurement’s LA Business Assistance Virtual Network Building &
  Safety’s Standard Plans Public Works’ Keep LA Beautiful Office of Budget and
  Innovation’s Mayors’ Dashboard Angeleno Account LA Optimized Volunteer LA
  Empower LA CivicASK creates opportunities for people to understand, actively
  participate, and increase the impact and value of our resources to help solve
  civic challenges throughout Los Angeles, and beyond.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  CivicASK is a pilot project of Civicas, a women’s civic action network. For
  four years we have hosted civic education forums for cross-sector leaders and
  maintained resource pages at Civicas.net on timely civic issues including
  COVID-19, social justice, civic health, civic space, education, climate change
  and civic organizations. We also present civic news & events to thousands of
  Angelenos via the monthly Civicas Review. Expanding this work into an
  interactive platform will amplify our reach and impact while linking more
  residents, nonprofits, foundations and government agencies working to address
  civic challenges. Some metrics we will measure include: User access,
  demographics, SEO Number of offers made Number of connections made between
  government agencies and civic organizations or individuals making offers
  Success of programs utilizing connections made with CivicASK in achieving
  desired and equitable civic outcomes (Al Fresco example) Growth of a regional
  resource network
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '300'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '5000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  CivicASK will help Los Angeles be a place where every resident is empowered to
  engage with others to address civic goals. This platform will enhance
  communication of civic initiatives and coordination with community resources.
  The impact of civic engagement and resources will be amplified in many areas
  including other LA2050 metrics like disability access which can be addressed
  by connecting with LA City’s Public Works disability programs. Neighborhood
  Council participation can be increased by linking to EmpowerLA. Organizations
  with projects and programs in the LA2050 archive can immediately populate the
  platform with current opportunities and requests for resources. In the
  long-term, CivicASK will become a self-sustaining, scalable model for access
  to civic initiatives. Angelenos will connect with people and projects across
  sectors and neighborhoods, increasing empathy and access to civic
  opportunities and resources, and improving life throughout the Los Angeles
  region, and beyond.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  Civicas is collaborating with Los Angeles Mayor’s Office and County of L.A.
  Several City departments (including Public Works, Procurement, Design,
  Beautification, Economic Development and Volunteer LA) expressed enthusiasm
  for connecting CivicASK to their evolving digital platforms. Building
  infrastructure prioritizing communication and efficient connections will
  simplify and increase equitable access to government initiatives which adds
  value to their investments. Agencies will participate and inform the
  platform’s design while initiatives like Al Fresco, LA Optimized and LA n Sync
  begin populating the directory’s “Menu of Civic Opportunities”. Our technology
  partner, Inspiring Service, redesigned, built and maintains the City of L.A.’s
  Volunteer LA website, originally funded by LA2050.
