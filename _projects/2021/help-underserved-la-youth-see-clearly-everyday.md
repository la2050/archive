title: Help Underserved LA Youth See Clearly Everyday!
project_summary: >-
  Vision To Learn (VTL) was founded to make sure that every child in America has
  the glasses he or she needs to succeed in school and in life. About 1 in 4
  kids naturally needs glasses. In low-income communities, approximately 95% of
  kids who need glasses do not have them. VTL seeks to solve this problem
  affecting over 250,000 students in LA County by bringing a mobile optometric
  clinic directly to schools and community sites to provide students in
  low-income communities with vision care: screenings, eye exams and glasses,
  all free of charge.

What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  VTL addresses a problem affecting over 2 million school children nationwide,
  and more than 250,000 in LA County, who lack the glasses they need to see the
  board, read a book, study math or participate in class. 1 in 4 kids naturally
  need glasses. But, in underserved communities, 95% of kids who need glasses do
  not have them. Students with uncorrected vision problems often avoid reading,
  suffer headaches, and have trouble focusing in class, as 80% of learning
  during a child’s first 12 years is visual. They are more likely to fail a
  grade, less likely to read by third grade – a milestone critical to preventing
  dropout – and more likely to engage in delinquent behavior (70% of juvenile
  offenders have uncorrected vision). The issue is one of access many low-income
  communities have few eye doctors, families are not aware of the need for
  eyecare and lack transportation or other resources. VTL’s mobile clinics
  address this need by meeting the children where they are every day – in
  school.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  VTL will complete approximately 3,320 screenings, 830 eye exams (25% fail rate
  from screenings) and provide 664 prescription glasses (80% of exams result in
  glasses) during school year 2021-2022. VTL has the capacity and proven track
  record to accomplish this goal. VTL has 8 clinics in LA serving students in 28
  school districts and children organizations (e.g., Boys & Girls Clubs). Since
  January 2018, VTL has provided nearly 500,000 vision screenings, 54,874 exams
  and 43,888 pairs of glasses to LA Unified students, representing nearly half
  of the students in LA County. Beginning in SY 2021-22, our proposed program is
  to provide glasses to every remaining K‐12th grade child in LA County who
  needs them. VTL has signed MOUs with many LA school districts towards this
  goal for SY 2021-22. VTL’s Screening and Examination process is: 1. VTL
  schedules and performs vision screenings using a Welch Allyn Spot Vision
  Screener, to determine which students have vision difficulties. 2. VTL’s
  mobile clinic comes to the school, where trained opticians and optometrists
  conduct eye exams for every student who fails their vision screening. 3. If a
  student needs glasses, he/she chooses a frame from a wide selection on the
  clinic. Glasses are delivered approximately 3 weeks later. 4. If a child
  loses/breaks their glasses within 1 year, VTL replaces them free of charge. 5.
  VTL returns every 2 years to provide continuity of care at schools.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Since our founding in 2012, VTL has provided over 500,000 vision screenings,
  147,400 eye exams and 116,100 glasses to over 1580 sites -- helping the most
  vulnerable children in LA see clearly. VTL measures the number of students
  provided vision care by tracking the followingdata: vision screenings, exams,
  glasses, and vision correction in a secure, cloud-based Electronic Medical
  Records (EMR) database, updated in real time by optometric staff in our mobile
  clinics. VTL’s EMR tracks results by student, mobile clinic, school district,
  and geographic area, which means we are able to report outcomes and exact
  number of children served.. A recent Johns Hopkins/Wilmer Eye Institute 3-year
  controlled study has shown that students recovered significant learning time
  due to VTL’s program as measured by standardized test results. This is
  critical to closing the learning gap, in post-COVID LA.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '3320'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '13280'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  VTL provides glasses predominantly to students of color and students in need.
  All LA K-12 schools served by VTL have student populations where 65% or more
  qualify for the federal Free and Reduced Price Lunch Program. By closing a
  healthcare access gap for these students, VTL fosters opportunity by helping
  them do better in school, participate in sports, and have the self-confidence
  to thrive in daily life. VTL uses an evidence-based model of care,
  independently analyzed by researchers at the UCLA Mattel Children's Hospital
  and Johns Hopkins Wilmer Eye Center. We expect children provided glasses by
  VTL to have: (1) Improved Access to Care. (2) Prevention of Blindness:
  Students with more serious eye conditions were referred to follow-up care. (3)
  Academic Improvement: Students receiving glasses from VTL showed improvements
  in math and reading GPAs. (4) Higher Self Esteem: Group screening and exams
  reduced the stigma traditionally associated with wearing glasses.
