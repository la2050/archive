title: Slashing Street Crashes With Artificial Intelligence
project_summary: >-
  248 Angelos died crossing streets or biking home last year. Using video & AI,
  we’ll probe 20 deadly intersections for pedestrians and cyclists and we’ll
  give agencies across the county the data they need to solve them.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - San Gabriel Valley
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South LA
  - Westside
  - South Bay
  - Antelope Valley
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Applying a proven model or solution to a new issue or sector (e.g., using a
  job recruiting software or strategy to match clients to supportive housing
  sites, applying demonstrated strategies from advocating for college
  affordability to advocating for housing affordability and homelessness, etc.)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Last year my wife was hit and injured at an intersection. When the police
  showed up they said “no one is bleeding so we don’t need to write a police
  report.” What?! Overnight she went from being a marathon runner to having
  irreversible herniated & bulging disks in her neck and back which made it
  impossible to stand, walk, or sit without pain. Imagine if that was you. Last
  year crashes killed 631 and injured 63,740 across Los Angeles County. 248
  pedestrians and cyclists lost their lives. Ultimately transportation agencies
  have to wait years for people to get injured and killed BEFORE there’s enough
  data to identify the root safety concerns, let alone solve them. Nationally
  30% of crashes go unreported. Ped & Bike crashes are rare enough that even
  with 5 years of data there typically isn’t a pattern and when a crash happens
  you’re 20 times more likely to die than a vehicle occupant. No wonder more
  people don’t walk and bike in LA!
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  At Street Simplified, we specialize in helping public sector transportation
  agencies solve crashes using video analytics and AI. We’ve already worked at
  70 intersections with 18 agencies including several in Los Angeles County:
  Pasadena, Arcadia, and Santa Clarita. We propose to use our analytics to study
  the 20 deadliest intersections across the county for pedestrians and cyclists.
  We use 24 hours of video taken from high-resolution temporary cameras to
  capture near misses, red-light running, speeding, and ped/bike non-compliance.
  In a single day, we capture 20 times as much risk data as you’d get from a
  year of crash reports. We then build detailed safety reports which outline the
  risk patterns we observe and provide a menu of proven mitigations that reduce
  crashes and save lives. The last step is to walk through the data and our
  safety analysis with the agencies that manage those intersections so they can
  take action on problems which in most cases, they weren't aware of or didn’t
  know how to fix. We already have a shortlist of locations extracted from TIMS,
  but the exact locations will depend on which agencies choose to participate.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  How we are measuring impact 1. We highlight potential recommendations which
  have already been proven. Crash reduction is measured with “Crash Modification
  Factors” which indicate the expected reduction in crashes for a given
  mitigation. The CMF clearinghouse http://www.cmfclearinghouse.org/ provides a
  list of over 1000 proven countermeasures that we draw from. Impact can be
  assessed by multiplying the current crash rate by the modification factor to
  estimate the statistical impact of a mitigation. 2. We conduct before/after
  evaluations using our video analytics to measure near misses, red-light
  running, speeding, and ped/bike non-compliance before and after making a
  change and this allows us to estimate crash reduction within weeks of a
  project rather than years. 3. Five years from now, the crash data will show a
  statistical decrease in crashes at locations where we studied and agencies
  took effective action.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '240'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '12000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  We assess pedestrian-cyclist and vehicle safety risk and thus will use total
  crashes for the impact analysis. The top 10 crash locations in LA all had over
  15 reported injury crashes last year. At 20 locations like this, that would be
  ~3000 crashes over 10 years. Typically 1 in 200 crashes results in a fatality
  so that’s 15 people dead over 10 years at these locations. If the ratio of
  total fatalities to ped/bike fatalities from last year persists, 5 or 6 of
  those killed would be pedestrians or cyclists. We recommend potential
  countermeasures backed up by years of research from FHWA which in aggregate
  typically would reduce crashes by 80%. We work closely with each agency
  partner to ensure that they take action and realize these benefits. In the
  worst case let’s just say they implement only half of our proposed
  mitigations. That’s still 1200 injury crashes eliminated, 6 lives saved, and 2
  or 3 pedestrians or cyclists who can live another day over the next 10 years.
