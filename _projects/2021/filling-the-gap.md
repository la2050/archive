title: Filling the Gap
project_summary: >-
  Filling the Gap provides underprivileged high school students in South Central
  Los Angeles with mentorship and the resources to cultivate self-agency,
  confidence, and purpose. Combining a curriculum centered around human
  development with a robust program for developing and implementing passion
  projects, Filling the Gap gives students access to rich and empowering
  experiences. Graduates of the program will have executed a project of their
  own, and in doing so will have developed confidence in navigating the world
  and their place in it.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - South LA
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Filling the Gap is a direct response to the current cultural climate, which
  lacks in its ability to support the passions of students in ALL areas of life.
  Especially in underprivileged communities, we recognize a deficit in the
  belief that student ideas can change the world, and they often don’t pursue
  creative, entrepreneurial, or social change fields out of fear of not being
  “successful” and often don’t have the experience or resources to pursue these
  endeavors. Without conversation around personal boundaries, consent, healthy
  relationships, and financial planning, they ultimately won’t be able to make
  their passions a reality that is compatible with our current cultural climate.
  Recognizing that cultural capital is as important as monetary capital, these
  restrictions ultimately limit social progress, as it keeps important and
  marginalized voices from participating in creative and innovative spaces.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  This grant will primarily fund student projects, especially underprivileged
  students, increasing representation in creative, technological,
  entrepreneurial, and social change fields, as these are the most
  underrepresented in this cultural climate. The curriculum consists of
  workshops on personal boundaries/consent, healthy relationships, and financial
  planning, which provides a basis for project development and implementation
  (grant proposals, piloting, and reassessment), empowering them through a
  holistic background, guidance, and experience. These students spearhead a
  project independently, receive mentorship for their passions, and develop
  their ideas. These skills modeling research, entrepreneurship, and social
  change methods are useful long after their individual project is completed and
  applicable to many fields. We give them a safe place to create, which will
  ripple through their lives and community, ultimately affecting many through
  this social change.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  This project began as The Why Project in 2020 but has expanded to include a
  more holistic curriculum and purpose. Our pilot program targeted New Designs
  Charter School in South Central LA and garnered extensive student interest of
  40+ students (~75% of students approached). Unfortunately, after our pilot
  meeting, schools were shut down due to COVID. We used this time to refine and
  expand our curriculum. With vaccination updates and student safety in mind, we
  will continue the program in person this upcoming school year. Moving forward,
  considering our past numbers, we plan on involving at least 3 schools to reach
  our intended direct impact. Based on the interest generated from our pilot
  project, it is clear that we meet a real need experienced by students. Initial
  measures of success involve student engagement but would later expand to
  include project milestones (research, funding/grants, pilot, implementation,
  refinement) and survey results of student satisfaction and confidence.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '150'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '2000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Our empowerment of underprivileged students to pursue passions that may not be
  supported in school curriculum would lead to more informed citizenship while
  also bringing communities together through mentorship, specifically USC with
  the surrounding low income, marginalized neighborhood. Their experience in the
  program builds self-confidence in actualizing an idea of their own creation
  but also a launching pad for their future endeavors. The students would know
  firsthand the entire process of project development from research and grant
  proposals to implementation and refinement. The mentorship, resources, and
  experiences within this program extend to adulthood with USC connections, thus
  broadening representation in technological, creative, and innovative
  industries where diversity is lacking. Ideally, these social change projects
  would take off as independent initiatives, winning external funding, improving
  the schools, local community, and broader city of Los Angeles.
