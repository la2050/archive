title: Educational Nonprofit Igniting Resilience that Produces Brilliance.
project_summary: >-
  IHADLA’s program provides 12+ years of support to youth living in under-served
  communities to achieve their full potential, by promoting values of higher
  education and career success from first grade to and through college, with
  opportunity guaranteed through academic, professional and financial resources.
  This grant will allow us to continue helping students effectively navigate a
  pathway to an empowered future through the increase of our virtual program,
  breaking the cycle of intergenerational poverty and leading to increased
  student success.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - East LA
  - South LA
  - South Bay
  - 'Other:: Inglewood'
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Our youth experience far greater odds of not completing high school than the
  state dropout average. Students that do not complete high school are four
  times more likely to be unemployed and over eight times more likely to be
  incarcerated than high school graduates. Even once they attend college,
  studies have shown that only 18% of Latino and 22% of Black LAUSD students
  complete college over 6 years. Additionally, the pandemic has had drastic
  consequences for our community. Almost a third of students’ parents have lost
  their jobs or have a reduced work schedule. Many are undocumented and not
  eligible for many resources; some are one-income households. Many students
  receive varying degrees of distance learning or do not have the technology
  necessary to engage. In 2020 Governor Newson projected "a $54 billion deficit
  and $19 billion less in Prop. 98 funding over two years for schools", which,
  combined with other challenges, stands to increase our student’s learning
  losses exponentially.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  IHADLA's program includes year-round virtual afterschool programming, &
  homework support. Students receive extracurricular enrichment, including STEAM
  workshops, virtual field trips, and wellness classes. We ensure college
  readiness by assisting with the application process and providing remote test
  prep, financial aid/scholarship support, and academic counseling. Students
  receive career exposure and guidance through our Dream Speaker and Mentor
  programs, where they build relationships and network with professionals. MSW
  interns conduct case management, therapy and mental health workshops. We
  provide monthly phone and video check-ins to support students’ transitions
  into college or career as well as two annual educational boot camps. These
  workshops instruct students on navigating campus issues and afford tools to
  manage stress, build community, and explore career opportunities and goodness
  of fit. Our approach is unique for its selection process, breadth of services
  and virtual implementation. When sponsoring a new program, we select an entire
  1st grade class, no matter academic history, and students receive services
  even if they move out of the area. Our comprehensive approach promotes
  academic, emotional, and career development, supporting students’ overall
  prosperity. Finally, our use of virtual platforms follows COVID-19 protocol
  while maintaining our full range of programming, alleviating the impact of
  environmental, systemic and digital barriers to students’ success.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  IHADLA utilizes a comprehensive approach to measure success. Frontline staff
  continuously input data on each student's participation, performance, and
  graduation rates to ensure academic success in real-time. Staff also provide
  case management to track goal attainment, community referrals such as mental
  health, and resource distribution. The Senior Director of Programs creates
  quarterly dashboard reports that include the data collected that the Board
  evaluates. We empower underserved students to pursue their academic and
  professional aspirations, and our program works: 98% of our Class of 2018 and
  96% of the Class of 2019 graduated high school on time. 95% of college
  sophomores and 81% of freshmen, and over 95% of younger students continued
  through the 2020-2021 academic year. In 33 years, we've reached over 11
  thousand people, evidence of our ripple effect; our students, often
  first-generation, provide new hope for their communities as peers and parents
  follow in their footsteps.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '350'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1386'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Our short- and long-term visions for success involve growing our virtual
  offerings to mitigate new and preexisting digital and systemic impacts on our
  students' futures and growing our population served. IHADLA is solidifying the
  remote formats of our mentor and internship programs as well as college
  application and financial aid workshops to bolster students’ pursuits of
  higher education and career. We intend to utilize online platforms for
  students to engage with mentors and professionals and receive hands-on
  experience in resume, personal statements and application writing. Success
  also includes our cohort of 11th graders remaining on-track to graduate high
  school, and with their graduation, the sponsorship of a new class of 1st
  graders. By continuously growing our offerings and numbers, IHADLA will
  increase underserved students’ chances of high school graduation, college
  completion, and personal goal attainment, thus leading to empowered
  communities wherever their services exist.
