title: Building Accessibility For Persons With Disabilities
project_summary: >-
  Angel City Sports supports people with disabilities reaching their fullest
  potential to engage with their communities as well as help the community
  discover how to proactively and respectfully practice disability inclusion. To
  accomplish this, we create a broad spectrum of adaptive wellness opportunities
  for adults and children with physical disabilities to support their physical,
  mental, and emotional well-being. The general public has an opportunity to
  participate in these adaptive activities, creating greater connection and
  awareness.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Today 22.6% of L.A. County adults (LA County Dept. of Public Health) and 3% of
  youth (KidsData) – a total of 2,560,000 members of our community - are living
  with a disability. Many are not fully participating in our community due to
  various barriers. The main five barriers to accessibility for persons with
  disabilities are: Attitudinal (how they are perceived by others and
  themselves); Systemic (policies, procedures, and practices); Physical (lack of
  adaptive modifications); Communications (lack of adaptions for sensory
  disabled); and Technological (lack of assistive devices). ACS works to reduce
  these barriers to help persons with disabilities reach their fullest potential
  to engage with their communities as well as help the community discover how to
  proactively and respectfully practice disability inclusion. By creating
  greater accessibility and inclusion for people with disabilities, the entire
  Los Angeles community becomes stronger.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  ACS creates a broad spectrum of adaptive activities and wellness programs for
  adults, children, and veterans who are living with physical disabilities and
  impairments. Through a holistic combination of year-round clinics, events,
  workshops, and classes, ACS supports the physical, mental, and emotional
  well-being for persons with disabilities so they can: 1) Maintain a positive
  mood and prevent depression; 2) Develop a greater sense of independence and
  self-efficacy; 3) Feel more included and empowered in their communities; 4)
  More readily access adaptive wellness activities; 5) Connect with positive
  mentors and peers with similar disabilities; and 6) Cultivate the positive
  mindset that supports obtaining and maintaining employment. ACS serves over
  1,000 people with disabilities annually through its year-round programs which
  are currently virtual but will resume in-person when it is safe to do so. In
  addition, ACS provides opportunities for community members to develop greater
  understanding about disabilities through awareness events, volunteering, and
  opportunity to participate in adaptive activities. By learning more about and
  interacting with individuals with disabilities, people learn respectful
  terminology, to not make assumptions, and most importantly, to see the person
  before the disability and make a more conscious effort towards accessible
  actions.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  The goals of ACS programs include: Removing barriers, promoting access, and
  encouraging participation in adaptive fitness and wellness activities;
  Promoting self-efficacy and independence; Addressing diverse regional needs
  and connecting people with disabilities with available resources; Creating an
  ecosystem that connects people with disabilities and partners to spark the
  adaptive sports movement; and Increasing awareness in the community around the
  importance and need for adaptive activities and opportunities through various
  types of media, volunteer opportunities, and participation in adaptive events
  alongside people with disabilities. ACS measures its quantitative impact
  through participation and engagement numbers. Qualitative impact data is
  primarily evaluation through comprehensive surveys that inquire about
  post-participation levels of confidence, esteem, and motivation to continue to
  engage in adaptive health/wellness activities.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '6600'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '6000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  According to the CDC, communities that are attentive to the health of its
  members can reduce the inequality among their residents. By addressing the
  physical, mental, and emotional needs of people with disabilities, they are
  empowered to be engaged, contributing community members. In addition to their
  strengths and skills, people with disabilities often model creativity,
  resiliency, and a solution-based approach to challenges. Adults and youth,
  with and without disabilities, learning and working side-by-side helps
  everybody appreciate the talents and gifts everyone brings with them. As a
  community, we have the responsibility to promote the inclusion of our
  differences. Having a people-first mindset creates inclusivity where there
  have previously been barriers. This shared personal relatedness supports
  perpetual growth of ourselves, each other, and our community. ACS’ vision is
  that adults and youth with disabilities are healthy and embraced as equal
  members of their communities.
