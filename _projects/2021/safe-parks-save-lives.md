title: Safe Parks Save Lives
project_summary: >-
  Harvard Park is surrounded by children and families who deserve a safe place
  to play, but they are unable to access their local park because of pervasive
  community violence. The Urban Peace Institute will combat rising gun and gang
  violence levels by empowering peacemakers and community leaders to create
  neighborhood safety. New peace ambassadors will collaborate with trained
  community leaders to reduce violence, and ensure children and families feel
  safe enough to play at Harvard Park.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Harvard Park families are unable to safely visit parks, schools and local
  stores because of pervasive community violence. These are fundamental
  activities that promote health and well-being. A local youth recently shared,
  “There are gangs on the part of the park, and I don’t want to get shot.”
  Recently, Harvard Park ranked as the fourth highest for violent crime out of
  272 Los Angeles neighborhoods. With the historic rise in gun violence,
  residents are now even more fearful of simply playing within the park and
  neighborhood. Since January 2021, shootings in South Los Angeles have
  increased by 234% and homicides are up by 150% compared to last year. Harvard
  Park has a long-standing history of high crime and gang entrenchment. Yet, the
  neighborhood remains historically overlooked, experiencing decades of public
  disinvestment resulting from structural racism, and leading to the highest
  poverty rates in the region with 34% of residents having a median income of
  $20,000 or less.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  The Safe Parks Save Lives project will lower gang and gun violence levels
  within Harvard Park and the surrounding community to establish a safe space
  for all families to play. To successfully reduce violence levels, UPI will
  train three new peace ambassadors stationed in local crime hot spots to
  mitigate gang tensions and stop violent gang retaliations before they start.
  UPI will also expand its Leadership Institute program to provide civic
  engagement training to five new Harvard Park residents. After completing our
  seven-month Leadership Institute’s Emerging Leaders course, these residents
  will be empowered to lead community-driven safety strategies and coordinate
  efforts between the new peace ambassadors, public leaders, school officials,
  and law enforcement officers engaged in the Community Safety Partnership
  initiative. UPI’s established Harvard Park Regional School Safety
  Collaborative will also convene 50 participants to further establish
  neighborhood safety by creating safe routes to schools and parks. UPI will
  also train four community intervention workers who coordinate the Summer Night
  Lights initiative, which will work to additionally reduce violence during the
  summer months by providing safe, family friendly activities at Harvard Park.
  Moreover, UPI will continue coordinating the Community Safety Partnership
  initiative to ensure increased community engagement and trust among residents,
  gang intervention workers, and officers.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  In 2017, UPI conducted a community needs assessment which engaged 979
  stakeholders to identify residents’ most pressing safety concerns in Harvard
  Park. It uncovered gun violence and gang activity as the top community issue,
  with only 33% of residents feeling safe being outside during the day. While
  the Community Safety Partnership initiative provided additional law
  enforcement officers, there has not been an equal investment in developing
  community leadership to coordinate safety strategies, nor an increase in gang
  intervention capacity to adequately address rising crime levels since
  COVID-19. To assess the effectiveness of UPI’s efforts in reducing violence
  and creating opportunities for play, UPI will track violence levels pre and
  post the program, as well as conduct additional surveys with residents to
  assess perceptions of safety. We expect crime and gun violence levels to
  decrease by at least 15% and resident perceptions of safety to increase by at
  least 10% over the next year.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '100'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '10000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Without a basic level of safety, play is not possible for all Los Angeles
  children, especially for children of color living in underserved communities
  experiencing disproportionate levels of violence. While families in Harvard
  Park have a park in their neighborhood, rising gun and gang violence levels
  prevent families from feeling safe enough to walk to or bike to the park, and
  even play within the park. As one youth describes, “the park is really nice,
  beautiful, but then a body will drop like nothing.” The Safe Parks Save Lives
  project will work to transform violence levels and reduce crime and gun
  violence by at least 15% over the next year. Increased safety will ensure
  families feel comfortable traveling to and from the park, utilizing the
  playgrounds, and playing on the sports fields. This initiative can serve as a
  model to help transform parks and communities through peacemakers and local
  community-based leadership development in South Los Angeles and greater Los
  Angeles County.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  UPI will collaborate with its long-time partner, Chapter T.W.O., to provide
  expanded gang intervention services through the hiring of three new peace
  ambassadors in Harvard Park. Chapter T.W.O. is a nonprofit organization with a
  mission to improve community safety in Harvard Park, and throughout South Los
  Angeles, by providing violence intervention services, youth mentoring,
  COVID-19 outreach and nutrition assistance to low-income families of color.
  UPI and Chapter T.W.O. have formally collaborated for over a decade to provide
  violence intervention services through funding provided by the Mayor’s Office
  of Gang Reduction and Youth Development. Chapter T.W.O. will hire and
  supervise three new peace ambassadors and ensure they work collaboratively
  with community leaders to reduce violence.
