title: 'Uni(verse), the world''s first interactive classroom poetry platform'
project_summary: >-
  Get Lit’s Uni(verse) is the world's first interactive poetry platform designed
  with youth voices and stories at the center. Based on our award-winning
  curriculum, this learning management system invites students to dialogue with
  the past, bring it to the present, and build new worlds through the gravity
  and impact of their voice. Our hybrid, deeply personal call-and-response model
  enables students across L.A. to share art in and outside of school with
  peer-to-peer feedback, and engage in activism to affect change in their
  classes and community.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  According to The Literacy Project, 25% of California’s 6 million students lack
  basic reading skills. With such poor readers, 44% of students entering Cal
  State schools need remediation. Without the ability to read at a proficient
  level, our youth face great impediments to their success, including roadblocks
  to careers, to full participation in their communities, and to comprehension
  of national and global issues affecting their lives. Add to this the COVID-19
  pandemic’s traumatic effect on our students, teachers, and schools,
  interrupting the education of those already struggling, widening the
  achievement gap between economic strata, and creating skyrocketing rates of
  depression among isolated youth. Uni(verse) offers youth a straightforward
  entry into literacy and self-expression. It provides academic rigor and
  structure that many online learning programs lack, with opportunities for
  intellectual challenges, feedback, discussion, meaningful connection, and
  deeply addressing emotions.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  In August 2021, Get Lit will launch Uni(verse), the world's first interactive
  poetry platform for the classroom. Based on “Words Ignite,” our award-winning,
  impactful poetry, literacy, and youth empowerment curriculum, Uni(verse) will
  give L.A. students the ability to access our curriculum online and to exchange
  ideas within and outside of school. Uni(verse) provides deeply personalized,
  hybrid learning through video and written modules, peer-to-peer feedback, and
  engaging content with Get Lit alumni. It features teacher professional
  development, guest speakers, contests, a library of resources, performances by
  our award-winning youth poetry troupe the Get Lit Players, virtual visits
  between classrooms, and a poetry exchange through which youth poets can share
  their work and score and converse about one another's art. It includes our
  annual poetry Anthology (getlitanthology.org/) with videos, bios, and
  downloadable poems filterable by poet, theme, literary device, etc. Uni(verse)
  participants may also compete in our annual Classic Slam, the largest youth
  classic poetry competition in the world. Uni(verse) will give students and
  teachers, especially in under-resourced areas, the broadest educational access
  and options. It will support and make connections between youth who feel
  isolated; facilitate collaborations; provide vital socio-emotional outlets;
  and enable us to reach the greatest number and widest socio-economic strata of
  L.A. youth with our life-changing services.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Our goal in 2021-22 is for Uni(verse) to be utilized by at least 48,000 L.A.
  County students, with availability to all students in 2022-23. Our curriculum
  is aligned with CA Common Core, VAPA, and CASEL Social and Emotional Learning
  Standards, approved by the University of CA as an “A-G” college preparatory
  credit, and by LAUSD as an Intervention Course. The platform incorporates our
  Scoremetrics app for tracking student growth in writing, performing,
  articulation, and emotional connection to material. Using real-time teacher
  and peer-to-peer evaluation, this game-like app improves Level 4 Depth of
  Knowledge skills and builds relationships among youth. We will also administer
  student surveys at the start and end of each semester. In addition to artistic
  skills and knowledge, surveys will measure retention rates, engagement, and
  overall depth of learning. Evidence of our impact will include significant
  improvement in students’ attendance, grades, and literacy after participation.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '48000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '800000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Uni(verse) reimagines the student experience for L.A. youth, will transform
  the format of education, and will improve literacy on a broad scale. It will
  close the achievement gap by providing online personalized learning
  experiences to all students regardless of socio-economic level. Students’
  voices and students’ stories are at the center of Uni(verse). It will ignite
  their love of language, support college readiness, and change classroom
  dynamics allowing all students to share and engage in cross-county dialogue.
  With our call-and-response model, students claim a classic poem that resonates
  with their own stories and write original responses, placing the greatest
  poets in history in dialogue with L.A. youth. Uni(verse) guides students in
  discovering, developing, and amplifying their voices, supports communicating
  both among youth and to a larger ecosystem, fosters empowerment, and develops
  leaders prepared to generate tangible change in their communities.
