title: Los Angeles Refugee Representation Project
project_summary: >-
  Al Otro Lado’s Los Angeles Refugee Representation Project connects recently
  liberated asylum seekers and longer-term immigrant residents to necessary
  resources and support. Our holistic model blends legal and case management
  services with direct humanitarian support because we recognize that we cannot
  expect clients to engage in their legal cases, attend medical appointments, or
  navigate benefits unless and until their basic needs (food, clothing, shelter)
  are met.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  In January 2020, the State of Immigrants in LA County (SOILA) reported a
  population of 10+ million people and about 36 percent (or 3.6 million)
  residents were foreign born. While immigrants clearly make up a large portion
  of LA’s population, they remain an untapped civic force; in 2016, an estimated
  768,000 individuals were eligible-to-naturalize (ETN) but had not yet done so,
  thus making them unable to vote or engage in other civic participation. One
  barrier to engagement is language; about 30 percent of all immigrant-headed
  households are linguistically-isolated, defined as having no member age 14 or
  older who speaks English at least “very well.” Regarding social support, LA
  has one of the largest immigrant populations in California but coverage in
  terms of immigrant-serving organizations is less robust compared to other
  counties: there are three such organizations per 100,000 individuals in LA
  County compared to ten organizations per 100,000 non-citizen immigrants in
  Alameda County.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  AOL’s approach to advancing equity for immigrant communities in service
  delivery is both individual and systemic. On an individual level, we believe
  in “meeting clients where they are,” whether literally (i.e. street-based
  outreach for homeless clients), or figuratively (i.e. employing
  trauma-informed treatment models for clients suffering from PTSD). Unlike most
  nonprofits, our holistic model blends legal and case management services with
  direct humanitarian support; we recognize that we cannot expect clients to
  engage in their legal cases, attend medical appointments, or navigate benefits
  unless their basic needs (food, clothing, shelter) are met. AOL moved our
  headquarters to Southeast LA because there are few immigration legal service
  providers in the area. Our staff travels throughout the County to meet clients
  and provide transportation to appointments along with benefit/service
  navigation in the following areas: legal (including fee assistance for
  application filing, fingerprints, expert witnesses,
  interpretation/translation, etc.), COVID testing and vaccination, DMV
  requirements for identification cards and driver licenses, voter registration,
  basic necessities including monetary assistance for food, utilities and rent,
  referrals to employment, mental and medical health providers, application
  assistance for public benefits (Medi-Cal, Cal Fresh, refugee cash program,
  etc.), information about ESL classes, filing taxes, opening bank accounts and
  building credit.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  In 2020, we achieved the following in our clients’ immigration legal cases: 60
  completed cases before USCIS, EOIR, BIA, and federal court; 13 asylum grants;
  10 adjustment of status (green card) approvals; 6 federal court orders of
  release for detained clients. For clients who win asylum, our year-long case
  management plan tracks: Week 1: housing, transportation, essentials (phone,
  toiletries, clothing, covid safety kit) Month 1: work permit, Covid test,
  assess need for services (therapy, medical, educational) Months 1-3: enroll in
  public benefits (refugee cash assistance, insurance, food stamps), social
  security card, state ID, driver’s license, family petition (if needed),
  long-term housing, identify local immigrant friendly resources, get vaccines
  (if available in client’s location) Months 3-6: secure employment, maintain
  contact to confirm they are on track, taxes reminder Aftercare: communicate at
  least 1x/month to ensure clients are on track to “self-sufficiency”.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '100'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  We hope that our work will move LA County closer to being a more welcoming and
  inclusive place for all immigrants, as outlined in the SOILA’s recommendations
  for governments, businesses and organizations. We are investing in expanding
  civic engagement opportunities and strengthening the voice and power of
  immigrants by providing financial resources and legal assistance for the
  naturalization process. We are also committed to supporting immigrants’ mental
  and physical health through referrals and warm hand-offs to trusted service
  providers in order to reduce the barriers, fear and uncertainties our clients
  may have about accessing these benefits and services, especially with regard
  to potential consequences for their immigration cases. Ultimately, our goal is
  to ensure that our clients, and immigrants in general, can accomplish their
  goals and dreams and thrive in this place that we all call home.
