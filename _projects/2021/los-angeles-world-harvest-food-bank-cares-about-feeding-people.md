title: Los Angeles World Harvest Food Bank Cares About Feeding People
project_summary: >-
  World Harvest Charities and Family Services operates World Harvest Food Bank
  (WHFB). We provide food, basic staples and essential items to individuals and
  families who have limited resources to meet their most basic needs. WHFB
  follows both the front line and warehouse food bank models allowing families
  to shop in a retail environment as close to a real shopping experience versus
  the standard food bank box model. We also provide boxed food supplies to
  agencies for redistribution. Getting food to people is priority.

What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Los Angeles World Harvest Food Bank provides nutritious, organic food items to
  more than 500,000 individuals and 75,000 families each year. Nearly 40% of the
  people served by the Los Angeles World Harvest Food Bank network are children,
  another 8.1% are elderly, and 31.8% of the families are working but struggling
  to make ends meet. Decreasing the ever growing number of families and
  individuals in need of food and basic necessities is the goal. Due to COVID19,
  high unemployment numbers, and uncertainty of how bills will get paid,
  families are in need of programs like WHFB. Helping families and individuals
  eat nutritiously and sustain a healthy diet is the goal during these
  unprecedented difficult times.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  WHFB currently distributes an average of half a million pounds of food monthly
  through the facility with 200 plus partner agency which includes food
  pantries, soup kitchens, shelters and after school programs for children. WHFB
  primary role in the program will be to acquire the necessary components of the
  boxes, assemble and distribute these boxes to organizations, families, and
  individuals in the food insecure spectrum. WHFB has identified subcontractors
  we intend to partner with to expand the Food Box Program. Subcontractors
  include growers, producers, processors, distributors, “last mile''
  entity/distributors. WHFB will take the lead to work with all entities to
  procure food box contents and coordinate arrangements for the distribution
  logistics for the end users. Although WHFB has a store that participants can
  come to and replenish their food supplies, there is a large community that are
  unable to travel to the store. Working with social service agencies, churches,
  schools and community groups WHFB will bring the food to them. WHFB has
  transport vehicles to be able to distribute food boxes and care packages to
  communities.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  WHFB is able to track and document the amount of food and household
  necessities. In addition tracking is done for the distribution to the
  households and agencies we assist. We currently distribute an average of 25
  million pounds of food through our facility and our 200+ partner agencies,
  including food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters and after school programs for
  children. This is a small number compared to the availability of food that is
  currently able to be provided and the number of people in need.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '25'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '2500'
