title: Pop-Up Social Innovation Labs
project_summary: >-
  The Why Lab Innovation School presents a series of three pop up social
  innovation labs throughout LA (virtual until further notice). These
  educational events bring together the community in new ways, to learn
  future-forward innovation skills while solving some of the biggest challenges
  within our city. They will explore redesigning systems, innovating new
  services, and fixing existing ones - with a goal toward equity, justice, and
  accessibility.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South LA
  - Westside
  - South Bay
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Our society is at a tipping point of broken systems and services that have led
  us to inequity, injustice, and unsustainable futures. In order to address the
  urgent need to redesign these, we need new types of skills, new modes of
  thinking, and new ways of working together as a community. According to the
  World Economic forum, 50% of all employees will need reskilling by 2025:
  including creative problem solving, critical thinking, and empathy, among many
  others. But we don’t have many spaces to learn and practice all this. In order
  to work towards meaningful change, we need new educational formats that
  address the redesign of systems around us, in a way that centers the lived
  experiences and needs of our communities. We need facilitated experiences that
  bring together citizens of all backgrounds, skills, and abilities in a safe
  space to understand the intricacies of our broken systems, and then learn how
  to innovate new and existing services with an equity-based value set.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  This is an educational program that is delivered in the form of a three-day
  pop up social innovation lab, bringing together LA residents and professionals
  to solve complex challenges within our city. These innovation labs will teach
  the methods of service design thinking and systems redesign while exploring
  real-time challenges. Participants will learn and practice important skills
  required for the future of work, such as creative problem solving, critical
  thinking, and empathy. Each pop up social innovation lab will result in
  fully-formed prototypes for new services as well as improvements for existing
  services and systems. These can then continue on to be tested within
  organizations, setting measurable goals for each idea. The outcomes are part
  entrepreneurship development, part systems redesign, part workforce
  development. The curriculum is designed for accessibility and equity. A
  special emphasis will be placed on inviting under-represented populations of
  BIPOC, immigrants, LGBTQ+, and people with neurodiversity and disabilities.
  Each event will bring together local and global experts in the facilitation of
  complex problem solving, sharing expertise and examples from other cities
  around the world which are utilizing these methods. The program supports
  hosting three cycles of this lab in the next 12 months, focusing on three
  different industries or challenge areas, to be selected in partnership with LA
  2050 and the City of LA.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  This program will be built upon the learnings of a similar annual innovation
  event called the Los Angeles Service Jam, produced by the same team. In the
  Los Angeles Service Jam, community members come together to reimagine new
  services in a variety of topics, ending with dozens of service prototypes
  created and tested at each event. Our current impact is measured by the number
  of participants and number of new services that are created during the event.
  We’ve had 10 years of this event, with an average of 60 participants per year,
  and an average of 12 projects produced each year. This curriculum has been
  tested in various cities around the world, measuring for educational outcomes,
  mindset changes, new skill adoptions. We will measure with qualitative
  interviews of understanding baseline mindsets toward innovation, before and
  after the event. We will also set individual industry-wide goals for each of
  the three events.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '390'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '3900'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  As famed work activist Grace Lee Boggs once said, “HOW we change the world and
  how we THINK about changing the world has to change.” This program will create
  a regenerative impact for the city, by up-skilling our workforce to approach
  their work through lenses of equity, creative problem-solving, and
  future-facing innovations. We will see an immediate impact with the creation
  of new ideas during these pop up events. And we will see ripple effects as
  these new ways of thinking are then taken into participants’ workplaces. LA
  has an opportunity to be a cultural and economic influencer by prioritizing
  the development of the skills of the future and actively creating
  conversations around redesigning for systems and services.
