title: Mental Health Resources for Culturally Diverse Communities
project_summary: >-
  The lack of multiple language support for mental health and wellness is
  overwhelming evident in LA’s growing culturally diverse and multi-generational
  communities. NAMI SGV’s members are culturally diverse relatives, friends,
  caregivers, of / and persons living with chronic brain disorder who benefit
  from these resources. We volunteer & help in ending the stigma by offering
  far-reaching advocacy, support, & educational programs for all in LA. A
  501(c)(3) affiliate of NAMI National, @NAMISGV, You Are Not Alone

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - San Gabriel Valley
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  In 2018, LA Public Health presented the stats on depression (not including
  bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, OCD, anxiety, and other chronic mental
  illnesses): - 1,200,000 persons are living with depression in LA - 50% of
  those are from culturally diverse communities and may need help in language
  support - SGV has180,000 persons alone and 3rd highest in LA LA is struggling
  to provide adequate mental health care, especially within our culturally
  diverse communities. IT MAKES a difference CULTURALLY in understanding the
  narratives of mental health conditions, describes symptoms, communicates,
  receives and responds to treatments.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  By following the example of LA County’s governmental departments (DMV & Dept.
  of Public Services) that offers 10 threshold languages +, We will bridge the
  gap in offering free resources who seek mental health care in multiple
  language options. The funding will pay for translation services and a budget
  for meeting virtually or in-person, once available. NAMI SGV’s trained and
  culturally diverse facilitators (volunteers) will lead: 1/ Basics 2/ Family to
  Family 3/ Peer to Peer Outreach program such as In Your Own Voice and new
  programs, + Presently, there is not enough organizations that continuously
  offer free of charge multiple language mental health programs led by trained
  and culturally diverse facilitators.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  According to the census.gov of 2019, LA county has: 1/ 10 million + peoples
  with 5 million identify as people of color 2/ 56.6% of population speak a 2nd
  language other than English There is a lack of services available free of
  charge that can help both support peoples and the governmental department such
  as LA Public Health and LA Dept of Mental Health. We can track and improve on
  what the LA Public Health's data has as of 2018 on Depression for example.
  This is both an existing effort and a new initiative. Our new initiatives are
  revisions of existing programs already presented in Spanish and Chinese as
  well as new language translations.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '50'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '100000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Offering culturally diverse communities will help bring everyone together in
  the multi-generational families where the younger generations may need English
  language while the parents and grand parents prefer their preferred languages.
  A person just doesn’t have mental illness, a family does, a community does.
  When an entire household can learn, grown, and live better together, it will
  make an impact in the family’s lives. No matter which language barriers, our
  programs are to serve everyone in the family and community.
