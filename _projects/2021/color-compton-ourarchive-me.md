In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - South LA
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Color Compton was established in the city of Compton, California due to the
  rich history of the community. Compton is known worldwide, however many don’t
  know the complex history, including the residents of the city. We currently
  have no course or space that teaches youth about the history of their
  community. This is not unique in marginalized communities of color. Often,
  BIPOC histories and stories are not dissected in public school and youth are
  not taught much of their racial and/or ethnic history in a nuanced way. Color
  Compton aims to address this directly by being a physical creative space for
  youth and community members to learn the histories of BIPOC communities and
  Compton. Our office also holds original art pieces by Compton artists that
  highlight this vibrant history. “OurArchive.Me” project will encourage youth
  to explore more of their own histories and take ownership of their stories.
  Youth will also actively participate in creating and documenting current
  experiences.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  To specifically address the lack of diversity in narratives presented to youth
  in color in communities like Compton, we want to develop our “OurArchive.Me”
  project. This project is an extension of our Fall “Local Story” series that
  focuses on photography and video. In “OurArchive.Me” we aim to expand this and
  be more intentional about the creating and preserving aspect of visual art.
  This project will work in a series of residencies of groups of up to 10-15
  youth members at a time. Each individual will receive a stipend for their
  participation and will work collaboratively to develop a communal archive
  catalogue. Youth will engage in educational research on archival work and
  histories of BIPOC communities and will actively engage with their community.
  They will begin with their own familial archival excavation and look through
  family photo albums and videos to begin an individual catalogue. Then they
  will present to each other and digitize any photos from community members to
  build on a community archive. Finally, youth will be behind the camera and
  document their own lived experiences and surroundings to capture their living
  archive.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  This project is the extension of our existing “Local Story” programming
  series. We currently measure our impact by the number of applications we
  receive for the program, the retention rate of youth in the program, youth
  participation and engagement during the series, the final visual projects
  created, and the feedback survey completed by youth after the program. To
  date, we have had positive feedback and critical reflective feedback on the
  impact of self-identity and level of confidence in creative fields. Moving
  forward, we hope to continue these measures of impact and expand on our
  surveys to include more areas and room for growth. In addition we hope to
  develop a mentorship component to the project and ensure that students are not
  only developing leadership skills but are able to develop networks.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '250'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '10000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  We hope to have a large impact on youth surrounding the South LA community and
  develop excitement surrounding BIPOC stories, historys, narratives and art.
  Historically, many of the stories associated with communities of color in
  South LA are submerged with violence. We hope to have an impact in changing
  this and provide a more positive, creative and diverse narrative around South
  LA communities and families. Beyond the youth, we believe that our project
  will engage folks from various generations and backgrounds and also encourage
  people to begin documenting their own experiences and preserving stories. We
  envision the youth in this area leading an international movement on creative
  forms of documenting stories and histories.
