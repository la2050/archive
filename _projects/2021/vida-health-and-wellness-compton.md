  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  The WHO identified childhood obesity as one of the most serious health
  challenges of the 21st Century. In the US,1 in 5 school-aged youth are obese.
  Obesity affects the immediate health, educational level and quality of life in
  children. It also causes neurological, cardiovascular and musculoskeletal
  complications, as well as psychosocial implications. LACDPH reports that 23%
  of children are obese. However, the city of Compton has one of the highest
  rates of childhood obesity (29%) and the highest rate of adult obesity (40%)
  in the county. Obesity disproportionately affects racial and ethnic minorities
  from low-income communities, especially African-Americans and Latinos. In
  addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated obesity promoting behaviors,
  such as less physical activity, unhealthier foods, longer screen times and
  irregular sleep patterns. That is why the Gasol Foundation focuses its energy
  on promoting healthy lifestyles within low-income communities involving
  children.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  VIDA! Health and Wellness is a community-based program with the main goal to
  reduce childhood obesity among the most vulnerable populations in Los Angeles.
  VIDA! is for children ages 6-12 and their families living in low-income
  communities. Following our motto, "Make it Healthy, Make it Fun", we introduce
  the families to a metaphor of a Healthy Galaxy. Throughout the program the
  families explore the four planets of: healthy eating, sports and physical
  activity, sleep, and emotional well-being. Families that participate gain the
  knowledge and skills necessary to make healthy choices in their everyday life.
  The program consists of 2 sessions a month for 8 months throughout the school
  year at a date and time when the entire family can participate, such as
  evenings or weekends. Each session is two hours and includes an educational
  portion, as well as physical activities. In addition, there will be
  supplemental sessions offered by partnering organizations. All of the program
  content and materials is available in English and Spanish. The VIDA! program
  is highly valued by the Gasol Foundation and as a result of the COVID-19
  pandemic the program was adapted to a virtual model. The virtual programming
  has been implemented via Zoom since September 2020 and will conclude in April
  2021. The virtual adaptation of VIDA! has been a success at maintaining and
  engaging participants. The Gasol Foundation staff have experience and ability
  to implement this program virtually if needed.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  VIDA! Health and Wellness launched in 2014 through a collaboration with the
  Partnership for Los Angeles Schools, a nonprofit that works in partnership
  with LAUSD. The project has been implemented in Watts, South LA and Boyle
  Heights. Now we are seeking to expand the program to Compton. We carry out an
  assessment protocol to monitor the effects of the intervention and successes.
  We utilize pre and post assessments to assist in tracking outcomes. We collect
  BMI measurements for both children and adults. The four healthy habits
  promoted by the project are assessed through scientifically validated
  questionnaires. Results show adults increased physical activity levels and
  sleep hours and 49% improved their weight status. Nearly all children (92%)
  either maintained or improved their weight status and the overall percentage
  of children with obesity and abdominal obesity was lowered. Also, 54.5% of
  children improved their diet quality and 35% showed improvement in emotional
  well-being.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '150'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '500'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  As the result of the COVID-19 pandemic, children and families overall health
  and well-being are more at-risk than ever, particularly in the most
  underserved areas where families have been disproportionately impacted. Gasol
  Foundation seeks to empower families to be leaders in health and wellness
  through VIDA! We arm families with the knowledge, tools and opportunity to
  practice healthy lifestyles and encourage communities to come together to live
  healthier. Through the key involvement of family and educators, our programs
  promote children's knowledge, attitudes and habits for their full development.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  Gasol Foundation already has a presence in Compton and has worked with other
  trusted partners within the community including: Alma Backyard Farms, Yetunde
  Price Resource Center and the Compton Community Development Corporation. We
  envision a continued partnership with local community organizations that can
  supplement our workshops with expertise that is aligned with our messaging.
  For example, Alma Backyard Farms specializes in growing and distributing
  organic fresh produce and the YPRC specializes in trauma informed programming
  that promotes healing and resiliency. These types of collaborations enrich the
  participants' experience, knowledge, and skills in holistic healthy living.
