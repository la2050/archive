What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Food on Foot works to create the systemic change in the Los Angeles region by
  helping people transition from life on the streets to steady employment and
  permanent housing. Homelessness is considered to be the most significant
  problem facing the region. Food on Foot is addressing underlying issues such
  as a lack of confidence/lack of trust, dependency challenges, stigma that
  affects people experiencing homelessness in extremely competitive housing and
  employment markets. Since 1998, Food on Foot has supported clients through the
  difficult process of permanently leaving behind the streets to focus on
  cultivating skills and attributes necessary for long-term success in permanent
  housing and long-term employment. According to Los Angeles Homeless Services
  Authority, in 2020 the City of LA experienced a 16% increase in people
  experiencing homelessness while the County of Los Angeles experienced a 13%
  increase during the same time (compared with 2019).
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Food on Foot is helping individuals heal from the demoralizing and
  traumatizing experiences of living in streets and shelters. The program
  targets individuals experiencing homelessness in the Los Angeles who are
  physically and mentally able to return to the workforce and enthusiastic to
  find permanent housing. Program participants work with licensed clinicians and
  other trained and experienced program professionals to achieve a progression
  of steps that starts with employment training opportunities, the receipt of
  food gift cards, and access to counseling. After demonstrating a strong work
  ethic and determination to succeed, participants begin preparing for full-time
  job opportunities and to secure permanent housing (market-rate studio
  apartments). Once gainfully employed, Food on Foot enables participants to
  move into their own apartment and subsidizes their rent and all basic expenses
  for up to twelve months while allowing participants to save their own funds.
  During this initial period, participants receive intensive support, case
  management, and financial subsidies to help them get back on their feet. After
  the first year in the program, participants have not only successfully shifted
  their own personal and professional trajectory, but have also begun mentoring
  other program participants that are just beginning to embark on their own
  journey off the streets.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Since 1997, Food on Foot has demonstrated an over 85% success rate for
  transitioning formerly homeless individuals back into the stability of
  permanent housing and long-term employment. We track job and housing retention
  for the 12-month period following program graduation. After one year,
  graduated are generally able to maintain market rate rentals without the
  costly public-funded supportive services that higher-acuity homeless require.
  Food on Foot’s metrics serve as a robust indicator of a successful re-entry
  program into mainstream society for individuals who had previously been unable
  to access necessary services. FoF's success rate is virtually unparalleled
  among systems intended to help the homeless regain their independence, in part
  because of the personalized services that our staff and volunteers provide to
  clients. FoF goes beyond case management and housing/employment placement to
  ensure that each individual has the unique resources that he/she needs for
  success.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '100'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '10000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Homelessness is one of the most pressing social issue in the Los Angeles
  region. By addressing the root of homelessness we lift up our neighbors and
  the community as a whole. In the past ten years alone, Food on Foot has served
  nearly 100,000 hot meals, including 11,500 meals in 2020 alone. The agency has
  added millions of dollars to the economy via productivity (wages earned) in
  that time period and saves taxpayers approximately $9.5 million a year, based
  on a recent report that calculated that emergency room visits,
  arrests/incarceration, and other publicly funded services cost $38,146 per
  year per homeless individual. Food on Foot sees that once a person is
  motivated to improve their life and receives the right support and resources,
  they will most likely maintain their housing and employment. As a trusted name
  in Los Angeles, Food on Foot continues to pioneer innovative solutions to help
  people help themselves back into permanent housing and long-term employment.
