title: 'Community Exchange: building our food safety net with empathy and precision'
project_summary: >-
  The Community Exchange Program is developing a concierge model designed to
  provide small- to medium-sized nonprofits throughout LA County with the
  healthy, fresh food their communities need, when they need it, so they can
  focus on their missions. Our vision is a city where everyone has food,
  community, and support.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Food insecurity in LA has spiked dramatically since 2020, extending to both
  housed and unhoused neighbors. Before the pandemic, 2 million people in LA
  County were living with food insecurity (about 1 in 5). Now, LA has the
  largest food-insecure population in the nation with 2.5 million people (about
  1 in 4). According to the LA Food Policy Council, food insecurity is often
  clustered in low-income neighborhoods and communities of color, which
  generally have 2-3 times fewer options when it comes to healthy, high-quality
  food. Nonprofits serving these populations have very specific needs, which are
  not sufficiently met through the existing food sharing systems. Attempts to
  solve this problem are made through technology and one-size-fits-all
  approaches, yet many communities remain disconnected from resources. Simply
  put, existing models don’t accommodate the diversity of nonprofit communities
  and their food needs, resulting in inequitable access to high quality food
  donations.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  The Community Exchange is developing an empathetic, culturally-sensitive, and
  customizable model that treats nonprofits like high-value customers, catering
  to the diversity of their needs, constraints, and schedules. Through our
  nonprofit partners, we deliver the right food to the people who need it most.
  Food is personal, and we want all Angelenos to feel the joy that comes from a
  great meal. As a kitchen ourselves, we understand the complicated nature of
  receiving food donations and preparing high-quality meals that meet an
  individual’s personal needs. Our careful nonprofit intake and feedback
  process, paired with our innovative food rescue inventory system, allows us to
  redirect resources more precisely to underrepresented communities. We
  emphasize quality over quantity, centralizing great food donations and
  efficiently dispersing them around the city, so donors can give to one place
  and nonprofits can better choose what they receive and when they get it. Most
  importantly, we layer on strong, active relationship building. We take a
  bottom-up approach and work with each organization to develop a deep
  understanding of their programs’ needs, preferences, populations served, and
  constraints. We have ongoing conversations, often weekly, to improve our
  offerings and ensure our service is responsive to changing needs in their
  community. With personalized knowledge of our over 80 nonprofit partners, we
  can match them with food that fits their community outreach and programs.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  In the last year, we rescued 1.1 million pounds of food from over 150
  businesses and food recovery groups, equating to about 700,000 meals. We moved
  to a temporary site in May and by December, our monthly food rescue grew by
  1,471% to 264,000 pounds. This was accomplished with very limited storage and
  refrigeration capacity, which we are increasing by moving to a better-equipped
  facility in April 2021. While we’re proud of our numbers, the formal and
  informal feedback collected from nonprofit partners - forms, in-person
  conversations, and phone calls - signal our model is on the right track. We’ve
  learned that we’re providing a level of service and choice not available
  elsewhere, and communities are gaining access to healthy, culturally-sensitive
  food like never before. Our ability to adapt to both temporary and permanent
  changes is key to meeting the on-the-ground realities of their operations, and
  we’re continuing to refine our program based on this essential feedback.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '100000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '2500000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  The Community Exchange has the potential to dramatically reduce food
  insecurity throughout LA, leading the way for a more efficient and equitable
  system. Just this year, we can rescue and organize over two million pounds of
  food and partner with fellow nonprofits to share 1.6 million meals with
  disadvantaged communities. Whether it's immune-boosting citrus, veggie bacon
  bits, or sustainably-raised striped bass, we will connect with more large food
  distributors and wholesalers to develop regular donations of healthy food and
  increase the quality, variety, and cultural-relevance of food donated to
  nonprofits. Long term, the model we are developing can be replicated and
  customized for any community. We will help partner nonprofits develop programs
  in their community, ensuring that all food-insecure Angelenos have consistent,
  local access to meals, regardless of neighborhood, income level or emergency
  conditions. Ultimately, this will result in healthier, more resilient
  communities.
