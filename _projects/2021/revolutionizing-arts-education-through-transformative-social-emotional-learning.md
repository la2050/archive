  Revolutionizing Arts Education through Transformative Social Emotional
  Learning
project_summary: >-
  With My LA 2050 support, Exploring the Arts (ETA) will infuse Transformative
  Social and Emotional Learning (TSEL) into its arts education programs to help
  empower teachers and students to effect change through collaboration. Using
  methods initially developed in response to COVID-19 remote environment, ETA
  will integrate our Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) for arts educators
  and Professional Development (PD) offerings for arts teachers and student
  mentors into our core programs.

'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  2020 was a year filled with unprecedented pain, anguish and challenges for
  public school communities. Dysfunctional and inadequate systems, built upon a
  legacy of racism and classism, unable to cope with the demands of virtual
  learning, only amplified the inequity in arts education that our educators,
  students and families have struggled with for many years. Compounded by the
  personal challenges facing our community due to COVID-19, stress, trauma, and
  depression have surged in the last year (1/2 of Americans report harmed mental
  health according to a Kaiser Family Foundation Poll). The arts, and the social
  emotional skills they provide, are essential to address this ongoing trauma.
  Yet, only 40% of LA County students are enrolled in an arts course. The
  pandemic has illustrated how necessary arts education, in combination with
  trauma-informed practices and Transformative Social Emotional Learning (TSEL)
  in school communities are to engaging and supporting students.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  In 2021-22, ETA will extend components of its existing programming to address
  the systemic problems intensified by the Pandemic. ETA is unique in its
  program design which is flexibly customized to each school, their community,
  and their particular goals. With the support of LA 2050, ETA will build
  community amongst art teachers through paid Professional Learning Communities
  (PLCs) where they support one another through iterative problem-solving
  dialogue related to distance or in person arts learning. Professional
  Development sessions, developed in collaboration with community arts partners,
  will increase the capacity of teachers to center black and brown students’
  identity, skills, culture and community, and nurture creative and critical
  thinkers by incorporating Anti-Racist and TSEL practices in their arts
  discipline. The Arts Internship Program (AIP) places high schoolers as paid
  interns in mentorship with professionals working in the arts to support
  connectedness, preparedness, and authentic participation. The 2050 grant would
  support expanding Learning Labs and Mentor Training where participants build
  TSEL competencies in self awareness, self-advocacy, and social awareness. This
  new programming will be created in collaboration with ETA’s community arts
  partners.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  “As a school leader, I am looking for ways to incorporate this schoolwide. In
  this capacity, I think it is about creating opportunities to acknowledge all
  the members of our community and helping them to find ways to celebrate who
  they are.” This school principal’s “exit ticket” following a “Building an
  Anti-Racist Arts Classroom” PD, led by LA Director Rubi Fregoso, speaks
  directly to how ETA is collaborationg with our schools to address inequity.
  Furthermore, it points to our collective vision of what we can achieve with
  the support of LA2050. Assessments and measurable impact indicators are
  fundamental to the ongoing evaluation of each of ETA’s programs. PLC Pre-and
  post-surveys, AIP self-reported surveys and exit tickets address the outcomes
  pegged to our program benchmarks, including self-awareness, social awareness,
  and connectedness. For example, following virtual summer programming in AIP,
  95% of students said they felt a stronger connection with each other and their
  mentors.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '58'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1750'
