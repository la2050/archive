In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': Research (initial work to identify and understand the problem)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Youth in the inner cities of Los Angeles are inadequately prepared to succeed
  as working professionals as they transition into young adulthood. These
  individuals struggle through a gauntlet of an unequal distribution of
  resources: education, career/personal guidance, assets, and capital. They are
  highly motivated to pursue their dream careers. However, they lack the support
  needed to identify their core strengths, corresponding career paths, and how
  to become trained accordingly. They are in a daily battle against
  discrimination and systemic prejudices that inhibit them from breaking into
  the industries of their desire. They have experienced environmental trauma
  living in cities with high crime rates and violence. These cycles are
  recurring in our communities, resulting in few positive role models for our
  youth to be led by. Each generation is left to start from ground zero, toiling
  to figure out the ropes on their own.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Wrkz, Inc is a mentorship program that serves young adults ages 17 to 30 years
  old in the inner cities of Los Angeles. Our growing community of mentors,
  working professionals, and business entities have committed to bridging the
  gap of opportunity for our participants. We nurture genuine relationships by
  being intentional with how we engage with these individuals. Staff, mentors,
  and mentees sync up once a month to get to know each other. This creates a
  safe space for us to listen and sift through the interest, skills, and
  experience of our participants. In conjunction, they also work together to
  create objectives designed to step each mentee through the process of bringing
  their ideas and careers to life. In our work, we have noticed the need to help
  participants process their traumatic experiences of living in the trenches of
  LA. We host activities like focus groups for staff and participants to
  dialogue using guided questions. We aid in unpacking the challenges of life
  and pursuing a career. Our focus groups cultivate a space for everyone to feel
  safe and vulnerable in sharing their experiences. Within our community,
  participants find accountability and healing through each other and the
  support from our trained staff. Providing mental health support for our
  participants is pivotal to our mission as we strive to remove mental barriers
  that stop momentum towards their career goals. Sessions are currently virtual
  per covid-19.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  We will be successful if mentors and mentees engage in collaboration, if
  projects are completed and if clients are satisfied with their deliverables.
  As we seek to build genuine mentorships between mentors and mentees, we’re
  successful if each pair attends at least 60% of their scheduled one on ones.
  Each project yields opportunities for mentees to gain knowledge and skills by
  working hands-on. They will explore and solve practical challenges within the
  art and photography space. We are successful if our participants complete at
  least 50% of their selected projects. Furthermore, our aim is to produce
  high-quality artifacts that add value to our client’s business. We are
  successful if participating small businesses find at least one produced
  artifact a valuable asset for the company a long with feedback for the improve
  of the program.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '12'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '24'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Within our ecosystem of support and resources, our aim is to eliminate the
  toil in searching for opportunities and allow our participants to lock in on
  the work. Thus far our focus has been on mentoring and supporting the journey
  of individuals within the world of art and photography. Our minimum viable
  service is to create a digital art studio that will advance the skills of our
  participants while enhancing the digital presence of small businesses in the
  community. A cohort of three participants who are actively pursuing a career
  in photography or digital art will journey through our one-year, project-based
  scholarship program. Our highly motivated mentees will be matched with an
  experienced mentor who will offer creative direction and guidance for skills
  development. Their goal is to produce high-quality deliverables for their
  clients. Selected businesses are looking to present their product or service
  more professionally to increase their competitive edge within the economy.
