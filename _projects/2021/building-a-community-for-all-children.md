title: Building a Community for ALL Children
project_summary: >-
  Friendship Foundation offers online and in-person programs for children with
  special needs in 40 schools throughout South Bay. Children with special needs
  build friendships with their student volunteers as they socialize, play games,
  and attend events as a group—a first-time experience for many children with
  special needs.

What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Children with special needs are 2-3 times more likely to experience bullying
  compared to their non-disabled peers. For the 175,000 children currently
  enrolled in special education in Los Angeles County, there are limited
  opportunities to experience friendships, socialization and participation in
  routines and activities. Their resources are often limited to doctors and
  therapists. Since 2005, Friendship Foundation has worked tirelessly to
  demonstrate that inclusive environments are mutually beneficial to students of
  special needs and volunteers who work alongside with them. Friendship
  Foundation addresses a critical gap in services for children with special
  needs and makes it possible for children with special needs to interact with
  people of all generations to experience social-recreational activities in a
  supportive, anti-bullying environment.

  Friendship Foundation programs will make it possible for 500 children with
  special needs to participate in virtual and in-person activities in a safe,
  inclusive environment with student volunteers. Friendship Foundation will

  Virtual School Clubs reaching approximately 340 students. When it is safe to
  provide in-person activities, Friendship Foundation will re-open 40 Friendship
  Clubs impacting students with special needs in 10 school districts. - Zoom
  Pals – A one-to-one buddy program where children and young adults with special
  needs connect to build a friendship. - Friday Adventures – A program takes our
  children through a virtual tour of national forests, zoos, and aquariums. -
  Chatter Box – A social skills class with each class having a particular goal,
  whether it is to teach how to greet a new person to how to continue a
  conversation. - Fitness Classes – 7 virtual fitness classes per week. -
  Drive-In Movie Nights – A drive-in-theater in our parking lot to bring an
  inclusive activity that brings all families together. - Sports Night – Hosted
  via Zoom, the students are invited to watch professional basketball, football,
  and baseball games. - Other programs include Zoom Movie Nights, arts programs,
