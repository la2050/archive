What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  It is well recognized and supported in the literature that social isolation
  poses a significant health risk to older adults. Even before the COVID–19, an
  estimated 43 percent of community-dwelling seniors suffered from social
  isolation and social isolation is closely associated with a number of health
  risks, including increased risk of mortality, dementia, risk for
  hospitalization and an increased number of falls Research has also found a
  strong link between ageism, in the form of negative stereotypes, prejudice,
  and discrimination toward older people, and risks to their physical and mental
  health. Intergenerational programs, like Cyber-Seniors, have demonstrated an
  ability reduce social isolation and combat ageism by reducing age-segregation
  and creating opportunities for both older adults and young people to find
  purpose and meaning in spending time together.

'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  CS collects data on an ongoing basis. The CS web-portal automatically
  administers surveys to participants in the program. Seniors are administered
  surveys that measure changes in use of technology & connections to the
  community. Young volunteers are administered surveys that measure changes in
  attitudes toward aging/stereotype reduction & improvement in skills such as
  goal setting, time management, leadership, problem-solving & professional
  skill-building. The benefit & impact of the CS program has been supported by
  independent research carried out in 2016/17, and published in Gerontology &
  Geriatric Education in Jan 2018 & in the The Journal of Gerontological Social
  Work in March 2018. Researchers reported an improvement in seniors’ ability &
  interest in technology & significant reductions in feelings of social
  isolation; & found that youth gained skills in goal setting, time management,
  leadership, responsibility, & improved attitudes towards the elderly.
