title: The Beautify LA Community Grant Program
project_summary: >-
  The Beautify LA Community Grant Program is an annual competitive matching
  grant open to the residents of Los Angeles to fund exceptional neighborhood
  projects. It encourages, supports, and provides opportunities to communities
  of high need and the general public in the ownership and beautification of
  public spaces. The grant will provide a stronger foundation and diverse
  partnerships that will revitalize the community and educate future generations
  to continue stewardship of public spaces through volunteerism.

project_video: ''
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  With a growing population, increase in service demand, and the financial
  crisis from the Pandemic, LA does not have the financial capability nor the
  labor force for the services desired by its residents. We are aware that
  neighborhoods without equal access or knowledge of funding sources suffer a
  greater risk of blight. Urban blight creates a perceived acceptance of litter
  and graffiti. This in turn creates a sense of reduced public safety in
  impoverished areas. With a noted disparity in access to funding and scarce
  City resources to service over 99 neighborhoods, the community has expressed a
  sense of slow government responsiveness. In addition, city policy and
  procedures can be confusing to navigate. Community projects established
  without the basic requirements and permits lack the justification for
  longevity or sustainability in the public right of way and can be
  unintentionally destroyed or removed. This further creates a sense of
  disassociation of a responsive local government.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  LA2050 will help us amplify the grant program and expand the limited number of
  awards. OCB/KLAB will execute a request for proposals throughout the City in
  English/Spanish from community groups, nonprofits, school groups, etc. Groups
  will submit project proposals of desired areas they would like to improve.
  Murals, art projects, medians and other creative projects in public spaces
  will take priority. Grant funds serve as seed money for community projects.
  The program will foster collaboration and create support networks, encourage
  creativity and innovation, instill community pride among residents, and
  empower them to take ownership of their communities. Grantees will work with
  city staff navigating partnerships and any city permit process that the
  project will require. An increase in community beautification projects creates
  a decrease in urban blight and crime related activity. To ensure equity,
  proposals will be screened and receive bonus points using CalEnviroscreen’s
  data on Disadvantaged communities (SB535 & AB 1550). A minimum of 33% of the
  proposals will be from communities of high need. This includes areas with high
  concentrations of people with low-income, high unemployment, low levels of
  home ownership, high rent burden, low levels of educational attainment, and
  high environmental pollution impact. The projects improve a neighborhood’s
  public safety and health through beautification while creating a positive
  economic impact and advocating for environmental justice.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Despite the elimination of previously funded grant programs, years later
  stakeholders have continued to demonstrate a desire for creative
  community-based project opportunities. An average of 110 grants were awarded
  yearly, with a dollar value from $2,500 -$10,000. An organization’s
  contribution match is usually more than the award. Examples • The Big Blue M:
  Awarded $10,000.Match= $21,575 • Veteran Memorial Park: Awarded $10,000.Match=
  $26,629 • Moorpark Way Median: Awarded $10,000.Match= $55,063 The value beyond
  funding is in the variety of community partnerships and the
  social/environmental impact. A knowledgeable community knows how to request
  services and advocate for their needs. We have seen an increase in
  communication and service needs, documented through the MyLA311 system.
  Knowledge of resources increases volunteerism. This increase in participation
  is documented in the number of annual volunteer hours entered while
  beautifying communities through clean up events/projects.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '500000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '2000000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  LA County will enjoy an increase of beautiful open spaces and cleaner
  neighborhoods. Residents will see an increase in community and local
  government engagement through volunteerism, improved and maintained public
  spaces and increased knowledge of city resources by its residents. The
  projected impact of the Grant through a variety of clean, green, and
  sustainable projects will improve public safety and help prevent blight that
  will then reduce litter throughout LA. The grant methodology supports the
  Sustainable City plan and the Green New Deal. To receive funding means to
  follow best practices in empowering those who live, work, and play in the City
  with an equal opportunity to participate in bettering their neighborhoods. LA
  City can serve as an example of community partnerships beyond city services. A
  long term goal and byproduct of the grant program would be to develop a guide
  of helpful resources for project implementation (recognized organizations,
  sources of donations, etc).
