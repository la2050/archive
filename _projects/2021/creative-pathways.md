title: Creative Pathways
project_summary: >-
  Grants funds will support the integration of our existing Creative Pathways
  (CP) college and career readiness activities with our new Film & Digital Media
  Pilot (F&DM) program. In this program, low-income youth of color, current and
  former foster youth, justice-involved and/or LGBTQ youth receive training in
  the creative industry skills needed for internships and first jobs. We hope
  that by helping young people overcome systemic barriers to entry, they will be
  empowered to find career success diversifying the voices in LA’s creative
  workforce.

project_video: ''
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - Westside
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Los Angeles’ economically disadvantaged youth lack equitable access to the
  educational experiences, resources, and support often afforded their more
  advantaged peers. Those that hope to work in creative industries are regularly
  faced with a myriad of barriers that impede success. For youth of color,
  current and former foster youth, justice-involved and/or LGBTQ youth, the
  challenges can be overwhelming. The creative industry field represents the 2nd
  largest labor sector in LA, yet minority representation within the field
  remains stubbornly and disproportionately low. This disparity distorts
  representation, silences voices, and leaves far too many talented young people
  on the outside, looking in. Exacerbating the current situation are the
  negative impacts of pandemic-related lockdowns and social distancing on
  youth’s mental health. As we look to a post-pandemic future it is clear that
  support for young people’s emotional needs is critical to their well-being.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Our Creative Pathways program readies low-income young people for college and
  career achievement by inspiring in each a belief in their own potential, and
  by providing the high caliber learning environments, information, support, and
  resources necessary for success. Aligned with our vision for a more equitable
  and inclusive society, our participants learn the hard and soft skills needed
  to enter the workforce, secure internship placements, and navigate the college
  application, financial aid, and scholarship process. LA 2050 funding would be
  instrumental in helping integrate our existing CP program activities including
  college days, career panels, 1:1 mentoring with our new F&DM pilot. F&DM’s
  training in digital video creation and filmmaking is designed to lead to paid
  internships but doesn't address college. Youth participants in Venice Arts
  other programs would benefit significantly with expanded case management
  services. Venice Arts safely resumed on-site programs in July 2020. We know
  that processing pandemic risks and restrictions, isolation, grief, racial
  injustice, economic uncertainty, and food insecurity, is emotionally
  challenging for all, especially young people. Having witnessed this struggle
  and experienced first-hand the devastating consequences when hope is lost, we
  held a special training session for all staff led by a pediatric psychologist.
  Venice Arts’ commitment to serving our youth and helping to ease their social
  isolation has never been stronger.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Venice Arts has a long history of measuring outcomes and using data to inform
  and improve our programs. The data used to define our Creative Pathways’
  outcomes are: activity participation; college application, acceptance, and
  graduation rates; internship application and placement rates; awards submitted
  and awards received. Program impact is evidenced in our successful track
  record of connecting underserved youths to creative career pathways. We have
  exposed countless youth to what it means to work in media arts and creative
  sectors; have organized hundreds of presentations, career-panels, and
  career-directed field trips; and have placed nearly 150 low-income and
  underserved young people, in paid internships. Past placements include
  NBC-Universal, Dreamworks, Univision, Sundance Institute, Motive, Brave New
  Films, KCRW, among many others. Our young media makers have also won hundreds
  of national, state, and local awards including recognition as a Presidential
  Scholar in the Arts.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '300'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1500'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Venice Arts’ first workshop in 1993, Venice Through Our Eyes, taught young
  people how to use the camera to find their voice: exploring, describing, and
  sharing their world through visual storytelling. Most had rarely seen their
  lives represented in the media and, when they did, often saw one-dimensional
  stories of poverty, violence, and despair. Our programs—conceived in a
  pre-digital era when teaching a young person how to use a camera to tell the
  stories of their lives was a unique and radical act—taught participants about
  the power of visual self-representation. As our pedagogy emphasizes the “whole
  child,” integrating creative/artistic, academic, and personal development, we
  have taken the work a step further with goals to help low-income young people
  succeed both in college and in the creative workspace. We hope for a Los
  Angeles creative industry that values the voices and contributions of all,
  including those marginalized by class, race, and immigration status.
