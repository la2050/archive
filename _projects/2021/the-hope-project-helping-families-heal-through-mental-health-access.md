In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  South Central LAMP serves immigrant families facing language and cultural
  barriers, food insecurity, unreasonable rent increases pacing them at risk of
  homelessness, and limited access to physical and mental health care. These
  stressors place the mothers we serve at higher risk for mental health issues
  such as PTSD, depression and anxiety. The pandemic has placed additional
  challenges on our families. Many of our families are undocumented and cannot
  access government relief; many work in environments where they are at risk of
  infection; others have suffered job loss and are struggling to pay rent; and
  others have tragically lost the family’s head of household or sole income
  earner due to Covid19. As a result, more families are struggling with grief,
  anxiety, depression, and feelings of isolation. Sadly, cultural stigmas and
  years of living in fear of deportation often stop our families from seeking
  mental health services. So, we are seeking to address these challenges in our
  community.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Since 1993, South Central LAMP has engaged an underserved and hard-to-reach
  community through a Family Literacy Program that engages immigrant mothers and
  their children ages 0-5 in an integrated 3-year curriculum that includes
  Parenting Education and Family Advocacy, English as a Second Language, Early
  Childhood Education that incorporates STEM education, and Parent-Child
  Interactive Literacy Activities. We also provide a weekly food distribution,
  free educational workshops, and developmental screenings for children in
  partnership with the LA Regional Center. Since the onset of the pandemic,
  South Central LAMP has continued to provide Early Childhood Education and ESL
  lessons through Class Dojo, allowed more parents to connect during zoom
  classes by providing them with iPads with modems, and remained in contact with
  our families to provide mental health support. We also continued to work with
  Partners for Children South LA to ensure effective and efficient linkage to
  local services for families with children ages 0-5, and offered food and basic
  needs essentials to the community at large each week. South Central LAMP is
  considered a haven for many of our families, and with your support, we can
  provide trauma-informed, culturally-responsive mental health and supportive
  services (including family advocacy and case management) to better meet the
  needs of the children and families we already serve while increasing our
  support and impact the South Los Angeles community.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  South Central LAMP's parenting and family advocacy services focus primarily on
  the women and children in our morning program. To serve more families, we will
  implement an afternoon program that includes case management, parenting
  classes, family advocacy, and mental health workshops while also providing
  childcare and an after-school STEAM program for their children. Surveys and
  assessments are administered to measure each child’s developmental gains,
  improvement in the areas of maternal support of a child’s learning and
  development, and progress in adult literacy and language skills. Through
  Family Advocacy, mothers develop goals and create an action plan in the areas
  of personal/academic, parenting/family, and child/early childhood education.
  Their progress is assessed throughout the year and the Family Advocate helps
  them overcome any obstacles. This close personal engagement contributes to our
  high program retention rate, which is consistently 90% and higher.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '300'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  The 2017 Key Indicators of Health report lists South LA as the county’s
  highest percentage of households living in poverty, highest percentage of
  adults with less than a high school degree, and lowest percentage of children
  ages 0-5 who are read to daily. Within a 5 mile radius of our agency, 99% of
  immigrant families emigrated from Latin America and nearly 100% of the women
  we serve are new immigrants who speak little to no English and are not aware
  of, or are afraid to access, resources that will help them advocate for
  themselves or their children. Mental health stigmas often keep immigrant
  families from seeking help. But we know that negative preconceptions and myths
  can be dispelled through education and positive experiences. By providing
  mental health and support services at South Central LAMP, an agency they
  trust, we can change the way that parents see mental health and mental health
  treatment, thereby breaking the cycle of generational trauma through education
  and therapy.
