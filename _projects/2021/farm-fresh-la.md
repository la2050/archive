  - South LA
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
  - 'Other:: Skid Row'
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Historical disinvestments have created generational economic and social
  barriers to local healthy food access in the communities. As a result there
  are many barriers preventing local farmers’ produce from reaching Calfresh
  shoppers in Los Angeles. One of which is that California grown produce can be
  expensive for small markets to purchase, particularly in low-income
  neighborhoods. Thus making locally grown produce not easily accessible for
  Calfresh shoppers. One of the reasons for this is that California grown
  produce is sought after produce, globally. Making the market extremely
  competitive, and sometimes too costly for small markets in low-income
  neighborhoods. This program is seeking to address the barriers between
  connecting Calfresh shoppers and small markets to local farmers of color. The
  Farm Fresh LA program does the work for the farmers, markets, and Calfresh
  shoppers to make local produce affordable for the market to provide and the
  Calfresh shopper to purchase.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Farm Fresh LA supports markets in South LA, Skid Row, and MacArthur Park, and
  local farmers. Our program aims at improving the following: (1) community
  access to fresh produce; (2) food supply chain between local farmers and
  neighborhood storeowners; (3) destigmatize government benefits by
  demonstrating purchasing power of CalFresh shoppers. Through our Farm Fresh LA
  program, we’re helping Calfresh shoppers support locally grown produce, and
  helping California farmers supports local participating neighborhood marketsِ.
  An example of this recently has been at the Healthy Neighborhood Market
  Network stores implementing the initiative, owners distribute and sell
  FarmFresh LA small produce bundles. Farm Fresh LA bundles costs $1 to $2
  CalFreshِ, but retails for $10 to $20. This initiative is part of our strategy
  to address the problems of decades of disinvestment and the flight of
  full-service grocery stores from low income neighborhoods, resulting in what
  are commonly called “food deserts.” Farm Fresh LA addresses the main problem
  of historic disinvestment by investing in the creation of new economic and
  social opportunities that enable these already resilient communities to thrive
  with healthy food access and affordability.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  This is an early-stage program. Success is measured by the relationship
  between partners as well as our ability to support and provide support to the
  communities-at-large. If we can facilitate a successful relationship between
  produce source and the cornerstones supporting the community, then the
  community will benefit. To measure the progress and success of the program, we
  will collect qualitative data through periodic sampling at CalFresh shopper,
  storeowner, produce vendor, and farmer levels. We will also collect quantities
  distributed as well as collect information on types of produce distributed to
  get a good understanding of how CalFresh shoppers enjoy their produce.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '300'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Over the one-year grant period we will support approximately 10 local farmers,
  3 small markets, and provide 4,300 affordable local produce bundles to
  CalFresh program participants. The estimated direct impact is 300 Calfresh
  program participants and the estimated indirect impact is 1000 community
  members. The success and expansion of this program long term will create a
  connected food ecosystem of local farmers, small markets, and Calfresh
  shoppers. Farm Fresh LA is an important program for forging these connections
  to sustain long-term positive change towards a resilient local food system.
