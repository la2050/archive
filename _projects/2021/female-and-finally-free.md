project_summary: >-
  Pacific Film Foundation (PFF) dedicates a channel to support UN Sustainable
  Development Goal #5: Achieve Gender Equality. PFF is developing a TV series,
  Female and Finally Free. For LA2050, PFF would invite LA County women and
  girls to send short video "entries" about achieving freedom from constraints,
  e.g., abuse, eating disorder, poverty, incarceration, bullying,
  discrimination, and others. Moderated videos would be streamed for public
  voting with winners earning a series casting shot.

'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  From UN Sustainable Development Goals Website: Gender equality is a
  fundamental human right and a necessary foundation for a peaceful, prosperous
  and sustainable world. There has been progress: More girls are going to
  school, fewer girls are forced into early marriage, more women are serving in
  positions of leadership, and laws are being reformed to advance gender
  equality. • Despite these gains, many challenges remain: discriminatory laws
  and social norms remain pervasive, women continue to be underrepresented at
  all levels of political leadership • Women are paid 16% less than men. • One
  in four managers are women. • 31% of young women are not in education,
  employment or training. • Only 40% of women who experience violence seek help
  of any sort. • 1 in 5 women and girls between the ages of 15 and 49 report
  experiencing physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner within a
  12-month period. • Women need more access to finance in order to be on an
  equal footing with men.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  PFF is committed to help meet U.N. Sustainable Development Goals by being a
  creative hub via streaming channels dedicated to the goals. For example, U.N.
  Goal #5: “Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.” Led by
  Dayle D. Hartnett, Ph.D., PFF is developing the TV series, Female and Finally
  Free, reaching out to women who will tell their personal stories of becoming
  free from constraints. These stories may be about surviving abuse,
  imprisonment, or bulling; or, suffering from postpartum depression, an eating
  disorder, or poverty; or, about victory over any adversity. For LA2050, we
  would use the grant to invite females throughout LA County to send their
  self-produced video story to
  https://pacificfilmfoundation.org/gender-equality-5 for posting on the
  streaming Channel 5 – Gender Equality. We will then invite Website visitors to
  view the stories and review/vote for the story(ies) they believe in (stories,
  reviews, and votes moderated). PFF’s ultimate goal is to develop, produce, and
  ultimately distribute this episodic series so that women and girls around the
  world can be inspired by these courageous examples. For LA2050, we would focus
  on stories celebrating girls and women in LA County who have broken free of
  constraints, and one or more of these stories could become part of the
  episodic series. PFF owns the URL, http://femaleandfinallyfree.com and would
  develop and launch the site as part of the LA2050 grant.
