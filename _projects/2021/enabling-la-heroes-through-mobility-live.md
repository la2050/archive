title: Enabling LA Heroes Through Mobility
project_summary: >-
  MoceanLab will make low-emissions hybrid carshare vehicles available to
  healthcare providers at a significant discount, currently set at or above 50%
  discount, with some at 100% discount. This service will allow these frontline
  workers access to safe, reliable mobility that enable them to get to and from
  their places of work safely and efficiently. With more access to healthcare
  providers, our community will more effectively be able to access healthcare
  and mental health services, while the hybrid vehicles will help improve
  overall air quality.

project_video: ''
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South LA
  - Westside
  - LAUSD (select only if you have a district-wide partnership or project)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Access to equitable mental health care and healthcare resources is an issue
  that faces many low income and under funded areas covered by LAUSD. Our
  program would allow LAUSD Mobile Healthcare, LAUSD faculty, and low wage
  healthcare workers access to reliable environmentally friendly transportation
  to visit patients most in need. Mocean Carshare will provide 50-100% discounts
  of our daily rate to those working hard on the healthcare front lines.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  We have a three-prong pilot for our LA Heroes Program. • LA Heroes
  Long-Term/Weekly Rentals: Discounted carshare rentals, 5-7 days in duration
  for low wage healthcare workers. Workers would need to prequalify and reserve
  the car a week in advance. • LA Heroes Discount for Schools: Make 50% discount
  available to all PK-12 faculty & staff across LAUSD schools. • New LA Heroes
  Fleet Healthcare Partners: Provide three vehicles free of charge to LAUSD
  nurse, psychologist, and aide resources that cover multiple school locations
  and are required to move from site to site during the day. There would be an
  application from the participating schools on behalf of the resources they
  would want to support with these vehicles.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Transportation Access: Our success will be measured by the amount of approved
  drivers and percentage of utilization.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '14280'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1004000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Providing transportation options for mobile staff at LAUSD and making carshare
  affordable and accessible to other LAUSD staff. Our program aims to
  successfully improve Los Angeles traffic congestion and the corresponding
  environmental impact of having many vehicles on the road. Studies have shown
  that carsharing can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 10 percent on average.
  Access to carshare programs give Angelenos options so that owning a second or
  third car is not necessary. As a result, fewer cars on the road and increased
  use of smaller and more efficient vehicles have a positive impact on our air
  quality.
