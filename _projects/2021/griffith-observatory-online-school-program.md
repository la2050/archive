title: Griffith Observatory Online School Program
project_summary: >-
  The Griffith Observatory Online School Program will take every single fifth
  grader in Los Angeles County on a stimulating, free, virtual visit to Griffith
  Observatory! The program’s five space-science modules, all presented live via
  Zoom, will show students that studying STEM subjects is fun and can be
  achieved by anyone, no matter what their background is.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  In 2019, only 30% of fifth graders in Los Angeles County met or exceeded the
  state standards for science learning, and this number was even lower for
  economically disadvantaged students who were African American (12%) and
  Hispanic (18%)*. These low proficiency levels are in part due to insufficient
  STEM educational resources in K-12 schools, especially Title I schools.
  Unfortunately, this lack of resources leads to more than just low test scores:
  it also largely contributes to the underrepresentation of minority
  groups—particularly Hispanics and African Americans—in STEM careers. As long
  as these underserved populations continue to be deprived of educational
  opportunities early in life, test scores will remain low, and students will
  keep believing that STEM subjects and careers are out of their reach. *“Test

'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  The Griffith Observatory Online School Program will provide free and fun
  informal STEM education to every single fifth grader in Los Angeles County
  each school year, starting this fall. This virtual adaptation of the
  Observatory’s Fifth-Grade School Field Trip Program will consist of five
  40-minute modules and will be facilitated live by Museum Guides, Telescope
  Demonstrators, and Observatory Lecturers. These modules will include a look
  through the Zeiss telescope; a live demonstration of how to make a “comet,”
  with students following along at home; a conversion of our popular planetarium
  show, “Water Is Life,” to a 2-D virtual experience; an interactive lesson on
  exoplanets; and a tour through Griffith Observatory’s galleries and exhibits.
  All of the program’s content was specifically designed to meet the State of
  California’s Next Generation Science Standards and fifth-grade curriculum, and
  each module will be accompanied by a packet of teacher and student materials
  that will help reinforce this content in the classroom.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Once the program is up and running, we will send a follow-up survey to each
  participating teacher in order to gauge the program’s impact on students’
  interest in STEM topics and engagement in the classroom. The Online School
  Program is based on the long-running School Field Trip program, so we expect
  it to have similar results. Our 2019 School Field Trip Program surveys
  revealed the following: ● 90% of respondents said the field trip was in the
  top 10% of field trips they have ever been on; 80% said their students were “a
  lot more engaged in the Observatory School Program than other field trips.” ●
  82% said their students were more excited about science learning AFTER the
  Observatory field trip. ● 98% indicated that the program reinforced content or
  science skills previously emphasized in the classroom.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '100000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '300000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  The Online School Program will ensure that kids in LA County from all
  backgrounds, including those most underrepresented in STEM career fields, have
  access to STEM education at a young age. Our goal is to start leveling the
  playing field by making students aware of the possibilities of STEM and
  helping them see that everyone can study and enjoy it. Because the Los Angeles
  Unified School District contains so many students from underserved
  populations—73.4% of students are Latinx, and 10% are African American*—we are
  uniquely positioned to bring STEM education to the populations who are most
  underrepresented in STEM career fields and. Over time, we will help build a
  diverse and flourishing STEM workforce in Los Angeles. *“Los Angeles Unified
