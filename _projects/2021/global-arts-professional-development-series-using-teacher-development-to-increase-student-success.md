  Global Arts Professional Development Series: Using Teacher Development to
  Increase Student Success
project_summary: >-
  We believe teachers who are constantly inspired to learn make the best
  educators, however, there is a severe lack of access to high-quality
  professional development for all educators. A grant from LA2050 will fund our
  Professional Development Series outright, providing free workshops for all.
  Our series consists of 17 biweekly workshops on Friday afternoons throughout
  the academic year, as well as a five-day Summer Seminario that brings back our
  most effective presenters from the year’s workshop series.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  There is a severe lack of resources dedicated to teacher development.
  Professional development for teachers is often an afterthought or only offered
  because it is a requirement. We want arts educators in Los Angeles to have
  access to a variety of relevant continuing education workshops to support
  their teaching practice.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Our Professional Development Program provides a collaborative space centered
  around teaching and learning. As a staff of educators ourselves, we understand
  firsthand the impact a teacher can have on their students. It is our objective
  to create an environment that recognizes and encourages teachers’ continual
  learning. Global Arts Professional Development Program workshops focus on
  educational psychology, musical excellence, and social justice, and are led by
  world-class presenters from varying backgrounds. Our workshops provide
  engaging and edifying material, as well as tangible tools that attendees can
  take into their classrooms and apply immediately. Since we launched our
  program online in September 2020, we have served over 100 educators in Los
  Angeles and elsewhere in the United States, Australia, Canada, Colombia,
  Eswatini (formerly Swaziland), and Venezuela.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  At the end of each workshop, surveys are distributed to all participants.
  These surveys have provided us with qualitative feedback about attendees’
  perceived effectiveness of the workshop and their desire to return for future
  workshops. All participant comments allow Global Arts staff to make
  adjustments to the topics presented and the workshop format, as well as to
  identify potential returning presenters. Additionally, we also use workshop
  registrations to monitor the number of attendees, attendee retention, school
  or organization affiliation, and how many attendees we can project to see the
  following year.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '500'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '100000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Global Arts envisions an accessible, long-term professional development
  program that improves the academic lives of the teachers and students of
  LAUSD. LAUSD is the 2nd largest school district in the nation with over 35,000
  teachers. The 2019 Teacher Strike opened the public’s eyes to the conditions
  in our school system; educators demanded development opportunities and
  conducive learning environments not only for their students, but for
  themselves and other educators. Unfortunately, nationwide only 29% of teachers
  are highly satisfied by professional development offerings, and this concern
  trickles down as it directly affects students' learning. This effect can be
  seen in LAUSD’s high dropout rate of 13.6%. The success of our program will
  manifest itself in reinvigorated LAUSD educators and lower student dropout
  rates across the district.
