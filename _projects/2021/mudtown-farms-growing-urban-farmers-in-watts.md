title: 'MudTown Farms: Growing Urban Farmers in Watts'
project_summary: >-
  WLCAC’s MudTown Farms trains Watts residents in urban farming for economically
  and environmentally sustainable careers. Our hands-on course includes
  subsidized apprenticeships, land access, cultural heritage, business networks,
  farm planning, and social safety net supports. New urban farmers will use
  self-determination and entrepreneurship to address food insecurity, food
  quality, and unemployment for themselves, their families, and the community.

project_video: ''
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  With 37% of all public housing in the City of LA and only 2 supermarkets,
  Watts is a food desert where residents (about 2/3 Latinx, 1/3 Black, and
  nearly ½ immigrants) have low access to food, employment, and education.
  Within a ½ mile radius of MudTown Farms, the median household income is half
  the county average, and 41% of residents live in poverty. Earlier community
  meetings revealed residents’ desires to learn more about urban farming, and
  our current gardening students aspire to go deeper with additional training in
  business, sustainable food systems, and best practices for maximizing food
  production. To address food insecurity, food quality, and unemployment, Watts
  residents need skills, knowledge, supports, and connections. To be viable,
  career pathways should include education, built-in business connections,
  subsidized launchpads, and social safety net supports. Options for both
  employment and entrepreneurship can offer self-determination and community
  business opportunities.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  WLCAC’s 1960s roots include farming under power lines in Watts and on remote
  ranches that supplied senior nutrition programs and social-enterprise markets.
  Building on this agricultural history and our track record of serving Watts
  residents, we will offer urban farmer training that incorporates cultural
  heritage, business networks, economic viability, nutritional sufficiency, and
  social safety net supports. Our newest site, 2.5-acre MudTown Farms, boasts a
  multipurpose building, greenhouse, orchard, aquaponics, composting, flower
  beds, and vegetable cultivation on historic, fertile, unbuilt and
  uncontaminated farmland. MudTown Farms’ innovative urban farming course will
  include subsidized apprenticeships, land access, and customized farm business
  planning. Urban farming offers both individual and community economic
  improvement by reducing food costs, improving diet quality, and producing a
  good return on investment. Even with barriers of limited language, education,
  and startup capital, Watts residents can gain useful, employable skills in a
  growing business sector, with scalable entrepreneurial options. Coordinated
  individual urban farmer action can increase the entire community’s capacity
  for food production, food access, employment, and self-determination,
  contributing to both economic and environmental sustainability. With this
  training and MudTown Farms’ continued support, new urban farmers can regrow
  the market garden economy that sustained earlier Watts residents.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Fruitful recruitment, student retention, and gains in farm/business knowledge
  and skills will demonstrate successful training. Program success includes
  15-20 urban farmers (at least 70% limited resource, at least 90% socially
  disadvantaged) completing training, 10 completing apprenticeships, and 5
  farming on subsidized plots. Income gained from employment and/or
  entrepreneurship will demonstrate individual economic success. Economically
  and ecologically sustainable urban farming ventures will demonstrate
  successful farm plans. Student pre- and post-program self-assessment of
  personal and family food insecurity and healthy food access will measure
  health improvements. An Advisory Council of at least 5 individuals will
  demonstrate connections to wider LA-area farm/food ventures. Active, trained
  farmers, continued programming, Latinx and Black community awareness of new
  career options, and access to healthy food will demonstrate longer-term
  success.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '20'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '80'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Through deep engagement, this innovative program will change the employment
  and income trajectory for significantly disadvantaged individuals, launching
  them into fulfilling, sustainable careers as urban farmers. Learning skills,
  making career connections, practicing entrepreneurship, and gaining food
  sovereignty will empower individuals who are poorly served by existing
  education and employment options. Furthermore, individuals who receive urban
  farmer training, career guidance, and subsidized apprenticeships and land
  access will improve food security and health for their families and community.
  Creating career paths, business networks, and a support system for urban
  farming careers promotes both economic and environmental sustainability in a
  neighborhood lacking these benefits. With the endorsement of our new Advisory
  Council, MudTown Farms’ training credential will set local urban farmer
  training standards and smooth the way for students’ employment and
  entrepreneurial credibility.
