title: Nature is in PLAY
project_summary: >-
  Our Nature Is in Play Project aims to connect all Angelenos to the inspiring,
  energizing, and healing benefits of nature in the city. Nature is in play at
  all of Los Angeles Audubon’s outdoor and online programs that connect diverse
  communities to nature walks, community-based science programs, habitat
  restoration, and nature sketching at schools, neighborhoods, parks and beaches
  throughout LA County.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - South LA
  - Westside
  - LAUSD (select only if you have a district-wide partnership or project)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Now more than ever, spending time outdoors in nature is important for both our
  physical and mental well-being. The benefits of spending time in nature should
  belong to everyone. Our Nature Is in Play project aims to center equitable
  access to nature-based opportunities in an effort to support communities in
  deepening their sense of place and belonging in the great outdoors. Barriers
  to participation in nature activities include lack of access to safe green
  space within walking distance, lack of transportation to more distant
  greenspace, unfamiliarity with how to access greenspaces using public
  transportation, fear and lack of understanding about plants and wildlife, and
  not feeling welcome or safe. We believe that when people connect to nature in
  our city through meaningful, joyful activities, they then seek ways to care
  for nature in our city. People, habitat, and wildlife all stand to benefit
  when communities can connect to nature.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Covid-19 temporarily disrupted LA Audubon's ability to host field trips for
  school groups, to lead community groups on nature walks, and to host
  volunteers for habitat restoration events. However, by adopting online
  learning strategies, such as in-class Zoom sessions for LAUSD students and
  posting virtual nature tours from parks on social media, we stayed connected
  to communities and expanded our reach to thousands of people of all ages who
  are longing for a connection to nature. We hope to resume in-person nature
  activities soon, but in the meantime, we will create a map-sketchbooklet that
  highlights key greenspace in the Ballona Creek Watershed, from the uplands of
  the Baldwin Hills, along the Park to Playa Trail and all the way to the beach.
  The “Ballona Nature Is in Play” publication will provide information about the
  watershed, space to sketch nature sightings during self-guided tours, and will
  include details about how to visit using public transportation. Offered as a
  download and in print, in English and Spanish, the publication has the
  potential to connect thousands of people to nature in the Los Angeles Basin,
  in a safe, self-paced, socially distant way. We will promote the publication
  via public libraries adjacent to greenspaces we use for our programming and to
  family groups through our long-established connections with Title 1 schools.
  When officially safe to do so, we’ll resume our in-person nature programs,
  including sites featured in the publication.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  LA Audubon’s nature programs have been in play for more than a decade, serving
  5,000 students each year primarily from LAUSD schools. Our outdoor programs’
  success is measured by the number of participants, student and teacher
  surveys, and hiring program alumni who have pursued careers in environmental
  science and education. The program outreach includes areas in historically
  underserved communities in South Los Angeles such as Baldwin Village,
  Crenshaw, and Inglewood. These communities suffer from poor air quality, have
  significant socio-economic needs and a high degree of racial/ethnic health
  disparity. The Baldwin Hills parklands, in particular, offer an oasis of
  much-needed green space for the community.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '500'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '5000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  We envision Los Angeles as a place where all people feel welcome and safe when
  connecting to nature outdoors; where diverse communities have easy access to
  green spaces; and where intergenerational learning leads to a life-long
  interest in enjoying and protecting nature in the city. Our ultimate goal is
  to spark an interest in the natural world, whether it’s found perched on the
  powerlines or at a State park or beach.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  LA Audubon is collaborating with three organizations leading small groups in
  nature activities, and/or including these sites on the “Ballona Nature Is in
  Play” publication. 1) Exceptional Children's Foundation where children and
  adults with developmental disabilities meet each week at Kenneth Hahn Park for
  nature-based activities; 2) Hike to Yoga where LA Audubon leads a pre-Yoga
  ecology hike up the hill to the top of Kenneth Hahn; and 3) the Westwood
  Greenway where small groups are led on ecology hikes through the two-acre site
  straddling the Metro E Line. In addition, our long-standing partnership with
  CA State Parks and LA County Parks & Rec provides us with unique access to
  host community events and nature education programs at Baldwin Hills
  Parklands, Ballona Wetlands, and the beach.
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?: >-
  Access to the LA2050 community,Hosting virtual events or
  gatherings,Communications support,Capacity-building and training,Strategy
  assistance and implementation,Volunteer recruitment
