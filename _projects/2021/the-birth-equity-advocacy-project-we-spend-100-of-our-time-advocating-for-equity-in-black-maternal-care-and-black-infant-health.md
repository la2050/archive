  The Birth Equity Advocacy Project - We spend 100% of our time advocating for
  equity in Black maternal care and Black infant health.
project_summary: >-
  In recent years, despite the reduction in Black maternal mortality rates in
  California the difference in outcomes for Black mothers compared with all
  other racial groups has continued to grow. COVID-19 has exacerbated factors
  that compound racial inequity, such as geography,socioeconomic status, and
  access to resources. Our work is focused on filling in the gap of awareness as
  it relates to birth equity due to racism. Our hope is that we can activate
  communities, families, and corporations to start talking about this issue more
  proactively.

  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Systematic racism in our healthcare system and in our healthcare policy that

  The Birth Equity Advocacy Project will create an effective and efficient
  strategic messaging and awareness campaign broken into three categories of
  impact Meaningful Messaging, The Black Mom Listening Tour and Coordinated
  Resource Building. The Birth Equity Awareness Campaign, by using a roundtable
  format, the Birth Equity Advocacy Project would lead the discussion in
  understanding what new and existing challenges have been impacted due to
  COVID-19 and what steps the group believes should be taken to close the gap.
  Meaningful Messaging for Birth Equity Advocacy means decimating the
  information collected from the group and translating that into powerful
  imagery and language. We plan to take the tenacity and urgency this issue
  needs to every platform and expand our reach as much as possible into the most
  underserved areas and to the most underserved communities. The Black Mom
  Listening Tour is the second leg of the Birth Equity Awareness Campaign. By
  conducting coalition building in our most regionally impacted areas we will
  use stakeholder influence to launch an engagement campaign. Coordinated
  Resource Building, is the final approach in our messaging campaign focused on
  provider education. We will focus on working with our provider based
  coalitions to ensure a diverse and comprehensive perspective of Birth Equity
  as it relates to Black Maternal Care to define the line more clearly between
  clinical intuition and unconscious bias.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  We are measuring impact by the exact amount of women and providers and
  legislators we are able to reach through direct communication through our
  awareness campaign and what policy we are able to have an influence on
  throughout that process. We know for a fact that in the space of Birth Equity
  for Black Maternal Care there are great 501c3s that have been doing the grass
  roots work for so long, however they can only allocate a small percentage of
  their time and funding focused on advocating - that is where we come in!
  Because we are a 501c4 dedicated to Birth Equity for Black Maternal Care we
  get to spend 100% of our time advocating and are not limited in funding we can
  receive or use on this issue.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '25000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '25000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  We have found that awareness is the key to eliminating implicit bias. We shift
  the narrative and re-create the framework for what it is to be a Black mother
  in the process of growing life. Our strategic approach is to develop an
  inclusivity framework through the lens of human rights that will set a trend
  for a larger conversation that results in tangible self sustaining change.
  With this help we can ensure more women in Los Angeles feel more supported to
  demand quality care.
