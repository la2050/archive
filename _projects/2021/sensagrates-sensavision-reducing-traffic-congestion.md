title: 'Sensagrate''s SensaVision: Reducing Traffic Congestion'
project_summary: >-
  SensaVision collects real-time traffic and roadway safety data of cities to
  decrease congestion and save lives on roadways. SensaVision is an end-to-end
  computer vision, AI, and IoT Mobility-as-a-Service platform for mobility and
  transportation data providers, and traffic engineers to provide real-time
  roadway, traffic, and safety analytics with and predictive analysis.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - East LA
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Drivers face 2.9 billion gallons of wasted fuel and generate 56 billion lbs.
  of additional CO2. In the US, on average 37,000 people die in crashes annually
  and 50% of fatal and injury crashes occur at or near intersections. Pedestrian
  fatalities are increasing with more than 6500 fatalities in 2019 estimated by
  the Governors Highway Safety Association (GHSA). Where 75% of pedestrian
  fatalities are beyond the intersection and 82% are at night (AAA). These
  factors are distracted driving, impaired driving, distracted pedestrians,
  red-light runners, wrong-way drivers, speeding, and other factors. These
  problems decrease the efficiencies of traffic congestion, reducing emissions,
  and improving public safety with an economic cost in the US of $242B annually.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  SensaVision collects, provides, and analyzes real-time roadway and traffic
  data. LiDAR point cloud and camera data provide 2D and 3D real-world views of
  vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, and other mobility and non-mobility data with
  tracking and analytics. The data is time series based and there’s no data
  collection of personal identification information. Data shared is in raw view
  or processed JSON format. The data is collected at intersections, beyond
  intersections, mid-block, and other locations to provide viable and unique
  data to assess and understand risks, traffic flow analytics, counts, volume,
  predictive AI analytics, and roadway safety. Data collected is processed with
  traffic, signal, and roadway data to provide advanced analytics of driver and
  pedestrian behavior and traffic analysis. Data analytics can be used to
  improve pedestrian safety, for mobility applications, to foster better
  decision making for autonomous vehicles, and prepare for the future of
  intelligent transportation system applications in Vehicle-to-Infrastructure
  (V2X) and Infrastructure-to-Everything (I2X) communications.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Results and impact will be measured by seeing the first 3 to 6 months of
  traffic flow and how traffic flow with congestion decreases creating less
  travel time and reducing emission. We install CO2 sensors without deployments
  to measure emission ratings. In addition, we assess the rate and frequency of
  near-miss collisions to verify changes to the signal phase and timing or other
  city planning impacts add value to describing the rate of incidents.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '20000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '82000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Our vision is to help reduce congestion, decrease emissions and save lives on
  roadways. The goal would be to pilot our technology with a city in Los Angeles
  County and with a successful pilot to expand across one city to neighboring
  and other cities across the county. A part of our plan is to integrate our
  data and solution into traffic control signals to make them adaptive. As well
  as, deployments that happened across the county our expansion to other
  intelligent transportation system solutions include vehicle-to-everything and
  infrastructure-to-vehicle communications. This solution will provide an
  intersection to intersection communication between all traffic signals to
  optimize traffic flow while decreasing congestion, emissions and improving
  public safety.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: ''
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?: >-
  Access to the LA2050 community,Communications support,Strategy assistance and
  implementation
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.: Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator’s (LACI) and
Which metrics will you impact?:
  - Travel time to work
  - ' Public transit ridership'
Indicate any additional LA2050 goals your project will impact.:
  - LA is the best place to PLAY
  - ' LA is the healthiest place to LIVE'
