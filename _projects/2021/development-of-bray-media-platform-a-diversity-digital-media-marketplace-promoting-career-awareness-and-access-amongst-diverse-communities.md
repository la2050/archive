  Los Angeles, CA is home to so many industry verticals, technology, media,
  STEM, and many more. It's so many programs in this city that give diverse
  communities career development awareness from colleges, non-profits, and
  organizations. These resources need to be available for diverse students and
  professionals in one place to thrive and stay encouraged. These organizations
  also need to work together to create endless content that can help increase
  diverse representation in STEM. Los Angeles, CA is already a multicultural
  city but with better jobs and representation, brings equitable wage. Bray
