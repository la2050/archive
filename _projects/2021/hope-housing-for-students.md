title: Hope Housing for Students
project_summary: >-
  For so long, the story of LA has been of inequity and poverty for marginalized
  communities; the lifelong solution to breaking these cycles of marginalization
  is education and independence. Hope Housing for Students works towards
  fostering educational equity for community college students who are either
  experiencing homelessness or housing insecurity. We not only provide housing
  for these students, but also a nurturing environment where we mold the future
  civic, business, & cultural leaders of Los Angeles.

  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  The quest for educational justice often focuses on bringing resources and
  voices to our 4-year university system, our community colleges represent the
  most immediate way to help close the education and wealth gap. Sadly, the
  amount of attention and resources for community colleges are lacking. For many
  students experiencing homelessness or housing insecurity, community college
  represents the chance of leaving behind a life of poverty and contributing to
  the social, cultural, and economic life of our city; we believe in investing
  and building up resources for these students to fully see their true
  potential. Through our Hope Housing for students initiative, we have built
  partnerships with Community Colleges in Los Angeles to find students who are
  suffering from homelessness or housing insecurity, develop housing solutions
  for them, and focus on a wide ranging program to aid in mental health,
  nutrition, and academic support so that these students build a life and
  contribute to our city.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Hope Housing for Students provide housing opportunities for community college
  students experiencing either homelessness or housing insecurity, and provide
  them not just a roof over their head, but full suit of programs to best aid
  students in succeeding. Our strategy is to give these students a comfortable
  and safe environment and the tools to help them succeed in the classroom and
  beyond. With our Mental Health Director overseeing both group therapy and
  individual sessions for all students, and also develop programs to provide a
  holistic approach to help students understand how best to live & thrive
  independently. Approximately 2/3 of our students are members of the LGBTQ+
  community. Currently, there are two residences that have been established by
  Hope Housing, with 22 beds in total. Our aim is to provide a whole curriculum
  that includes meditation & yoga, financial planning, sustainable living,
  self-defense & training, community building, healthy eating among many others.
  We nurture character building as a twin component for educational success. By
  creating future leaders who have been from historically marginalized
  communities, we change the story of LA to be one of equity and justice.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  With two semesters into the program, we have tracked an extensive array of
  metrics that have gone beyond our initial expectations for success. Two
  students were accepted in 4-year institutions while one student who arrived
  with a 2.7 GPA achieved a 3.7 GPA in both the Fall and Winter Semesters. We
  believe that investing in student housing and supportive programs would lead
  to increased participation rates in school and increase overall GPAs. We had
  expected average GPAs to increase by .5; after the first semester, the average
  GPA of program participants went from a 2.7 to a 3.5 with 72% of all units
  that students took passing. Our aim is to have all students either enroll in a
  4-year University program after graduation from their community colleges, or
  enter into a trade position with long term employment opportunities. The early
  numbers indicate how vital stable housing, mental health services, and life
  coaching offered through our program have positively impacted these students.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '40'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '200'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  These future leaders have the lived experience to help shape a more equitable
  and just LA society. A society that does not judge based on poverty or
  identity, but has equal opportunity for all is a different LA than the one
  that has been experienced by many on the fringe. With resources in place, we
  hope to be a model for policy makers and civic leaders at a larger level. We
  believe that a successful investment into our program can provide valuable
  lessons to build a more creative, livable, and economically mobile city in
  which all marginalized communities will have equal access for every Angeleno.
  We firmly believe this is a promise from us in the present to the future.
