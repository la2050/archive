title: Online Arts and Athletics Lessons for Children with Chronic Illness
project_summary: >-
  CoachArt's mission is to create a transformative arts and athletics community
  for families impacted by childhood chronic illness. CoachArt improves social
  and emotional wellbeing by matching children with chronic illness to volunteer
  coaches who provide inclusive, free instruction that accommodates a child’s
  needs, instills confidence, and ignites lifelong passions. We are instating
  our innovative COVID-19 online service models as a permanent program option to
  ensure that immunocompromised children will always have safe opportunities to
  learn.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Applying a proven model or solution to a new issue or sector (e.g., using a
  job recruiting software or strategy to match clients to supportive housing
  sites, applying demonstrated strategies from advocating for college
  affordability to advocating for housing affordability and homelessness, etc.)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Children with chronic illness historically experience learning inequities.
  Families lose access to arts programs provided by hospitals when their
  children move to outpatient care. Additionally, 60% of CoachArt families in
  Los Angeles are low income, lacking the resources to afford extracurricular
  activities elsewhere—especially programs that can adapt to children’s needs
  and physical limitations. As a result, children miss out on developmental
  opportunities, face ostracization as the “sick kid” at school, and experience
  rates of depression 5 to 7 times higher than their peers. The COVID-19
  pandemic has exacerbated the circumstances for children with chronic illness
  in Los Angeles County who, due to their greater vulnerability, need to follow
  stringent precautions and are thus isolated. In the face of stress and
  uncertainty, children with chronic illness are in need of socialization, play,
  and safe environments to learn now more than ever.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  CoachArt restores equity in learning for children with chronic illness by
  providing ongoing, adaptive lessons in arts and athletics at no cost to
  families. Lessons accommodate special needs, inspire lifelong passions, build
  self-confidence, and encourage children to remove the label of “sick kid” and
  redefine themselves as an artist or athlete. CoachArt’s current initiative is
  to further develop the online programs launched during the start of the
  COVID-19 pandemic. 96% of parents reported that lessons were engaging for
  their child and requested to continue online learning even after Los Angeles
  reopens—underlying a need for online access moving forward. CoachArt kids’
  most common diagnoses are Cancer (26%), Blood Disorders (10%), Respiratory
  Diseases (11%), and Neuromuscular Disorders (7%). We serve a diverse
  population of families, comprising 53% Latino, 14% African American, 13%
  Caucasian, 9% Asian American, 2% Middle Eastern, 1% Native American, and 8%
  multiethnic backgrounds. Transitioning to an online model provides more
  equitable opportunities for low-income families in underserved areas of LA.
  Our online platform CoachArt Connect was originally designed for volunteer
  coaches to match with a student near them within a limited radius. We are now
  incorporating a functionality to CoachArt Connect which will allow volunteer
  coaches to match with students outside their neighborhoods, further addressing
  former inequities and giving all students more opportunities to learn.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  We track our progress through collecting metrics such as lesson hours and
  number of students served, while collecting feedback surveys which measure
  social and emotional wellbeing through four areas: fun; stress-relief;
  socialization (friendship and positive mentorship); and self-confidence. In
  2020, families reported that 95% of students had fun learning, 86% felt more
  relaxed, 93% met a positive mentor, and 85% grew more confident. Socialization
  dropped by 30% (52% made new friends), thus we are building creative ways for
  students to interact with one another more via Zoom. From the American Academy
  of Pediatrics Journal, the 2018 article titled “The Power of Play: A Pediatric
  Role in Enhancing Development in Young Children” advocates for the benefits of
  play, including improvement in language and math skills. Children need to
  develop a variety of skill sets to optimize their development, decrease toxic
  stress and depression, build peer relations, and enhance their sense of
  agency.

Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Joining LA2050 in shaping the future, CoachArt makes LA a more inclusive place
  to learn. LA residents who volunteer with CoachArt teach children valuable
  skills (either 1:1 or in a group workshop format) such as painting, piano,
  ukulele, culinary arts, robotics and coding, creative writing, dance, martial
  arts, and yoga. Mentorship empowers kids to recognize their full potential and
  thrive despite adversity and isolation, while creating a supportive community
  for parents. Our goal is to further develop high-quality, online service
  models in order to provide equitable access to immunocompromised children and
  ultimately improve their social and emotional wellbeing. CoachArt ignites the
  creativity, passion, and confidence of children with chronic illness who are
  crucial in making LA’s story one of hope for all. Our vision is that one day
  every family impacted by childhood chronic illness will be connected to a
  community of support and opportunity to learn together.
