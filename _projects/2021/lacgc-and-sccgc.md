project_summary: >-
  Solano Canyon Community Garden is a 5 acre open space located in Elysian Park
  in Central Los Angeles near Dodger Stadium. We are a community garden and farm
  open to everyone. We have individual beds which are leased on a yearly basis
  with a membership of approximately 20 people and a communal farm with a
  volunteer base which has currently reached approximately 120 people. The
  garden is currently seeking funded upgrades to expand the capacity of
  volunteers to serve the community via weekly empowerment workshops, food
  pantries and much more.

  Community in net access to healthy food, food insecurity, housing
  affordability, water pollution, air quality, healthcare access, renewable
  energy use, property rate, water-use efficiency, local water, resilient
  communities, mental illness, access to mental health services, tree canopy
  cover, older adult well-being, and homelessness. We are honored to generate
  and identify information and expand capacity since the Solano Canyon Community
  Garden has shown great promise in Community Outreach.
