title: 'LA Industry: Circular Textiles'
project_summary: >-
  LA Industry aims to create a centralized hub where material byproducts from
  businesses can be repurposed rather than going to landfills. This hub will
  create a local closed-loop market that promotes a circular economy by
  providing stable and consistent material streams for reuse. Two key success
  factors will be the management of an online material exchange platform and
  quality control/assurance.

project_video: ''
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Under Mayor Eric Garcetti, the City of LA created L.A.’s Green New Deal
  sustainability pLAn. The pLAn has ambitious goals of reaching zero waste by
  2050. This can only be achieved by moving towards a circular economy through
  the implementation of different tools. As a municipality and sustainable
  business assistance team working directly with LA’s manufacturers and
  businesses, LA Industry is uniquely qualified to foster connections and build
  infrastructure to support this project. The design and implementation of a
  centralized hub and online access portal to manage exchanges and quality
  control of the inventory will be one of the pollution prevention and
  sustainability strategies used to help businesses and industries reduce costs
  and environmental footprints. Our clients voiced concerns about a lack of
  local opportunities to reuse, repurpose, or recycle material streams along
  with L.A.’s Green New Deal’s prestigious zero waste goals provided a perfect
  opportunity for this project.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  The hub as proposed is focused on post-industrial material streams and will
  create new markets, green jobs, and economic opportunities for entrepreneurs
  to find innovative solutions to reuse, repurpose, and recycle. This hub will
  be a centralized location where businesses and organizations can browse clean
  material streams to use as feedstock in their manufacturing processes,
  reducing the number of virgin materials used and thus creating cost savings. A
  successful hub will be an important tool to aid the City of LA in reaching
  100% landfill diversion by 2050 as well as being a proven model other cities
  moving towards sustainability can implement.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Due to the immense volume of the City of LAs’ textile and garment waste, our
  project will target the collection and repurposing of post-industrial textile
  scraps. Diverting this textile waste would support L.A.’s Green New Deal’s
  waste goals of 100% organic waste diversion by 2028, 100% landfill diversion
  by 2050, and 50% local material reuse by 2035. We hope to achieve a
  successful, circular, and streamlined business model for textiles that can be
  applied to other material streams. This includes mapping out the A’s (material
  stream producers), B’s (intermediate processors), C’s (end users), as well as
  monitoring transactions to establish a dashboard of tracking metrics (ie:
  frequency, tonnage, composition, active users, cost savings, value creation,
  etc.)
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '5000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '4000000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  The direct impact of this proposal is that LA County will see a reduction of
  waste going to landfills, the creation of new markets, green jobs,
  collaboration opportunities, and cost savings to local businesses, as well as
  uniting local organizations and NGOs passionate in sustainable fashion. The
  indirect impacts of this proposal will be cleaner local communities due to the
  reduction of waste going to landfills, a step closer for the City of LA and LA
  County in achieving zero waste, and fostering a social sense of responsibility
  amongst local businesses and consumers.
