title: 'The Village: A Collective Approach to Affordable Housing'
project_summary: >-
  The Village is a community-oriented supportive housing concept that will
  provide safe and affordable housing for female-led households. Organized
  around shared, collective spaces, it will explore the potential of supportive
  housing integrated with other programs such as childcare, spaces for economic
  development, or healthcare to strengthen communities and bolster essential
  networks of support. With the grant funds, we will work in partnership with
  the community to design a space that embodies their collective needs and
  aspirations.

project_video: ''
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - San Gabriel Valley
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  The scale of the housing crisis enveloping Los Angeles in recent years is well
  publicized. Under mounting political pressure, the dominant solution has been
  to target narrow quantitative metrics by providing as many units of housing as
  quickly and inexpensively as possible. Embodied in the provision of this
  housing are cultural values that are often incongruous with the lifestyle,
  demographics, and needs of the population being housed. To receive assistance,
  potential residents must conform or they do not qualify. Housing provided is
  typically individual units with parking and little collective space,
  unavailable to undocumented individuals or families, and with little ability
  to reduce the cost of housing for the end-user without public assistance
  throughout their tenancy. Additionally, a metrics-driven housing practice
  spatially distributes supportive housing far from employment opportunities and
  other necessary amenities, compounding the deleterious effects of housing
  insecurity.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  We propose to develop a process and design model for community-oriented
  supportive housing as an alternative to the metrics-driven models commonly
  deployed in Los Angeles. The Village is a shared, integrated, affordable
  housing concept accommodating multiple families in rental housing, and will be
  oriented towards female-led households to protect victims of domestic violence
  and to address the soaring number of women and their families experiencing
  increased instability as a result of the pandemic. In contrast to the majority
  of supportive housing that is provided as atomized, individual units,
  encouraging atomized, isolated patterns of use, The Village will be oriented
  around The Village commons, communal spaces that facilitate the sharing of
  domestic labor such as childcare and cooking. It will explore the potential of
  supportive housing to strengthen communities and bolster essential networks of
  support, while providing onsite job opportunities through these networks. It
  will also incorporate a diversity of additional programs, such as spaces for
  economic development or healthcare to mitigate challenges brought about by the
  geographic sprawl of LA County. In developing this project, we intend to
  create a roadmap for others to follow, extract insights from, and expand upon.
  Critically, the prototype will be developed through a community-led design
  process, giving potential residents the agency to advocate for the values most
  important to them.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  As a pilot initiative, this venture builds on a shared commitment to research
  and collaboration. In order to ensure success, we have strategized to most
  effectively leverage our complimentary, yet diverse areas of expertise.
  Procedurally, we will structure our efforts through quarterly reports
  consolidating our findings with analysis from community outreach and design.
  We will regularly share these with community stakeholders and industry leaders
  for their feedback, but consider the community response to be our most
  valuable metric of success. We will develop a “Social Impact Bond” to address
  the current inability of funding models to reflect and quantify the long-term
  financial impact of innovative housing schemes. The design solutions will also
  need to meet the requirements we have delineated in quantifiable arenas in
  integrated housing, as well as intangible metrics such as access to community
  and economic resources.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '150'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  We will develop a replicable model for a community-led approach to the
  provision of supportive housing, reflective of the needs and values of its
  immediate context. In addition to creating a prototypical design for The
  Village, the open-source development model seeks to strengthen communities
  through increased agency and access to critical resources such as quality and
  affordable healthcare and childcare, and offer tools to residents and
  community leaders to better advocate for their needs. These elements are
  required to stabilize female-headed households whose instability has only
  increased as a result of the pandemic. The Village concept aspires to consider
  each resident as a vital node in the broader community, whose health and
  welfare is determined by the strength of bonds between members. Ultimately, by
  synthesizing the values embodied in design and development, we hope to build
  upon the interdependency of community members to amplify opportunities and
  quality of life.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  LOHA and TBE will function as a single team, sharing coordination and design
  responsibilities. They will produce written and visual analyses for the
  research and outreach components, and lead the design process to create a new
  housing strategy prototype. Together with NEW and CCF, they will organize
  workshops, design charrettes, and community outreach events. NEW and CCF will
  contribute feedback and direction to the proposals, leverage their extensive
  experience in community development, and identify potential project sites. We
  have readied ourselves to work together as a team, and by integrating
  design-thinking from the earliest stage of project conceptualization, our
  interdisciplinary approach gives us a unique understanding of how to create a
  better way to house unstable families.
