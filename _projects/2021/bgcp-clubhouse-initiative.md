title: BGCP ClubHouse Initiative
project_summary: >-
  Through the ClubHouse Initiative, BGCP has transformed members’ experience at
  the Club during COVID-19 into an engaging, community-building opportunity that
  fosters a sense of belonging and sparks creativity and learning. Club members’
  self-contained small groups are transformed into Houses, chosen based on
  cultural identity and positive values, which work together on enrichment and
  educational projects and compete in weekly challenges. LA2050 would support
  expansion of the Initiative and the creation of a toolkit to share with
  others.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - San Gabriel Valley
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  The problem that BGCP is addressing with the ClubHouse Initiative is the
  social disconnection experienced by children in the Pasadena community as a
  result of COVID-19 lockdowns. When the Club was planning its reopening in the
  summer of 2020, Club staff connected with local families to identify
  children’s needs that the Club could play a role in meeting. Among the primary
  issues identified were children’s feelings of isolation, loneliness, anxiety,
  and depression. BGCP staff also consulted relevant research on the impact of
  the COVID-19 crisis on children’s mental health. The ClubHouse Initiative was
  developed as a way for the Club to create these needed social connections and
  foster a sense of belonging during this crisis, areas which research indicates
  are key in restoring children’s mental health during and following the
  pandemic.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  The ClubHouse Initiative was born out of the need to re-design the Club
  experience in response to COVID-19. When BGCP’s Clubhouses reopened last
  summer, BGCP created small, self-contained, socially distanced “pods” at each
  Clubhouse with a dedicated staff member. Each pod belongs to one of several
  Houses, which are diverse in their identity and positive values. For example,
  the Amistad House evokes Spanish heritage and fosters friendship and
  self-discovery. Weekly, Club members in their Houses work on group projects
  which develop skills and knowledge, foster collaboration, and reinforce
  academic concepts. Projects culminate in weekly challenges, where Houses
  present their learning and compete for points based on participation and
  collaboration. Projects have focused on racial justice, Hispanic heritage,
  education, ecology, fitness, and space exploration. House challenges occur via
  Google Hangout, so that pods can remain in their areas, and both Clubhouses
  can participate together. Through the Houses, members deepen their social
  connections and build their sense of belonging, areas identified in research
  as key to sustaining children’s mental health. BGCP piloted this Initiative
  last summer and continued it this school year based on positive feedback. BGCP
  seeks to expand the Initiative and continue it beyond COVID-19. Specifically,
  the Club plans to design more STEM-related challenges, with Houses showcasing
  scientific experiments and careers available in the STEM fields.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  BGCP assesses members annually across a host of indicators through the
  National Youth Outcomes Initiative (NYOI) of the Boys & Girls Clubs of
  America. Surveys assess members’ Club experiences, academic progress, and
  other areas. BGCP has seen promising results after implementing the ClubHouse
  Initiative. The Fall 2020 member responses in the areas of Sense of Belonging,
  Overall Club Experience, and others are the highest yet. Key outcomes include:
  • Overall Club Experience - 96% ranked as “optimal” or “fair,” compared with
  72% in 2019 • Sense of Belonging: People listen to me here - 98% agreed or
  strongly agreed, compared with 80% in 2019 • Sense of Belonging: People at
  this Club accept me for who I am - 98% agreed or strongly agreed, compared
  with 87% in 2019 These results illustrate the positive impact that BGCP is
  having on members during this difficult time. BGCP expects by 2022 to maintain
  these historic gains, and to increase to 98% members’ “optimal” or “fair” Club
  experience.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '250'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '10000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  LA County will be improved if our work is successful, because the ClubHouse
  Initiative is designed to strengthen Club members’ mental health and academic
  success. LA County will also be improved because other organizations will have
  access to BGCP’s best practices to launch their own programs. There are two
  main criteria to gauge the success of the ClubHouse Initiative. The first is a
  year-over-year increase in members’ sense of belonging at the Club. This is
  important because a strong sense of belonging is a critical factor in
  children’s mental health. It is also a strong indicator of continued Club
  attendance, which reaps additional benefits, including increased high school
  graduation rates (BGCP seniors have had a 100% on-time graduation rate for
  several years) and increased academic proficiency. The second criterion for
  success will be the full development of a ClubHouse Initiative toolkit by
  March 2022, which will be freely available to interested youth-serving
  organizations.
