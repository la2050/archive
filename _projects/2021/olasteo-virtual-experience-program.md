title: OLASTEO Virtual Experience Program
project_summary: >-
  Our carefully curated virtual experiences expose students to a world beyond
  their local communities which motivates them to learn and understand through
  lived experiences. OLASTEO scholars hear from and engage with speakers and
  educators who they did not have prior exposure to. Students receive goods and
  products from BIPOC-owned local businesses where possible. And, true to
  OLASTEO’s nature, our scholars enjoy meals and snacks representing a variety
  of cultural heritages and dietary options.

What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  In the South Los Angeles neighborhood of Watts, less than half of adult
  residents have a high school diploma and only 4% hold a bachelor’s degree.
  Even while crime rates lower and civic and community engagement rises, the
  city’s predominantly Latinx and Black youth are not receiving the
  opportunities they deserve to graduate from high school and enter college.
  OLASTEO works to close this gap by providing innovative experiential
  programming and opportunities for students in high school and college at
  critical turning points in their lives. OLASTEO is currently expanding its
  reach beyond Watts, and in 2021 will be serving students in the following Los
  Angeles County communities: Watts, Compton, Arroyo Seco-Boyle Heights,
  Southeast Los Angeles, Palmdale, Lancaster, Florence-Graham, Huntington Park,
  Lynwood, View Park-Windsor Hills, Ladera Heights, Baldwin Hills, Firestone
  Park, Leimert Park, and Highland Park.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  COVID-19 forced us to pivot from physical excursions to virtual programming in
  order to continue providing enriching journeys for our student community, who
  have felt the pandemic’s impact much more severely than most. Our virtual
  experiences bring the key components of our in-person excursions into the
  online world and can be attended safely from our scholars’ homes. Each virtual
  experience includes an educational workshop, at least two interactive speaker
  sessions, a welcome package, a foodie experience delivered to our students
  each day, and a completion appreciation gift at the program’s culmination. The
  requested funds will be used in support of OLASTEO’s Virtual Experience
  programming. Each experience will target serving up to 50 students per event.
  For a modest per-student dollar amount, we are able to educate students,
  expose minds, and expand mindsets in a boutique and impactful manner. All
  LA2050 funds will be used to support the programming, including the curated
  meals and snacks, the welcome and completion appreciation gifts which include
  goods and products related to our speaker line-up, and to pay honorariums for
  speakers and education sessions. Please view our 2020 Summer Virtual
  Experience Impact Report (https://bit.ly/3fzHgpq), which highlights our
  first-ever Virtual Experience. If the state of the COVID-19 pandemic improves
  and when in-person gatherings are safe, OLASTEO will pivot back to our
  in-person Excursions.

Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  OLASTEO serves as an innovative experiential learning program for students in
  underserved communities throughout LA County. We expose students to the
  stories and lived experiences of others so that they can be inspired,
  educated, and empowered to think and dream of limitless possibilities for
  their own futures. By supporting a deeper understanding of each other’s
  differences, we allow students to embrace the diversity of the global
  community that exists within Los Angeles County. OLASTEO scholars are
  accepting of the salad bowl they live in and equipped with the knowledge to
  educate their families, friends, and classmates on the stories and experiences
  of others. Please hear from our scholars Yuli
