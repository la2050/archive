title: Rainbow Labs - A Mentoring Program For LGBTQ+ Youth
project_summary: >-
  Acting on the power of mentoring, we are launching a summer pilot program
  leading to a full-fledged afterschool program for LGBTQ+ youth by January of
  2022. This summer, 50 LGBTQ+ youth will be paired with ten mentors. Youth will
  meet weekly with their peers and a mentor for formal activities such as
  utilizing their storytelling power and an accelerator program offering
  opportunities for youth to engage with LGBTQ+ professionals. Mentors will also
  build in informal one-on-one time to individual and uniquely identified
  support to their mentees.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
  - LAUSD (select only if you have a district-wide partnership or project)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  The benefits of mentoring programs are not reaching LGBTQ+ youth. MENTOR
  National, a national mentoring and capacity building organization, states for
  every 5,000 youth mentoring programs only five focus on LGBTQ+ youth. LGBTQ+
  youth face unprecedented challenges without mentors. In a 2019 report on the
  California School Climate, UCLA’s Williams Institute stated, “LGBTQ+ youth
  reported having less meaningful school participation, lower expectations from
  adults, fewer caring adult relationships at school, and a lower level of
  connection than non-LGBTQ+ youth." GLESEN’s 2019 National School Climate
  Report follows this trend saying 32.7% of LGBTQ+ students missed at least one
  entire school day in the past month because they felt uncomfortable, and over
  77% reported avoiding extracurricular activities. COVID-19 has exacerbated
  these challenges with the Trevor Project reporting in October of 2020 that 55%
  of LGBTQ+ youth feel depressed or anxious.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  In a recent report by MENTOR, findings suggest that high-quality mentoring
  relationships could reduce feelings of distress among LGBTQI-GNC youth, while
  also supporting improvements in the quality of their relationships within peer
  and family networks and reducing their susceptibility to involvement in
  problematic behavior. Grant funds will act on the intervention of mentoring.
  We will expand our summer pilot program's success to five high schools by
  January 2022. Mentors and youth will meet ten hours each week for program.
  Funding will support: -Curriculum Design: Curriculum will focus on
  storytelling and entrepreneurship. Youth will explore different ways to
  express their stories through podcasts, videos, cover letters, and college
  essays. Our second module, entrepreneurship, will focus on the elements of
  business development and forming relationships with LGBQT+ professionals.
  Youth will be given funding to support their business development idea.
  -Full-Time Program Manager: The program manager will support on-going
  programming with mentors and youth. -Youth Advisory Council: Ten youth will
  serve on our youth advisory council, where they'll provide feedback on our
  mentors and program activities. -Program Supplies & Events: We'll be hosting
  monthly mentor-mentee events. Program supplies will support mentors to reach
  their youth effectively. -Program Evaluation: A program evaluator will support
  the implementation and analysis of our surveys.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  This program is in early-stage development. The foundation of our success will
  be how our program will need to adjust from a pilot to an after-school
  program. Our goals for our program include: (1) Build positive mentor/mentee
  relationships; (2) Build positive peer relationships; and (3) Provide an
  environment for LGBTQ+ youth that is safe and inclusive. To measure these
  goals, we'll conduct a pre an post survey with youth and mentors. We
  anticipate the following outcomes: • 90% of mentees report having a positive
  relationship with their mentor at the end of the program • 90% of mentors
  report having a positive relationship with their mentee(s) at the end of the
  program • 90% of youth participants report that they enjoyed connecting to
  other young people in the queer community • 90% of youth participants report
  that the program was a safe space for them • 90% of mentors report that the
  program created a safe environment
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '100'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '150'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Mentors are life-changing, especially for LGBTQ+ youth who do not have near as
  much access to mentors as other youth. In Los Angeles, for LGBTQ+ youth,
  finding a mentoring program that aligns with their needs. Also, they battle
  the other typical program access challenges such as transportation, time, and
  cost. We envision a Los Angeles, where LGBTQ+ youth feel supported, safe, and
  empowered. No LGBTQ+ youth will face dropping out at school or feel isolated
  because of who they are. With our program, we will eliminate those challenges
  and increase access to mentoring for LGBTQ+ youth. LGBTQ+ youth will move on
  from our program graduating high school and college, forming deep
  relationships with their peers, and building the next new world-changing
  business In this grant year, we plan to reach 100 youth and engage 25 mentors
  in weekly empowering activities. Over five years, we plan to engage 1,000
  youth and 500 mentors to expand our reach to additional afterschool providers.
