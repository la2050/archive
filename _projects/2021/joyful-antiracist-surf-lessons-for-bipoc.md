title: Joyful Antiracist Surf Lessons for BIPOC
project_summary: >-
  Through free surf lessons for all BIPOC, education on surf history & culture,
  and original media content that elevates representation, Color the Water is
  committed to fighting racism, reclaiming coastal land and waters, and changing
  surf culture in Los Angeles. We are transforming surf culture from the
  aggressive, territorial way it is now into something similar to its roots -
  surf based on a love and respect for the ocean centered in sharing, community
  and compassion, while helping surfers care for and protect the ocean and each
  other.

  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Surfing has not escaped the legacy of institutionalized racism. Rooted as a
  communal and spiritual practice, surfing was received and reappropriated by
  white colonialism. The ocean and surfing have been commodified in a white led
  industry that amasses wealth, distorts origins, and centers themselves while
  disenfranchising BIPOC. The pervasive racism in surf culture has displaced
  people of color, forcing them away from the coast, from early missionary
  practices all the way to redlining and segregation. In Los Angeles, places
  like Inkwell or Bruce’s Beach continue to lack diversity, affordability, and
  accessibility. People of color are stigmatized and kept from water play by
  dangerous stereotypes such as the idea that Black people do not swim or surf,
  or notions that swimming, water polo, and surfing are white sports. The surf
  industry is one of the fastest-growing action sports industries in the world
  with a net worth of $10 billion that continues to leave BIPOC communities
  behind.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Color the Water is creating access to a truly inclusive, celebratory surf
  culture - respectful of the ocean and clearly against all forms of racism in
  and out of the water. - Provide Access and equip BIPOC with the knowledge,
  skills, and equipment needed to surf - Experience first-hand the benefits of
  ocean access and play through free surf lessons. - Celebrate and meet the
  BIPOC surf community in welcoming ways focused on equality and positivity -
  Educate the BIPOC surfer community with historical and cultural knowledge so
  they can represent themselves as BIPOC surfers fully and proudly - Explore all
  the ways to play at the ocean and the special chances the beach gives us
  people with true access. - Raise awareness on the joyful activity of riding
  waves as a community, paying respect to our ancestors, and creating a surf
  culture centered in community and conservationism. - Media representation of
  BIPOC surfers through powerful storytelling media. Everyone has a right to
  play in the ocean, especially those who have been historically denied access.
  We are creating a new coastal culture led by BIPOC waterpeople and
  contributing positivity and joy to surfing for all.

Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  If our work is successful, LA beach culture will completely transform.
  Marginalized communities will have genuine access to the ocean. Surfing will
  look more like the diverse mix of people that make LA a multicultural capital
  of the world, establishing a new paradigm centered in true inclusivity and
  coastal conservation. Media representation will also change. The journey of
  learning will be documented with style, creating a fresh narrative that
  celebrates not only our diversity and the pursuit of riding waves but the
  pursuit of social and environmental justice as well. Education will likewise
  be transformed with curriculum that includes the history of racist realities
  along the coast, the BIPOC surf pioneers who fought against them, and the
  growing movement of people who embody a culture of joyful and defiant
  anti-racism. By 2050, 10,000 BIPOC surfers will have gained autonomy in
  surfing, cementing a sense of freedom and inclusion that will change surf
  culture forever.
