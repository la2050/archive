In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - South LA
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  The Tackle Young Foundation has identified financial literacy (or the lack
  thereof) as an area of need within our elementary age children of the LAUSD
  student population. Through our team’s work, we aim to provide as many
  students as possible with the foundational knowledge necessary to achieve
  financial security and independence later in life as adults. We have
  identified this issue through observation as well as personal experience, and
  we aim to actively engage LAUSD students with our Foundation’s founder, LA Ram
  Kenny Young, through his motivational speaking and curriculum focused on
  fundamental financial information. For too long, the children of Los Angeles’
  underserved communities have grown up without any conversation focused on the
  fundamentals of financial literacy, and Kenny Young plans to engage that
  conversation.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  The TYF’s founder, LA Ram Kenny Young, has put together a plan that will be
  implemented in three phases. First, he would like to identify 5 elementary
  schools (25 students at each school) within the LAUSD that currently teach
  children from historically disadvantaged neighborhoods. Second, he would like
  to implement a one week afterschool course at each of the 5 schools, as well
  as provide each student with a hot meal before the start of each day’s lesson.
  (Kenny is a firm believer in performing on a full stomach). Lastly, he would
  like to create a follow up program intended to keep the children engaged with
  their financial goals throughout the academic school year (via a monthly
  status updates/check-ins). The curriculum will be designed in a way that is
  easily absorbed by elementary aged students, and keeps them engaged for the 11
  months to follow. The monthly status updates are designed to keep the students
  on task while also implementing basic skills related to managing a budget and
  keeping up to speed with current affairs in their local communities.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Success with this project will be measured based on our monthly status
  reports. These reports will help us gauge how students are retaining the
  information provided, as well as how they are applying the information in
  their daily lives. We believe the status reports will serve as a critical part
  of the students’ development, not only as a learning method, but also as a
  means by which we can learn to adjust our methods of teaching depending on how
  the information is being received. The TYF firmly believes in evolving with
  our students’ learning processes in order to better serve them through the
  duration of the course.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '125'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '400'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  LA County will benefit from the TYF’s work in the immediate future as well as
  several years down the road. The most immediate benefit will be numerous
  children from underserved communities being provided with an after-school hot
  meal. The students will also be engaged in conversations and lesson plans that
  will provide students with the confidence necessary to tackle various economic
  challenges in their daily lives, as well as tools for later in life as their
  economic situations continue to evolve. The TYF believes this initiative will
  help to strengthen the economic viability of Los Angeles’ underserved and
  under-resourced communities, which will prove to strengthen LA’s future as a
  global leader of innovation and economic opportunity. Our mission is to help
  these students tackle these financial issues early in their lives in order
  that they can better serve as leaders in their respective communities for
  years to come.
