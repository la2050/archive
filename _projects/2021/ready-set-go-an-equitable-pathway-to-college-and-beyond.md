title: 'Ready, Set, Go!: An Equitable Pathway to College and Beyond'
project_summary: >-
  All young people, regardless of race, ethnicity or zip code, have the right to
  a high-quality K-12 education--one that builds the skills, knowledge and
  resilience needed to complete a 4-year college and gain greater economic
  mobility. The Partnership for Los Angeles Schools College Compass program
  (high school component) prepares students through initiatives including
  college-readiness tracking and best-fit advising. With a network of
  highest-need LA Unified schools, we incubate programs intended for the broader
  impact of LA Unified adoption.

What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  College completion is the North Star that guides the Partnership’s work
  because a bachelor’s degree boosts earning power significantly, far beyond
  what a high school diploma or its equivalent can provide. Our students—and the
  majority of LA Unified’s 500,000 students—desperately need a pathway toward
  greater economic mobility: 96% of our students qualify for Free or
  Reduced-Price Meals, often used as an indicator for families living in
  poverty; 89% of students identify as Latinx and 9% as African American, and,
  as such, encounter limitations fueled by systemic racism. Another problem
  exists beyond challenges within our schools and throughout LA Unified: many
  students and families believe that college is for other people. Typically,
  this belief does not stem from an aversion to a university education. Rather,
  students see college as something unattainable, a default position often
  influenced by a lack of exposure to educational opportunities, as well as
  severe financial constraints.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  In March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic forced LA Unified to shift to distance
  learning. Despite tremendous upheaval, the Partnership was committed to the
  College Compass program, whose high school component especially helps students
  stay on track for college and view college as achievable. We continued the
  initiatives (described below) by modifying them for virtual implementation, an
  approach we applied to all our work. * Summer Melt Intervention – During the
  summer before college, many recent high school graduates lack the guidance to
  navigate tuition and financial aid hurdles, among other enrollment
  requirements. As a result, a certain percentage of students who had committed
  to enroll never make it to their college. Through the Summer Melt Initiative,
  Partnership staff directly assist our at-risk graduates to successfully
  transition to enrollment. * Best-Fit Advising – We provide our high schools’
  college counselors with tailored professional development to support students
  in applying to best-fit colleges. Such schools have high graduation rates for
  students of color and meet a high percentage of financial need. * College
  Access Partners – Our staff works with community partners to offer assistance
  with college applications, financial aid and enrollment. * On-Track-To-College
  Tool: We assist our high schools to inform families of their student’s
  personal progress in meeting objectives related to college completion;
  students develop goals in response to their progress.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Project Outcomes: * By June 2022, the percentage of eligible Partnership
  seniors accepted to a 4-year college will increase by 2 percentage points from
  the June 2021 rate as measured by Partnership school records. Our acceptance
  rate has grown from 32% (2015) to 49% (2020). * The English Language Arts
  (ELA) proficiency rate across the Partnership’s high schools will reach 60% as
  measured by the Spring 2022 Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments (SBACs).
  Between 2015 and 2019*, our high school ELA proficiency rate grew by 20
  points, from 37% to 57%, surpassing LA Unified’s 2019 rate (52%). * The math
  proficiency rate across our high schools will reach 25% as measured by the
  Spring 2022 SBACs. (2019 SBACs: 22%) Across all Partnership schools, ELA
  proficiency doubled from 19% (2015) to 38% (2019), and math rose from 14% to
  25%, both exceeding the growth of LA Unified. *The 2020 SBACs were cancelled
  statewide; as of 4/2/21, LA Unified is uncertain about conducting the 2021
  SBACs.

Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  The Partnership is uniquely qualified and positioned to drive the changes in
  our city’s public school system needed to ensure equitable access to a
  first-rate education for low-income students and students of color. These
  young people represent the majority of the District’s 500,000-student
  enrollment. Ultimately, we seek LA Unified’s adoption of our project for
  broader implementation. The Partnership directly manages 19 LA Unified schools
  that serve 14,200 students in Watts, South LA and Boyle Heights. We are not a
  charter organization, nor part of LA Unified although our network schools stay
  within neighborhood District feeder patterns. The Partnership is an
  independent nonprofit implementing innovative solutions that significantly
  improve the outcomes of our network students. Because we design our
  initiatives and programs to be sustainable at scale, our successes act as
  powerful proof points for LA Unified—the nation’s second-largest school
  system—and smaller LA County districts.
