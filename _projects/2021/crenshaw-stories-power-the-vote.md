title: Crenshaw Stories Power the Vote
project_summary: >-
  The historic heart of Black LA, Crenshaw is ground zero for the pandemic’s
  inequitable impact based on systemic disinvestment, marginalization and now,
  accelerating displacement. Crenshaw Stories Power the Vote recognizes the 2022
  election as a critical opportunity to create common purpose and demand action
  through a grassroots narrative change process led by local artists and youth.
  Vibrant art activations amplify our stories, build connection and inspire
  voter turnout for election results that drive the change we envision in our
  neighborhood.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Systemic inequality, public disinvestment and now, the threat of displacement
  and cultural erasure. The pandemic has exacerbated these issues. Crenshaw
  adjacent communities south of the 10 fwy are among the most endangered,
  ranking high or very high on the LA index of Displacement Pressure. And
  residents in this part of the city, home to a powerful, but under-resourced,
  network of youth, artists and community members, find their experiences
  mis-represented, excluded or exploited in policy-making, media, and other
  circles of power and influence. LA will be at its best when Crenshaw District
  citizens have direct, sustained and meaningful input to policy-makers, and the
  power to envision and create a thriving community. Crenshaw Stories Power the
  Vote uplifts local stories of community needs and vision, and supports an
  intergenerational network of artists and culture-bearers to create art that
  amplifies calls to organize and get out the vote, and hold public leadership
  to account.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Crenshaw Stories Power the Vote taps the potency of sharing stories to
  increase civic engagement and voting among residents. Through three phases -
  Storygathering, Creation: Art as Call to Action and Art Advocacy - we build
  creative and civic participation, increasing volunteerism, awareness and voter
  turnout in the June 2022 primary. Phase I: Story Gathering Youth and artists
  lead story circles, finding in histories and hopes, inspiration for art
  activations to amplify local narratives. The sharing of personal and community
  stories transformed into murals, performance and public festivals enhances for
  all connection, purpose, and hope about the future. Young people draw people
  in, making them feel welcome and ready to engage. Phase II: Creation: Art as a
  Call to Action The stories seed public artworks, activations, festivals and
  digital media that uplift the issues and spark the advocacy necessary to truly
  transform the Crenshaw District. By making voices often ignored visible, we
  enable local priorities to be heard ensuring real attention to address the
  issues raised. The art will be strategically placed in highly visible
  locations i.e. Crenshaw and Slauson, the People’s Street in Leimert Park, in
  addition to leveraging the power of social media. Phase III: Art Advocacy In
  this phase, we move from storytelling to joint advocacy and action, uplifting
  narratives as part of a platform for change, supporting policies that advance
  our shared vision for Crenshaw residents.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Crenshaw Stories Power the Vote impacts three Connect metrics: public art and
  cultural events, social and emotional support, and voting rates. At the
  project’s core are neighbors sharing stories facilitated by youth, artist and
  community partner teams, increasing connections through listening and being
  listened to. Success will look like a growing intergenerational network of
  youth, artists and culture-bearers with increased feeling of belonging,
  connection and mutual support. The stories will be transformed into 20 locally
  led accessible workshops or events engaging 10-2000 people each - pop-up and
  semi-permanent public art and performance - DJ set in a parking lot, a mural,
  African Diasporic dance, drum and mask-making workshops - to enhance
  participation and multiply opportunities for people to connect. Finally, and
  most importantly, the project increases voter participation as story gathering
  and art activations result in a high impact call to action that ends at the
  ballot box.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '5000'

Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Our goal is to use art and cultural programs as a vehicle for connecting Los
  Angeles residents more deeply to their neighborhoods and the larger city. “The
  arts and humanities can broaden citizens’ voices and participation, offering a
  welcoming entry point to those who have not felt access to the civic realm
  before.” Civic Dialogue Arts and Culture: Findings from Animating Democracy
  (Americans for the Arts). Residents who participate in Crenshaw Stories Power
  the Vote will be empowered through recognition of the value of their stories,
  their neighbors’ stories, and those of the neighborhood as a whole. We want to
  dismantle past barriers keeping them and other low-income communities of color
  from our seats at the table. We will invest in the long-term capacity of our
  community to use deep wells of local art and cultural resources as a basis for
  exerting greater influence over local policy making processes to achieve a
  more equitable city for all.
