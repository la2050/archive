  Facing Extinction: Connecting Angelenos with resources to coexist with LA
  Cougars
project_summary: >-
  At the Cougar Conservancy, our mission to reduce human-wildlife conflict and
  conserve cougar populations through science-based management and conservation.
  Our work seeks to connect the people of Los Angeles to conservation issues
  existing in their neighborhoods while protecting imperiled cougar populations
  from extinction.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - San Gabriel Valley
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South LA
  - Westside
  - South Bay
  - Antelope Valley
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Los Angeles is one of the last megacities left in the world that has a
  remaining large cat population, yet cougars in Southern California are facing
  an “extinction vortex” driven by genetic isolation due to habitat loss and
  fragmentation caused by roads and development. Hundreds of cougars a year are
  lost statewide to human-caused mortalities including vehicle strikes,
  rodenticide poisoning, and depredation despite warnings from scientists about
  the potential loss of cougar populations in this region within 50 years if
  nothing is done to improve their habitat and public perception. Our mission is
  to connect Angelinos with resources they need to coexist with wildlife and
  ensure cougars have a future in LA. Angelinos love cougars and show their
  appreciation for wildlife annually when we celebrate P-22 Day to honor the
  iconic cougar of Griffith Park. People have coexisted with cougars for the
  last 40,000 years and this relationship has been critical for ecological and
  cultural integrity.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  The Cougar Conservancy will work to promote human-wildlife coexistence by
  connecting 15,000 LA residents to ecologically sound, geographically specific,
  and culturally sensitive educational programming. We seek funding to achieve
  the following outcomes during the 1-year project period: -Recruit and train
  100 volunteers to connect their family, friends, and neighbors to our
  coexistence resources. Research has shown that human-wildlife conflicts can be
  prevented or resolved by providing communities with sound information
  delivered by community members. -Provide educational programming virtually and
  in-person (COVID limitations) to more than 8,000 people on coexisting with our
  wild neighbors. We will develop both youth and bilingual (Spanish) outreach
  programs and organize monthly events. We will hold demonstrations on how to
  build secure enclosures in 4 separate locations in communities along the
  urban-wildland interface within LA County. -Respond to reports and mitigate
  conflict with our Conflict Task Force as needed. Less depredation permits will
  be issued when our science-based consultations help reduce the number of
  depredated pets and livestock. -Create a video series to increase public
  participation in wildlife decision-making. This media project will increase
  general understanding of the process, relay the importance of public
  participation, and encourage the building of diverse coalitions of
  participants to ensure decisions affecting wildlife are made equitably.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  The Cougar Conservancy will evaluate the performance of our programs using
  both qualitative and quantitative methods: a) Qualitative evaluation tools:
  Testimonials from program participants Pre and Post event surveys Increased
  understanding and participation in public policy Increased tolerance of
  predators and connection to nature in and beyond LA b) Quantitative evaluation
  tools: Number of volunteers participating in trainings Number of people
  reached through our Conflict Task Force, including the Number of Conflict
  Visits Number of cougar-proof enclosures built Number of residents reached
  through canvassing (COVID limitations) Number of messages received by the
  Conflict Hotline (phone and email) Number of Angelinos reached through
  community events (in-person and virtual) Number of students engaged in Youth
  programs (in-person and virtual) Number of people reached through the Public
  Participation Video Series Number of people engaged online using the hashtag
  #CoexistWithCougars
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '13000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '2000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Our programs intend to reduce the number of pet and livestock fatalities from
  depredation. We are committed to ensuring that the communities living and
  recreating in LA feel empowered with the tools they need to coexist with
  wildlife. Dispelling misconceptions can improve public relations with
  predators and the outdoors in general and thus strengthen Angelinos’
  connections to nature in their neighborhoods. Fewer conflict complaints and
  depredation incidents would support the recovery of cougar populations most
  at-risk of extinction in the short term. In the long term, we hope to identify
  novel tools to prevent future conflicts and establish lasting changes within
  state and local budgets that allocate resources to researching and managing
  human-wildlife interactions. Our programs targeting LA youth and Spanish
  speakers specifically are designed to support more diverse participation in
  outdoor recreation and decision-making processes occurring at neighborhood,
  local, and state levels.
