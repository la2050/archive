  Leveling the Playing Field for Black Youth, Girls, and Teens through Dodgers
  RBI
project_summary: >-
  Through Dodgers RBI, LADF levels the playing field for low-income communities
  and those experiencing social injustices by making baseball/softball more
  accessible to racial/ethnic minority youth, refurbishing dilapidated fields in
  underserved areas, and delivering health, educational, racial equity and
  leadership development resources to promote healing for Los Angeles’ most
  vulnerable youth. Black youth, girls, and teens are significantly
  underrepresented in sports, and why we focus on recruiting these groups to
  participate in Dodgers RBI.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  According to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 62% of youth living in
  poverty have experienced at least one Adverse Childhood Experience (ACEs),
  which significantly impact a child’s development and social-emotional
  functioning. Studies also show poverty disproportionately affects
  racial/ethnic minority youth, making it a social and racial justice issue. The
  impact of poverty is great, leading to diminished health and decreased
  readiness to learn and graduate from high school for Black and Brown youth,
  which only grows more severe, as the low-income communities where they live
  are exposed to traumatic experiences associated with poor housing, food and
  income insecurity, limited resources, inadequate schools, and high crime and
  violence. The COVID-19 pandemic compounded these effects while illuminating
  the social disparities and systemic oppressions plaguing Black and Brown, and
  low-income communities, which further demonstrates the need for racial equity
  and social justice support.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  LADF works closely with Parks and Recreation departments and non-profit
  organizations to make baseball/softball more accessible to racial/ethnic
  minority youth and to recruit Black youth, girls, and teens to participate in
  Dodgers RBI. Once in the program, these groups gain access to resources that
  promote healthier life outcomes, including college tours and workshops, STEM
  education, racial equity curriculum, mental wellness support, health, dental
  and vision screenings, free glasses, fitness and nutrition clinics, and more.
  Coaches and parents/caregivers are incredible resources to promote a child's
  healthy development, which is why we offer coaches training and parent
  workshops centered around trauma-informed approaches in Dodgers RBI. Here,
  coaches, parents and caregivers receive training on how to create
  intergenerational, healing environments where youth can grow social-emotional
  learning (SEL) attributes, such as positive identity, discipline, and
  pro-social connections. Seeing racial equity, social justice support, and
  leadership development as critical needs of the youth we serve, Dodgers RBI
  also provides RISE leadership workshops for youth, coaches, and parents to
  empower them to be community leaders. RISE leadership workshops cover
  Identity, Diversity Concepts, Perspective Taking, Privilege, Sports as a
  Vehicle for Change, Civic Engagement, Leadership, and Goal Setting, and will
  help Black youth, girls, and teens in Dodgers RBI grow in critical areas of
  life.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  To measure success of Dodgers RBI on the social-emotional development of
  youth, we use pre/post-program and workshop surveys, demographic data
  collection, focus groups with youth, parents/guardians and coaches, and
  interviews with Dodgers RBI partners. LADF’s Manager of Strategy & Impact
  oversees data collection and analyzes assessments at the start and end of the
  Dodgers RBI program to determine youth’s physical and social-emotional
  development through sport. Evaluation from 2019 found 77% of Dodgers RBI
  players ages 5-8 reported an increase or maximum feeling of safety at the park
  and 73% reported an increase or maximum feeling of Self-Confidence. Using the
  Hello Insight Tool by Algorhythm, LADF also found 97% of Dodgers RBI players
  ages 9-18 succeeded in social-emotional learning development, gaining in at
  least one SEL capacity, and nearly two-thirds (65%) developed in 3 or more SEL
  capacities, like social connections, academic self-efficacy, and
  self-management, to name a few.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '7000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '4490'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  According to a recent survey by Hello Insight and Laureus USA, sports-based
  youth development (SBYD) programs, like Dodgers RBI, are highly important for
  youth development, as they play a significant role in growing the social,
  emotional learning (SEL) skills of youth. This study found a particularly
  strong impact between SBYD and SEL among young men of color and youth in
  under-resourced communities, making it clear that Dodgers RBI is more
  important now than ever. Research shows strong SEL skills give youth the
  ability to manage themselves, as they engage with the world, build and
  maintain relationships, and face challenges. Strong SEL skills are necessary
  to be successful in school, career and life. This is why we are committed to
  ensure sports and SEL opportunities are made accessible to low-income youth
  through Dodgers RBI, so they are not only healthier in the short-term, but
  also more confident, equipped and successful to achieve their dreams in the
  long-term.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  Up2Us Sports, Positive Coaching Alliance, and We Coach will provide
  parents/caregivers, coaches, and volunteers with coaches training that
  includes trauma-informed approaches and positive youth development strategies,
  so adults involved in the program are equipped to offer powerful support to
  Dodgers RBI players. Through RISE, Dodgers RBI participants will participate
  in a multi-week leadership program to be leaders in addressing racism and
  improving race relations. The program will cover how to break barriers, build
  trust and create pathways for positive communication. RISE will also help
  facilitate parent workshops, to discuss the power of sport to improve
  diversity, equity, and inclusion and to create positive change in the areas of
  race and equality.
