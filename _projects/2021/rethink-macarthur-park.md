  In order to begin changing the narrative of housing-insecure individuals and
  lack of neighborhood safety at MacArthur Park, Integrated Recovery Network

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  MacArthur Park became known for violence after 1985 when prostitution, drug
  dealing, shootings, and the occasional rumored drowning became commonplace. As
  the park's reputation deteriorated, so to did the facilities. Over time,
  MacArthur Park has become a hub for the homeless. To many Angelinos, homeless
  people are scary and tent encampments a threat. It is this seemingly city-wide
  sentiment that pushes city officials to invest in enforcement-based approaches
  when addressing homelessness. According to the Los Angeles Homeless Services
  Authority (LAHSA): “Fines and citations, encampment clearings and other
  municipal practices and policies that disrupt and displace people create
  additional barriers and setbacks for people experiencing homelessness, making
  it more likely that people will remain homeless even longer.” With the recent
  crackdown in Echo Park, it is clear that we as a city need to take a more
  compassionate initiative with our housing insecure Angelinos and with our
  parks.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  In order to begin changing the perspective of MacArthur Park, Integrated
  Recovery Network proposes the Rethink MacArthur Park Initiative which will
  employ the housing insecure individuals who reside there and the neighboring
  area to provide supplemental maintenance to the park while providing
  supplemental income and job history to some of the city's most vulnerable
  Angelinos. The supplemental maintenance services will include: supplemental
  trash removal, litter abatement, graffiti removal, and pressure washing
  services. “A disorderly space with garbage gives the impression that people
  are not taking care of that place,” explains John Morton, World Bank
  environmental expert. "Therefore, if a neighborhood tolerates disorder,
  whether that means throwing trash on the ground or dirty streets, it could –
  hypothetically – produce an environment more conducive to crime... It is a
  symptom and also part of the cause.” In 2015 at Central Villa, Jamaica; a
  neighborhood with high crime and unemployment rates; the Jamaica Social
  Investment Fund cleaned streets to recover public spaces. Not only was the
  area cleaner but the project also helped mobilize the community, which led
  residents to propose new initiatives, such as the promotion of recycling,
  skills-development, and family support programs; which address a variety of
  risk factors that contribute to crime, violence and homelessness. Cleaning up
  won't fix all of the problems, but it can be the start.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  The Rethink MacArthur Park Initiative is a proposed pilot program that will
  use surveys and visual data to track and measure it's success. Firstly,
  Integrated Recovery Network will regularly photograph the area of MacArthur
  Park every 2 weeks for the duration of the program term as part of its'
  community outreach efforts. As the Park Maintenance team cleans up the park
  and the community grows accustomed to their presence, we expect that the
  community will reciprocate our efforts and this will be visible to all.
  Additionally, every 3 months Integrated Recovery Network will conduct street
  outreach in order to conduct surveys on the local community. This survey will
  measure - among other things - Park Safety, Park Cleanliness and Community
  Perception.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '100'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '100000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  It is the vision of the Integrated Recovery Network that the Rethink MacArthur
  Park Initiative can be one of the catalysts which will spark a new generation
  of Angelinos primed for change. If one of the most densely populated areas in
  the nation, once considered a cautionary tale for Los Angeles, can become a
  beacon of change and return to its former glory, then we can prove to our
  elected officials and Los Angeles residents, that community based approaches
  and social enterprise can and do produce results; that the residents of
  MacArthur Park care for the park and that Los Angeles cares for the people who
  reside there.
