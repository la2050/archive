title: Free Clinical Training for Psyhotherapists of Color
project_summary: >-
  Psychotherapists of color (PsyOC) have been historically, and are presently
  underrepresented in the fields of psychology and social work. This
  underrepresentation means there are not enough PsyOC to fulfill the mental
  health needs of clients of color. PsyOC also tend to have less post-graduate
  clinical training than their white counterparts. This is where LOVS steps in.
  LOVS will create a pilot program that provides free, trauma-focused clinical
  training to associate and licensed PsyOC, as well as practicum students.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Research reveals that racial minorities experience mental health issues at the
  same rate as whites, but they access mental health therapy at a much lower
  rate. Barriers to treatment, such as distrust in the mental health system in
  the US and scarcity of same-race therapists, are attributed to this disparity.
  The National Association of Black Social Workers support this notion, finding
  that Black/African Americans experience better treatment outcomes when paired
  with PsyOC. The problem of access to same-race therapists can be credited to
  the lack of trauma-focused trained PsyOC. In our recent hiring process at LOVS
  we received 100+ applicants but only 10 were PsyOC. Of those PsyOC, only 1 had
  post-graduate clinical training. On paper, white applicants often have more
  clinical training and are frequently chosen for jobs over PsyOC with little or
  no post-graduate training. This leads to less PsyOC in the field. This is the
  problem we seek to address by clinically training PsyOC.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  The problem identified in question 7 is directly related to the fact that
  these training interventions are expensive, and in fact are often cost
  prohibitive to new PsyOC. This cost as is illustrated in the budget section of
  this application. Having the worry of cost eliminated, we will be able to
  produce trauma-trained PsyOC. The pilot program LOVS is proposing is quite
  innovative and quite simple in nature. We want to train 16 PsyOC in at least 3
  different mental health treatment interventions. The three that we have chosen
  are Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), Trauma-Focused CBT (TF-CBT), and Eye
  Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR). The reason we have chosen
  these 3 interventions is because they are centered around treating trauma. At
  LOVS, we are trauma-informed and provide therapy through a trauma-focused lens
  and these three interventions are the top trainings as it pertains to trauma
  treatment. We believe that we can not only successfully provide this training,
  but we can continue the training for years to come utilizing the expertise and
  partnering with those who became certified in the year of the grant and
  thereafter. What is unique about our program is that we will provide this
  training for free, and require participants to give back to the community by
  volunteering at LOVS throughout the year and once certified in the above
  interventions, agree to provide one training to our next year’s round of
  PsyOC.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  This is a simple part of the application for us to write. We will measure
  success by the amount of PsyOC that will receive and complete training through
  LOVS. If all 16 PsyOC that are chosen to participate in this pilot program
  complete all 3 trainings, then we'll have 100% success. All trainings will
  occur virtually. We have reached out to trainers from each of the 3
  interventions and found out what they charge, which you'll see in the budget
  section of this application. It's our hope that we may be able to work out a
  deal with these trainers since we will have so many PsyOC being trained.If we
  are able to provide these trainings at a lower cost, then we will be able to
  increase the amount of PsyOC trained, which would give us over 100% success.
  We will also be able to measure the success of the pilot program for years to
  come because we know that the PsyOC trained will be able to fill the void
  allowing more clients of color to be seen by PsyOC. It's the gift that keeps
  on giving.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '16'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1200'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  LA County will be better when our work is successful because during the grant
  year we will provide training to 16 PsyOC. Without this training, many PsyOC
  candidates might be looked over for employment, but by receiving the training
  they will be much more competitive in the job market. The impact of training
  16 PsyOC goes beyond the knowledge and experience gained by the PsyOC. Clients
  of color often prefer to be seen by a PsyOC, but there is a shortage of PsyOC
  in LA County. By training these 16 PsyOC, we are increasing the amount of
  PsyOC, thus allowing for more clients of color to be seen by someone that
  looks like them. The benefits of this grant will not end with the completion
  of this grant. We propose that once our 16 PsyOC are certified in the
  interventions, in years to come they will be committed to doing at least one
  training for free to future candidates of the program. We believe that what we
  invest with these 16 therapist will sustain the program for many years to
  come.
