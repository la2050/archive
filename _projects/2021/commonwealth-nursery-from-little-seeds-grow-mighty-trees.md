title: 'Commonwealth Nursery: From Little Seeds Grow Mighty Trees'
project_summary: >-
  Commonwealth Nursery is a public private partnership to grow climate and
  community resilience in Los Angeles. Located on a historic 11 acre site in
  Griffith Park, the nursery serves as an urban ecological laboratory and
  training grounds to support LA’s tree canopy equity goals, creating a more
  livable and resilient city for all Angelenos. Commonwealth is a catalyst to
  grow trees from locally-sourced seed, train the next generation of urban
  forest stewards, and grow the green jobs of the future.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  With the rising threat of climate change, urban tree canopy equity in Los
  Angeles is more vital than ever. Due to inequitable distribution of green
  development in historically redlined districts of the city, wealthier LA
  neighborhoods enjoy vastly larger urban forests and their benefits, from shade
  cover and urban heat island reduction to improved air quality and mental
  health outcomes—an average differential of 37% canopy cover in affluent areas
  to 15% in formerly redlined neighborhoods. Procurement of quality native and
  climate-ready tree stock with which to remedy this inequity has been an
  ongoing issue. Additionally, the need for horticultural education and
  workforce development training around tree propagation, tree maintenance, and
  tree care is vital to the health of LA’s existing canopy and the efficacy of
  new city tree planting initiatives. These challenges point to a need for
  deeper integration of ecological restoration and climate resilience into city
  urban forestry programs.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Through our collaborative work at the Commonwealth Nursery, City Plants seeks
  to grow community resilience, biodiversity, and tree canopy equity across LA.
  Funds will expand nursery infrastructure to grow more climate-ready trees to
  distribute to Angelenos via City Plants’ and LADWP’s Free Trees Program, with
  priority to low canopy neighborhoods. Through regional seed collection and
  propagation of target species, our team will supply locally-grown plant
  material to public green infrastructure and ecological restoration projects.
  Trees grown from locally-sourced seed have been shown to be more adaptive to
  local conditions, just as our urban forest is most resilient when stewarded by
  local communities themselves. That’s why we’re partnering with the LA
  Conservation Corps to create a Green Workforce Development Program for at-risk
  young adults, alongside Recreation and Parks staff, to learn about tree and
  plant propagation for a climate-ready future; tree, plant, and green
  infrastructure installation, maintenance and monitoring; and nursery and
  arboriculture best management practices. Our goal is to train the next
  generation of urban forest stewards and grow the green jobs of the future.
  Given the central location and rich history of the Griffith Park nursery site
  and the diverse skills and expertise of our collaborative partners, our
  project is uniquely positioned to realize these goals. Together, we will
  cross-pollinate to transform LA into a more vibrant and equitable city.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Our outcome monitoring process for this project will be twofold. First, we
  will maintain detailed records and data on the number of trees grown, names of
  species, locations and dates of seeds collected, number of saplings propagated
  and success rates of different propagation methods used (i.e., from purchased
  vs. locally-collected seed, from cuttings, etc.), number of free trees
  distributed to Angelenos, as well as the survival rate and overall health of
  our nursery specimens. Second, we will conduct an in-depth evaluation of our
  Green Workforce Development Program, using both qualitative feedback and
  quantitative indicators from our youth participants directly as well as from
  community partners engaged with the yearlong training program. City Plants
  will continue our outcome tracking and public feedback process for our Free
  Trees program, as well as documenting the number of volunteers participating
  in nursery-related events.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '15000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '45000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  The Commonwealth Nursery will serve as an example for how public private
  partnerships can transform LA into a more livable city. In 2022, the Nursery
  will have expanded to 17,220 sq ft onsite, building upon current
  infrastructure with additional tables, a site-wide irrigation system, seed
  storage fridge and propagation station. We aim to create a tree seed
  collection bank of 10-15 species and propagate 4,500 saplings, doubling our
  existing stock. City Plants will hire a consultant to create a Green Workforce
  Development Program to train an initial team of six LA Conservation Corps
  members in nursery, arboriculture, propagation, and seed stewardship, and
  young adults will emerge with equipped with expertise. Working directly with
  native tree seed will allow young adults to learn the process of propagation
  while creating a more equitable and resilient urban forest for all. Training
  young adults alongside Dept of Recreation and Parks staff will facilitate a
  nonprofit to city job pipeline.
