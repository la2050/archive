title: MentorDash
project_summary: >-
  We are building a technology dashboard that will connect S.T.E.A.M. mentors
  from the industry to LAUSD high school classrooms in order to provide teachers
  with co-curricular and extra-curricular support in the science, technology,
  engineering, arts, and math departments. The purpose of our dashboard is to
  increase class enrollment and class engagement within high school CTE (Career
  Technical Education) classes and participation in afterschool activities
  related to S.T.E.A.M.

project_video: ''
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - LAUSD (select only if you have a district-wide partnership or project)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Applying a proven model or solution to a new issue or sector (e.g., using a
  job recruiting software or strategy to match clients to supportive housing
  sites, applying demonstrated strategies from advocating for college
  affordability to advocating for housing affordability and homelessness, etc.)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  After engaging in programs with LAUSD teachers & administrators since the
  shutdown started in March 2020, we have assessed that LAUSD has the following
  problems: (1) The old classroom model of education is broken. (2) Teachers are
  not able to transition smoothly between in-person and virtual instruction on
  their own. (3) Schools are struggling to obtain the human capital needed to
  keep students engaged and enrolled as LAUSD returns to normal instruction (4)
  Teachers in the science, technology, engineering, arts, and math departments
  are under-resourced for both the virtual and hybrid class model. (5) CTE
  departments are understaffed.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Grant funds will be used to: (1) complete any additional technical development
  of MentorDash (2) hire a full-time Program Manager to coordinate the launch of
  our first cohort of 25 LAUSD high schools (500 students per school) in August
  2021 and then manage the subsequent cohorts. Together, Hacker Fund and Road to
  Artdom operate the largest nonprofit network of S.T.E.M. mentors in the United
  States. Our new mentorship dashboard will allow the volunteers from our
  network to provide office-hours, workshops, bootcamps, and career fairs for
  students virtually under the supervision of their teachers.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Since LAUSD first shutdown in March in 2020, we have piloted several virtual
  engagements including bootcamps, workshops, and office hours in partnership
  with Compton Unified School District. We saw an increase in students
  participation in S.T.E.A.M. classes. We have decided to operate all of our
  virtual engagement through MentorDash so that we can track student engagement
  and performance. We will be measuring impact via the following metrics: (1)
  number of students enrolled in S.T.E.A.M. classes after introduction of
  MentorDash on campus; success: increase (2) NPS of students enrolled in
  S.T.E.A.M. classes that use MentorDash: success: positive NPS (3) number of
  students that complete modules on MentorDash: success: 50% of students (4)
  teacher satisfaction ratings of classroom environment; success: increase in
  positive satisfaction ratings (5) student proficiency in S.T.E.A.M. subject;
  success: students pass S.T.E.A.M. related classes
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '112500'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': ''
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  If our work is successful, we will see the following: (1) student enrollment
  in science, technology, engineering, arts, and math classes throughout LAUSD
  schools will increase. (2) CTE class participation and class project
  completion rates will increase. (3) positive satisfaction ratings with CTE
  classes among students in the virtual and hybrid instruction model will
  increase. (4) student enrollment in S.T.E.A.M. related afterschool programs
  will increase. (5) reports of S.T.E.A.M. teacher burnout in LAUSD will
  decrease. (6) LAUSD will be better-prepared to offer the hybrid education
  model to its students.

  Road to Artdom will make its art curriculum and network of mentors (designers,
  artists, and other creatives) available on MentorDash.
Which of LA2050â€™s resources will be of the most value to you?: >-
