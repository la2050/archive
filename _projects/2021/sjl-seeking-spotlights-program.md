title: SJL Seeking Spotlights Program
project_summary: >-
  LA’s bright stars inspire Hollywood dreams in kids all across the globe. Yet,
  given limited resources and opportunity, LA's underserved communities are
  often left in the dark. SJL's Seeking Spotlights Program aims to help at-risk
  LA youth explore opportunities, discover passions, and align career paths in
  music and entertainment. Equipped with outlets, skills, tools, and
  connections, each student will be uniquely positioned for success. SJL's
  innovative approach unlocks talent by building a stage for LA youth to create
  their own spotlight.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - South LA
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Across LA’s underserved neighborhoods, children growing up in poverty are
  often exposed to extreme adversity, stress, and danger, causing early
  disadvantages compared to more privileged peers. Struggling to catch up or
  keep up, dropout rates rise and opportunities for further education and paid
  work decline. In addition, minority youth fall victim to systemic inequality,
  prejudice, and discrimination. Facing an unrelenting environment, unforgiving
  system, and unaccepting society, art and music offer at-risk youth rare and
  powerful outlets for creating positive change. These industries offer a
  variety of career options and provide tools for self-exploration and
  expression. Studies show that kids engaged in the arts are more likely to stay
  in school, report higher grades, be civically engaged, and overall achieve
  more. SJL’s art and music programs will empower at-risk youth with tools for
  creating their identity, on platforms to amplify local talent contributing to
  LA’s creative culture.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Corporate, industry professional (instructors & mentors), artist/entertainer
  stakeholder alignment, planning and mobilization identify 50 - 60 kids who
  have a passion for subjects such as photography, graphic design, producing,
  etc. We will co-create targeted art skills and career programs aligning
  interests and connecting youth across our non-profit partners through classes,
  activities, virtual career showcases, and live art shows. Bringing in our
  social impact network, our content will be critically curated and engaging.
  Great care will be taken in our research, selection, and preparation stage.
  Once finalized, spanning over 3 months, the kids will attend virtual group
  classes once a week. Between classes there will be additional activities. Each
  course will include a final art project, where SJL will host both in-person LA
  art showcases and amplify young talent via virtual platforms and social media.
  At the end of the program, if completed, the youth will have one of two
  options: be paid for their time or continue forward in the program, keeping
  the tools we’ve provided for them and seeking employment, internships, or
  formal education within the industry. If they choose to continue, we will
  support them through access to our network, their mentors, and industry
  professionals. All attendees will be given a chance to publicize their work
  and use our website to sell, showcase, or market to a global network of buyers
  and supporters.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Having already achieved this program’s success on an individual level, SJL is
  prepared to implement this on a grander scale. With a network consisting of
  the world’s leading music company, industry professionals, youth
  organizations, corporate sponsors, and high-profile artists, musicians, and
  entertainers, the foundation has already been built.  By utilizing beginning
  and end of program surveys among the kids, youth organizations, and industry
  mentors, we will constantly be on the pulse of how the program is doing,
  adjusting as needed. Success will be achieved by: number of signups; number of
  graduates who choose to continue; number of 17/18 year old’s who obtain
  internships or jobs, start their own business, or sell their work; engagement
  of additional corporate sponsors; engagement from industry experts involved in
  the program; and press and media reach. As we see all these numbers grow,
  surveys returned positively, and students thriving, success will be achieved.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '100'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  In everything SJL does, we aim to create a culture of impact. Exposing youth
  to arts, music, and entertainment on a personal level has potential to turn
  dreams into reality and create long-term, tangible impact. The resources,
  support, and the skill set they’ll be given will open countless doors, both in
  the form of careers and cultural influence. Connections formed with industry
  experts, mentors, and fellow attendees builds a positive support system. Given
  an outlet to express themselves, they will add diversity not only to the
  industry itself, but to the world around them. The work they create will
  bridge cultural differences. A path to economic and financial success will be
  forged. By showcasing these industries to the kids, we are showcasing their
  talent on a global stage, changing the narrative that has been written of low
  income youth. The fastest way to change lives is to change minds.
