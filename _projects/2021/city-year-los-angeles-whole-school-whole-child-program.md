title: City Year Los Angeles Whole School Whole Child Program
project_summary: >-
  City Year believes all children can succeed. Every day, our AmeriCorps members
  serve as student success coaches, helping students build on their strengths
  and cultivate social, emotional and academic skills - from mastering fractions
  to learning to work in teams. City Year partners with schools in
  under-resourced communities to create learning environments where all students
  have the tools to grow and fully engage in their education.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - South LA
  - 'Other:: Inglewood'
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Students in the communities we serve often don’t have access to educational
  opportunities and tend to face systemic obstacles that can further drain their
  capacity to learn. Students in these circumstances graduate high school at
  rates that are nearly 22 percentage points lower than their middle- and
  upper-income peers. This inequity is due in part to a lack of access to
  educational opportunities and individualized supports that are designed to
  meet the intensity of student need. Current school closures and distance
  learning undoubtedly create more barriers that can compromise students’
  academic and life outcomes. According to the NWEA, students will likely see
  learning loss similar to that of other disruptive crises or to the “summer
  slide” crises. This learning loss is likely to be exacerbated by the
  additional aspects of trauma students are experiencing, particularly the
  students we serve who come from households impacted the most economically.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  As Los Angeles and Inglewood Unified Schools Districts operate via remote
  virtual learning, our AmeriCorps members continue to serve as student success
  coaches in a virtual capacity. We focus on the three types of interventions
  known as “Early Warning Indicators” of being off-track from graduation for
  students – attendance, behavior, and course performance. We have pivoted our
  service to adapt to the ever-changing needs of our schools and students. City
  Year Los Angeles has developed a variety of options to implement our course
  performance and social-emotional development interventions virtually or in a
  hybrid remote/in-person capacity, when the time comes. Our AmeriCorps members
  lead breakout rooms to review specific academic concepts with small groups of
  students, call home to promote attendance or assist with technological issues,
  host virtual afterschool spaces where they can help with homework and class
  material, set goals with students around social-emotional competencies, and
  perform regular check-ins with students to monitor their growth in those
  areas, among a myriad of other supports. AmeriCorps members’ invaluable
  presence in virtual classrooms will help to mitigate learning loss. This grant
  award will help us maintain a strong cohort of AmeriCorps members who work
  hard to decrease the potentially widening skill gaps of our students, help
  create differentiation in the virtual and in person environments, and to
  assist teachers in virtual settings.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  We will continue to evaluate our impact via qualitative feedback from our
  partner schools. We elicit this feedback from our partner teachers and
  principals regarding our impact on students via mid-year and end of year
  surveys. Through the surveys, teachers and principals can assess their
  satisfaction with City Year and evaluate the impact of our service on students
  and school culture. This year, we have our highest ever approval ratings from
  our partner teachers! 95% believe that CYLA AmeriCorps members are having a
  positive impact with students. During a typical school year, we would measure
  our academic impact by using the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (HMH) Inventory
  exams and the Deveraux Student Strengths Assessment (DESSA) to measure
  students’ academic and social-emotional development. This year, we will not
  administer the HMH inventory or DESSA, as those tests have not been built for
  the virtual space and as AmeriCorps members must be physically present when
  the tests are taken.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '13000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '25000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  If our work is successful, our students will be better equipped academically
  and social-emotionally to return to in-person learning. Prior to the pandemic,
  City Year was the subject of a study with the Everyone Graduates Center at
  Johns Hopkins University to explore whether there is a connection between
  social-emotional and academic outcomes and understand whether there is a
  correlation between time with an AmeriCorps member (ACM) and student outcomes.
  The study found a strong connection between social-emotional development and
  academic outcomes. According to the study, improving in just one area of
  social-emotional development is equivalent to gaining a year of schooling.
  This analysis validated City Year’s holistic approach by revealing that we
  support improvements in academic outcomes through the direct effect of English
  Language Arts or math tutoring time with an ACM, and through social-emotional
  support from an ACM, which correlated with stronger academic outcomes.
