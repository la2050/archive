title: POPS the Club POPScast
project_summary: >-
  POPScast is a podcast made by and for teens to explore and discuss the
  realities of ways the criminal justice system impacts their lives. Teen hosts
  explore this impact through discussion, expert interviews, call-ins, calls to
  action and poetry, spoken word, visual arts, and music. Focused on a slice of
  life approach, POPScast will explore a different theme each week and like POPS
  the Club, celebrates and honors teens’ voices, visions and ideas and creates a
  community of learning and support.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Mass incarceration affects not just those convicted of crimes, but also their
  loved ones who experience the loss as a “shared sentence.” Stigma and trauma
  are part of the fabric of the lives of more than 1 in 14 children in America
  who endure this trauma, and in Los Angeles, estimates suggest that up to 25%
  of youth in economically vulnerable neighborhoods have a parent or caregiver
  in jail or prison. POPS the Club provides support to these youth so that they
  can effectively address and move past mental and emotional challenges they
  experience as a result of this experience. Through the use of trauma-informed,
  arts-based programs, POPS creates a safe, empowering space for these teens in
  their schools, transforming stigma and shame into hope and dignity so they can
  thrive academically, socially, and emotionally, now and as adults. But not all
  schools have a POPS club, and POPScast is designed for teens who don’t have
  such a space in their lives.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Guided by professional podcast producers, POPS is developing a podcast. Ten
  Los Angeles-based grads of the POPS the Club program, will be trained and will
  work under the guidance of a professional producer to develop a first season
  that explores teens’ experiences with the criminal justice system. Programming
  is modeled on POPS the Club meetings (combining mindfulness, art, mentors and
  conversation) and on Ear Hustle (a podcast about the realities of prisoners’
  lives, before and after release, shared by those living it). The podcast will
  feature discussion of topics about how the criminal justice system touches LA
  teens’ lives, offering opportunities for artistic expression, authentic open
  discussion, and interviews with role models like Earlonne Woods, co-creator of
  Ear Hustle; Oscar-nominated comedians and social activists, the Lucas
  Brothers; and writer and podcaster Ashley C. Ford. During the grant period, we
  will develop, market and launch Season One (eight episodes), evaluate its
  success, and begin production for season two. The goals of this project
  include 1) Deepening teens’ understanding of and opportunities to share their
  experiences with the criminal justice system; 2) Building connection with
  other youth and learning about each others’ experiences; and 3) Creating
  awareness for the general public around the challenges these youth face as a
  result of family incarceration and other impacts of the criminal justice on
  teens’ lives.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Success for POPScast would be the project’s capacity to fulfill its goals
  outlined in question 8. As an early-stage project, POPS is currently exploring
  the most efficient and accurate ways to measure quantitative impact. POPS
  anticipates it will determine POPScast’s direct impact/success by Number of
  listeners/downloads; POPScast reviews; POPScast subscribers; Increase in POPS’
  website traffic; Repurposing of POPScast content; and Future sponsorship
  support. Measuring indirect impact, which would include the awareness of the
  general public about the negative impact having a justice-involved loved one
  can create in the lives of children, is more challenging to measure. POPS is
  exploring meaningful ways to assess this impact with its evaluation team,
  which include experts from USC and CSUN. The most important success indicator
  is the meaningful impact POPScast makes for the youth creating the podcast and
  those who discover POPS.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '37'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '3500'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  The struggle of youth with incarcerated loved ones has been diminished and
  overlooked for too long. POPS is a proven vehicle that provides support and
  hope. According to program data, POPS youth are staying in school, increasing
  their scores on standardized tests, developing self-esteem, and becoming more
  future-oriented. POPS students who intended to drop out of school are
  graduating and going on to attend college and have turned away from substance
  use, traded making art for gang activity, and are embarking paths they were
  not able to envision before joining POPS. POPScast is designed to be an
  effective way for POPS to connect with and create community for those youth
  similarly impacted but who feel alone, while also creating visibility for this
  urgent issue. By giving youth an opportunity to be seen and heard, to connect
  with each other and inspiring role models, Los Angeles will have more high
  school graduates, more social support, and more productive, engaged citizens.
