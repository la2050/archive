In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  The pandemic has exaggerated existing emotional and physical issues in our
  community. Our goal is to help people in need achieve optimum health and
  wellness. Having evolved over thousands of years, Eastern Medicine
  (acupuncture and all it's modalities) is one of the oldest continually
  practiced schools of medicine in the world. Eastern Medicine is used to
  prevent and treat disease, relieve pain, balance mood, enhance athletic
  performance, increase fertility, and improve overall health and wellness.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Mend will keep our treatment prices at a low level and also be able to offer
  reduced price healthcare to those who do not have insurance and who cannot
  afford our normal low rates. Acupuncture works by triggering the body's innate
  healing ability and can be beneficial for many health conditions. The World
  Health Organization (WHO) has documented many symptoms, diseases, and
  conditions that have been shown in controlled clinical trials to be
  effectively treated with acupuncture. Mend treats infants, children,
  teenagers, women, men and the elderly.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  We will measure our success based on our patient volume and outcome. We need
  to bring more people into Mend and spread the word that Acupuncture and a
  valid and powerful mode of medicine that can offer help during such a tough
  time. If patients come in debilitated, and leave a few weeks later after a few
  treatments with a healthier outlook and tools to move forward, then they will
  spread the word and bring in more patients for us to help. This grant will
  also give us the money to advertise our services to help spread the word that
  we are here to help the community.

Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  There are so many people who are suffering from depression, anxiety, substance
  abuse, and all the physical side effects from these socio-emotional issues. I
  think people are desperate for resources to help them move forward in such a
  difficult time. If people are given the tools to stay/get healthy the
  financial burden on the city will be lighter, our workforce will be stronger,
  and our economy will grow.
