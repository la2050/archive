title: Telling stories through STEAM enrichment with Kidspace Children’s Museum
project_summary: >-
  An LA 2050 grant will support Kidspace’s STEAM enrichment programming for
  students from Title 1 elementary schools in Los Angeles and Pasadena. Students
  will engage online and onsite with a museum exhibition about parade float
  design and construction; family workshops where they can build and decorate
  their own float model; online videos; downloadable lesson plans and family
  activities; and – health guidelines permitting – field trips and family access
  to participate in the decoration of a float for the 2022 Rose Parade.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - San Gabriel Valley
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Education inequities abound in LA County, and COVID-19 brought this crisis
  under a spotlight when students began virtual learning in March 2020. While
  Kidspace’s home, Pasadena, is renowned for scientific achievement, fabled
  architecture, and myriad arts and culture opportunities, it’s also a place of
  staggering income inequality. Pasadena has the greatest number of private
  schools per capita in the U.S. with 45% of the city’s children enrolled in
  private school. Meanwhile, 68% of Pasadena’s public school students come from
  economically disadvantaged households. The COVID-19 crisis exacerbated this
  “tale of two cities” and the gaps in parents’ ability to work from home and
  support online classes, internet and device access, and disparities in access
  to virtual enrichment programs and opportunities for creative expression.
  Located in the shadow of the historic Rose Bowl, Kidspace has a unique
  opportunity to bridge the “two Pasadenas” around a learning opportunity built
  on civic pride.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Funding will allow Kidspace to launch an innovative STEAM learning program for
  students from Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) and Pasadena Unified
  School District (PUSD), and for local families online, onsite, and in schools.
  K-5 students and their families will engage with Kidspace’s program team, and
  our partners from Artistic Entertainment Services (AES), a renowned parade
  float designer (and next-door neighbor to the museum), to explore the design,
  materials, animation, story, navigation, and build of an actual Tournament of
  Roses parade float. Students will engage online and onsite with a museum
  exhibition about float design and construction; family workshops where they
  can build and decorate their own float model; online videos; downloadable
  lesson plans and family activities; and – health guidelines permitting – field
  trips and family access to participate in the decoration of a float for the
  2022 Rose Parade. This initiative builds on our experience over the last year
  working with LAUSD’s Season of STEM program to translate project-based
  learning for online and remote teaching using a parade float as the central
  project. With the return of the Rose Parade in 2022, this Kidspace learning
  program celebrates an event with the power to connect our community
  intellectually, physically, and emotionally.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  When COVID-19 brought Los Angeles to a halt and left children learning at home
  for more than a year, the aforementioned inequalities in education were
  brought into stark relief. As it became clear that remote learning would
  continue into the 2020-21 schoolyear, organizations like Kidspace entered into
  a partnership with Season of STEM through LAUSD and the Broad Foundation to
  bring after-school enrichment to LAUSD elementary students. During the fall
  semester, students worked together with Kidspace and float builders from AES
  to tell the story of the “Best Day Ever,” which emphasized travel both near
  and far. During this spring 2021 semester, the students are working with a
  renowned puppeteer and Disney Imagineers to build a mechanical puppet that
  will be exhibited at Kidspace starting this summer. We are measuring
  quantitative impact – attendance, continued participation, etc. as well as
  qualitative impact through student, parent, and teacher testimonials.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '150'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '100000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Imagine an LA County where all children can joyfully and creatively engage
  with the world, and act as agents for their ideas and interests. Through this
  LA2050 project, Kidspace will continue to work with marginalized communities
  to bring in a new audience to share their culture, their stories, and
  emphasize the invaluable contributions every single person makes to the story
  of LA. Staggering inequities in our local education system often leads to
  silos in which some stories are heard louder than others, and some are not
  heard at all. Rather than lead children through linear, closed-ended
  experiences, we will design an inspiring and inviting enrichment program for
  them to explore according to their own interests and ideas. This challenging
  and highly engaging program will help PUSD and LAUSD students connect with
  hands-on STEAM concepts while giving them a voice and a platform to tell their
  stories with the tangible pieces they’ve created.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: ''
