title: Music Education for Los Angeles
project_summary: >-
  The Fender Play Foundation places instruments in the hands of youth who aspire
  to play and receive the powerful benefits of music education. We will expand
  our middle school music program in partnership with LAUSD to reach 6,000
  additional students from across the city. By providing students with
  instruments, live music classes, and access to the Fender Play app, the Fender
  Play Foundation is designing a middle school music program that enhances
  learning and gives students a creative outlet at a time when they need it
  most.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - LAUSD (select only if you have a district-wide partnership or project)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  The Fender Play Foundation's middle school music program seeks to support
  student engagement and mental health, which has been negatively impacted by
  school closures. A recent report revealed that 40% of LAUSD middle and high
  schoolers were disengaged or absent from classes in spring 2020. More than
  13,000 middle and high school students have been consistently disengaged in
  fall 2020. An additional 56,000 did not actively participate on a daily basis.
  School closures have accelerated many existing inequities and mental health
  challenges for students. A national poll reported that 46% of parents say
  their teen had shown signs of a new or worsening mental health condition.
  Recent CDC data revealed mental health-related emergency room visits increased
  31 percent for children between the ages of 12 and 17 from March to October
  compared to the same period in 2019. Music education can help students
  navigate these challenges exacerbated by the current health crisis.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Our innovative program combines synchronous and asynchronous learning to
  engage middle school students and give them the transformative opportunity to
  learn a new instrument. We donate brand new Fender instruments (electric
  guitar, acoustic guitar, bass and ukulele) to students and work with Los
  Angeles Unified School District teachers to create and deliver
  pedagogically-sound music lesson plans. Students also receive free access to
  Fender Play, a digital platform for learning and practicing their instrument.
  For inspiration, professional musicians host field trips to share their music
  experiences directly with students, teachers and parents. At the end of each
  semester, students always get to keep their instrument and have the
  opportunity to continue learning with our program. Over 58% of students from
  the 2020 fall semester reenrolled to keep playing in the 2021 spring semester.
  In survey responses, multiple students have expressed the mental health
  benefits of learning an instrument through our program. Here are a handful of
  responses from the most recent survey during the 2021 spring semester: “I feel
  happy when playing the guitar. It helps me when I'm stressed.” “Online
  learning is pretty stressful and getting lost into the music playing guitar
  really helps.” “I feel refreshed most of the time, because I play my
  instrument as a break from work.” “It’s fun and helpful for my anxiety."
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Our program uses quantitative data from Fender Play app usage, demographic
  data from LAUSD about program enrollment and qualitative data from parent,
  teacher and student surveys throughout the semester to measure our outcomes.
  Based on an analysis of Fender Play app usage, we learned that students from
  the 2020 fall semester who reenrolled for the 2021 spring semester watched
  more lessons a week than those who didn't continue with the program. We also
  discovered that students who reenrolled watched twice as many lessons on their
  "off days" (days without classes) as those who didn't continue with the
  program. Based on demographic data from LAUSD, we are monitoring enrollment
  and engagement for students of color, low-income students, English learners,
  foster youth, students with disabilities and homeless students. Based on
  parent, teacher and student surveys throughout the semester, we can gauge the
  impact our program has on learning, engagement, confidence and mental health.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '6000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '12000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Our vision is to inspire and unite students and families in Los Angeles County
  through music. To scale and reach more students, we need partners who
  recognize the power of music to bring people together. Music education is a
  community-driven solution for young people to withstand increased isolation,
  mental health challenges and division in Los Angeles. By mobilizing the
  community to help us increase access to arts education, boost enrollment in
  after school programs, and combat K-8 chronic absenteeism, the Fender Play
  Foundation can help Los Angeles become known for providing the most creative
  and engaging education in the country.
