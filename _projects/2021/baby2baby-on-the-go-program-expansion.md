What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  1 in 3 families in this country were already choosing between diapers and food
  before the pandemic, and now the families that Baby2Baby serves are struggling
  even more due to a year of lost income, millions of lost jobs and increased
  lack of access to these critical items. The moms and dads we serve have
  resorted to making homemade diapers out of newspapers. Some of them are
  watering down their baby formula to make it last longer and skipping meals to
  pay for these essential items. To put this increased need into perspective, in
  the first month of our COVID-19 relief, we distributed 350% more diapers than
  the month prior. We now have 731 million diaper requests – a startling 505%
  increase – showing the deeper effects of the pandemic. When Baby2Baby can
  supply these critical items like diapers and formula through our distributions
  across Los Angeles County, families can use their extremely limited funds to
  focus on food, shelter, and keeping their kids healthy and safe.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Things are getting increasingly worse, not better, for the families we serve.
  One year into the crisis, high poverty neighborhoods are still impacted by
  COVID-19 on a staggeringly different scale than more affluent areas. In
  California, families living in poverty have double the number of COVID case
  rates with half the number of vaccines being administered. Even before the
  pandemic began, these families were already living in an everyday crisis. A
  year later 8 million people, including 2.3 million children, have fallen into
  poverty for the first time in the US, and more children across Los Angeles
  County are relying on Baby2Baby than ever before. Prior to COVID-19, our main
  mode of distribution was an in-person shopping model, where thousands of
  social workers and authorized staff would access our headquarters to pick up
  essential items for the children in their programs. Due to increased safety
  measures, Baby2Baby implemented a delivery only method of distribution during
  this pandemic and stopped allowing any social workers to shop or pick up on
  site. As a result of this distribution mode shift, Baby2Baby has made
  deliveries to hundreds of organizations spanning school districts, homeless
  shelters, health clinics, foster care, hospitals and more. Baby2Baby On-the-Go
  - our mobile distribution program - now consists of two freight trucks, and
  four couriers getting as many items as possible to children in need, seven
  days a week.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Baby2Baby On-the-Go is an existing program, and has become our primary mode of
  distribution to get essential items into the hands of children living in
  poverty across LA. Baby2Baby now makes deliveries to over 450 partner
  organizations, representing all SPAs across LA County - up from 257 partners
  before the pandemic began. Our LA COVID-19 Relief has reached 423,436 children
  in Los Angeles, and our requests continue to grow by the day. To put the
  increased need in perspective we have seen the following increases in requests
  - diapers: 120,750,011 in 2020 to 731,248,560 in 2021 - formula: 52,123 in
  2020 to 6,159,822 in 2021 - school supplies: 7,008,950 in 2020 to 20,912,950
  in 2021 - blankets: 79,508 in 2020 to 1,095,340 in 2021 The LA 2050 Grant
  would help Baby2Baby meet the need that is increasing every day by stocking
  our truck for 15 additional distributions across 4 target SPAs allowing
  Baby2Baby to reach over 15,000 of the most vulnerable children living in
  poverty in LA.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '15000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': ''
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  When Baby2Baby can supply these critical items like diapers and formula
  through our distributions across Los Angeles County, families can use their
  extremely limited funds to focus on food, shelter, and keeping their kids
  healthy and safe. The expansion of Baby2Baby On-the-Go will allow us to
  increase our mobile distribution program to reach a goal of 15,000 additional
  children living in poverty by removing the challenges that have prevented
  access to basic essentials for the most underserved and remote communities in
  Los Angeles County.
