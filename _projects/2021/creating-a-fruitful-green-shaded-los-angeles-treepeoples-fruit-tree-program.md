  Creating a Fruitful, Green, Shaded Los Angeles: TreePeople’s Fruit Tree
  Program
project_summary: >-
  Through fruit tree distribution and education events, TreePeople will activate
  Angelenos to help create a sustainable, edible urban forest that provides not
  only food security and community nutrition, but also critical benefits such as
  cooling shade, air quality, reduced water pollution, and carbon capture.
  TreePeople will distribute fruit trees at a number of events in “tree poor”
  neighborhoods and train community members on how to plant and care for their
  trees.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Many Angelenos live in hot, tree-less neighborhoods with no affordable grocery
  stores in sight, only fast-food outlets and corner stores stocked with junk
  food and few healthy options. Residents of these “food deserts” rely
  disproportionately on food from corner stores or travel to grocery stores
  outside of the community, which adds cost and takes time. Many in these
  communities struggle to get the fresh produce they need, resulting in hunger
  and malnutrition. In fact, an estimated 1 in 4 Angelenos face food insecurity.
  The same communities that lack fresh produce also face the worst environmental
  challenges. Pollution is high and environmental assets are low. The
  consequences can be severe: separation from nature is linked with mood
  disorders, and physical health problems, such as obesity, diabetes, and
  asthma. Communities need a greener, shadier environment, along with access to
  fresh produce. Fruit trees do both: they green urban areas and provide healthy
  food for years to come.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  TreePeople’s Fruit Tree Program focuses on underserved, environmentally
  stressed communities with low canopy and few options for healthy food.
  TreePeople will distribute 5-gallon fruit trees through a series of community
  events. If needed, curbside delivery of fruit trees will also be performed to
  comply with COVID regulations. Community members register in advance to
  receive a fruit tree (limit one per household) and select from multiple
  species appropriate to the local climate and soil conditions. Typical fruit
  tree options include lemon, lime, kumquat, orange, nectarine, peach and plum.
  Prior to receiving a fruit tree, community members are provided a short
  workshop that covers proper planting and care practices as well as printed
  instructional material. All workshops and materials are provided in both
  English and Spanish. Fruit tree distribution events are publicized through
  flyers distributed at schools and community organizations as well as through
  social media and the TreePeople website. This program has led to excellent
  results in tree survival rates and extensive community benefits like yummy,
  nutritious fresh fruit.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Since launching our first fruit tree distribution in 1984, TreePeople has seen
  the fruits of our labor – thousands of trees have matured and are yielding
  fruit annually in underserved neighborhoods across LA County. Past recipients
  have been inspired to pay-it-forward and have held local workshops, ensuring
  distributed fruit trees are flourishing. We found our fruit tree distribution
  model works well in low-income, urban communities because it is highly
  localized and harnesses the power of community support, rather than costly
  equipment or contractors. Through LA2050 we hope to: + Distribute 2,500
  5-gallon fruit trees at 10 events to low-income residents. + Educate fruit
  tree recipients on tree care, including watering, pruning, pest and disease
  identification. We will consider this program successful if the participants
  have fun, learn about tree care, and are inspired to steward their urban
  forest.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '2500'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '10000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Trees are an essential part of a healthier, greener, resilient Los Angeles.
  And just as trees need continued care to thrive, so do our communities. Our
  fruit tree program significantly benefits the physical health and environment
  of high-need communities. Distributing fruit trees connects people with
  nature, provides nutritious food, and engages community members to play a
  meaningful role in advancing climate resilience. Community members who receive
  fruit trees will have access to fresh fruit for years to come, resulting in
  improved nutrition and food security. Fruit trees also offer a much-needed
  connection to nature for residents who lack access to green spaces. Planting
  and caring for fruit trees empowers residents to become environmental
  stewards. Fruit trees capture carbon, clean the air and provide much-needed
  shade, resulting in healthier, cooler, and more climate-resilient communities.
