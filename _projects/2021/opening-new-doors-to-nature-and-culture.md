title: Opening New Doors to Nature and Culture
project_summary: >-
  Every day, the Natural History Museum connects eager learners to one of the
  most significant natural history collections in the world, sparking
  meaningful, lifelong relationships with science, nature, and culture. Our free
  field trips, Adventures in Nature camps, and other hands-on programs--both in
  person and virtually--resonate deeply because they engage youth directly in
  the work of real scientists. Access to programs like these plays a huge role
  in igniting student curiosity about science and the pursuit of future careers
  in STEM fields.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
  - LAUSD (select only if you have a district-wide partnership or project)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Today, in LA County, half of all students will graduate without having reached
  proficiency in STEM subjects. While numerous studies suggest exposure to
  informal STEM learning at an early age is essential for developing a positive
  view of science, all too frequently extracurricular opportunities in the
  sciences are rare in low income communities. As a result, people of color
  continue to be vastly underrepresented in the sciences, both within higher
  education and the workforce. NHM’s goal is to close that gap. Here's how an
  NHM Ocean Experience Mobile Museum residency at a high school in Boyle Heights
  changed the lives of the teens who participated. Students were so inspired by
  what they experienced, and shared their phenomenal drive to learn more, that
  NHM subsequently created a paid Marine Science Teen Internship program
  especially for them. Fast forward a year and alumni of the program are now
  attending the University of Hawaii, UC Berkeley, among many others, as Science
  majors.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  NHM education programs invite students to engage in the work of real
  scientists. Being able to touch and observe real fossils and historical
  artifacts has proven to be a powerful learning catalyst, especially for
  students not actively engaged by traditional classroom settings. Interacting
  directly with the authentic research being done by museum scientists, and
  seeing themselves reflected in the diverse faces of those same scientists, can
  be transformative. In response to the pandemic, NHM is offering a full suite
  of virtual learning resources to students learning from home and their
  teachers. Videos cover everything from LA history to mammalogy and mineral
  science. Large-scale webinars bring objects from "behind the scenes” for
  students to exclusively access. Museum Educators work one-on-one virtually
  with individual classrooms focused on developing critical thinking and science
  literacy. And “Adventures in Nature” day camps provide students in pre-K
  through 8th grade an opportunity to spark their curiosity and creativity. In
  this current moment, when the timeline for in-person field trips remains
  unclear, our challenge (and opportunity) is to deliver our immersive programs
  wherever our audiences are. We want to continue to expand our reach to
  students in the “virtual classroom” while also welcoming students and teachers
  back onsite once it is safe to do so. The only barriers are a budget stretched
  thin by the pandemic and Museum Educator staff already at capacity.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  NHM uses a number of assessment tools to determine learning outcomes and
  program effectiveness. Specifically, we track metrics related to the following
  four broad categories: 1) use and reach; 2) implementation and student
  participation; 3) outcomes and understanding achieved; and 4) quality of
  engagement. Outcomes vary from program to program, but these results are
  typical: students are more actively engaged in their learning, asking
  questions, raising their hand, and getting involved. Having direct contact
  with Museum Educators, Collections Managers, and Curators affords students a
  first-hand look at the fields of science, history, and museum management,
  awakening minds to new career paths. When students are able to engage with
  rare artifacts and primary resource materials their sense of awe really makes
  the learning “stick.” The fact that this “sticky” content delivery is
  seamlessly integrated with Next Generation Science Standards leads to
  improvement in academic achievement.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '12085'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '7500'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  NHM seeks to ensure that all young Angelenos have equitable access to science
  and cultural learning opportunities. In this critical moment in our region’s
  (and our country’s) history, and despite tremendous fiscal challenges, NHM is
  fulfilling a unique and important role in the educational landscape. Our
  Museum Educators introduce youth to the awe-inspiring wonder of the natural
  world. Falling in love with nature is often the first step toward a greater
  understanding of science, opening doors to what we hope is a life-long journey
  of exploration and discovery. With a grant to hire two additional Museum
  Educators, NHM will be able to continue to expand access to new audiences and
  forge connections to the natural world in students of every ethnicity, age,
  ability, and income level. NHM would be grateful to partner with LA 2050 and
  the entire Los Angeles community to ignite the next generation of scientists,
  nature enthusiasts, and innovators.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  The museum partners with numerous school districts, community partners,
  non-profit organizations, and educators at over 1,200 schools across Los
  Angeles to meet the needs of our learning communities. With the onset of the
  pandemic, NHM has deepened its collaboration with LAUSD in particular, which
  distributes the new distance learning resources facilitated by our Museum
  Educators. These resources are catering to students and teachers across the
  other 79 school districts as well and to families learning from home across
  Los Angeles County. This year, NHMLAC also piloted the Teacher Advisory
  Council, made up of nine teachers who represent schools and districts all over
  Los Angeles County, to assist in curriculum development and provide direct
  access and perspectives regarding student needs.
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?: 'Access to the LA2050 community,Communications support'
