title: Build CA's Largest Public Kids' Makerspace
project_summary: >-
  Envision a 4,000 sf makerspace designed just for kids, where youth can develop
  creativity and collaboration skills. A makerspace serving up to 100 youth at a
  time from across LA, staffed by educators, makers, and artists as diverse as
  the city itself. Where youth gain practical skills by building functional
  projects (Design a Bookshelf!), then use those skills to large-scale
  collaborative creations (6' Squirrel Robot! A Unicorn Cart!) as wild as their
  imaginations. All using sustainable materials sourced from recyclables and
  industrial offcuts.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - Westside
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted children's abilities to learn in
  concrete, hands-on ways. In addition, many underserved youth stuck at home
  have not had the resources/materials to do so. When we are back in person, our
  children are going to need a place to access their creativity and
  ingenuity.This is where we come in: In too many schools, particularly in
  LAUSD, arts education has become a sad afterthought, and students aren't
  gaining the STEAM skills necessary for full engagement with our increasingly
  knowledge-intensive, globally integrated and innovation-based economy. For
  over 15 years, our unique ethos and methods have been incredibly effective at
  imparting STEAM lessons in an intuitive way. This new facility will allow us
  to serve youth in need of a hands-on creative learning environment. We can't
  wait to get into our new space, and provide our Tinkering Camps and Classes
  for those youth who need it most- all while using materials that are
  sustainable and recycled.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  reDiscover develops the creative potential of LA’s youth using real tools and
  sustainable materials. The need for reDiscover’s services and demand for our
  maker programs outstrips the 2,400 sf makerspace we’ve operated in Venice
  since 2015. To better serve our existing community, reach more underserved
  children, and stay true to our core competency of creating inspirational
  environments where all children can learn, make, and tinker, we are moving to
  a new and larger facility in West LA, with excellent highway access to serve
  as a regional resource. In the initial move, we will transform 4,000 sf of the
  facility into makerspaces and a Creative Reuse Materials Warehouse, and have
  an option from the landlord to double this footprint as our programming
  continues to grow. This will create the largest public kids' makerspace in
  California, perfect for school groups, camps, and classes. The new reDiscover
  Center will be an anchor for LA's youth maker community. A place where
  community organizations and local artists meet and make together, sharing
  ideas anchored in reDiscover’s vision of a creative, sustainable Los Angeles.
  Where each year, thousands of young people from all walks of life get deep
  into learning maker skills, raising their sights to careers in the creative
  economy, and making something amazing. Vote for reDiscover this year, and help
  youth in Los Angeles get back to their creative, inventive selves- as we all
  try and get back to "normal" together.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  This expansion into a 4,000 sf makerspace will allow reDiscover to triple the
  number of youth served annually in our intensive Tinkering Camp Programs,
  double the capacity to serve the youth in our Tinkering Club program, and
  allow us to expand the number of LAUSD school trips by 250%. In addition, we
  serve as a vital space for artists, teachers and parents to inexpensively
  purchase quantities of recycled and upcycled materials. With new materials
  processing and storage capacity, we can help to reduce LA's carbon footprint
  while providing great maker and arts materials to the community. Our visiting
  schools can now send whole buses of students, train teachers, and gain access
  to our curriculum for in-school maker lessons. In addition to tripling the
  number of youth served, we will be able to open a retail facility to sell
  maker resources, and serve as a gallery for youth artists. rDC participates in
  the California Cultural Data Project to track our impact in the community.

Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Our vision is to facilitate 20,000 children per year as they learn to not
  simply to problem-solve, but expand upon their own solutions; not only to
  express creativity, but to become experienced makers and tinkerers- learning
  to design things with their own hands, making something real. Impact:
  Differentiated makerspaces for different interests and skill levels, ranging
  from paper and scissors to 3D scanners and CNC routers. Program collaboration
  bridging arts and maker organizations, including government, non-profit, and
  industry. Joint programming of our shared spaces to result in new and more
  robust curriculum used by strategic partners to reach 100,000+ additional
  youth. Engagement with schools across LA County serving BIPOC youth, providing
  accessible maker experiences rooted in LA's richly diverse craft, art,
  engineering, and maker traditions.
