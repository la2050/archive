title: 'Mental Health Matters: The Hero Coalition'
project_summary: >-
  Turning kids’ struggles into strengths, The Hero Coalition’s mental health
  programs in Spanish and English will impact over 200,000 children, teens, and
  parents in 2021. Created by psychologists and co-powered by youth, these
  interactive programs – in LA homes, schools, and community centers - build
  resilience, empathy, inclusion, nonviolent conflict resolution, and family
  communication skills. We teach crucial, evidence-based tools to navigate
  racism, depression, anxiety, anger, grief, shame, and fear. Our work - free of
  charge - also takes preventative action against despair, loneliness, and pain,
  which can lead to suicide, self-harm, and addiction.

What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  The US is in a mental health crisis, affecting relationships, job rates,
  homelessness, the economy, rates of substance abuse, domestic abuse, suicide,
  crime and violence. According to American Psychological Assn meta-analysis,
  mental disorders in teens are 5x the rate of 75 years ago. These youth are
  leading us into the future: 30% engage in multiple high-risk behaviors, such
  as substance use, sex, violence, depression, attempted suicide +50% have
  overwhelming anxiety 52% victims of cyberbullying 48% victims of bullying 33%
  intense depression 1 in 6 teens seriously considered suicide in the past year
  Black & Brown youth suicide attempts: nearly 2x that of White youth LGBTQIA:
  4x more likely to attempt suicide than straight kids 80% of teen suicide may
  be attributable to bullying For every suicide, there are +100 attempts COVID
  has exacerbated this. We must provide mental health services in ways that are
  replicable & free to the public. The Hero Coalition is doing that.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  We work in Partnership with YMCA USA, which chose The Heroic Journey as their
  mental health & social emotional learning program for children, teens &
  parents. In 2021, our work with YMCA is impacting 190,000 lives. Created by
  psychologists, The Heroic Journey features evidence-based tools that teach
  crucial mental health & social emotional skills in ways that are culturally
  relevant. The Heroic Journey teaches relatable mental health tools for:
  Violence prevention Emotion management Empathy Resiliency How to seek help
  Responding to bullying, racism, misogyny, LGBTQI+bullying Navigating inequity
  & discrimination Handling anger, depression, anxiety Ending implicit bias
  Becoming allies for targets Conflict resolution Restorative practices Healthy
  personal identity (crucial for ending fear and bias) Addressing emotional pain
  that leads to risk behaviors such as self-harm & addiction In addition to
  YMCAs, our work has multiple outlets: •The Heroic Journey at Home is available
  - in English & Spanish, free of charge - to the public via our website. •Our
  Inclusion & Diversity Council creates & distributes free mental health comic
  books. We have donated 4800 copies of Lights, Camera, Identity! Never Alone to
  LGBTQIA centers. We have donated +900 copies of SuperKids to children’s
  hospitals, to help children suffering from critical illness navigate
  loneliness, depression, anxiety & fear. •The Heroic Journey is in schools
  through CIS, the largest drop-out prevention org in the US.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  In our evidence-based work with YMCAs, we use Hello Insight, their org to
  measure mental health program data & provide continuous improvement. We have
  monthly feedback meetings with +100 leaders/teachers, helping ensure cultural
  relevance & address specific needs. Our psychologists have done additional,
  internal webinars to provide support for Black & Brown mental health issues;
  trauma-informed work with kids. Measurements in YMCAs/community centers
  include: •Self-reported life management: ability to regulate one’s own
  emotions/behavior; take positive risks; persist through challenges •Social
  skills: ability to consider others’ perspectives, develop empathy
  •Self-efficacy: a person’s motivation over their own job, school, or parenting
  performance; potential for success •Mastery: one’s desire to learn, increase
  overall ability Measurement in schools also include: •Attendance •Number:
  bullying/behavior incidents •Students’ self-reporting depression/anxiety
  •Climate of inclusion

Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  With the LA2050 grant, we will expand our programs to underserved children,
  teens, and adults in 2 ways, with the goal of making mental health tools
  relatable & free for all who seek support. •Free programs & webinars, similar
  to our work for YMCA USA •Free printed resources, expanding on our relatable
  mental health comic books We are positioned for this: •Our work is used in
  Metro LA YMCA under Exec Dir Jen Sullivan. We plan to expand to underserved
  YMCAs in Commerce Crenshaw Downey Gardena-Carson Montebello Southeast-Rio
  South Pasadena San Marino Torrance-Southbay Weingart East LA Wilmington
  •Pending funding, we plan to bring our work to Boys & Girls Clubs. •We are
  partnered with Communities in Schools, the US largest dropout prevention org,
  in Chicago. We are in conversation with CIS LA Exec Dir Elmer Roldan to expand
  that work here. Casel.org meta-analysis shows that teaching the basic tools
  used in The Heroic Journey positively impacts kids’ lives as many as 18 years
  later.
