title: Youth Artificial Intelligence Program
project_summary: >-
  We are bridging the skills gap to new collar technology careers for
  opportunity youth in LA County. Using interactive play-based learning
  projects, youth build their digital and artificial intelligence literacy,
  discover emerging careers and become certified in the top ten 21st Century
  soft skills. Youth develop an AI Pitch for their community as a final project.
  This is where a community improvement idea is showcased, including the
  potential uses of artificial intelligence. This information sharing increases
  the community's awareness of AI.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Antelope Valley
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  We are addressing income inequality and our program will help decrease the
  GINI index from .50 to .35 by 2050. We will help reach the goal of 10%
  employment in tech jobs by 2050 and decrease the November 2020 unemployment
  rate of 10.6% to under 4% by 2050. Our program prepares opportunity youth for
  emerging new collar technology careers, which pay life sustaining wages.
  Research shows there is a major skill gap in the technology industry, which
  cannot be closed at the pace youth are graduating from college. IBM CEO
  created the term "new collar" jobs, which shifts the hiring paradigm from
  relying on resumes and experience to looking at potential and soft skills.
  Education for new collar jobs is in the form of industry level certifications
  and badges, which per research closes the income inequality gap. The
  unemployment rate will decrease as new collar jobs are entry level, include
  paid apprenticeships, free training and span across industries outside of
  technology. The demand is high.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  The Youth AI Learning Program is currently a one year pilot, funded by LA
  County Department of Mental Health, Transforming LA grant, and ends Dec 2021.
  We train 5 opportunity youth per cohort (total of 25 youth per year) using an
  innovative and immersive enhanced earn and learn opportunity. Each cohort is 6
  weeks however we will extend to 8 weeks under LA2050 based on feedback. The
  youth receive certification in the top 21st Century employment soft skills,
  artificial intelligence literacy play based modules, socio-emotional
  intelligence and mental health techniques and resources. We have guest
  speakers who didn't follow a traditional pathway into a tech career. The
  students practice all skills hands-on thru projects and culminates with an AI
  Pitch presented to the community. The pitch is their idea on a way to improve
  the community or social cause and explores the potential use of artificial
  intelligence. Our students are eager learners ranging from first generation
  college students to GED/HiSet holders. 75% have never participated in a summer
  or STEM camp. The program is run virtually during COVID19 and we bridge the
  digital divide by providing donated laptops and/or hotspots based on need. We
  currently are restricted to youth in Supervisor District 5 with a preference
  for Antelope Valley SPA-1. Under LA2050 we propose to include youth, LA County
  wide, as there is growing demand for our program. For in person learning, when
  permitted, our office is in the Antelope Valley.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  This is an existing one year pilot due to end December 2021. Impact is
  measured by students completing pre and post surveys measuring the increase in
  literacy regarding artificial intelligence, career options and job
  preparation, soft skills and mental health status. We also receive career
  speaker evaluation forms. The students also keep a daily journal as a self
  reflection and professional goal setting tool as they progress through the
  course. Students complete a pre and post video journal to measure how the
  program met their self identified and desired goals. DMH BUPPS (mental health
  assessment) survey three times (pre, post and 3 months after program
  completion) to measure the sustained impact of the program. Critical thinking,
  presentation, leadership and collaboration skills are measured through
  completion of training modules and work projects. Our goal is for the students
  to increase in self sufficiency, confidence and vocational clarity to pursue
  education and employment.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '30'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '600'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  With our work being successful, LA County will truly reflect a place where
  everyone can obtain the education, skills training, social support, mental
  health resources and industry support to obtain life sustaining wages and
  entrance into new and emerging careers. We believe our focus on new collar
  technology jobs which have a high demand, low supply of workers, high wages
  and non traditional access points is viable. Opportunity youth we work with
  are very interested in technology and embrace our play based learning model
  and work based learning projects. We are unique in offering work based
  learning in a trauma informed, client centered environment for the past three
  years as an iFoster TAY AmeriCorps host site. Opportunity youth are our core
  and empowered to learn, explore, make mistakes and discover solutions as we
  grow and learn together. Our youth quickly realize their potential and our
  projects guide them to become engaged in the community using their strongest
  skills.
