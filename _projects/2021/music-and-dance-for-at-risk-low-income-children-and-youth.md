title: 'Music and Dance for at-risk, low-income children and youth'
project_summary: >-
  BGCV is partnering with Boys & Girls Clubs of Metro Los Angeles to bring our
  incredible music program to their communities. Both organizations are
  providing care at no charge to children of low-income families with essential
  workers, with a priority for single parent households. Giving children and
  teens that lack the ability to pay an opportunity to have access to high
  quality music education - something that isn’t readily available for
  low-income families - is vital to both organizations’ mission.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - South LA
  - Westside
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Both BGCV and BGCMLA serve diverse, predominantly low-income students ages 6
  to 18 without the financial resources to access dance and music education.
  Prior to COVID-19, we offered robust dance and music classes like ukulele,
  ballet, violin and more to all Club members. During the COVID-19 shutdown,
  access to creative outlets for our children and teens was essentially shut
  off. Music education and performance is the perfect way for children and teens
  to express their emotions, especially when they can’t articulate their
  feelings. Our young peoples’ mental health has suffered greatly from isolation
  and stress during the pandemic, and we want to relaunch our music and dance
  program. In addition, until recently, BGCMLA has had limited music programing.
  During 2020, they partnered with Fender Play Foundation and USC’s Thornton
  School of Music to offer music programs. Due to the enthusiastic response,
  they want to build an ongoing music program at BGCMLA Clubhouses, based on our
  model.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  The requested funds will support an expansion of BGCV’s longstanding,
  award-winning BGCV Music and Dance programming, which will serve a projected
  300 students at BGCV during the school year and another 200 at BGMLA clubs.
  (All programs will adhere to public health and County guidelines, and both
  organizations have implemented stringent COVID safety protocols. We anticipate
  serving near normal numbers on-site by Fall 2021, but we are planning for
  multiple scenarios, including hybrid onsite/online programming.) BGCV has a
  nationally recognized performing arts program. BGCV provides our members with
  opportunities to creatively express themselves and build their skills in
  state-of-the-art music production studios that they would not otherwise be
  able to access. We emphasize building skills and learning, rather than perfect
  performance or artwork. As members work on their music or dance skills, they
  learn discipline and perseverance, and have the opportunity to perform or
  showcase their art. Our state-of-the-art music center and studio offers Club
  members the opportunity to learn skills in audio engineering, music
  production, song writing, and vocals, as well as learn about elements of the
  music and performing arts industry. We also provide introductory piano,
  violin, ukulele, guitar, and drums/percussion group and individual lessons,
  and ballet classes. Our Music staff mentor those students who show a
  particular talent for art or music.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  The BGCV/BGCMLA Music program will provide opportunities for our members to
  develop their creativity, express themselves, explore career options in the
  arts, and even improve their academic performance, with goals to: •Increase
  student interest in music. •Improve skill levels of participants in various
  music disciplines. •Provide opportunities to showcase participants’ music.
  •Expose participants to new music disciplines. We have set outcomes that 90%
  of members will improve their music skills by the end of the fiscal year. The
  Music Directors evaluate student work by assessing their skill level at the
  beginning and end of each semester and noting improvement. As students
  improve, they create more complex music or art projects. We also use our
  recitals as program evaluations. We also focus on ensuring those members with
  an interest in a career in the arts have the skills to do so, with a long-term
  goal of increasing the percentage of underrepresented groups in creative
  industries.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '500'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '2000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Long-term, we are creating opportunities for underrepresented students to
  succeed in all aspects of the music industry. At BGCV, our hands-on Music
  Production curriculum prepares students for future employment in the music
  industry. In addition to taking individual and group music lessons, music
  production members learn to operate a recording facility, use ProTools, Logic
  Pro X, and Ableton Live, work with actual clients, learn the science behind
  sound, partake in music industry workshops, and learn about higher education.
  Music Production students may book the studio for private sessions. Members
  also attend field trips to various record label offices and state of the art
  recording studios. Many high school music producers, musicians and songwriters
  are on their way to achieving success, thanks to the guidance provided. Based
  on our track record of success at BGCV, we are now working toward expanding
  our curriculum to South and Central Los Angeles with BGCMLA.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  BGCMLA will recruit participants, provide space for programming, and manage
  the hiring process for the BGCMLA Music Director to be hired. Their staff will
  work with our Music Director, Shane Basye, to map out a three to five year
  plan to build out BGCMLA’s program. BGCMLA will cover all facilities related
  expenses for music programming at their Clubhouses.
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?: >-
  Access to the LA2050 community,Capacity-building and training,Volunteer
  recruitment
