title: Find Your Anchor - grassroots suicide prevention
project_summary: >-
  Find Your Anchor (FYA) is a grassroots movement aimed at suicide prevention,
  awareness, and education. With creativity and a personal touch, FYA aims to
  support those who may be struggling and de-stigmatize conversations
  surrounding suicide and mental health. This funding would help us launch more
  FYA boxes to those struggling throughout Los Angeles - many at the lowest
  point in their lives. It is our goal to receive more messages like this: "I
  just wanted to let you know you saved a life today."

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  We are experiencing an epidemic of hopelessness. In 2019, we lost 48,344
  people to suicide. There were a staggering 1.4 million attempts. Currently,
  there is a gap in how our society is addressing this. Our program is
  innovative because we fight the hopelessness in a tangible way. And we do that
  by reminding individuals that they are not alone. That there are strangers all
  over the world who care. COVID has only exacerbated these issues, bringing
  mental health to the forefront.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  At the heart of Find Your Anchor’s mission is a small blue box. Once referred
  to as a “mental health first aid kit,” each box is packed with good vibes and
  materials designed to inspire, soothe, and offer support. This includes a “52+
  Reasons to Live” deck of cards, an infographic on depression, a list of
  resources, posters, stickers, a bracelet, and a letter. The boxes are intended
  to be organic in the sense that each person can add their own anchors and
  inspiration to the box before passing it along. This funding would help us
  launch more FYA boxes to those struggling throughout Los Angeles - many at the
  lowest point in their lives. $100,000 would reach 6,750 citizens. These box
  recipients cross all demographics, social classes, and age groups. This
  program will help us establish deeper roots in Los Angeles (we relocated from
  Chicago 2 years ago), ensuring that we reach more people who are struggling.
  The infusion of 6,000+ boxes into the county will help us to create
  long-lasting partnerships within the community that will extend far beyond
  this program. For those contemplating suicide, there is an overwhelming sense
  of loneliness and despair. We wanted something specifically for them. We want
  those in need to open the box and think “someone cared enough to make this for
  me” - providing, or sparking, within them a reason to fight.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Since Find Your Anchor provides a physical product, we will track demand for
  our boxes. We will also focus on data that tells us where the most box
  requests come from, demographics of the box requesters, geographical data,
  etc. - but nothing compares to the impact of a testimonial. Throughout this
  project we will continue to measure success in the form of firsthand accounts
  of box recipients. However, we will also measure success by the number of
  school partnerships we create, recurring box subscriptions we receive, and
  workshops we give.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '6750'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '40500'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  These testimonials are the definition of our success. - “I just wanted to let
  you know that you saved a life today.” (Student) - “I just wanted to let you
  know that I received one of your boxes from a dear friend of mine a few weeks
  ago. I thought about killing myself that day and when I got the box, I
  completely second guessed it. I’m now seeking help and getting the help I
  need. Thank you so much.” - “Yesterday, I opened my mailbox and found a
  package in there from you. From the deep, depths of my heart, I thank you.
  You've saved a life.” - “I lost my oldest son to mental illness that resulted
  in suicide. Thank you for this tangible way to spread the message about
  suicide and preventing others from going through what our family has.”
  (Mother) - "This is a great addition to my therapy groups. I work primarily
  with female survivors of military sexual trauma and see huge benefits in
  passing the box among the group." (Social Worker)
