title: Sail Away Weekends
project_summary: >-
  LAMI’s Sail Away Weekends provide at no charge an extraordinary adventure to
  heal and bond families of Los Angeles homicide victims through a partnership
  with Justice For Murdered Children. Inaccessible to many due to cost and lack
  of familiarity, families set off on a one-night, two-day weekend voyage of
  excitement and respite. They sail a tall ship, participate in safe water
  activities, and overnight at Catalina Island. Sharing this new and challenging
  recreational experience in a safe and supported environment is the essence of
  healing PLAY.

project_video: ''
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Applying a proven model or solution to a new issue or sector (e.g., using a
  job recruiting software or strategy to match clients to supportive housing
  sites, applying demonstrated strategies from advocating for college
  affordability to advocating for housing affordability and homelessness, etc.)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  There have been more than 400 murders in Los Angeles County in the last twelve
  months alone. The death of a loved one is traumatic, but experiencing a family
  member murdered results in debilitating and lasting trauma and grief
  significantly unique to families of homicide victims. The circumstances
  surrounding a murder and the sudden loss to murder create a complexity of
  traumas that disrupt the grieving process for family members. While homicides
  occur across socio-economic groupings, murders are disproportionately higher
  in low and middle-income brackets. Many families of murdered victims find
  coping and healing in building relationships and community with other
  co-victims who share the same experience. In addition to these communities of
  families' search for legal and medical resources to assist with their
  recovery, they also need to feel like husbands, wives, daughters, sons, and
  families and the joyful parts of living again through affordable, safe,
  supportive experiences.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Sail Away Weekends Program invites families of murdered victims at no cost to
  experience the life-affirming healing properties of shared excitement,
  laughter, physical activity, problem-solving, teamwork, creativity,
  appreciation, reflection, and imagination that exist on a weekend expedition
  to Catalina Island. The following program meets the LA County COVID-19
  guidelines at this time and is flexible to adjust as restrictions are
  tightened or eased. Five to six families (20 individuals total) will undergo a
  health screening and, if no indications of infection, will join the LAMI tall
  ships on a Saturday morning in San Pedro, CA. The ship has been zoned for
  safely-distanced activities, and households will move from between zones.
  Rigorous hygiene and PPE protocols are enforced. Participants will learn and
  perform all sailing and live-aboard responsibilities, including sail handling,
  navigation, meal-preparations, and ship-shape upkeep. The ship will arrive at
  Catalina Island early Saturday afternoon. The time at Catalina will include
  and inspire opportunities to climb the rigging, swim, snorkel, kayak, island
  hikes, play maritime team-building games, participate in storytelling, and
  downtime. Participants will sleep at comfortable island-based facilities LAMI
  regularly utilizes. If guidelines allow it, participants will sleep aboard the
  ship. The ship will return to San Pedro on Sunday afternoon. The program is
  proven to be a transformational and joyful experience.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  LAMI's Sail Away Weekends Program and its goals are identical to past
  experiential at-sea programs we have conducted. Success will be met if
  participants show positive changes in attitudes toward the activities and
  their outlook on the world and themselves. Pre-and post surveys will be
  conducted to assess these metrics. Our partner Justice For Murdered Children
  also has a long standing relationship with these families and will report back
  on longitudinal changes exhibited by the individuals.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '160'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '960'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  The trauma felt by family members of murder victims is deep, lasting, and
  unique. If untreated, these co-victims can often suffer from mental illness,
  depression, self-harm, lower quality of life and have a higher propensity to
  even violence themselves. Giving these families an opportunity to share
  together moments of joy and discovery is a transformative experience that adds
  to the many elements necessary for a positive outcome in their lives.The
  greater community of LA County will benefit if the negative cycle of impact
  from a homicide does not extend outward from the future actions and choices of
  these co-victims.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  Justice For Murdered Children has more than 30 years experience in the
  homicide victim's family community, building relationships and providing
  resources.
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?: >-
  Access to the LA2050 community,Communications support,Capacity-building and
  training,Strategy assistance and implementation
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.: Justice for Murdered Children
Which metrics will you impact?:
  - Prevalence of trauma and adverse childhood experiences
  - ' Access to open space and park facilities'
  - ' Parks with intergenerational play opportunities'
Indicate any additional LA2050 goals your project will impact.:
  - LA is the best place to LEARN
