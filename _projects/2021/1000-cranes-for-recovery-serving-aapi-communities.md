title: 1000 Cranes for Recovery serving AAPI communities
project_summary: >-
  Through 1000 Cranes for Recovery, SHARE! will address pandemic-related
  distress caused by losses, unemployment and discrimination experienced by
  chronically underserved Los Angeles Asian-American and Pacific Islander
  communities by 1) training and placing 25 AAPI in the peer workforce, and 2)
  training 1,000 peers on AAPI issues and culture through free monthly webinars
  and 3) hosting a weekly support group. The cranes symbolize hope and a
  collective wish for recovery for AAPI communities.

project_video: ''
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  The pandemic has devastated Los Angeles Asian-American and Pacific Islanders
  (AAPI), with a mortality of 195 Asians per 100,000 and 477 Hawaiians per
  100,000 [LA County Dept. of Public Health] as well as extreme loneliness and
  isolation. There has been a 150% rise in anti-Asian hate crimes and violence
  [CSU Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism]. Contrary to the myth of the
  successful “model minority,” AAPI unemployment soared from 3% to 15% [Rand
  Corporation]. Los Angeles AAPI are in need of emotional support, yet they are
  the least likely of all ethnic groups to receive mental health services, due
  to stigma, language barriers, poor cultural competency and the lack of AAPI
  mental health providers. This historic underrepresentation has been compounded
  by the complexity of serving diverse immigrants from more than 26 countries
  [Asian Americans Advancing Justice LA], as well as rapid population growth
  since 2000, projected to increase a further 11% by 2050 [LA Almanac].
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  While many mental health professionals require years of training before they
  can enter the workforce, SHARE! will bring 25 AAPI Peer Specialists into the
  workforce within six months. Peer Specialists, because they have lived
  experience of mental health issues, and/or are parents/caregivers with a child
  with mental health issues, are uniquely qualified to reach AAPI who are
  reluctant to ask for help. After participants complete the SHARE! Advanced
  Peer Specialist Training, a 70-hour online program which meets national
  requirements for certification, SHARE! will support them with job-hunting
  skills, networking, mentorship and further training in relationship-building,
  conflict resolution and peer bridging to support homeless and formerly
  incarcerated people. SHARE! will organize free monthly online trainings for
  peers and community members on the needs of AAPI communities, including
  unemployment, COVID-related losses, fighting mental health stigma, coping with
  discrimination, needs of elders, youth and parents, and more. Each participant
  will fold an origami crane that will be publicly displayed, and will earn a
  crane-shaped badge to designate them as culturally sensitive to AAPI
  communities. The trainings also will reach an estimated audience of 1,500 a
  month through a webpage and social media. SHARE! also will host a weekly
  online self-help support group for AAPI and allies to support community
  members as well as those working in the mental health system.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Peer services build community and relieve isolation. A Canadian study, for
  example, found Chinese immigrants who got peer support were less lonely and
  felt happier. [BMC Geriatrics, 2020] Peer services engage and empower people
  who are reluctant to receive mental health services and reduce symptoms and
  hospitalizations. The recipient of seven peer training grants, SHARE! has
  trained 781 peers since 2016. SHARE!’s graduates, 73% of whom are not white,
  have an 87% placement rate in the mental health system. SHARE! has trained 42
  Asian/ Asian-American Peer Specialists who speak Mandarin, Tagalog, Korean,
  Khmer, Guamanian, Punjabi, Japanese, Hindi, Cantonese and other Chinese
  languages. SHARE! will track placement rates, tell success stories to
  encourage others to enter the mental health field, and continuously improve
  trainings and support groups through evaluations and community feedback.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1025'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '12500'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Twenty-five AAPI Peer Specialists will each serve at least 100 people a year.
  The 1,000 peers trained to better serve AAPI communities, will each carry the
  message of hope and recovery to at least 10 people. More than 12,500 people in
  overlooked AAPI communities will get support to reduce loneliness and mental
  health issues, grieve the losses of the pandemic, find jobs and cope with
  discrimination. The monthly trainings and associated website and social media
  will generate compassion and understanding that will reduce anti-Asian
  sentiment, hate crimes and violence, as well as inspiring others to replicate
  the project. (Little Tokyo Services Center has already expressed interest in
  replicating our program for social workers.)
