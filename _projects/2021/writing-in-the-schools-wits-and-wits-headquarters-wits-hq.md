title: Writing in the Schools (WITS) and WITS Headquarters (WITS HQ)
project_summary: >-
  In WITS, published poets visit LA Title I schools and teach students the art
  of writing poetry. At the end of the school year, one poem from each student
  is printed in a professionally bound anthology, theirs to keep at no charge.
  WITS will enable 600 young students to channel their inner Amanda Gorman and
  come to an after-school program at Red Hen Press’s workshop space (WITS HQ) to
  study, unwind, and learn about writing, books, and the publishing industry in
  academic year 2022–2023.

What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  WITS was founded in 2003 out of Red Hen Press Editor Dr. Kate Gale’s
  experience with parenting. A single mother of two kids, she was surprised to
  learn that there was practically no arts instruction in Title I schools, and
  high school graduation rates were at 72.5% (per LAUSD). Fortunately, her
  neighborhood's public school had a magnet arts program. When Gale realized the
  only thing anchoring her son in school was the theater class he loved, she
  determined that Red Hen had to make it part of its mission to get arts into
  Title I schools. After WITS’s first year, school teachers told Gale, “These
  kids have gotten a taste of achievement. They’ll never drop out now.” Says
  Gale, “Every child that gets excited because of that book they carry around
  with their own work printed in it, that’s success.” According to the CA Arts
  Education Data Project, in 2018, graduation rates were up to 81.8%. WITS will
  continue to inspire young minds until every LA child excels in and finishes
  school.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  WITS places published poets in classrooms to work with predominantly
  underserved students for one hour a week for six weeks. Students are exposed
  to poetry not offered in standard curricula, gain an understanding of
  different poetic forms, and express themselves by writing poetry of their own.
  Each student submits a polished poem, which is published in a professionally
  bound anthology, theirs to take home at no cost. Red Hen created WITS poetry
  textbooks, which students also keep. School teachers coordinate lesson plans
  with the WITS workshops to provide continuity throughout the semester. In this
  way, the WITS program is woven into students’ overall education and becomes
  more than an extracurricular activity. Students benefit by working with
  professional poets, being encouraged to express themselves while learning
  college-level English language skills, and experiencing the joy and sense of
  achievement that comes with having one’s work published. Red Hen Press is
  uniquely positioned to offer such a program, having a diverse range of poets
  eager to share their craft. WITS HQ will be an after-school program for high
  school students to visit Red Hen’s workshop space for a quiet and safe place
  to study, write, and explore the publishing industry. Participating youth will
  receive tutoring and engage in community service, field trips, and enrichment
  activities. WITS HQ will also host open mic nights and student book clubs
  (books provided at no cost)!
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  WITS teachers, school teachers, and students are polled through pre- and
  post-workshop surveys. Student evaluations include quantifiable questions
  about confidence in writing and public speaking, understanding of vocabulary,
  and interest in poetry, in addition to short answers about teacher
  effectiveness, etc. Teacher surveys include short answer questions about
  student performance, the relationship between workshops and the curriculum,
  and the effectiveness of the WITS teacher to encourage CA State Educational
  Standards. Comments include: “descriptive language use has flourished, and is
  evident in their classroom writing,” “confidence in writing has soared,” and
  “thank you for opening the world of creative writing. They will never forget
  this experience.” Of students surveyed, 69% felt more comfortable in a
  classroom environment, 70% developed an interest in writing poetry, and 77% of
  students reported improvement in their writing ability after participating in
  WITS.

Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  In the 2019–2020, WITS served 244 students from LA Title I schools (300 are
  projected for 20–21), serving a majority Latinx population. Bringing authors
  into classrooms opens the door to the arts and literature for kids. A grant of
  this size would enable the hiring of a new staff position fully devoted to
  WITS; the increase in workshops to 12 per year in 10 schools, reaching
  approximately 600 students annually; the purchase of additional textbooks; and
  increased instructing artist stipends (internationally renowned authors Doug
  Kearney and Chris Abani taught for WITS, and we continue to have high quality
  WITS instructors). The grant would also help implement WITS HQ with additional
  necessary equipment, increasing academic achievement as well as knowledge of
  career and life choice potentials, community issues, and civil rights. Youth
  will be provided a safe space to build self-esteem and mature intellectually
  and socially.
