title: Access! Outdoor Sculpture in West LA
project_summary: >-
  Outdoor sculpture on view in the Murphy Sculpture Garden at UCLA, the Beverly
  Gardens Park, and Century City is free to the public. There are no public
  guides to these adjacent art installations. Our guide will provide accessible
  engagement with art for all audiences in various formats: audio & written
  guides, QR codes, video highlights, & family activities. Access! Outdoor
  Sculpture in West LA will encourage the public to safely enjoy art in outdoor
  spaces and serve as a template for additional guides to explore art in other
  LA neighborhoods.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Westside
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  There is public art throughout Los Angeles, most of it is under-utilized.
  We've identified a cluster of three outdoor sculpture parks in West LA (as a
  case study) that offers free access to fine art, yet they are rarely visited
  by people other than by residents in the adjacent neighborhoods. Our goals are
  manifold: encourage people from neighborhoods across LA to enjoy art in
  outdoor spaces; develop a guide for all audiences (adults, youth, family) to
  engage with art in meaningful ways. Guide formats will be designed for various
  levels of art knowledge and compliant with ADA guidelines. Participants will
  learn about the art and about the history of West LA's neighborhoods where the
  outdoor sculpture is found, from Beverly Hills and Century City to the campus
  of UCLA. We envision this project Access! Outdoor Sculpture in West LA as a
  pilot that can serve as a model for similar accessible guides to public art
  found in other LA neighborhoods, for example in downtown LA and South LA.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Art Muse initiated the outdoor sculpture project in January 2021 with the idea
  of encouraging the public to make better use of outdoor art spaces. In this
  way we encourage art appreciation in open-air environments during the covid-19
  pandemic when restricted admission to museums and other arts institutions is
  enforced. Our plan is to determine the content and format for the guide over
  the spring and summer by researching best practices for visitor engagement
  with public art collections (audio and written guides, QR codes, video
  highlights, and family activities). We will begin working on the research and
  organization of the West LA outdoor sculpture guide in the fall by writing
  content and with design discussions. Art Muse Academy is in communication with
  the Century City Chamber of Commerce and The Arts Council, the City of Beverly
  Hills Art & Cultural Events, and the Hammer Museum to ensure the project is
  endorsed by these organizations. Art Muse Academy has been granted a Getty
  Marrow 2021 summer intern who will devote 10 weeks to research and contribute
  to the initial development of the West LA Public Sculpture Guide. We will
  consult with artists working with the Arts & Disability Program at UCLA as
  well as organizations focused on specific disabilities: visually impaired,
  deaf and hard of hearing, and mobility. If funding is secured, we will
  schedule monthly weekend get-togethers for community and family groups,
  starting with pilot programs in the early 2022.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Coordination, cooperation, and input. Our first measure of success for this
  new project is to establish coordinated, open lines of communication with and
  among the various stakeholders which currently include the Century City
  Chamber of Commerce, The Arts Council, City of Beverly Hills Art & Cultural
  Events, and the Hammer Museum. With their input and knowledge of each other's
  commitment to the project, the final West LA outdoor sculpture access will
  reflect cooperation within the community as a whole. Another measure of
  success is to solicit input from a group of consultants-- artists, educators,
  disability advocates, and specialists-- to inform the design and content of
  the guide and its formats in order to effectively address special needs for
  people with disabilities. And finally, we will test the guides with invited
  focus groups to determine effectiveness and areas for refinement before
  launching the public Access! Outdoor Sculpture in West LA.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '50'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '500'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Access! Outdoor Sculpture in West LA will stimulate access to fine art for all
  Angelenos as well as visitors to our city. Participants will learn about their
  city's neighborhoods through visits to public art venues, starting with West
  LA. These visits will be enhanced by informative, engaging guides, offered in
  a variety of formats in order to offer access to art for all people. In
  particular, the formats of the guides will be developed to give access to
  public art for people with disabilities by addressing particular needs such as
  verbal descriptions and "touch" tours for the visually impaired and
  identifying particular sculpture that can be easily approached for those
  participants with mobility disabilities. We will consult with specialists to
  confirm the sculpture is placed in accordance with ADA guidelines. Ultimately,
  Access! will celebrate the public arts found in the parks and open spaces of
  Los Angeles.
