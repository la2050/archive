title: Improving Air Quality at LAX by Reducing Employee Traffic
project_summary: >-
  LAX was the third-busiest airport in the world in 2019, and with more
  travelers returning to the skies, tens of thousands of airport workers will
  once again commute to the airport on a daily basis. LAX is a 24/7 operation
  with 50,000+ badged employees, and approximately 75% of those employees drive
  alone to work. That's A LOT of cars on the road, and that's why LAWA is
  launching commuteLAX, a Transportation Management Organization (TMO) designed
  to help LAX employees find alternative modes of transportation to ease their
  commute to work.

'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Traffic in Los Angeles and around Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) has
  been a known issue for decades, contributing to highway and roadway
  congestion, affecting local air quality, and causing stress for both the
  traveler and commuter. In 2019, an average of 97,248 vehicles entered the
  airport daily, dropping to 46,915 in 2020. As Angelenos ease back into air
  travel and LAX employees return to work, the airport has a unique opportunity
  to get ahead of this expected surge. With construction of the People Mover and
  other airport access improvement programs underway, we have developed
  commuteLAX to encourage employees to leave their cars at home and use
  alternative commute options like transit, carpools, vanpool, and active
  transportation programs. commuteLAX is a monumental step forward to help LAX
  bounce back stronger than before. Changing our travel mindset and commute
  behavior, one employee at a time.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  commuteLAX will serve as a one-stop shop for transportation information,
  resources, and services for all LAX employees and employers, including
  airlines, concessionaires, and contractors. The commuteLAX service will
  officially launch in Summer 2021 and offer employee commute programs such as
  personalized transit trip planning, carpool and vanpool matching, secure bike
  lockers, and public bike racks. The grant will be used to expand our vanpool
  fleet, offset the cost of monthly vanpool fares, host annual campaigns for
  events like Rideshare Week and Earth Day, and incentivize alternative commute
  trips by providing discounted or free transit passes, gift cards, gas cards,
  car washes, and Guaranteed Ride Home trips, which are available for commuteLAX
  participants who experience an emergency and need to get home right away.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Employees who participate in commuteLAX will report their alternative commute
  trips, we will in turn be able to track and calculate vehicle miles, gallons
  of gas, and emissions saved. This data will be collected on a monthly basis
  and used to calculate environmental impacts and track the success of the
  program. Our short-term goal in the first year is to bring awareness of the
  program to employees and guide them to alternative commute options. Our
  long-term goal is to reduce employee trips to the airport by 20 percent.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '50000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '260696'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Historically, the perennial joke in Los Angeles is that the greatest act of
  friendship is to pick someone up at LAX. Imagine making that drive every
  workday. We want to lessen that burden on our employees by improving their
  quality of life while reducing traffic and our carbon footprint. As a
  notoriously congested employment center within LA County, we must focus on
  changing employee travel behavior by encouraging and incentivizing the use of
  alternative commute modes as employees return to work. With the 2022 NFL Super
  Bowl, 2022 MLB All-Star Game, the 2028 Olympic and Para-Olympic Games, and
  other large-scale events coming to Los Angeles and surrounding cities, LAX
  will be the first stop for many visitors. Our efforts will help improve
  traffic for travelers, employees, and the nearby community. Reducing traffic
  at the airport is one of the ways we'll serve our community, ending the joke
  by making it irrelevant.
