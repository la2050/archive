title: Reimagining Mental Health Access for Youth
project_summary: >-
  Changeist will pilot a model of mental health support that could be replicated
  by other out-of-school time organizations, that provides youth participants
  with easy access to a suite of high quality mental health services, free of
  charge. We are contracting a team of mental health professionals to support
  the learning of mentors and will be “on-call” for emergency and ongoing needs
  of youth, including counseling, mental health first aid training, and
  facilitated reflection for the community around impactful current events.

project_video: ''
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Changeist is a place for young people to come together to dig into social
  justice issues affecting our communities, all while gaining a greater
  understanding of their own identities and where they fit into making change.
  It’s hard work. Our young people are often dealing with incredible challenges
  of their own, and our college-aged mentors are often tasked with leading
  difficult conversations around current events that they themselves are
  wrapping their heads around. These challenges are further exacerbated by
  COVID-19’s impact, and limited access to support systems our youth need. The
  coordination with schools, families, providers, and insurance can take too
  long, and cause a young person to give up on the process. This suite of
  services and team of contracted professionals will allow our staff to provide
  youth with the services they need, at the time they need them, with fewer
  barriers. It also allows for an array of service options and providers to find
  the right fit for each youth.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Changeist plans to invest in a strategy that reimagines mental health access
  for our youth. For our 2021-22 program, we will contract a suite of mental
  health professionals that will be “on-call” for the following needs: -
  Immediate and free (to youth) access to mental health professionals for youth
  with emergency needs, including counseling services - Proactive mental health
  first aid training for staff and college-aged mentors - Facilitated reflection
  sessions for mentors periodically throughout the year and especially when
  impactful events occur (ie. violence toward racial groups, school shootings)
  We believe this strategy will uniquely allow us to address mental health needs
  in our community. This suite of professionals will allow us to respond more
  quickly to youth needs, while also strengthening our capacity as leaders to
  support our community during challenging times. We think this strategy will be
  more beneficial than bringing on a single staff member because it will allow
  us to contract professionals with different specialties and identities that
  will better serve more of our youth. It also allows us to truly measure the
  needs and costs associated with those needs, for future years.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  To date, we have identified some needs within our community and have begun
  talking with professionals that are interested in the contract work. Some
  things we’ll be assessing are below: 1. Tracking programmatic needs for mental
  health support 2. Measuring response rates - how quickly we were able to
  connect and provide young people and mentors with the services they needed 3.
  Understanding how prepared mentors and staff feel to address/escalate mental
  health needs of youth 4. Understanding how mentors feel about having a trained
  professional facilitate reflections and team discussions 5. Learning from the
  pilot -- What are the gaps in this strategy? Are the total funds we need to
  serve youth realistic for future fundraising? Do we have the correct policies
  in place to manage the strategy? Is this strategy replicable?
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '70'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '350'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  We hope to pilot a strategy that could be replicated at other youth programs
  that don’t already serve the mental health needs of their participants. Youth
  programs are often the place where young people feel connected to adult
  mentors, especially if they don’t already find that in school or at home. This
  strategy could allow youth programs to serve youth with mental health needs,
  no matter what the program’s mission. If our young people enter adulthood with
  a better practice of attending to their mental health needs, they will be more
  satisfied and successful people, making change in LA County.
