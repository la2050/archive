title: Help Foster Youth Students Address Food Insecurity
project_summary: >-
  Foster Nation’s Meal Nation program fights food insecurity for LA’s most
  vulnerable population - older foster youth. Many students don’t have access to
  the food resources they relied on before campus closures, and they have also
  lost critical income due to impacts of the pandemic. We know that having a
  meal is essential to educational success. Our goal is to ensure foster youth
  have at least one meal a day for 30-60 days, and the know-how to access public
  benefits like CalFresh in order to help them meet their basic needs beyond
  this program.

  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Foster youth are in the highest need bracket when it comes to accessing
  resources during the COVID-19 crisis. In a virtual town hall for foster youth
  hosted in March 2020, by John Burton Advocates for Youth, Children’s Bureau
  and Think of Us, access to food was identified as the number one priority for
  transition-age foster youth. Due to the lockdown and campus closures across
  the nation, foster youth students have lost critical sources of income and
  access to food because students no longer have access to the on-campus jobs,
  meal vouchers and pantries they relied on for daily sustenance. Within the
  first few weeks of the lockdown, it became apparent that foster youth students
  were disproportionately affected by this pandemic, much more than their peers
  who had familial ties or support networks to turn to.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Meal Nation provides foster youth students with a meal a day for 30-60 days
  and helps foster youth access CalFresh. Our program includes 3 key components:
  meal delivery, meal pick-up, grocery gift cards. The program is entirely free
  to participants, and the average meal cost is $8.50. We work alongside our
  program partners Freshly, Not Impossible Labs (NIL), Rise and Guardian
  Scholars, college campus support programs for foster youth. Prioritizing
  nutritious food was important because we recognized this might be the only
  meal a student has access to on any given day. We partnered with Freshly to
  deliver healthy prepared meals weekly to youth with stable housing that lack
  access to transportation. Our partnership with NIL leverages technology that
  allows foster youth to order healthy meals from thousands of local restaurants
  using basic text messaging. This serves students without stable housing who
  may be living in their car or in a shelter. To see the model and technology,
  visit bit.ly/fosternil. The grocery card option provides a weekly $50
  e-grocery card to students with dietary restrictions or other special needs,
  and we require grocery receipts before we issue a new card. We realize 30-60
  days of meals will not solve food insecurity for this population, so our
  partnership with the nonprofit Rise provides Student Navigators who give 1:1
  assistance with CalFresh enrollment to ensure our participants have a
  long-term solution to address hunger.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Meal Nation measures its program outcomes by collecting feedback directly from
  foster youth students 25 days into receiving meals, and again when they exit
  the program. In order to assess our work and ensure quality service-delivery,
  we ask our students to provide feedback on several key measures: food quality,
  enrollment, level of anxiety around hunger, motivation to stay in school,
  whether they feel cared for and supported, and whether the program had an
  impact on their lives. We also provide an open-ended question for foster youth
  to share how the service can be improved. The program has served over 1,300
  unique foster youth across California, and based on survey responses, 89% of
  foster youth say that the program decreased their anxiety about where their
  next meal was coming from. 86% say the program helped them stay motivated to
  keep up with schoolwork. 95% say the program made them feel cared for and
  supported. And 86% say the program had a positive impact on their lives.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '368'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '368'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Foster youth in LA County were already experiencing a high prevalence of food
  insecurity and the pandemic only made the situation worse. Our intended impact
  is to address food insecurity in an immediate and long-term way. LA County is
  responsible for the welfare of foster youth – and has the largest foster youth
  population in the country. We all must ensure that foster youth have equitable
  opportunities to thrive. The impact of this program empowers LA County to
  remove barriers to success so that foster youth can focus on what matters
  most: getting an education and finding a career path in order to lead
  self-sufficient lives. Our program exemplifies a model of how we can support
  foster youth and create a healthier and more hopeful Los Angeles for people to
  move from just surviving to thriving – from impossible to I’m possible.
