  The program is a case management approach that addresses all aspects of a

  by reducing recidivism. The case management method allows the participant to
  remain engaged throughout the services such as one-on-one and family meetings
  which allow the participant to take control and responsibility for his/her
  life. As part of the case management approach, plans of action, goal setting,
  and introspection are developed to support their vision for the future.
  Resilient prepares them to finish their education and work towards a career
  for a purposeful life. Resilient collaborates with local stakeholders and
  other community based organizations that provide our participants with
  employment, paid internship, and paid career/skill training before
  transitioning them to their future careers in whatever field they have chosen.

  The overall vision for success of the Re-entry, and Covid relief services
  program will be to reduce recidivism and improve the quality of life for the
  families and individuals in the South LA area. Additionally, we will
  contribute to reducing the number of individuals being incarcerated in the
  area utilizing the re-entry outreach strategies. Resilient understands that
  the incarceration rate and other hardships communities experience in South LA
  are real issues, not only because of statistics, or media coverage, but
  because the Resilient team have experienced these realities and work
  tirelessly every day to improve the lives of young people and their families
  dealing with these same realities. The funding of the program will be the seed
  that grows to bring safety and a brighter future in South LA.
