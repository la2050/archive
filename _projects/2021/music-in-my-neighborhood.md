title: Music in My Neighborhood
project_summary: >-
  With support from LA2050, Neighborhood Music School (NMS) will help students
  access the transformative power of arts education through high quality,
  low-cost music lessons on a wide variety of instruments led by caring mentors
  and over 107 years of community enrichment. Together we will remove financial
  barriers, place violins in hands, pianos in homes and create vibrant
  communities filled with music, self-expression, and connection.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - East LA
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  NMS addresses the lack of access to high quality, low-cost one-to-one music
  education in Boyle Heights and surrounding communities. 93% of Boyle Heights
  residents identify as Latinx and 86% of households are Spanish speaking with a
  median income of $36,451. Less than 38% of students in K-5th Grade have access
  to music education through their schools yet we know that low-income students
  who are highly engaged in the arts are twice as likely to graduate college as
  their peers with no arts education. Hispanic students lack access to quality
  arts education as compared to their White peers. Therefore, we remove barriers
  so that every student can explore their unique journey and gain transferrable
  skills through one-to-one music lessons on a variety of instruments led by
  caring, qualified, mentor teaching artists. The arts are a right and not a
  privilege.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Although tuition is designed to be affordable, many of our families are unable
  to pay $68 per month and almost half of our students currently receive
  financial assistance ranging from a 25-90% reduction in tuition. In
  partnership with LA2050, we will award more scholarships than ever before so
  that more students can experience the transformative benefits of music
  education. Students will meet their teaching artist either in person or via
  Zoom for a weekly 30-minute lesson on an instrument of their choice. Students
  can learn piano, violin, cello, voice, guitar, drums, sax, trumpet, ukulele
  and more. We also understand the importance of students having their own
  instrument upon which to practice and perform, so we provide instruments
  through our low-cost rental program. For only $10 per month, we will deliver a
  piano to the students’ home and cover all costs associated with moving and
  tuning. We also provide instruments like cellos and violins in various sizes
  so that as students grow, we can ensure they are working with appropriately
  sized instruments. NMS students receive approximately 48 lessons annually.
  Throughout the year, recitals, community events and performances will give
  students the opportunity to share their newfound skills and connect to the
  larger community. Teaching artists serve as mentors and work individually with
  each student and craft a personalized plan to meet artistic, musical and
  performance benchmarks.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  This is an existing program and our model has created deep impact for over a
  century. We measure our impact by the technical and performance skills each
  student demonstrates. Students have many opportunities to share their talents
  with a larger community. In class they work on specific compositions to build
  proficiency and comfort. Once students feel confident enough to play for
  others, they participate in Showtime!, a gentle first step to the stage. Once
  students progress, they work on longer, more challenging compositions to
  present in NMS Recitals and community events. Advanced students are given
  opportunities to perform in NMS ensembles at private and civic events. In
  February 2020, NMS students performed at Idyllwild Arts Sustainability
  Symposium with Idyllwild students and Lakota Strings. We also measure our
  impact by the quality and quantity of community engagement and sustained and
  increased enrollment.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '400'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '5000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  When students have access to high quality instruction led by mentors, the
  whole community of LA benefits. Students take pride and care in their
  investment, while sharing individual and collective journeys through music.
  The power of accessible arts education at every level of development is the
  focus of much study, yet neighborhoods with lower income tend to be left
  behind. NMS was founded in 1914 to lift that barrier and, in 2021, we continue
  to lift barriers to access and engage connection to experiences that transform
  the individual student and the collective community. Music education
  facilitates development in fine motor skills, reading, repetition, and
  performance. In doing so, students learn how to apply music skills to academic
  and life challenges. All families deserve the dignity to provide their
  children with arts opportunities that help shape their identity and goals. Our
  goal is for all students to have caring mentors lead them through their
  artistic and personal journeys.
