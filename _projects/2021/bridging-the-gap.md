title: Bridging the Gap
project_summary: >-
  Founded by a Black woman in 2009, KITS empowers foster youth to heal from
  trauma through the arts. Now, KITS is launching a Production Studio for a
  Cause to change the current trajectory of youth in foster care by increasing
  career readiness, social capital & personal wellness. Operating as a social
  enterprise, KITS will use the tools & labor income of the entertainment
  industry to provide racial & economic equity to LA’s most underserved youth
  through workplace training in – & the artistic outlet of – filmmaking & other
  creative industries.

'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  The foster care system is a pipeline feeding the prison system, homeless
  population, unemployment, and our country's mental health epidemic. Over
  35,000 foster youth live in LA County, 40% of whom end up in jail, homeless or
  dead within 3 years of aging out of the system. Only 55% graduated high school
  in 2020 (compared to a rate of 87% by their peers), less than 4% earn a
  college degree by age 25, and almost half are unemployed 8 years after leaving
  foster care. Even the most unconscionable data – 90% of youth with 5+
  placements will enter the justice system, and foster youth are 3-5 times more
  likely to commit suicide than same-age peers – showcase the disservice done to
  those in the child welfare system. These figures represent LA's foster youth
  and who they will become without keen intervention to combat their
  debilitating trauma. Unaddressed, it leads to a range of psychological and
  emotional challenges negatively impacting their growth, life skills & coping
  skills.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  KITS will create & launch the first-ever Production Studio for a Cause [PSFAC]
  designed for foster youth, ages 18-24. As the entertainment industry is
  responsible for over 640,500 jobs in LA County, resulting in over $58.8
  billion in labor income, it is here where 8.4% of LA's estimated annual gross
  will be used as a catalyst for systemic change in foster care outcomes. The
  PSFAC will operate 7 days a week as an innovative learning, vocational &
  social enterprise facility for transitional age youth to have an artistic
  outlet. The PSFAC is a safe place where youth have continuous access to the
  arts to generate content while being gainfully employed – providing a creative
  space to heal, create animated & live-action content, and learn the intricate
  details of business management, technology, film equipment, budgeting &
  behavior therapy – through the art of filmmaking. Clients like DCFS will hire
  our youth to create PSAs & other content. Industry professionals will also pay
  it forward by renting one or more of the 15-20 production sets to create their
  motion pictures, episodic shows & other media content for TV & film projects
  while hiring our youth, identified as young professionals [YP], to work on
  their projects. We are ultimately bridging the gap between 2 major entities
  impacting our local economy. The PSFAC will be the intersection of arts,
  technology & wellness for present & former foster youth, redirecting the
  trajectory from adversity [as stated in Q7] to achievement.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  The PSFAC was first envisioned by KITS, after serving various group homes in
  LA County. As KITS connected with youth who were in agencies for several
  years, with the uncertainty & instability of the system, and every upheaval of
  a new placement &/or school, it was clear; they needed real opportunities to
  not just prepare for aging out, but to be empowered to be self-sufficient as
  they did. By building industry partnerships, KITS was able to provide youth
  paid internships, scholarships to screenwriting programs & production jobs,
  preparing us for this next step. Our metrics to evaluate outcomes of the PSFAC
  include collecting "Wrap Recaps" from industry clients & teaching team members
  at the wrap of every project recording YP progress, as well as pre- &
  post-surveys from YPs & industry professionals to assess gains in job skills,
  planning, self-control, social awareness, focus & adaptability. We will verify
  success by YP growth in social capital [life/coping skills] & personal
  wellness.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '433'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '500560'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Our intended impact will be evident in LA County as we change the negative
  trajectory of low-socioeconomic & underrepresented youth by giving them the
  skills to retain employment, achieve their goals, and become leaders in their
  communities. The LA2050 grant will be used to create a detailed design model,
  market analysis, data analysis & an implementation strategy to launch the
  studio. With the labor income produced by the entertainment industry annually,
  our PSFAC will serve long-term as a launch pad for our YPs to earn an income
  while gaining production & business experience in the industry, as youth get
  hands-on sector-based job training from the industry professionals who will be
  renting the space. It will also serve as a space to create, write, & film
  personal projects. The studio will provide racial & cultural equity to foster
  youth most often overlooked by society, ending traditional outcomes of job
  insecurity, food insecurity & homelessness among aged-out foster youth.
