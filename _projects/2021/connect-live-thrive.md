In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Opportunity (OY) populations need connections to online job and training
  resources. OY in LA are disproportionately Black and Hispanic (almost 80% of
  all OY); live in low-income neighborhoods; & face important barriers to job
  access such as disconnections and labor market discrimination. Barriers to
  economic inclusion for OY in LA include: lack of home internet access; limited
  social networks (outside of low-income communities); and greater connections
  to online job searching info, platforms & skills. The LA2050 report found that
  entry level jobs (likely to be appropriate for OY) are clustered in several
  regions including the LAX area, Downtown LA, West. L.A., and Hollywood.
  Findings suggest a mismatch between regions with many OY and regions with the
  best employment opportunities for that population. The vast majority of youth,
  including at-risk and homeless youth, use the I-net frequently, while
  frequency, use & skills vary dramatically by socioeconomic status, race &
  gender.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  This project will, utilizing a culturally responsive approach, creatively
  expose OY to: 1) social and emotional learning skills; 2) real life examples
  of engaged youth, via the provision of Millennial Mentors; and 3) access to
  entry level jobs in the City of Los Angeles, particularly the LAX area.
  Project activities will include: 1) purposeful life training skills; 2)
  clinical support; 3) college and career sampling, exploration, and placement;
  4) mentoring support; and 5) technology training (including meaningful social
  media contacts and greater connections to online job searching information,
  platforms, and skills). Outcomes from this partnership may include: paid
  internships, mentorships and educational opportunities; access to career
  assessment and job matching technologies; work force skills development and
  private sector job opportunities; and/or a 2-year free college experience.
  Partnerships and consultants will support the following activities: social and
  emotional learning; technology and college/career training; and social
  engagement opportunities. Participants will be recruited via public community
  & social media announcements and solicitations to South LA community-based
  organizations. Selection criteria will invite students to post video
  applications. All applications from participants that agree to program
  requirements will be accepted until the maximum is reached.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
