title: STEM FOR ALL SEASONS
project_summary: >-
  What do you get from a group of passionate STEM providers faced with a
  pandemic and students stuck at home? STEM for All Seasons! Leading LA STEM
  organizations have come together in the ExpandLA network to provide
  coordinated STEM learning to thousands of students. By working
  collaboratively, the program provides under-resourced students access to
  unique STEM experiences, nurturing curiosity and empowering self-development
  through hands-on learning activities that highlight the rich STEM assets of
  LA. Help us continue in the next school year.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
  - LAUSD (select only if you have a district-wide partnership or project)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  LA is a region of remarkable diversity, yet diversity and opportunity rarely
  intersect. Students from marginalized communities lack access to robust
  out-of-school STEM learning experiences that expand their awareness of STEM.
  This exposure can equip children with skills and connections needed to benefit
  from a shifting economy. A study by WestEd, the Lawrence Hall of Science and
  SRI International showed that 40% of elementary teachers spend 60 min. or less
  teaching science each week and only 33% say they feel prepared to teach
  science. It also found that only 44% of principals believe it is likely for
  students to receive high-quality science instruction in their schools. The
  study showed that high-quality teaching requires specialized materials and
  experiences that schools are strapped to provide. The study was done
  pre-pandemic; COVID19 and its impact on the lives and education of LA’s youth
  created an even more urgent need to support the STEM learning and well-being
  of students.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  A group of LA STEM organizations, working through network organization
  ExpandLA, responded to the COVID19 crisis and created a program to increase
  access to STEM experiences to thousands of youth from marginalized
  communities. Called Season of STEM, the program has delivered STEM-based
  curriculum and enrichment programs to about 80,000 LAUSD students since its
  inception. This spring we served about 730 classrooms. This proposal aims to
  grow the program’s reach to an additional 300 classrooms for a total of 1,000
  each season. The intent is to expand the program from LAUSD to countywide. The
  program will continue the unprecedented coordination of the work of the STEM
  organizations around common goals and practices, while providing STEM learning
  both as after-school enrichment and, more significantly, as part of the
  regular, core school day. Collaborating with teachers and building upon the
  methods of STEM learning proven effective this year, providers will reach as
  many upper elementary students from marginalized communities as possible with
  a hybrid approach that offers access through live, online platforms combined
  with customized asynchronous resources and featuring in-person STEM learning
  experiences either at students’ locations or provider sites, per County and
  District health guidelines. Recognizing the needs of students after a year of
  disruption, the program will also integrate social-emotional learning with
  STEM, emphasizing the natural connections between them.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Since 2020, the Season of STEM program has brought together STEM providers
  around LA, including major science museums and small STEM non-profits, to
  serve about 80,000 students in LAUSD, the country’s second-largest school
  district, as it dealt with the disruption in student learning. The program
  provided coordinated STEM learning both as after-school enrichment and, more
  significantly, as part of the regular, core school day, delivering synchronous
  online experiences, and brand new asynchronous resources. To date Season of
  STEM has covered Summer 2020, Fall 2020, and Spring 2021 semesters, in
  partnership with LAUSD. A comprehensive evaluation looking at teacher, student
  and provider impacts is currently underway. Preliminary survey results
  indicate that 93% of teachers rated the program as excellent and 87% felt that
  the program was effective in engaging students.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '30000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '330'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  With a coordinated network of out-of-school time (OST) STEM providers under
  ExplandLA, Greater Los Angeles will gain and achieve a few critical goals: 1.
  significantly increase access and exposure to STEM experiences for youth from
  marginalized communities; 2. expanding the local collaborative network of STEM
  organizations; 3. opening up opportunities to partner with LAUSD and other
  organizations in an unprecedented way. The proposed program under the ExpandLA
  initiative aims to provide STEM-based instruction to 1,000 classes in Greater
  Los Angeles each season. With the continued coordination between STEM
  providers, that professional community will be strengthened, creating
  opportunities to engage more students and other members of the public.
  Additionally, Expand LA looks to encourage the growth and reach of a more
  diverse set of community STEM providers, offering new or early-stage OST
  organizations the chance to expand their reach in the new school year.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  By design, Expand LA aims to support, connect, and advocate for out-of-school
  time (OST) programs in the Greater Los Angeles area. The initiative’s main
  thrust is to remove barriers that currently exist so students can easily
  access rich programs that help develop each student’s understanding of the
  world around them. By strengthening these programs, ExpandLA can help ensure
  that all children and youth in Los Angeles benefit from OST programs that
  nurture their thirst for knowledge and creative pursuit and help them grow
  into the best versions of themselves.
