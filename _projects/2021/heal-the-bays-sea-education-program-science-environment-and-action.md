In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - South LA
  - South Bay
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  The Heal the Bay Aquarium, which is located underneath the Santa Monica Pier,
  traditionally hosts 100,000 visitors annually. Due to COVID-19, the Aquarium
  temporarily closed its doors to the public and suspended its traditional STEM
  education and field trip programs in March 2020. The SEA Education Program,
  which is a high-quality marine science education series now offered through a
  virtual format, was created last summer in part because of public health
  mandates issued by Los Angeles County and a commitment to serve as a no-cost
  educational resource for a vulnerable student and teacher population. To
  ensure continued impact, Heal the Bay will secure grant support and waive
  program access fees for underserved Los Angeles County-based youth, including
  students attending Title 1 schools - schools receiving federal funds to
  support low-income students – and members of youth-serving organizations
  (e.g., Boys & Girls Club).
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  The SEA Education Program seeks to improve science proficiency, foster equity,
  advance academic enrichment and enhance students’ social-emotional growth by
  ensuring: Virtual classes include structured lessons about the marine
  environment, stewardship, and “visits” to the Heal the Bay Aquarium and the
  beach environment just outside the facility’s doors; Los Angeles County-based
  students (3rd-5th grade) have access to the Program, regardless of income,
  through the support of foundations; Los Angeles County-based students have
  access to the Aquarium’s educational offerings via a user-friendly virtual
  platform that is conducive to learning and facilitates meaningful interaction;
  Program curriculum meets California State Science Standards and supports Next
  Generation Science Standards, Ocean Literacy Principles, and International
  Society for Technology in Education standards; Curriculum mitigates potential
  learning loss caused by COVID-19-related disruptions to education delivery;
  Teachers have access to resources that help integrate the experience into
  lesson plans; Students have an opportunity to participate in online exercises
  that promote scientific inquiry and inspire problem solving; Students have
  access to a safe learning environment that values curiosity and enthusiasm
  over “knowing the right answer”; Messaging reinforces students’ sense of
  purpose as important stewards of the ocean, future scientists, and the next
  generation of environmental leaders.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Impact will be measured in the following ways: The number of
  schools/educators/youth-serving organizations engaged via targeted outreach
  including direct email communication and listserv networks (80% of those
  reached will know about the program and its goals after the first year); The
  number of students enrolled in the SEA Education Program (50% of those
  contacted will successfully enroll in program within six months); Active
  student participation during SEA Education Program sessions (95% of
  participants will actively engage in the online session); Retention of
  students over a course of SEA Education Program sessions (90% of participants
  will actively engage in the online session over the multi-session course);
  Participating educators will indicate the content enhances classroom-based
  science lessons and STEM proficiency (100% of participants will be asked to
  provide feedback on curriculum and program delivery).
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '6000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '500'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Building on Heal the Bay’s successful track record of creating opportunities
  for lifelong learning, the SEA Education Program will improve science
  proficiency (STEM education) among some the region’s most vulnerable students
  in Los Angeles. Heal the Bay’s experience in the community education space has
  resulted in strong relationships with a broad network of partner schools,
  districts, educators, youth-serving organizations and aquaria. These
  relationships will ensure Heal the Bay has ongoing access to its target
  student and teacher populations, especially underserved youth. The Program is
  also scalable and will be adapted to include a hybrid delivery model once
  in-person instruction is deemed safe.
