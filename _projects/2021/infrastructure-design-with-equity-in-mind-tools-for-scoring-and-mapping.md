title: 'Infrastructure Design with Equity in Mind: Tools for Scoring and Mapping'
project_summary: >-
  Our aim is to create an Equity Infrastructure Scorecard that aids in mapping
  concentrations of (in)equitable infrastructure across the city. This mapping
  is the first step in transforming every city engineering project into a more
  equitable system of support for all Angelenos. Beginning with a pilot project
  for three select systems the aim is to develop a process that helps agencies
  1) understand and analyze existing infrastructural conditions, 2) identify
  gaps and needs, 3) direct resources, and 4) equalize access and distribution.

project_video: ''
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  The Bureau of Engineering invests millions of dollars each year engineering
  the stormwater, public parks, streets, and wastewater systems for all
  Angelenos, but aging infrastructure and uneven investment means that not every
  Angeleno has equitable access to basic infrastructure that supports a high
  quality of life. Too often, economically disadvantaged neighborhoods receive
  lower quality facilities or suffer through longer disruptions simply because,
  among other reasons, residents have less agency in the planning and
  decision-making process. The resulting landscape is uneven, yet how uneven and
  where that unevenness persists is not precisely known. An understanding of
  this uneven landscape, which requires better access to data, is the first step
  toward identifying need and increasing a more infrastructurally equitable
  city. This condition has been highlighted in the current pandemic, where
  access to space and connectivity in particular have favored the wealthy. It’s
  time to change that
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Inspired by Mayor Garcetti’s Executive Directive No. 27 and LA’s Green New
  Deal, Engineering hopes to spearhead a look outward, finding ways to better
  assess and transform our contribution to a more equitable built environment.
  The first step is to understand the existing condition by creating an
  Infrastructure Equity Scorecard, then use that knowledge to pinpoint areas of
  inequity through mapping, and, in the long run, work more closely with
  communities to build the systems that best serve their needs and bring all of
  LA’s infrastructure into the 21st century. Though data exists, bridging the
  silos between city agencies can be challenging. This project would create a
  team dedicated to a pilot mapping of three potentially interconnected systems
  -- sidewalks, stormwater, and parks and open space -- to model the scoring and
  mapping process for the City of LA. This Scorecard draws from existing
  sustainability assessment tools, which often only minimally focus on an
  equitable built environment, and tools and technology in development by our
  collaborators at Autocase. This collaborative Scorecard and Mapping would be
  the first step in Engineering’s objective to create a standard where every new
  infrastructure project is seen first through an equity lens.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  In the short term, the three measures of success include: 1) completion of
  research and gathering of data needed to fully analyze the current and
  historic conditions of the three systems; 2) establishing a set of metrics for
  the Scorecard; and 3) the completion of Infrastructure Equity Mapping to
  identify areas of most pressing need. Long-term successes include broad
  utilization of the mapping system for all five Bureau’s planning, design, and
  construction management activities to increase the level of infrastructure
  equity within Los Angeles. The mapping would also allow council districts and
  communities to leverage the equity mapping to procure additional resources and
  funding in historically under-served districts. The ultimate goal would be to
  have the Equity Infrastructure Scorecard and Mapping system applied across all
  city and county agencies. True success will come from realizing Engineering’s
  mission of delivering high quality services with equity in mind.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '450'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '4000000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  An equity-first focus will impact the practice of hundreds of engineers and
  millions of residents across the City of LA. The Infrastructure Equity
  Scorecard and Mapping will initiate a conversation with all our contracting
  agencies and across public works, impacting billions of dollars of
  construction projects in all council districts. In the long range, the project
  will lead to more equitable distribution of resources by foregrounding a
  process that tracks infrastructure gains and losses and will give voice and
  agency to historically under-served residents. The Scorecard and Mapping are
  the first steps to identify a baseline of infrastructure conditions and
  distribution. The ultimate goal is an interactive, publicly available and
  adaptable mapping and assessment tool, which allows designers, engineers and
  residents to be proactive in the face of rising wealth disparity and climate
  challenges, the sum of which are exponentially disastrous.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  Linda Samuels, Director of the Infrastructural Optimism LAb based in LA and
  St. Louis, will be a project manager, guide the project concept, and
  coordinate among partners, collaborators and agencies. As an urban design
  researcher, her work focuses on next generation infrastructure and leveraging
  infrastructure investment for greater social and environmental gain. The
  project research team will include experts assisting in the collection of data
  and spatial mapping. Simon Fowell, Principal Economist at Autocase, brings
  several years of experience building sustainability tools to support the
  collection of data and develop metrics. Their multi-criteria analysis systems
  currently help identify co-dependent disparities in systems such as transit,
  recreation, and healthcare.
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?: >-
  Access to the LA2050 community,Communications support,Capacity-building and
  training,Strategy assistance and implementation
