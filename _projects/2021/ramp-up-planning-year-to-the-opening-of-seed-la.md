title: Ramp-up Planning Year to the Opening of SEED LA!
project_summary: >-
  SEED LA will be the first public, college-preparatory boarding STEM high
  school in South Los Angeles for youth who truly need a nurturing, safe
  environment to achieve academic success, and attain economic independence to
  live their best life. For 20 years, SEED has implemented an innovative model
  that integrates a rigorous academic program with a nurturing boarding program

  grant funds to ramp-up to school opening in August 2022.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  A SEED school addresses two key opportunities in LA. Resilient youth served by
  LA County need an educational model with enhanced services not currently
  available in traditional schools. Concurrently, LA Metro estimate more than
  778,000 new jobs over the next 40 years. There are limited options for
  underrepresented youth to connect and prepare for the jobs. LA County provides
  welfare services for nearly 36,000 youth and supervises approximately 10,000
  youth through the Probation Department. LA County has determined these youth
  could benefit from an enhanced academic model that includes educational
  enrichment and intensive social services to attain graduation and career. In
  South LA 7% of local high school students are performing at grade level in
  math and 25-30% are at grade level in language arts. 58% of young people in
  foster care graduate from high school and only 3% from college. More
  staggering, 50% of young adults who age out of foster care end up homeless or
  incarcerated.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  SEED LA seeks to break the cycle of intergenerational poverty by enrolling
  youth who can benefit most. As chartered by LACOE, SEED LA will have a
  weighted lottery, giving priority admission to foster youth, homeless/housing
  insecure youth or have an immediate family member incarcerated. Students will
  come from families who qualify for free and reduced lunch program. SEED LA
  will offer two overarching programs, academic and student life. The academic
  program will offer STEM, college-readiness activities, will be WASC-accredited
  and all students will take A-G coursework. In partnership with LA Metro, SEED
  LA will incorporate curriculum and exposure to careers in global
  transportation infrastructure to create a pipeline of skilled graduates ready
  to pursue a range of opportunities. SEEDs student life program utilizes the
  gift of time, 120 hours each week. This extra time can be used on a variety of
  services, activities, or programming including HALLS (Habits for Achieving
  Life Long Success) curriculum, mental health checks, mentoring, remedial
  learning and extracurriculars like gardening, sports, theater, or clubs. Every
  SEED graduate has a staff member dedicated to their post-secondary success
  through SEED’s College Transition & Success (CTS) program. SEED’s CTS advisors
  assist with access to scholarships and emergency financial support, visit
  graduates at their colleges, and provide professional and personal development
  mentoring as part of the multi-faceted CTS approach.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  SEED programming works. The key metric is graduate rates from four-year
  colleges. 90% of SEED 9th graders graduate from high school. 94% of SEED
  graduates enroll in college. Students who attend “green” or “yellow” colleges,
  colleges that support first generation minority students, are graduating
  college at much higher rates (64%) than the national average (11%). 80% of
  SEED graduates are first-generation college students. There are very specific
  academic growth targets set forth in SEEDs charter. The first tool is Network
  Success Measures (NSM) and the second is School Improvement Plans (SIP). NSMs
  set benchmarks for success to establish accountability and set goals by
  capturing student and organizational performance in Math and ELA, Attendance,
  Student retention, Staff retention and College Application Rates. SIPs focus
  on priority work and align to SEED Network initiatives. These tools are guided
  by the schools Root Cause Analysis, school year vision, and are grounded in
  data.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '30'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '125'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  The impact of SEED LA to LA County is tangible. LA County spends $233,000 per
  youth annually for juvenile camps, SEED LA will cost $40,000 per student for
  housing and an excellent education. SEED LA’s ambitious goal is that 75% of
  its students graduate a four-year college within six years. SEED LA will
  provide a solid pathway to financial independence. The impact on the
  individual, family, and community sustains a lifetime. SEED LA is part of a
  community redevelopment project on blighted property at Vermont Ave and
  Manchester Blvd left vacant since the civil unrest of 1992. SEED LA will be
  147,000 sqft state-of-the-art campus with 170 dorm rooms, 20 staff apartments,
  22 classrooms etc. Serving 400 students, 50% of the students will come from
  the Vermont Manchester neighborhood and 50% of students from throughout LA
  County. SEED schools are intentionally located in the communities where its
  families live. Existing SEED schools are beloved community assets for all to
  utilize.
