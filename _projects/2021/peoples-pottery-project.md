  People’s Pottery Project’s mission is to empower formerly incarcerated women,
  trans and non-binary individuals through the power of art-making, grassroots
  advocacy, and meaningful employment through our non-profit ceramics studio.

  difficult transition out of incarceration, thereby providing meaningful art
  therapy and urgent resources to prevent individuals from returning to prison.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:

  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Los Angeles holds the bleak distinction of jailing more people than any other
  US city. At the same time, women have become the fastest growing percentage of
  the prison population. Post-incarceration, women face even greater trauma,
  steeper barriers and fewer resources than men. Women return home from prison
  to stigma, economic precarity, and a lack of supportive services. As the 2019
  Prison Policy Initiative briefing states: “Given the dramatic growth of
  women’s incarceration in recent years, it’s concerning how little attention
  and how few resources have been directed to meeting the reentry needs of
  justice-involved women”. For trans and gender non-conforming people,
  discrimination adds to the impacts of structural racism and gender-based
  discrimination. These forces along with systemic disinvestment lead to high
  recidivism rates for this group. After decades behind bars, dreaming of life
  outside, women are coming home to a city that does not support their return to
  society.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  People’s Pottery Project’s (PPP) mission is to empower formerly incarcerated
  women and trans people through our non-profit ceramics studio. We put into
  practice the principle of “Care Not Cages,” by centering the needs of people
  coming out of prison, most of whom are Black, Brown, Indigenous and LGBTQI.
  Guided by our formerly incarcerated leaders, we are collectively building an
  arts based center for healing, education and community. In response to the
  urgent needs of people leaving prison, we provide paid work opportunities and
  job training in design, production and distribution of the People’s Bowl and
  other homewares. We offer part-time work on a flexible schedule that provides
  economic stability to people in reentry. PPP offers ceramics classes free of
  cost to formerly incarcerated individuals. Arts programming is essential for
  healing trauma and helps recently incarcerated women establish a sense of
  self, power, and hope. This program offers an inspiring pairing of women in
  reentry and PPP staff, who have navigated this transition home successfully
  and are leaders in their community. PPP recognizes the need for grassroots
  advocacy led by directly impacted communities. One of the primary barriers for
  formerly incarcerated people to advocate for systems change is economic stress
  and inflexible, low-wage jobs. PPP centers advocacy by encouraging leaders to
  participate in coalitional movements to provide safety, healing, and dignity
  for formerly incarcerated people.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  People’s Pottery Project is in the early stages of development, but has
  already had immense success. In the last year and a half, we have taken on
  five employees who have been recently released from life sentences. We have
  provided paid job training, leadership development, and trauma-informed
  management systems. PPP has partnered with A New Way of Life Reentry Project
  to offer free ceramics classes to women in re-entry. We have provided 180
  hours of our paid ceramics program to formerly incarcerated people. We have
  had six features in prominent arts publications, bringing visibility to our
  community and the issues we face while transforming public narratives about
  incarcerated individuals. Looking forward, one way we will measure our success
  is by expanding the hours our formerly incarcerated leaders spend working
  directly with target communities: people in re-entry, formerly incarcerated
  individuals, and non-system impacted members of the community.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '800'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': ''
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  At People’s Pottery Project, we celebrate the freedom of every person who is
  released from a life sentence and walks from the prison gates; our goal is to
  create a community for them to come home to. Our mission is to provide every
  disenfranchised formerly incarcerated individual access to a therapeutic arts
  practice and paid vocational training. Over the next year, with increased
  support, we will expand our programming to provide 6500 hours of free
  therapeutic classes for women in reentry and paid training for formerly
  incarcerated individuals. We will increase sales and production of the
  People’s Bowl, and in the process hire an additional full time member to
  develop professional work experience in a holistic and supportive environment.
  This year we will develop the advocacy that is at the center of PPP, by
  providing support for our members to move into pre-existing coalitional spaces
  to continue fighting for the needs of formerly incarcerated women and trans
  people.
