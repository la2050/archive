title: A Memoryhaus and Archive Caretaker Fellowship Program
project_summary: >-
  ITS-IN-SCOPE is a Memoryhaus, in Historic South Central, innovating an
  intuitive model of collective learning intended to support our community as we
  figure it out together. Our physical environment serves as a site for
  learning, optimizing, and imagining how shared histories can inform a
  collective future. Our annual fellowship cultivates leadership through
  artistic and archival frameworks, enabling people in historically divested
  communities to explore contemporary studies, remember intuition, and engage
  history as a tool for self discovery.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic have demonstrated both the lack of available
  resources in predominantly Black communities and the ways anti-Blackness is
  inherent in so many systems in the United States. As a result, Black people of
  all ages in South Central have been unable to imagine their actualization
  forcing them into uninspiring experiences of life with little to no upward
  mobility. The infrastructure within which we live our lives and explore the
  possibilities for our communities are outdated. The remnants of past resources
  and opportunities are unable to keep up with the constantly growing and
  changing needs of Black people. The deficit framing of Black culture
  contributes to the perception of impossibility around reinvestment. Community
  does not lack an abundance of information or knowledge by which we may
  reimagine our circumstances and sense of self, what we require is space and
  time to apply historic know-how towards present ways of being.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Our project consists of two main components: a physical space in Historic
  South Central and an annual fellowship program. Our Memoryhaus is the home for
  our community programming and a site where youth in the South LA community can
  gather in interdependent study. Monthly programming is inclusive of
  experiences like communal discourse, sound healing, multimedia creation
  related to the present exhibitions and the opportunity for the community to
  publicly present their work for engagement. In this way, the community is able
  to explore the SCOPE curriculum in a way that integrates unique understandings
  into their daily life. Functionally, the space consists of a showroom
  exhibiting material artifacts, a research library, and an outdoor classroom.
  The Archive Caretaker Fellowship was created to empower the intuition and
  curiosity of local artists, futurists, and historians. The individuals in
  harmony with the collective will engage in 6 months of shared study, from
  October 2021 through March 2022, to explore overlooked histories, unimagined
  futures, and contemporary solutions in fellowship with local caretakers. Our
  curriculum incorporates concepts like time, space, love and post colonialism
  but engages them from the unique perspective of the individual in the context
  of their personal understanding. In this way, critical dialogue is cultivated
  through explorations of self to better inform both a collective learning and a
  solution based process of knowledge production.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  The Archive Caretakers Fellowship graduated its inaugural cohort in Spring
  2021. Beginning in October 2020, fellows participated in a rigorous discourse
  based curriculum. Qualitatively, fellows engaged the curriculum material
  throughout the fellowship from the framework of their current practices as
  artists and archivists. Upon completion of the program, fellows developed
  Material Artifacts (archival pieces) that incorporated their learnings
  throughout the fellowship in an interactive format. Fellows also developed
  workshops that centered their learnings for the larger community to
  participate in from mid-March to mid-April 2021. Quantitatively, fellows and
  participants in the various workshop experiences self reported through a
  survey their satisfaction with the experience. A total of 62 members of the
  community participated in intimate, appointment-based fellowship presentations
  at our archival space.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '10'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Historical awareness is a necessary foundation in the development of Black
  youth in their quest to self actualize. At this time, there are few reflective
  opportunities for Black youth to explore the circumstances of their
  experiences. Intellectual gate-keeping prevents them from understanding the
  parallels in their present experiences and those of their ancestors. We aspire
  to cultivate communal appreciation, reflection and healing by intentionally
  connecting the experiences of Black Angelenos to those of the larger Black
  diasporic experience in the United States. As a community centered, community
  operated archival space, we intend to cultivate the conditions to work towards
  a shared vision of what Los Angeles can represent for Black youth presently
  and in the future, formed by them. Our fellows develop unique frameworks of
  collective leadership, to be explored in their personal practice as artists
  and archivists and in the SCOPE space for larger communal engagement.
