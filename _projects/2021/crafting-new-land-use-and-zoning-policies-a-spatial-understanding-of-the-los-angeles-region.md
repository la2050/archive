  Crafting New Land Use and Zoning Policies: A Spatial Understanding of the Los
  Angeles Region
project_summary: >-
  We're entering a crucial decade for both Los Angeles and the planet,
  decisionmakers and stakeholders need a comprehensive understanding of how land
  use, zoning, and code should change across our region to create places that
  produce both climate resilient outcomes and healthy communities. This project
  is an initial study into what regional land use, zoning, and code should look
  like while centering environmental and climate justice, public health, and
  racial inequities. We also seek to provide public education about land use and
  zoning concepts.

project_video: ''
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': Research (initial work to identify and understand the problem)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Like many coastal counties across the nation, Los Angeles County will be
  significantly impacted by climate change, not only from drought and fires, but
  sea-level rise and flooding, as well. Simultaneously, as we think about the
  not so distant future we are dealing with immediate crises such as
  segregation, urban warming, housing and homelessness, affordability and
  displacement, long commutes, and lack of tree canopy and green spaces to name
  a few. Unfortunately, most don’t understand how to utilize land use and zoning
  for a county as big as Los Angeles, there is no connected network of
  knowledge, data, and information to understand the inner workings of the
  region, and how land use and zoning decisions in one community ripple across
  the county to another. Thus, this project asks, for the 88 cities and
  unincorporated L.A. that make up the county, how should land use, zoning, and
  code be structured to create a county where every community is considered
  healthy from a holistic view?
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  The project is best described using three phases (research and data gathering,
  crafting of the policy recommendation, and visualization and modeling) that
  are nested under one consistent phase (community engagement and outreach).
  Each phase is constructed through community engagement and outreach. Phase 1:
  Research and Data Gathering -> Literature Reviews, Focus Groups, Interviews,
  Data Collection, Data Analysis Phase 2: Crafting of Policy Recommendations ->
  Crafting model land use, zoning, code, setbacks, etc. to understand how to
  achieve what constitutes a healthy community Phase 3: Visualizing and Modeling
  -> Geospatial Modeling, Renderings Phase 4: Produce a Final Report We believe
  this is the appropriate phasing of the work as the land use and zoning
  decisions, the implications of those decisions, and the processes that lead to
  these decisions are so decentralized that they end up being inaccessible to
  communities across Los Angeles. This would be an opportunity to try and
  centralize those decisions, while also modeling and visualizing those
  decisions and how they not only reshape the spatial environment in the direct
  community and the broader region.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Primary measure for success is will be determined using pre- and post-survey
  to measure change of attitudes and understanding of land use and zoning. 1.
  Success is getting people to realize that it’s not too late to solve the
  multitude of problems in society and the role of land use and zoning in
  helping to solve that 2. Success is getting people to understand the urban
  planning process as it relates to crafting the various land use and zoning
  policies in their communities, and how that then produces the spatial
  environments in which they live. Primary measure of success would be a
  complete report with an interactive map 3. Compiling a centralized way for
  people to understand how land use and zoning decisions interact with one
  another regionally. Long-term metric of success The long term metric be having
  land use and zoning decisions across the county in 88 cities and
  unincorporated Los Angeles produce healthy and climate resilient communities.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '2500'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '5000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Short-Term Success 1. Laying the foundation to understand what needs to be
  done in broad strokes as it relates to land use, zoning, code, etc., across
  Los Angeles County 2. Creating a regional understanding of land use and zoning
  decisions 3. A public education campaign that helps people understand people,
  place, and biological diversity in the face of multiple crises that are
  playing out all at once. Changing how people can think of Los Angeles County
  and reimagine their spatial environment. We plan to change how people react to
  change in their community, and to get folks to see a future where they can all
  see themselves living in the communities they would like. Long-Term Success 1.
  Launching a new wave of civic engagement and community-led planning where
  people around Los Angeles County are working with local government to design
  and build communities that can meet the needs of all while understanding the
  broader ecosystem of place.
