title: Modern Band Music Education
project_summary: >-
  Little Kids Rock’s modern band program unlocks students’ inner music makers!
  Using the music that kids already know and love (styles like pop, hip hop, and
  Latin), modern band empowers students to play their favorite songs within
  minutes of picking up an instrument; boosting self-confidence, improving
  school attendance, and giving them the tools for a lifelong healthy, creative
  self-expression. By training additional teachers to launch modern band
  programs, more kids in LA County will have access to diverse, student-centered
  music education.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
  - LAUSD (select only if you have a district-wide partnership or project)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Music education must be accessible and relevant to be effective. Research
  shows that, even in schools that can offer music programs, 80% of students
  will leave as soon as it becomes an elective. Little Kids Rock first increases
  accessibility by addressing financial barriers to music education. In LAUSD,
  72% of students qualify for free/reduced-fee lunch. When buying groceries is a
  challenge, getting lessons outside of school is nearly impossible, so
  in-school offerings are essential to providing a creative outlet to kids. We
  increase participation by building a curriculum that is relevant to, and as
  diverse as the students we serve. In LAUSD, nearly 75% of students are Latinx,
  meaning the majority of students are not represented by traditional music
  classes. By teaching today’s most popular music genres—including hip hop,
  Latin, and R&B, which were largely pioneered by people of color—students who
  feel represented by these genres get the means to express themselves and be
  heard.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Little Kids Rock’s modern band program prepares teachers to incorporate
  popular genres into their music classes by providing them with professional
  development, curricula, and classroom resources. Because Little Kids Rock
  invests directly in district teachers, modern band is offered during the
  school day and at no cost to all the students that teacher reaches. This
  highly sustainable model allows the program to grow each year as new students
  immediately fill the seats of recent graduates. During the 2021-2022 school
  year, Little Kids Rock will train and equip up to 30 new modern band teachers,
  to reach 3,000+ additional students. Grant funds will support up to two
  certification workshops for new teachers, such as our “Modern Band 101” or
  “Digital Songwriting and Production” series. Courses will be held online or
  in-person as current health guidelines allow. Los Angeles County is currently
  one of our largest program markets, serving approximately 16,000 students
  annually through the efforts of 160 teachers. LAUSD administrators facilitate
  the recruitment of teachers to participate in our workshops, and many LAUSD
  teachers have become modern band ambassadors who mentor new teachers.
  Workshops are open to any teacher who expresses their interest, but our
  district partners help us identify high-needs schools that would benefit from
  targeted recruitment. For an overview of our current program schools, find a

'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Since launching LA County’s first modern band program in 2004, Little Kids
  Rock has provided 4,200 PD hours to 345 teachers to bring engaging music
  instruction to kids. To measure our qualitative impact, we conduct classroom
  site visits (as current health guidelines permit), solicit teacher feedback,
  and require program teachers complete an annual survey on student, teacher,
  and school outcomes. In response to this survey, students have shared: • “My
  confidence grew, and I completed one of my life goals which was learning how
  to play the guitar.” • “I like the band because it is fun working with other
  kids. It's fun to get to know each other.” • “I like that it gives me an
  excuse to be myself in front of people.” Countless studies have shown that
  music education enhances students’ creative thinking, emotional development,
  and intellectual curiosity, among other benefits. Modern band’s collaborative,
  hands-on approach amplifies these benefits through student-centered
  instruction.

Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Little Kids Rock believes that music is best learned experientially. This
  means modern band provides students with hands-on experiences with an
  instrument and opportunities to collaborate with their peers. By emphasizing
  songwriting and improvisation, kids learn to use music as a tool for
  self-expression. Based on historical data, we anticipate the following
  outcomes in students who participate in modern band: • 85% will feel happier
  and/or more confident • 85% will want to come to school • 80% will be more
  likely to express themselves In the long-term, we aim to use modern band to
  address systemic inequities in education. We seek to provide alternate avenues
  for music education for students without instruments at home, ways to
  integrate music production technology into music education, and opportunities
  for students of color to express themselves through their music-making. We
  believe that this approach will make music education more diverse, inclusive,
  and equitable.
