  Lost Angels Children's Project offers a vocational training social enterprise
  program that provides high-needs transitional aged youth (TAY) with hands-on

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Antelope Valley
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Lost Angels is located in the under-resourced city of Lancaster, within the
  Antelope Valley, where systemic racism, marginalization, the war on drugs, and
  a school-to-prison pipeline have created barriers to achievement. The area is
  exposed to an overcrowded state prison and juvenile justice center and,
  according to a 2019 Impact Justice report, 60% of Lancaster residents have
  close friends or family that have been incarcerated. Lancaster experiences the
  highest rates of child abuse, neglect, and foster care placements in the
  County. Census data shows nearly 24% of Lancaster residents are in poverty
  (compared to 14% in LA County); the median income for males is $36,606 and
  females is $24,309. Young people of color are particularly at risk and, in
  2020, Lancaster and Palmdale were among the cities with the largest number of
  unemployed in the state—reaching above 20%. Lost Angels is improving economic
  opportunities and income inequality by creating a workforce pipeline for
  youth.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  In 2020, LACP launched the Lost Angels Work Program, piloted in partnership
  with the City of Lancaster, Los Angeles County Office of Education (LACOE),
  and the Antelope Valley America’s Job Center of California (AJCC). The
  vocational training social enterprise has supported two cohorts of students to
  date and is currently teaching the third cohort, with plans to scale up.
  Participants are low-income and high needs, including youth of color, unhoused
  youth, foster youth, justice-affected youth, youth recovering from drug
  addiction in rehabilitation programs and youth referred through L.A. County
  public benefits welfare-to-work programs (GAIN/GROW). Our program participants
  have been 48% Latinx, 35% Caucasian, and 17% African American. In the last
  cohort, two students had criminal records, two were in drug rehabilitation,
  and three were unhoused. Lost Angels not only offers job training and career
  development support, but also addresses essential needs and barriers to
  progress. Our staff assist students with expunging records, obtaining driver’s
  licenses, completing their high school diploma or GED, and other legal,
  personal, social and financial issues. All applicants receive referrals and
  linkages to housing services, public benefits, and other vocational training
  opportunities, jobs and workforce development resources. Lost Angels is on
  track to have a 92% graduation rate, with more than 90% of students placed in
  on-the-job paid apprenticeship at $15/hour.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Lost Angels is proposing to take an existing program to scale by increasing
  the number of students served in a year and providing extended supportive
  services. We measure quantitative and qualitative outcomes, including: 1)
  number of TAY students served; 2) demographic information; 3) current status
  of housing/rehabilitation/probation, etc.; 4) types of supportive services
  provided (driver's license, housing, criminal record expungement, etc.); 5)
  number of students certified to drive a forklift; 6) number of students with a
  career development plan and resume; 7) number of students that graduate after
  12-weeks; and, 8) number of students securing a living wage job. LACP will
  survey students to determine satisfaction with the program and collect
  information on changes in quality of life.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '76'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '250'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Lost Angels is creating a diverse, skilled workforce that will reduce the
  number of unemployed and unhoused young adults in Los Angeles County. Our
  organization leverages community assets and resources to support hard-to-reach
  youth populations and improves their personal, educational, and economic
  outcomes. The first year of the Lost Angels Work Program pilot has proven
  incredibly successful, with 71% of students securing employment at wages
  between $17-$25 per hour with benefits after graduation. We expect these
  numbers to increase as the program is strengthened, partnerships are further
  developed, and we build our capacity to take in more students.
