title: >-
  Ocean degradable and home compostable flexible packaging materials made from
  agricultural waste
project_summary: >-
  This grant will help us launch a pilot with our partner and build a
  small-scale production line, which equals 10,000 rolls of films. We will be
  upcycling 125 tons of agricultural waste and replace hundreds of tons of
  plastic films.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - East LA
  - San Gabriel Valley
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  The increasing amount of synthetic plastic waste is a huge problem that could
  potentially be solved with bioplastics. Despite increasing efforts to recycle,
  approximately 53% of waste in the US is still sent to landfill and plastic
  waste makes up about 19% of that. People are becoming more aware of the damage
  that plastic waste can cause to the environment, it is still extremely
  prevalent in daily lives, from packaging to clothing. The plastic used for
  food and beverage packaging makes up 2/3 of the world’s plastic waste.
  Flexible packaging is a growing segment of the world’s packaging market. The
  world produces 78 million tons of flexible packaging film every year. Even
  though the volume of flexible packaging is smaller by weight and space, most
  flexible packaging cannot be practically recycled. Flexible packaging isn’t
  made of pure plastic polymers but rather made by blending several materials.
  These blended materials make flexible packaging complicated for separation and
  recycling.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Unlike current alternatives to microplastics, which are based on plant
  polysaccharides, such as cellulose and algae, Mi Terro’s plant protein
  materials do not rely on chemical cross-linking for their performance. This
  enables them to decompose quickly and completely in the natural environment.
  Our proprietary technology re-engineers agricultural waste into
  plastic-alternative packaging material. Our packaging film is 3-4 times
  cheaper than other bio-based materials (PLA, PHA, PBAT), is at a similar price
  as LDPE film, home compostable, ocean degradable, heat sealable, excellent
  water and oxygen barrier, low thickness, and potentially edible. Our
  technology can potentially apply to any type of agricultural byproducts and
  surplus food, including plant, dairy, and vitamin supplement byproducts. Our
  process uses less energy than paper and plastic production while creating 90%
  less CO2 than plastic. Our material accommodates a diverse range of fully
  compostable packaging applications for fresh produce, dry food, fashion, and
  standard product packaging.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  We measure success by the amount of agricultural waste we upcycle and plastic
  film we replace. In addition, we measure our success by the number of
  employees we hire. 2022: we will start manufacturing at a small scale, which
  equals 10,000+ rolls of films. 2023: we will start manufacturing at a
  semi-commercial scale, which equals 200,000+ rolls of films. 2024: we start
  manufacturing at a commercial scale, which equals 1,000,000+ rolls of films.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '4'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '10000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Selective agricultural waste and food waste at commercial buildings, schools,
  grocery stores, and home can be upcycled and processed into
  plastic-alternative materials. We will create hundreds of jobs to
  underrepresented communities.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: ''
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?: >-
  Access to the LA2050 community,Communications support,Capacity-building and
  training,Strategy assistance and implementation
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.: ''
Which metrics will you impact?:
  - Federal research grant funding
  - ' Patents'
  - ' Venture capital investment'
