title: Meal Project
project_summary: >-
  Santa Monica College’s Meal Project is fueling vulnerable students’ academic
  persistence and degree completion. Our students struggling with food
  insecurity are provided groceries and nutritious meals via innovative
  partnerships solely with Los Angeles-based nonprofits, businesses, and
  restaurants. Meal Project is utilized as an access point to increase screening
  and connections to critical services inside and outside SMC, for a range of
  supports from housing insecurity to mental health and wellbeing.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Community College students’ completion of degrees and career or technical
  certifications are critical to the upward mobility of individuals as well as a
  resilient Los Angeles economy. SMC’s 29,600 students reflect Los Angeles
  County with most (90%) residing outside of the Santa Monica city limits and
  concentrated (68%) in L.A. County Supervisory District’s 1 and 2, Downtown,
  East and South of Downtown L.A., which have seen the greatest economic and
  health impacts of COVID-19. Prior to the pandemic, 54% of SMC students were
  food insecure according to a national survey conducted by Temple University’s
  Hope Center for College, Community, and Justice. Increasing rates of food
  insecurity among SMC students prior to and during the pandemic - along with
  data showing the detrimental effect food insecurity has on college persistence
  and degree completion - propelled us to reengineer and dramatically expand our
  food security ecosystem, launched as Meal Project in March 2020.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Meal Project connects students to longer-term supports while employing
  strategies to address their immediate food insecurity. Meal Project provides a
  weekly drive through food pantry at which students receive shelf stable
  groceries, fresh produce and proteins, and a choice of two meal access
  options: 28 nutritious meals per month home delivered weekly (Everytable.com),
  or 28 immediate access meals per month through our partnership with Los
  Angeles technology incubator Not Impossible Labs’ Bento initiative
  (Notimpossible.com). Students are qualified for Meal Project’s services using
  the USDA’s food security assessment tool. Within 20 minutes of program
  enrollment, a food insecure student can pick up a healthy to-go meal near
  their current location through an innovative, text-based message interface
  from partnering restaurants with throughout LA County (no app download
  required). Underpinning all of Meal Project’s supports is the emphasis on
  transitional tools for longer-term self-sufficiency through screening,
  outreach, and referrals to needed services both internal to the College and in
  the greater community. Student assessments encompass finances, food, housing,
  social supports, and health and well-being, all essential contributors to
  academic success. SMC also has a designated facilitator to help students sign
  up for benefits such as CalFresh (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
  aka food stamps).
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  SMC has seen a 20% higher rate of academic persistence, demonstrated through
  continued enrollment semester to semester, among students receiving Meal
  Project assistance compared to the general student population (SMC
  Institutional Research). Impact measures: 1) Number of meals and bags of
  groceries distributed. Anticipated: 150,000 – 200,000 meals and 40,000 –
  50,000 bags of groceries. 2) Increased student persistence as measured by
  course completion, drop rates, and continued enrollment for participants
  compared to the student body. 3) Increased matriculation to college among
  vulnerable students as measured by enrollment of new students (freshman)
  qualifying for Meal Project assistance. 4) Increased graduation rates among
  students receiving Meal Project assistance. 5) Increased food security among
  participants. 6) Increased program usage by at-risk populations. 7) Number of
  needs assessments conducted. 8) New referrals to/enrollment in CalFresh.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '13354'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': ''
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  We envision a future in which college students reach their academic and career
  dreams, knowing their basic needs, including food security, are assured. In
  addition, we foresee other higher education institutions addressing students’
  basic needs more broadly, as we continue to share our models and lessons
  learned with one another. SMC is poised to have an outsized impact on college
  matriculation during the grant period if we are able to continue the program
  at the current level where no student struggling with extreme hunger is turned
  away. A harbinger of the future, SMC’s enrollment decreased less than 2%
  during the pandemic while community college enrollment has fallen on average
  by 10% nationwide. Moreover, SMC students receiving Meal Project assistance
  have continued enrollment semester to semester at a rate 20% higher than our
  overall student body.
