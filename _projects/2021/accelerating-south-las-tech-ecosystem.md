title: Accelerating South LA’s Tech Ecosystem
project_summary: >-
  The Plug In South LA Accelerator Program supports promising early-stage tech
  entrepreneurs from underserved and underrepresented communities who are poised
  to disrupt their industries. This intensive program helps Black and Latinx
  entrepreneurs prepare to raise capital, pitch potential investors, and develop
  strategies for scaling up their businesses. Local business leaders from LA’s
  tech ecosystem provide guidance through curated mentoring sessions that meet
  the entrepreneurs based on where they are in their development.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Black- and Latinx-led companies started more than a million new businesses in
  the U.S. over the past decade. Despite this, the opportunity gap is a chasm.
  Less than 2% of available venture funding reaches Black and Latinx startup
  founders. White startup founders are 3.4 times more likely to receive approved
  capital investment than their Black and Brown counterparts. A business
  starting strong financially can endure challenges, adapt to changes, and scale
  up. Startups with significant initial investment are also more likely to
  receive additional funding during future funding rounds. The odds are stacked
  against founders lacking initial investment. Four factors are critical in
  determining whether a small business succeeds or fails: financial resources,
  management capability, brand awareness, and startup capital access. The Plug
  In South LA Accelerator Program targets these areas for minority early-stage
  tech entrepreneurs, laying the groundwork for a more equitable path forward.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  The Plug In South LA Accelerator Program supports promising Black and Latinx
  early-stage tech startup founders through weekly workshops, guest speakers,
  and one-on-one mentorship with local industry leaders. The founders learn how
  to grow and sustain a successful venture. Sessions cover topics such as
  product development, team building, fundraising strategies, and user
  acquisition growth. The seasonal program runs from 12 to 20 weeks and
  culminates in a showcase where the founders present their companies to
  experts, community leaders, and prospective investors. Plug In South LA does
  not have an equity stake in the startups. Instead, we take a hands-on approach
  to workshop the founders’ challenges, helping them develop, communicate, and
  execute their ideas to scale up their businesses. Participating founders
  typically lack investor networks, meaning they haven’t received the
  introductions required to raise seed capital. Our program taps into a network
  of investors who engage in candid, productive conversations, putting the
  founders in a stronger position. Making the program available year-round would
  give significantly more local underrepresented entrepreneurs the resources to
  leap across the opportunity gap.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Plug In South LA measures the success of the accelerator program by tracking
  several metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs). One the number of
  graduates from each cohort. We also look at the number and quality of new
  entrepreneurs applying to the program, including the diversity of their tech
  offerings. We measure entrepreneurship maturity for each participant pre- and
  post-program by looking at their business growth, partnership growth, and any
  acquisitions/IPOs. The amount of investment in the startup founders as a whole
  is an important metric, including successful fundraising rates, number of new
  investors, and the average investment. In addition we track engagement through
  the number of volunteer and guest mentors, and the overall number of programs
  in South LA that promote entrepreneurship.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '90'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1350'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  The Plug In South LA Accelerator Program’s first cohort of five local startup
  founders graduated in 2020. Founders emerged with quantifiable gains including
  signing paid customers, increases in online conversions, hiring employees, and
  raising capital. The current second cohort has eight founders. Dozens of
  mentors and speakers volunteer for the program. Each participating founder
  creates positive ripple effects in LA. Successfully offering the program
  year-round will scale up benefits locally: boosting existing businesses and
  suppliers, creating job opportunities, inspiring young innovators, and
  building a diverse talent pipeline for the broader tech industry in Los
  Angeles County. A stronger startup community in South LA provides a tangible
  economic boost to the region. With this grant, a year-round program will
  support 90 Black and Latinx early-stage founders annually, increasing the
  number of viable local businesses while advancing Los Angeles as a tech
  entrepreneurship hub.
