title: 'The Curtain Rises: Village Arts Theater in the Schools Program'
project_summary: >-
  The Curtain Rises: Village Arts in the Schools Program is a one-of-a-kind
  free, after school theater arts program for students at Colfax and Lankershim
  Elementary Schools. Since 2012 Village Arts has offered high-calibre, fun, and
  inspiring theatre programs that have become an annual tradition for families
  in the San Fernando Valley. Fall of 2021 Village Arts wants to remove all
  financial barriers to their after-school program. Theater has an undeniable
  power to connect, uplift, and inspire, especially when it is accessible to
  all.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - San Fernando Valley
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Village Arts annually provides 12% of their students with some form of
  financial aid and has never turned a child away due to lack of funds. Despite
  this, many in our community are still unable to afford after school programs
  in the arts. As of 2018, 86% of Lankershim students and 25.5% of Colfax
  students qualify for free and reduced lunch. These inequities have only been
  exacerbated by COVID-19 and particularly impact BIPOC and immigrant families.
  Drama programs are shown to significantly improve literacy development and
  skills in English language arts, as well as building community and improving
  self-confidence. It is essential that all students have the opportunity to
  participate in equitable and high-caliber theater education. In order to help
  our most vulnerable community members rebuild, Village Arts wants to eliminate
  cost as a barrier to participating in our after-school programming.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  The simple and most effective solution to guarantee all students access to
  Village Arts fall theatre programs is to remove the barrier of cost. ALL
  students at both Colfax Charter and Lankershim Elementary, K-5th grade, could
  then participate in the rehearsals and performances of a musical. Village Arts
  adheres to all LA County COVID protocols and currently, LAUSD plans for full
  school reopening in the Fall ‘21. If infection rates rise, we are prepared to
  work closely with the schools to make accommodations or postpone programming.
  Awarded funds would underwrite the significant rental fees charged by LAUSD
  for the auditorium and rehearsal spaces. It is imperative that Village Arts
  after-school programming occurs on campus to best support all families. After
  school programs on campus create safe, educational spaces for children whose
  families need after school care or for whom transportation is a barrier.
  Salaries for artistic and technical staff, as well as hard material costs
  would also be covered by the grant. Year after year we have witnessed the
  benefits of our work and parents remark on our “inclusive and nurturing
  environment.” The process of creating a show naturally creates a bond with
  children, differences dissipate, and the necessity of collaboration is
  experienced. By extending our reach to families in need, as well as to
  underserved schools like Lankershim Elementary, Village Arts programs will
  have an even greater impact on more community members.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Village Arts has documented past success by measuring growth in annual
  enrollment, reach across LA and rise in social media numbers along with
  testimonials from participating families. In Fall 2021 Village Arts will
  expand its theatre program to Lankershim while continuing its work at Colfax.
  Outcomes for programs at both schools will be measured through pre and post
  surveys distributed to guardians and children. Surveys will measure the impact
  of programming on a student’s sense of connection to community, self-esteem,
  and confidence in their abilities. Similarly, the children’s surveys will
  allow students to self-report on their experience as a community member, cast
  member, and participant. Success will be defined by the number of new students
  reached, as well as the number of low-income families who are able to
  participate in Village Arts programming when cost is not a barrier.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '150'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1240'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  A free after school performing arts program would create a space for everyone,
  regardless of socioeconomic status. Elimination of tuition provides equal
  access to families at Lankershim and Colfax. At Lankershim this is imperative
  because many families are not able to afford the cost of any tuition. Our
  programs will help the region of Los Angeles to transform into one of the few
  places where all students have equal access to the benefits of a performing
  arts program. A continuing partnership with local schools would exist;
  offering students a safe and inclusive space to find community on campus.
  Village Arts holds a strict policy of color-blind casting and is inclusive of
  all abilities. In this environment, kids learn what they are all truly capable
  of and the power of working with others. By providing this accessible and
  valuable experience, we will help the next generation of Angelenos discover
  the power of community, the arts, and their unique voice.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  Our partner organizations will be Colfax Charter and Lankershim Elementary
  School. Both principals of these institutions have signed on for proposed
  programming in the Fall and have spoken at length about the significant
  benefit of a free theater arts program at their schools. The schools have
  agreed to let us use their auditorium space for after school rehearsals and
  for the final performances. There will also be a performance during the school
  day presented as an assembly for all students to attend. Prior to
  registration, the schools will help market the program and distribute fliers
  to families. This will be a unique and lasting partnership, providing students
  with easily accessible and free theater arts education right at their school.
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?: 'Access to the LA2050 community,Capacity-building and training'
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.: 1.) Colfax Charter Elementary School 2.) Lankershim Elementary School
