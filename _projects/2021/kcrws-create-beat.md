title: KCRW's Create Beat
project_summary: >-
  The Create Beat celebrates the creative genius of Southern California by
  highlighting the artists who make Los Angeles the home of the extraordinary.
  The program deliberately moves beyond mainstream arts institutions to engage
  with the creative and revolutionary humans living in our neighborhoods who
  make a profound and tangible impact. Through authentic, intimate stories of
  local changemakers, the Create Beat redefines what art and culture means in LA
  by proving that these spaces can be more accessible, relatable, and
  community-centered.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
  - 'Other:: Santa Barbara County'
  - ' Orange County'
  - ' Palm Springs Area'
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  When thinking of arts and culture in Los Angeles, icons like Hollywood and
  major museums first come to mind. While these places are essential to the
  cultural makeup of our city, the emphasis on well-known institutions can
  create an arts culture driven by status and power, rather than the people and
  stories behind each work of art. Providing a homogeneous representation of art
  in LA can make these spaces uninteresting and inaccessible to the average
  person, further creating barriers to underrepresented groups in the arts and
  entertainment industries. Arts and culture are a vital resource for
  inspiration, story-telling, and community participation, but our current
  coverage is not as representative as it could be. The Create Beat will
  spotlight the creators that bring unparalleled creativity to LA and tell the
  human stories behind our city’s incredible cultural output.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  By using a wide lens to discover one-of-a-kind local artists, the Create Beat
  will provide opportunities for listeners to engage with the arts, highlight
  diverse artists and art forms, and make art and culture accessible,
  compelling, and human-driven. Through our award-winning journalism, the Create
  Beat will create a space for artists such as the guerilla gallerists, the
  escape room creators, the activists using sport to change minds, uniquely
  SoCal street artists, and the people reinventing live music to share their
  craft and explore how wider societal issues play out in their creative
  expressions. This coverage will be a brand new short-form feature each week on
  our regular programming, like "Greater LA," that brings the voices and sounds
  of Southern California to the world. The Create Beat aims to be the definitive
  source of in-depth coverage for the genius of Southern California in all of
  its various forms. Providing an equitable platform for visionaries to share
  their art will help restructure the media practices that can overlook local
  creators and artists. By broadening the scope of our reporting and promoting a
  more holistic scope of reporting to include more voices, the Create Beat will
  also encourage community members to engage with and participate in the arts to
  help diversify the arts and culture industry.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  KCRW will gauge the success of the Create Beat through a variety of metrics.
  For all of our programs, KCRW tracks listenership through monthly Nielsen
  Reports that help us understand how many individuals are tuning in through our
  terrestrial broadcast signal, as well as through analysis of digital
  engagement on our website and other digital platforms. We will use these
  methods to track the reach of the project broadly. Additionally, KCRW tracks
  the success of our projects through audience engagement. This takes the form
  of engagement around our content on social platforms as well as through
  audience feedback, which is frequently requested through tools such as
  Hearken. KCRW will track audience engagement and feedback over the course of
  the grant period to understand the interests of our audience and how this
  content is being received in the community.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '500000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '13000000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  The KCRW Create Beat aims to highlight the vast diversity of arts and culture
  in Los Angeles by celebrating the genius of the people who make it. We aim to
  transform Los Angeles County by creating a platform to showcase diverse
  artists, art-forms, and the way that these projects interact with the
  communities who call Los Angeles home. This will help highlight creatives who
  are frequently overlooked in a city in which arts and culture coverage can
  become dominated by major players in the entertainment world. At the same
  time, the KCRW Create Beat will enable our listeners to engage with these
  works in a way that is accessible, compelling, and human-driven. By better
  understanding the plethora of artistic opportunities around them, we aim to
  inspire our listeners to engage with creatives in their communities.
