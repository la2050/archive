title: 'Educational Interventions for Black & Latinx Males in Azusa, California'
project_summary: >-
  Efforts are underway by a team of representatives from Azusa Pacific
  University, Citrus College, and the Azusa Unified School District to partner
  to conduct a participatory action research plan in order to analyze existing
  interventions that aim to improve retention and graduation rates of students
  of color, particularly Latinx and African American male students, whose
  retention rates are alarmingly low. We aim to discover why interventions
  currently in place seem to be failing these young men.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - San Gabriel Valley
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': Research (initial work to identify and understand the problem)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Administrators at Azusa Pacific University (APU) and leaders in the Azusa
  community are increasingly concerned with the alarmingly low numbers of Latinx
  and Black male students that complete four-year degrees. Noting the data on
  LA2050’s website gathered from a report from the California Department of
  Education, currently 64 percent of Los Angeles County high school graduates
  enroll in college. Aggregating this data by race-ethnicity shows that 55
  percent of Black students enroll in college and 47.4 percent of Latinx. In our
  localized study, we found matriculation rates for Black male students is at 27
  percent and at 35 percent for Latinx students at Azusa Pacific. Existing
  interventions seem to be largely ineffective in helping the majority of these
  students succeed in a college setting. Taking into account LA2050’s target of
  a 90 percent matriculation rate, our research study aims to identify
  interventions geared toward eliminating college inequities and thus improve
  matriculation.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  APU has taken note of the inequities in the city and at the encouragement of
  city officials and community leaders has attempted interventions aimed at
  alleviating or eliminating socio-economic inequalities or stressors that
  overwhelmingly affect people of color. One such program implemented by APU,
  known as C.H.A.M.P (College Heading And Mighty Proud), pairs elementary school
  students from the local public schools, largely students of color, with
  college students who serve as mentors to foster a love for and understanding
  of the importance of education. Believing that education is a means to improve
  the lives of youth, this program illustrates efforts to create a pipeline
  aimed at students of color within the educational system in the city of Azusa.
  We will analyze and adapt the C.H.A.M.P. program in partnership with the local
  school district to ensure its goal of fostering a love of life-long learning
  in the students enrolled in the program. We will work with Citrus College and
  the Student Center for Reconciliation and Diversity at APU to design new
  interventions at Citrus that target Black and Latinx students' academic
  success and sense of belonging, as well as develop tools for perseverance and
  adaptation.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  We will administer a survey gauging student participants’ aspirations, hopes,
  and fears about their education at the beginning of the academic year. Focus
  groups and individual interviews with students will help us more deeply
  understand student perceptions. Additionally, interviews with teachers and
  program administrators will balance students' perceptions on their tenacity,
  aspirations, and drive. This data will be analyzed to gauge the effectiveness
  of the intervention on students’ academic success. We will interview students
  as the year closes to gauge their perceptions of their success, sense of
  belonging, perseverance, adaptations, and desire to complete a four-year
  degree. Success will be measured by improved academic performance, positive
  student self-assessment, increased degree completion, and organic policies
  changes that effectively strengthen the interventions. Our desire is to see
  student matriculation in identified populations improve by 5 to 10 percent
  each year.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '150'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1500'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Success will be primarily measured by improved academic performance, positive
  student self-assessment, degree completion, and organic policies that
  effectively strengthen this cohort model across the institution. We aim to
  raise matriculation rates by five percent each year among the most
  marginalized populations and believe that this will improve the overall
  matriculation rates of all students in the region. In addition to these
  measures of success, we hope to improve communications between various
  educational institutions in the city of Azusa to support ongoing efforts to
  improve the educational lives of the students in the city. We also hope to be
  more engaged with community members in this work and be seen as a positive
  presence in the City of Azusa.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  Azusa Pacific University, who administers the C.H.A.M.P.S program will be a
  key partner in this project. APU's Chief Diversity Officer and leadership for
  their Student Center for Reconciliation and Diversity will help connect us
  with students, hire and employ student researchers, conduct surveys, design
  the participatory action research plan, and made adaptations to interventions.
  Additionally, we are in talks with leadership at Citrus College and Azusa
  Unified School District to be involved in this study on an advisory level. We
  also have the enthusiastic support of Blanca Rubio, the state assembly member
  of the 48th district, which Azusa falls under.
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?: >-
