'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  An urgent need exists to mitigate risks and promote healing, for OY, from
  trauma & adverse child experiences (ACE). ACEs include: Abuse; Neglect; Mental
  illness; &/or Incarcerated relative. CDCP (2019) reports: 1) the childhood
  years are the “building block” years that help set the stage for adult
  relationships, behaviors, health, and social outcomes; 2) ACEs & conditions
  such as living in under-resourced or racially segregated neighborhoods,
  frequently moving, experiencing food insecurity, and other instability can
  cause toxic stress; & 3) Some children may face further exposure to toxic
  stress from historical and ongoing traumas due to systemic racism or the
  impacts of multigenerational poverty resulting from limited educational and
  economic opportunities. Children growing up under these conditions often
  struggle to learn & complete schooling; are susceptible to illness & mental
  health challenges over their lifetime; & may have difficulty forming healthy &
  stable relationships.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Creating and sustaining safe, stable, nurturing relationships and environments
  for all children and families can prevent ACEs and help all children reach
  their full health and life potential. Our project will: connect youth to
  caring adults and activities; and teach social and emotional learning skills.
  SAMHSA’s 6 Key Principles of a trauma-informed approach, will be employed: 1)
  Safety; 2) Culture, history & gender; 3) Empowerment, voice, and choice; 4)
  Peer support; 5) Collaboration and mutuality; and 6) Trustworthiness &
  transparency. This project will utilize a culturally responsive approach to
  creatively expose OY to: 1) Abundant and enjoyable recreational opportunities;
  2) Opportunities for healing from trauma through empowerment, planning, and
  choice (of recreational activities); 3) Culturally responsive social and
  emotional learning skills; and 4) Real-life examples of engaged youth, via the
  provision of Millennial Mentors. Project activities will include: 1) Abundant
  recreational opportunities (including exploring outdoors and appreciating our
  natural environment); 2) Social and emotional learning activities; 3) Clinical
  support; and 4) Mentoring support. Outcomes from this partnership may include:
  Healing from past trauma and adverse childhood experiences; Stress reduction
  and coping strategies to minimize response to triggers of past traumas; A
  sense of belonging and empowerment (and enhanced self-esteem and sense of
  purpose); and Positive engagement skills.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Metrics will include: 1) 90% of Youth will experience, at least, five new
  high-quality recreational opportunities (including outdoors and our natural
  environment); 2) 90% of Youth will utilize a digital platform to voice their
  opinions (increase civic engagement); and 3) Dream metric: Youth will increase
  their total number of local social media friends and connections by 10
  friends. Note: Prevalence of trauma and adverse childhood experiences: LA2050
  seeks data that measures the rates of exposure to trauma and adverse childhood
  experiences among local youth. Toward this dream metric, our aim will be: 90%
  of youth will receive therapeutic support and SEL strategies to mitigate risks
  from past trauma and promote healing. Project success will be measured,
  ongoing throughout the project, formally and informally, soliciting feedback
  from all stakeholders. Project services and activities will be adjusted, as
  data support, to ensure the highest level of success upon project conclusion.
