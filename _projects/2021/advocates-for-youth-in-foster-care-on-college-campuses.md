title: Advocates for Youth in Foster Care on College Campuses
project_summary: >-
  CASA of Los Angeles, alongside DCFS and local colleges, will match volunteer
  advocates (CASAs) one-to-one with Non-minor Dependents (NMDs, or youth in
  foster care age 18-21) currently enrolled or transitioning to enroll at local
  colleges. In addition to helping NMDs secure benefits and basic needs, CASAs
  will help them navigate all aspects of college life, i.e. securing financial
  aid, campus housing, job opportunities, physical/mental health support,
  tutoring and whatever else they may need to graduate and thrive during this
  critical time.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  For Non-minor Dependent youth (NMDs, or those who have elected to remain in
  foster care from ages 18-21) who are enrolled in college, the burden of
  navigating both Extended Foster Care (AB12) and school can be overwhelming.
  Young people of color are particularly over-represented in this system and
  frequently struggle to access and maintain services available to them.
  According to the Alliance for Children’s Rights, only 3% of LA County youth in
  foster care graduate from college, even though 70% of youth in care say that
  they want to pursue a higher education. CASAs have already proven to be a
  tremendous support to NMDs by helping them navigate the gauntlet of paperwork,
  meetings, and phone calls needed in order to access AB12 services. We need to
  expand upon this program with help from community partners to better identify
  NMD youth enrolled in local colleges who would benefit from the personalized
  advocacy a CASA volunteer can provide, including support of their academic
  success.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  CASA/LA plans to recruit, train and support new and active CASAs to assist
  NMDs in college and post-secondary institutions with whatever the young person
  may need during this critical time, and help NMDs develop skills to live as
  independent adults. CASAs will help ensure that once youth are enrolled in
  college, they have the support systems in place to successfully complete their
  chosen academic programs. CASAs make sure that these young people are
  receiving all applicable resources, including financial aid, that they are
  eligible for. They are also often one of few caring adults that these young
  people can rely on. CASAs trained to work with these young people will: (1)
  ensure that foster care exit planning is complete; (2) mentor the young adult
  through the process of accessing available financial aid and academic support,
  completing their education, securing housing, transportation, job
  training/employment; and (3) help these young adults gain confidence and
  self-sufficiency. To achieve this CASA/LA will: (1) Work with DCFS, LACCD and
  other colleges, universities and post-secondary institutions to better
  identify NMD youth on campus who would benefit from this personalized advocacy
  and collect referrals to our program. (2) Recruit and train 50 new volunteers
  in the first year to serve minimum two-year terms as advocates for NMDs, and
  50 new volunteers in the second year. (3) Serve 120 new non-minor dependents
  with one-on-one advocacy.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  In 2016, we fully implemented our monitoring database by Social Solutions,
  Efforts to Outcomes (ETO) and developed a framework that allows us to track
  key data elements, including how many children we serve, how many CASAs are
  serving youth, the length of our waitlist and how many more CASAs are needed
  to serve waitlisted youth. ETO also allows us to track case progress and
  measure outcomes. When a case is assigned, the advocate supervisor and CASA
  examine the case and rate the status and level of risk of the youth on a
  baseline scale along the three core dimensions: safety, permanency and
  wellbeing. We then document the initial assessment related to these
  dimensions, advocacy goals and plans, the degree to which the plan is then
  implemented, and how the assessment changes over time. In 2019, we hired a
  Director of Research & Evaluation, responsible for guiding program evaluation
  and using this data to measure success and change our programs to better serve
  children and their families.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '220'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': ''
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  We envision that this program will allow more young people in LA County foster
  care successfully complete college, reducing overall attrition rates, and
  provide them with an achievable plan for safely exiting the system. It will
  also provide these young Angelinos with the confidence and skills to build and
  maintain relationships, problem solve, and take personal responsibility. LA
  foster care continues to operate as a pipeline into homelessness, poverty and
  the prison system and will continue to do so until fundamental changes are
  made to how we care for our community's most vulnerable kids. We believe that
  an LA in which every young person in child welfare has an advocate and the
  opportunity to thrive is a safer, richer, more successful LA for all. Every
  day our team works hard to make this LA a reality. We have determined that
  there are 12,000 youth in foster care in LA who have an immediate need for
  CASA intervention. This number includes all NMDs receiving AB12 benefits in
  LA.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  Our community partners at DCFS, LACCD, local colleges and post-secondary
  institutions will be instrumental in helping us identify young people on
  college campuses and post-secondary institutions in need of CASA advocacy.
  Youth must be formally referred (in writing) to the CASA of Los Angeles
  program to be matched to a CASA volunteer. CASA/LA works with many community
  partners to better ascertain and define the growing advocacy needs of the
  children and youth that we serve. These partners work with us to better serve
  our youth, identifying and addressing the needs of the individual young people
  we serve as well as the advocacy priorities of the child welfare community at
  large. We rely this input from and collaboration with these partners to better
  inform our work and programs.
