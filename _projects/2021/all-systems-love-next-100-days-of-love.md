  We are at a crossroads in every system, across every neighborhood in LA,
  caused by a disconnection and how we align our operations. What would it take
  to transform every system. We want to remove the disconnection from each other
  and our own hearts. Mels Love Land creates connection transforming any
  disconnection inspiring heart centered actions, for our homeless, our land,
  air, water, transportation, immigration, which leads to mental health issues,
  apathy and frustration. More folks are loving than fearful, more folks want a
  world of connection than not, we are experiencing a disconnect. Loving our
  land and each other. "I" thinking is the beginning of Illness and "We"
  thinking creates wellness. We, together, taking a stand for love, for
  connection, for the power of emodied love is our destiny. Will we be loving or
  will we be more loving?

  The world is full of loving individuals ready to do the necessary work to

  bringing love to every situation. We will use our NEXT 100 days of Love to
  host experiences and amplify loving thought to educate, inspire and connect to
  community interested in ecosystems restoration, land acknowledgement, rooted
  reconnection to place and the love of all living things. Mels Love Land needs
  an infusion of attention, investment and relationship building to expand all
  of the various love and kindness work we do throughout LA. We envision a new
  day. A new way to identify, establish and operate sustainable programs that
  utilize the city's most valuable assets. The NEXT 100 days of love will host,
  organize and establish the inner workings of an all systems love network,
  involved in shifting the conversation to love. Los Angeles is home to so many
  artists, engineers, farmers, folklorists, accountants, transformational
  leaders (healers, coaches, workers, doctors, strategists, leaders,
  practitioners) we are passionate about making transforming LA with a
  long-lasting, permanent shift to aligning in love. In our connection is our
  salvation and the NEXT 100 initiative allows us to consider the possibility
  there is another way. A dear friend suggests we apply our hearts to
  envisioning the world we wish to create.

  'creating care' as loving actions. Yes we give in 100 offerings promoting
  local businesses to expand awareness and uplift all who encounter the love
  factor of our NEXT100. Combined with a love report and experiences based on
