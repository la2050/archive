title: Reimagining Nano-Entrepreneurship Mutual Mentorship
project_summary: >-
  Business and professional skills mentorship program for low-income, older and
  senior BIPOC LGBTQ+ to start-up or expand a nano-business. A nano-business is
  defined as having no full-time employees and one part-time owner operator.
  Examples of nano-businesses include a small house plant business, button
  making business, and recycling. The initial investment or cost to grow is
  $1000 or less. The return on investment after the first three months should be
  in the range of $100-$1000 per month. Beneficiaries will be part of an alumni
  network.

project_video: ''
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - South LA
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  We are addressing the supplemental income needs of older low-wage earners in
  BIPOC communities, specifically in Koreatown and South Central Los Angeles.
  $100-$1000 additional income per month can help people remain housed, meet
  basic needs, and have a little extra for nice things. Older, low-income BIPOC
  often suffer from lack of information and minimal resource support to lead
  secure lives. Our nano-business models also take into consideration mobility
  barriers and disabilities; and be low labor or minimal labor. Our community
  driven, multi-ethnic mentors and mentees will also engage in inter-ethnic
  coalition building, information sharing, and resource pooling to build
  solidarity. This will help with community safety and the overall well being of
  Los Angeles residents. Our model has been tested in our direct aid and food
  aid initiatives. Our current mentorship model has focused on older, low income
  Women of Color.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  We identify older, low-income BIPOC through our existing food aid program that
  is LA County wide. We will focus on Central LA and South Central LA for our
  new phase of growth. Beneficiaries will receive support and material resources
  to start a nano-business (side hustle or side gig). Often the barriers are
  nominal such as lack of access to a working cellphone, transportation, or lack
  of bank account. We will work with beneficiaries to ensure they have these
  basic tools. We will create start-up nano-businesses or expand existing
  nano-businesses. Example: Jane Kim. She collects recyclables to help make ends
  meet. We will help her obtain recyclables more easily by working with local
  businesses to donate their recyclables to her and help with transporting the
  recyclables. Jane Kim can easily increase her income by many times and reduce
  time spent collecting recyclables. Her personal safety also increased. Her
  quality of life increases. Example: Joyce Washington. She has disabilities and
  is homebound. We will help her start a plant business with several other
  tenants in her building. She and peers can propagate succulents and hold
  monthly sales. We will help organize, promote, and market the monthly sales.
  We will assist with point of sale and payment solutions. Example: Letitia
  Guevara. Single mother with two toddlers and no transportation. We will set
  her up with a button making business. Will help her with button design such as
  logos and slogans.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  We measure the impact through feedback from the beneficiaries. We know that
  $500 in additional income per month has helped Zerita Jones pay for basic
  needs like food and utilities. It helps keep her housed and improved the
  quality of her life. We helped David, an 88 year Black man, by saving
  recyclables for him. He was living out of a van. The additional income helped
  with gas. Because he was a part of our knowledge network, we were also able to
  help him with a ticket and prevented his van from becoming impounded. After 3
  years, he was able to find a room that he could afford. We helped Peter Kim
  with his knife sharpening business by getting him two additional customers per
  month. $100 per month was all he needed to remain housed. We measure outcomes
  with the beneficiaries.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '50'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '500'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Our pre-pilot nano-business mentorship program has been successful. Example:
  Zerita Jones was able to start a button making business. She has 900 orders
  that she can make in 3 hours sitting at her dining room table. She has
  disabilities and limited transportation. She sells her buttons through
  community organizations for $1 each. We envision a future with many such
  nano-business owners that are sustainable and increase quality of life. The
  intended impact is to build community health one person at a time. In making
  our program multi-ethnic, we also improve cultural relations in LA County and
  share knowledge with each other. Our information sharing network can also be
  used to share information about many resources such as mental health services,
  health services, cash aid, grocery vouchers, etc.. When more low-income, older
  BIPOC are part of a knowledge network, their safety and community safety
  increases.
