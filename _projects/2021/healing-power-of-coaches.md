title: Healing Power of Coaches
project_summary: >-
  Up2Us Sports’ Healing Power of Coaches program is a citywide effort to ramp up
  the support and training of trauma-informed coaches who will inspire the
  health and wellbeing of Los Angeles youth through access to PLAY
  post-pandemic. Our two-pronged approach will leverage LA2050 support to
  increase the number of coaches working with youth in LA’s most underserved
  communities and provide training citywide to 1,000 sports coaches in positive
  youth development programs who use play to impact their physical,
  social-emotional and academic health.

  Up2Us Sports’ Healing Power of Coaches program is a citywide effort to ramp up
  the support and training of trauma-informed coaches who will inspire the
  health and wellbeing of Los Angeles youth through access to PLAY
  post-pandemic. Our two-pronged approach will involve leveraging LA2050 support
  to increase the number of coaches working with youth in LA’s most underserved
  communities and provide training citywide to all youth sports coaches who want
  to use play to impact the physical, social-emotional and academic health of
  young people.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Up2Us Sports plans to address this immense need for healing among LA youth by
  offering our nationally recognized “trauma-informed” coach training to local
  schools, parks and nonprofits. We will leverage funding from LA2050 to bring
  on a dedicated Training Manager and infuse our Coach Training Curriculum with
  additional training content that addresses the specific challenges that youth
  and their coaches are facing in the post-pandemic environment (i.e. mental
  health, racial equity, and gender equity issues). We will also identify
  communities that are lacking coaches and leverage our federal AmeriCorps grant
  to recruit coaches and level the playing field for opportunities for all youth
  to play - regardless of their socio-economic status. Our training will help
  coaches to intentionally use the combination of physical activity, positive
  peer-support, adult mentoring and life skills development in sports to
  directly address post-traumatic stress resulting from isolation. This approach
  will increase the effectiveness of our program on youth and youth impacts by
  enhancing youth’s SEL skills and overall experience in SBYD programs.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Up2Us Sports will leverage its existing monitoring and evaluation plan to
  evaluate process and outcome indicators for our program. We will track the
  number of coaches completing each training through training rosters (or its
  equivalent). We will also conduct site visits to determine whether youth have
  positive experiences with Up2Us Sports coaches trained in SBYD practices and
  how it translates into a more meaningful impact on the development of their
  physical and mental wellness as well as SEL skills. A mixed-methods approach
  will be used to collect quantitative and qualitative data (through pre- and
  post-surveys) from coaches and youth to assess program impact on coach
  reaction, learning, and application as well as on youth results, following the
  Kirkpatrick Model of Learning. • Coach Outcomes -Increased knowledge and
  skills and their application in SBYD and trauma-informed coaching • Youth
  Outcomes: -Positive engagement and experience with Up2Us Sports trained
  coaches
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1040'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '26000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Since 2013, Up2Us Sports has been supporting the development of young adults
  (primarily from low-income communities) to become coach-mentors in LA’s most
  underserved neighborhoods. To date, we have leveraged support from federal and
  state AmeriCorps (i.e. California Volunteers) and DOJ funding to recruit over
  375 coaches who received 32 hours of SBYD training and have served 38,750
  youth at more than 80 programs across LA. Our signature training has received
  city-wide attention from the Mayor’s Office, the parks department, schools,
  and nonprofits. In 2015, Up2Us Sports hired its first team of LA-based
  trainers who have delivered more than 40 trainings to 5,200 coaches.
  Leveraging our past experience and track record, we received support from the
  LA84 Foundation to host a 6-week citywide training series for LA-based coaches
  and SBYD practitioners. Up2Us Sports has also undergone two extensive
  evaluations that measured its effectiveness in supporting youth development
  outcomes.
