title: Building better pathways for aspiring teachers across L.A.
project_summary: >-
  Teacher pipelines are broken and often don't represent the students we serve,
  so Rivet School and Alder Graduate School of Education are working together to
  build a better pathway for school-based workers to become teachers – leading
  to a stronger and more racially diverse teacher workforce. While working full
  time, these staff will earn their BA in an innovative degree program at Rivet
  School before going on to earn a MA and teaching credential at Alder GSE –
  unlocking economic opportunity and a fulfilling lifelong career in education.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - South LA
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Schools across the state employ over nearly 500,000 classified employees. In
  Los Angeles, these staff members tend to be people of color from the local
  community. At the same time, LA schools face a teacher shortage, struggling to
  recruit and retain teachers reflective of the racial identity of the students
  they serve. Research bears out the significance of same-race teachers for
  students of color – increasing performance on academic assessments in math and
  reading. The pipeline to teaching is broken: districts already employ a
  massive pool of homegrown prospective teachers of color — but these staff
  cannot advance without earning a bachelor’s degree first. By creating a more
  flexible, supported pathway through college and into credential training, our
  program taps into an overlooked population of working adults seeking
  opportunity. While many think of college attainment as a goal for 18-22 year
  olds, Rivet School's efforts significantly expand the market of potential
  graduates.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Rivet School provides an accelerated, affordable, and supportive college
  experience for working adults to earn a bachelor's degree. We unlock the
  promise of online education through real-time 1:1 coaching, enabling students
  to earn a bachelor’s degree in as little as 2-3 years and, ultimately, to
  access untapped opportunity through increased economic mobility. Rivet
  School’s Educator Pathway program solves a specific problem facing non-degree
  holding classified school staff (like instructional aids and after school
  workers) that aspire to become teachers but cannot leave their full-time
  school-based job to enroll in college. Through partnership with schools and
  community organizations, we find and enroll these classified staff into our
  program and layer on extra support to pass state licensure exams (CBEST/CSET)
  and enter a high-quality credential program. Through our collaboration with
  Alder Graduate School of Education (Alder GSE), we support K-12 schools to
  build resilient internal pipelines for classified staff to become teachers in
  their schools. Rivet School has partnered with some of the largest school
  districts in California, including Stockton, Oakland, and San Francisco school
  districts, and this grant will support our work to expand impact in LA.
  Recently, we launched partnerships with a number of Los Angeles schools
  including the Inner City Education Foundation, STEM Prep, and Equitas Academy,
  recognizing this is only the beginning of our work in Los Angeles.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Rivet School is a results-oriented organization and we consider our impact
  over short- and long-term time horizons. In the short term, we will enroll 100
  LA-based school workers on the Educator Pathway (EP) before August 2022. Of
  those enrolled, 80% will identify as Black or Latinx. Currently, Rivet School
  serves 50 EP students, of which 90% identify as Black or Latinx. We will also
  support EP students to earn their BA within 3 years. Currently enrolled
  students are on track to earn their degree in 3.1 years, putting us within
  reach of our pace goal (and compared to 5.5 years at CSUs). In the long term,
  we will support 80% of EP students to pass the CBEST and CSET within 6 months
  of graduation. We are still early, but of our 9 graduates, 3 have passed the
  CBEST. We will also achieve a 90% rate of matriculation into credential
  programs within 6 months of graduation. We are still early, but of our 9
  graduates, 9 have been accepted into credential programs.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '100'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '3000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  In California, LA is a leader when it comes to diversifying the teacher
  workforce. In LAUSD, Latinx and Black teachers make up 41% and 10% of the
  workforce, respectively – both more than double the state average. Rivet
  School and Alder GSE aim to build on this great progress and contribute toward
  achieving parity to better mirror L.A. county’s student demographics. Nearly
  90% of Rivet School’s Educator Pathway students are Black and Latinx –
  promoting stronger student outcomes by furthering racial diversity in LA’s
  classrooms. Along the way, our graduates will prove out working adults can
  achieve college success – contributing toward the 50 percent bachelor's degree
  attainment. Additionally, our pathway plays a larger role in income equality
  as it relates to the Gini index. First year teachers in LA earn nearly $26K
  more annually than non-degree holding staff like instructional aids. Our
  pathway disrupts the status quo by making college and economic advancement
  possible.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  Rivet School and Alder GSE have closely partnered for over two years. Our
  missions and teams are aligned in every regard – from our commitments to
  racial equity to the high standards we set for teaching and learning. We’ve
  successfully worked with schools in the Bay Area to build internal teacher
  pipelines and want to replicate that success in LA. Alder GSE’s high touch
  teacher residency model enables candidates to earn their teaching credential
  and Master’s degree while apprenticing with an expert teacher alongside a
  community of peers. Currently, 96% of Alder students obtain full time teaching
  positions upon graduation, and they already partner with several LA-based
  schools. Alder welcomes Rivet graduates into its program knowing that our
  students are motivated aspiring teachers.
