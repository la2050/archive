title: 'Jobs for Justice: Support Chrysalis’ Reentry Initiatives'
project_summary: >-
  Chrysalis is the leading organization in LA focused on helping formerly
  incarcerated individuals attain self-sufficiency through work. Each year,
  through classes, supportive services, and our social enterprise “Chrysalis
  Enterprises” (CE), we provide comprehensive job readiness training and
  employment for over 1,600 participants in transitional jobs. We offer these
  motivated individuals, 81% of whom are justice-involved, and 72% of whom have
  past felony convictions, a second chance in life when they need it most.

project_video: ''
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Over 60% of formerly incarcerated individuals are unemployed one year after
  release. Due in part to changes in public policy, as well as inmate releases
  since COVID-19 arrived, the number of ex-offenders in need of employment
  support as they reenter society has risen dramatically. Regardless of the
  efforts to plan for a seamless transition, reentering individuals face
  enormous challenges to establishing a pro-social lifestyle, including
  difficulty in finding and maintaining employment due to a lack of job search
  experience, education, vocational skills, and/or work history, as well as
  employers’ reluctance to hire those who have been involved in the justice
  system. In addition, the post-pandemic unemployment rate in LA County in
  February 2021 was 10.9%. Justice-involved people, already facing challenges in
  finding employment, will be competing in the job market with high numbers of
  recently unemployed people without criminal backgrounds.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  For clients with significant barriers to employment, Chrysalis offers paid,
  transitional employment with our in-house businesses to get them started on
  the road to permanent, outside employment. Transitional jobs deliver
  marketable experience and occupational skills while providing a closely
  supervised, supportive working environment that allows clients to demonstrate
  and practice their hard and soft skills. Chrysalis Enterprise Businesses
  include: • Chrysalis Works: a professional street maintenance company,
  providing work experience in trash and recycling pick-up, landscaping,
  graffiti removal, hauling, and street sweeping. • Chrysalis Roads: employs
  people with justice system involvement to do litter abatement and freeway
  maintenance with Caltrans. • Chrysalis Staffing: a temp to permanent staffing
  agency that allows clients to re-enter the job market through short-term,
  full-time, and part-time work assignments in administrative office support,
  property management, and janitorial services, among others Throughout the
  pandemic, our CE businesses have been deemed essential. We have even been able
  to identify new opportunities for transitional jobs, such as providing support
  for Project Roomkey Program, which is placing high-risk people experiencing
  homeless in hotels and motels during the COVID-19 crisis.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  A steady job is a key step to a person’s transition out of poverty and onto a
  pathway to self-sufficiency. We define success as helping our formerly
  incarcerated clients succeed by becoming ready for a job, getting a job, and
  retaining their job for at least 6 months. A 2010 Mathematica Policy Research
  study showed that an adult with barriers to employment who can stay employed
  or in a program for 6 months will have improved employment and social outcomes
  for the long term. We measure success by collecting impact data about our
  programs and clients, including the number of clients 1) completing our
  program, 2) transitioning to outside, permanent jobs, 3) retaining employment
  for 6 months, and 4) wages earned. Data is collected from a variety of sources
  and tracked in our organization-wide database. We create a monthly dashboard,
  which tracks information about the services each client has accessed and the
  time it takes for clients to complete our program and find a job.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1500'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '5000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  If successful, Chrysalis will CREATE opportunities for over 1,100 formerly
  incarcerated people to reenter society, find work and get on the path to
  self-sufficiency during the grant year. Our approach to reentry is jobs. We
  are recognized leaders in the reentry community connecting people to
  employment and assisting people to increase their incomes. CE workers earn
  wages and pay taxes, reducing their recidivism rates and dependence on
  government assistance. They receive on-the-job training from supervisors with
  lived experience in homelessness and incarceration. And they are paired with
  an Employment Specialist, to support their job search throughout their
  transitional employment, helping to move them successfully into mainstream
  employment. Employment improves housing stability, increases self-esteem and
  sense of dignity, and creates better physical and mental health, while also
  setting in motion changes that have positive ripple effects on families,
  communities, and society.
