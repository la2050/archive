title: Back on My Feet Next Steps Program
project_summary: >-
  Back on My Feet combats homelessness through the power of community and
  employment resources. Members develop greater confidence and become part of a
  positive community by joining volunteers on walks/runs and then leverage these
  soft-skills and confidence developed in the Next Steps Workforce Development
  Program, working with staff 1-on-1 to upskill and prepare for the workforce
  and gain employment. BoMF’s person-centered approach gives individuals
  experiencing homelessness access to opportunities and tools needed for
  sustainable independence.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Individuals and families can fall into a state of homelessness for a variety
  of reasons that are often interconnected such as lack of affordable housing,
  limited economic opportunity, and sudden or long-term medical problems. These
  challenges are heightened for people of color who face long-standing
  individual and institutional racism creating barriers to accessing quality
  education, sustainable employment, affordable housing, and safe public spaces
  in which to sustain physical and mental wellness. Simply put, too many among
  us are living on the brink of poverty and homelessness, and it's difficult to
  rebound without help. In our own community, 66,436 people in Los Angeles
  County are experiencing homelessness, a 12% increase from 2019. We anticipate
  this has increased further due to the pandemic-related economic recession.
  Sustainable employment is a key factor of sustained independence, breaking the
  cycle of homelessness and poverty. The need for our program is immense and
  growing.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Back on My Feet (BoMF) combats homelessness through the power of running,
  community, and essential employment and housing resources. We form run/walk
  teams comprised of volunteers and members (individuals experiencing
  homelessness) that meet three times a week. Through exercise and engagement in
  a positive community, members develop greater confidence, accountability, and
  discipline. These skills power our members’ progress on the road to employment
  and independence. After 30 days of building essential skills at morning
  walks/runs, members move into the “Next Steps” workforce development stage of
  our program. Staff meet with members 1-on-1 regularly to create a personalized
  plan to achieve their career goals and aspirations. BoMF ensures each member
  can overcome barriers to employment and meet their goals through upskilling
  workshops, financial empowerment courses, education/certification programs,
  and financial assistance towards the removal of one-time barriers to
  employment and housing. Additionally, BoMF will launch career coaching
  volunteer support for members in 2021 to include further individualized
  employment guidance. Once a member achieves long-term employment and moves
  into independent housing, they become “alumni”. Our Alumni Program continues
  to foster the circle of positive support and engagement through additional
  guidance and invitations to workshops and community activities, as alumni
  continue their progress into healthier, more economically stable lives.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  BoMF determines impact as the number of individuals served and employed. BoMF
  LA has impacted over 860 individuals in gaining employment and independence.
  This year 112 new members will engage with the program and 80 members will
  gain employment. BoMF members not only gain employment but on average, 83% of
  members are still employed after 15 months. 44% receive a wage increase within
  their first 6 months, and 21% are promoted. Members also build healthier
  lifestyles supporting their long-term success. After 60 days of
  walking/running, members experience health benefits including: 48% reduction
  in high blood pressure, 41% reduction in obesity, 58% reduction in nicotine
  usage. Members are also 2.5x more likely to report high self-esteem than the
  general urban homeless population. After 90 days with BoMF 97% of members take
  a more positive attitude toward themselves, 72% of members find their life to
  be more meaningful, and 86% of members feel more satisfied with their lives.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '122'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '350'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  BoMF defines success as sustainable, long-term employment supporting
  individuals in breaking the cycle of poverty and homelessness. Through the
  BoMF Next Steps program, 80 individuals will gain meaningful employment.
  BoMF’s transformational impact and vision expand to our broader communities as
  well. As volunteers from our surrounding LA communities engage with members in
  our initial programming and through Next Steps, impactful relationships are
  built and barriers are broken down for the entire LA community. Our program is
  also cost-effective with an economic impact on the Greater Los Angeles
  community. On average, the cost to serve one individual experiencing
  homelessness in LA is $34,000 annually while the cost for BoMF to serve one
  member through our highly individualized program is a one-time investment of
  ~$10,000. Furthermore, for every $1 invested into the BoMF program, $2.50 is
  returned to the community within 3 years through cost savings and increased
  economic output.
