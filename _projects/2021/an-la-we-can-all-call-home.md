title: An LA We Can All Call Home
project_summary: >-
  PATH will transform LA’s COVID housing efforts by amplifying the voices of
  formerly homeless advocates who have experienced the process. We operate one
  of LA’s primary pandemic housing solutions: LeaseUp, which increases the
  affordable housing supply through landlord engagement. We will create a Lived
  Expertise Advisory Board to assess LeaseUp, recommend person-centered
  adaptations, and advocate for systemwide changes to elected officials—helping
  PATH change LA’s housing market and expediting our most marginalized
  neighbors’ housing journeys.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  PATH seeks to address LA’s growing homeless crisis, which is set to rise
  drastically during the pandemic. Housing has been historically inaccessible to
  many Angelenos with an estimated 509,000 affordable units needed to bridge the
  gap. In early 2020, LA saw more than 66,000 of our neighbors experience
  homelessness—a number set to skyrocket post-eviction moratorium. In LA County,
  685,000 jobs have been lost. Compounded by rising rents, housing shortages,
  poor health, and more, the pandemic recession is projected to push another
  52,300 adults out of their homes. Chronic homelessness is also set to increase
  in LA by 86% over the next four years. Our Black neighbors are impacted most,
  representing 34% of the homeless population yet only 8% of LA. By ending
  homelessness, PATH also targets the systemic and institutional racism that
  caused it. PATH will use a racial equity lens to increase LA’s affordable
  housing, reduce homelessness more effectively, and help our neighbors make it
  home.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  An LA2050 grant will help create a Lived Expertise Advisory Board to
  strengthen PATH’s existing LeaseUp LA initiative, a countywide landlord
  engagement effort to expand the affordable rental market. Launched in 2018,
  LeaseUp accelerates housing availability by 1) working with landlords to list
  their market rate units as affordable and 2) building the PATH-App, a rental
  listing site that any LA case manager can access for their clients. LeaseUp
  has since acquired thousands of units and is a key COVID re-housing strategy.
  PATH seeks to build a LeaseUp Lived Expertise Advisory Board to ensure our
  critical work is culturally competent, person-centered, and effective. It will
  comprise formerly homeless LeaseUp participants. They will lend their
  perspective to assess our overall landlord engagement strategy, review
  messaging and marketing, and make sure that implementation is aligned with our
  population’s needs. We will hire an associate director to lead our Lived
  Expertise Advisory Board and our existing Landlord Advisory Board. They will
  work with our leadership and meet with other advocates in similar roles to
  develop a recruitment strategy. At the advisory board kickoff, the members
  will convene virtually and develop guidelines, expectations, meeting
  frequency, and more. We will immerse them in LeaseUp, hear and apply
  recommendations, and uplift their advocacy efforts in local government. Our
  project is unique because it allows the people being served to guide the
  service.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  As an expansion of an existing project, PATH will measure impact with a
  combination of ongoing and new measures. LeaseUp has made incredible strides
  since 2018, adding 4,478 new units of affordable housing to LA. Our project’s
  design places LeaseUp staff as liaisons between landlords and case managers
  from countywide agencies. They engage and support landlords, acquire units,
  facilitate lease-up, work with case managers, and address any future issues
  during a tenant’s lease. On average, it takes three months for a case manager
  to conduct this process independently and LeaseUp significantly reduces or
  eliminates that. To date, they have worked with 4,632 landlords and 2,654 case
  managers from 102 different agencies. PATH’s new LeaseUp Lived Expertise
  Advisory Board will help increase this amazing success and ensure that this
  work includes our most marginalized neighbors and directly addresses their
  disproportionate housing barriers.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '30'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '2500'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Thousands of Angelenos who have systemically been excluded from equitable
  housing will have safe, healthy homes as a direct result of PATH’s work.
  Without the worry of daily survival, they will be able to stabilize their
  health and finances, reintegrate into the community, and thrive. Many
  landlords who contribute their units to us are smaller and rely on this income
  to support their families. PATH’s efforts will support these individuals who
  have also been severely impacted in the pandemic recession. At the macro
  level, PATH’s LeaseUp Lived Expertise Advisory Board seeks to create
  equitable, accessible housing for Angelenos. Our top priority has always been
  those we serve and launching this advisory board will take us to the next
  level. Their voice on what needs to change in LA’s housing market will help
  inform practices and policies on how to embrace those in need. By first
  rethinking processes on the ground level, PATH hopes to embed in LA’s culture
  that everyone deserves a home.
