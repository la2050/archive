title: 'Improving Math Scores, Improving Lives'
project_summary: >-
  A year of distance learning and pandemic living has left LA students
  struggling with school. Socioeconomically disadvantaged youth are particularly
  likely to fall behind, specifically in STEM subjects. Impact 6’s virtual
  tutoring program is designed to not only increase math scores for high school
  students in underserved communities, but to also help foster a passion and
  love for the subject, resulting in more engaged students who are better
  prepared to pursue careers in STEM.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
  - 'Other:: Inglewood'
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Only 4 in 10 LA high school students are proficient in math. In 2019, only 30%
  of socioeconomically disadvantaged students met the standard on the SBAC for
  math. Underserved communities lack the resources and opportunity for
  supplemental education, a factor of greater academic success, outside of
  school. Students who fall behind in school are less likely to graduate, find
  gainful employment, or become civically engaged. With studies showing that
  students who excel in STEM subjects are more likely to attend and graduate
  from college, improving their economic status, keeping students engaged with
  math is essential to keeping them in school. As schools struggle to keep
  students’ test scores afloat, especially during a pandemic, never have they
  been more at risk of falling graduate rates. Students unengaged and
  underperforming in math are less likely to pursue careers in STEM areas, and
  are less likely to feel adequately prepared for college or higher education.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  This 1:1 virtual tutoring program for socioeconomically disadvantaged youth in
  LA communities aims to not only raise their math scores, but instill a passion
  for the subject while providing study habits and critical thinking skills to
  last a lifetime. We will partner with 1 - 2 charter high schools who suffer
  from the lowest math rates in the city, identifying and assessing at risk
  youth in need. Tutors will be paid or volunteer for free and either college
  students or young professionals from STEM professions. After a two week
  training program created and led by the program’s part time director, they
  will dedicate at least a full semester of tutoring 1 to 3 students each. The
  tutor brings their expertise and passion for math, connecting with the student
  on a level their teacher is unable to. Each student can expect 1 to 2 sessions
  a week based on need, as well as an optional weekend small group session.
  Tutors will give progress reports to parents every few weeks and report
  directly to the program director, who will oversee all tutors. What makes this
  tutoring program unique is the tutor’s passion for math and their focus on
  building lifelong studying habits and real world skills. Students will be
  taught effective study habits, proper testing techniques, and how to apply
  what’s learned to real world solutions. Most importantly, students who cannot
  get the help they need in class will be given the attention and mentorship
  they deserve.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Impact 6 has researched this program and built a solid foundation for it,
  already having dedicated, passionate tutors from all areas of LA ready to
  begin. A 15% rise in test scores among program students is the quantitative
  goal, but we’re hoping for much more. Success will be achieved when the
  program also shows an increase in high school graduates from underserved
  areas, an increase in college bound students majoring in mathematics or
  another STEM subject, and students who better understand math. At the
  beginning and end of each semester, students will receive a survey asking them
  about their attitudes towards math, with hope for a positive increase. Parents
  will also receive a survey to gauge their satisfaction with the program
  overall, with the goal of 80 - 100% of parents satisfied with it. Tutors will
  have end of program interviews with the program director for feedback,
  adjusting as needed. We’re hoping they express satisfaction as well and see a
  retention rate above 75%.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '400'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '2000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Students who enroll in our program will leave with higher scores, increasing
  the city’s SBAC’s scores. They’ll also leave with a genuine interest in math,
  confidence in an academic environment, and be equipped with better study
  habits. They’ll be mentored by young professionals who are familiar with or
  from their area, forming a connection with someone who models reachable
  success. Students who otherwise would’ve never pursued careers in math will be
  eager to do so, resulting in an increase in STEM employment. Uplifting them in
  turn uplifts their communities, helping families and neighborhoods be exposed
  to greater opportunities. The tutors walk away either paid for their time or
  with credits in service to their name, and a strong sense of fulfillment.
  Their positive experience will be shared with friends, who we hope in turn
  also sign up, increasing volunteerism in the city. The program helps to foster
  a culture that values education, volunteerism, and the pursuit of STEM
  subjects.
