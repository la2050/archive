title: Justice and safety for survivors
project_summary: >-
  We seek to address the lack of safety and accessibility to justice for
  immigrants who are survivors of domestic violence and sexual abuse and the
  problem of some government and law enforcement agencies that become barriers
  to their seeking justice and safety rather than being part of the solutions.
  When an immigrant survivor receives justice and feels safe, they have the
  ability to becoming more integrated into our communities.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Applying a proven model or solution to a new issue or sector (e.g., using a
  job recruiting software or strategy to match clients to supportive housing
  sites, applying demonstrated strategies from advocating for college
  affordability to advocating for housing affordability and homelessness, etc.)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  The problems we seek to address are the lack of safety and accessing justice
  for immigrants who are survivors of domestic abuse and sexual assault along
  with the problem of some government and law enforcement agencies that become
  barriers to these issues rather than being part of the solutions. Integration
  is difficult in a good situation for immigrants, let alone for ones who are
  survivors. LACLJ serves survivors (mostly immigrants) of domestic abuse and/or
  sexual assault through free legal representation and free legal support for a
  survivor seeking justice and safety. Survivors are underrepresented and
  oppressed to begin with and now have gone through trauma and have to go
  through this legal system on their own, without attorneys, in court with their
  abuser who has the right to cross examine them. In regards to government being
  more responsive to residents, survivors are consistently met with barriers
  rather than comprehensive solutions to support them being safe.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Current programs are creating safety and justice for immigrants who are
  survivors of domestic abuse and sexual assault, including those who have been
  trafficked, while working to make all government and law enforcement agencies
  providers of solutions rather than barriers. LACLJ provides free legal
  representation to help survivors secure restraining orders and favorable
  custody orders so they may be protected and their children be protected from
  violence. For sexual assault survivors, attorneys explain the criminal
  process, ensuring survivors feel safe to report, and then work to ensure
  survivors' rights are protected during the prosecution of the perpetrator.
  Another program at LACLJ is obtaining immigration status and ending the fear
  of deportation for immigrants we serve. Survivors sometimes choose not to seek
  justice or safety because of the fear of being deported if they do so. Our
  40-year history has showed that as we serve survivors and bring justice and
  safety into their lives, they become more integrated into our community and
  those in government who are tasked with supporting them have the ability to
  understand them and their challenges in a higher level. As we work with
  survivors we see the barriers through government services and agencies meant
  to help them actually create barriers for them when seeking justice and
  safety, such as a survivor being able to file for a restraining order without
  having to enter any public place where the abuser may be present.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  We consistently survey those we have served to ensure levels of justice and
  safety after having worked with them. In 2019, 94% of exiting clients reported
  they knew what to do in response to threats to their safety, and 92% agreed or
  strongly agreed that they understood their legal rights. 71% of clients felt
  that they knew about services that could help them (a 54% improvement from
  intake), and 72% of those clients felt they were receiving enough help from
  those services. 89% of clients said after receiving services they felt less
  fear, 91% felt more confidence, 89% felt more hopeful. 89% of parents reported
  that they had a better relationship with their children, and there was a 63%
  increase in the number of parents reporting they were satisfied with their
  ability to co-parent. 44% of clients reported satisfaction with their
  financial condition after receiving services (a 200% increase over those
  clients at intake).
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '2700'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  LA County would be different if our work is successful because we would have
  more (low, income, immigrant) women taking control of their lives and their
  families' lives, moving beyond the oppression of abusive relationships,
  empowered and fully engaging in the benefits of our society by speaking up and
  accessing their legal rights. LA County is also different in the way survivors
  feel about their own individual lives, including the safety they feel, which
  adds hope and justice to LA County. Immigrants are much more easily integrated
  into our communities when they experience safety and justice. LA County will
  also be different in the way all government agencies serve (or don’t serve)
  survivors and being institutions that support survivors receiving justice and
  finding safety rather than being barriers to these things. A different LA
  County in regards to government agencies and law enforcement would mean that
  these powers are used to protect and support survivors.
