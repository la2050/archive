title: Watts Up Los Angeles
project_summary: >-
  Watts Up Los Angeles is an interactive campaign to help people in Los Angeles
  County understand their energy usage and responsibility to conserve power by
  participating in a citywide DJ competition. Major neighborhoods and DJs
  promote their performances across the city and recruit fans to generate
  kinetic energy to power their music performances on re-engineered playground
  equipment. Local energy experts and vendors are onsite and online to empower
  Angelenos to understand their carbon footprint in order to tread lightly in
  Los Angeles.

'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  The specter of black/brownouts looms large in everyone's minds - and the only
  real-time solution is for people to take it upon themselves to conserve
  energy. Bringing people together is the right engine. By running, jumping,
  turning, or pedaling to create kinetic energy through a number of playground
  devices (Swing Sets, Human Hamster Wheels, SeeSaws, Bikes and Hand-cranks),
  individuals understand the value of energy. Much of the burden of rolling
  blackouts falls on the disenfranchised and underserved populations because
  they lack political power. By including all Los Angeles neighborhoods in this
  project, we are bringing in community voices and politicians to advocate for
  better solutions long term, and to build solidarity among more privileged
  groups to trim their own consumption to reduce the need for rolling blackouts
  that they often aren’t paying the price for themselves.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Watts Up Los Angeles provides an opportunity for Los Angeles to learn about
  renewable energy through a campaign built around the city's biggest resource,
  its citizens. By creating their own energy with others in their communities
  and interacting with different Los Angeles neighborhoods in an open-air
  festival environment, Angelenos can share ideas on ways to limit their energy
  usage and support clean energy options in Los Angeles. As everyone has an
  energy footprint, our goal is to create momentum and awareness for ways we can
  reduce our energy, spark innovation in the communities all while providing a
  fun and entertaining experience for all ages. Watts Up Los Angeles requires
  all participants. volunteers, vendors, and spectators to calculate their
  carbon footprint as their entry fee into the experience. Free downloads of the
  Watts Up Los Angeles digital soundtrack will also be available for those
  downloading the Green Outlet app which can monitor the energy usage of
  household appliances and estimate the amount of carbon produced based on your
  energy usage.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Watts Up Los Angele's impact is measured by the number of Angelenos
  participating in a high number of touch point experiences, including
  participation as a DJ, a volunteer, a participant in generating energy, an
  audience member, a follower on social media, a speaker, a supporter, a vendor,
  and more. We will report on the number of people calculating their carbon
  footprint and signing up for an energy monitoring app. Global Inheritance is
  also able to track the amount of wattage generated by the audience, the number
  of people voting for their favorite Los Angeles DJ's, the number of people
  volunteering for the project, and working with educators to empower people to
  learn about energy use.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '5000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '100000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Watts Up Los Angeles's vision for success is people feeling empowered by the
  idea that conserving energy can help save the planet and their communities.
  That embracing a county powered by renewable energy is our future and that
  Angelenos need to innovate in the space and inspire each other. Better
  informed Angelenos on energy and climate issues can use their voice, their
  vote, and their dollars to support low wattage, clean energy-friendly that
  benefits all. The impact that the creative talent across Los Angeles County
  can make by motivating their communities ensures this program isn't just for
  the environmentalists but for all types of Angelenos.
