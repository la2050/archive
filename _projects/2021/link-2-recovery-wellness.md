title: Link 2 Recovery & Wellness
project_summary: >-
  From 2020 our daily rituals have been disrupted and many have suffered
  devastating effects to their mental health and increased substance use due to
  COVID-19. Feelings of fear, anger, and anxiety have exposed the vulnerability
  of our communities. Social Model Recovery Systems serves over 1200
  participants a year and provides measurable results for a healthier lifestyle.
  Our goal is to maximize opportunities by connecting participants to accessible
  telehealth services at every step of their recovery journey and increase
  social support systems.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - San Gabriel Valley
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the need to increase accessibility to
  services through technology for vulnerable populations such as those with
  mental health conditions and Substance Use Disorders (SUD). In a survey of all
  participants throughout our treatment programs, we found that only 22% had
  access to devices compatible with telehealth and video-conferencing. This is
  extremely concerning as disruption to treatment services and social isolation
  can be devastating for people in recovery. In a recent study conducted by
  Hulsey, Mellis, and Kelly (2020), 34% of 1079 respondents reported that they
  experienced accessibility problems in treatment and recovery support, and 20%
  reported increased substance use due to COVID-19. Video chatting and
  telehealth have become a lifeline to many, but disparities in technology
  access prevents many from getting the supports they need to maintain their
  recovery.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  The purpose would be to improve the capacity of the organization to provide
  telehealth services to program participants, as well as help participants
  connect to recovery support groups and families while in treatment. In order
  to increase the telehealth capacity, a technology assessment needs to be
  conducted and upgrades are necessary to the current system. Telehealth
  provides an opportunity to keep participants engaged especially in times of
  crises, as well as during the normal course of business and the use of
  video-chat has become common practice for people to connect with social
  supports. One of the biggest barriers is not having the devices with the
  capabilities to connect due to either lack of data plan, limited data plan, or
  no internet connection. Telehealth is bound to stay even after the COVID-19
  pandemic is over and we return to a new normal in our lives. Telehealth made
  it convenient for many to see doctors virtually, skip waiting rooms, and stay
  safe while receiving services. Many support groups have expanded their access
  by creating virtual rooms for people to join. This initiative would improve
  technology capacity and provide tablets to program participants to use while
  in treatment. Technology that most people often take for granted is a luxury
  that many others cannot afford and exacerbates existing disparities in health,
  education, and income.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  This is an early stage project to increase organizational telehealth capacity.
  Objectives: a. Conduct technology assessment. b. Obtain 500 tablets to provide
  program participants with a device that can utilize telehealth services via
  licensed HIPAA compliant platform. c. Train all staff and program participants
  on the proper use, privacy protocols, and telehealth etiquette. Outcomes: a.
  Reduce disruptions in service, maintain engagement, and increase accessibility
  through building telehealth capacity. b. Increase social connection of program
  participants to families, friends, support groups, fellowships in recovery,
  and 12-step sponsors. Measures: a. Reducing disruptions in service will be
  measured by sign-in sheets, and Telehealth Capacity Questionnaire. b.
  Engagement will be measured by number of participants who stay at least
  30-days in treatment and Telehealth Capacity Questionnaire. c. Connection will
  be measured by pre and post-test Telehealth Capacity Questionnaire results.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1200'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '2400'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  The vision for success for this project is to increase accessibility to our
  programs through telehealth to improve engagement, recovery, and wellness for
  those suffering from mental health issues and SUD. These individuals face an
  increased risk of physical and psychological consequences that have been
  exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic (Cullen, et al., 2020). The initiative
  will diminish and prevent the long-term effects of the pandemic on this
  vulnerable population by improving engagement, recovery, and wellness. Studies
  show that treatment delivered through telehealth is as effective as in-person
  sessions, has higher satisfaction rates, and improves retention rates (Lin, et
  al., 2019). The success of this initiative will advance recovery and treatment
  while reducing the economic burden the county faces due to untreated SUD.
  Achieving sustainable recovery for participants will improve productivity and
  the quality of life for Los Angeles (LAC Department of Public Health, 2020).
