title: Foundations for Future Armenian Professionals
project_summary: >-
  The Armenian Professional Society’s goal is to encourage and assist Armenian
  professionals in Los Angeles to achieve their full potential by providing
  scholarships and mentorships, along with networking resources and
  opportunities. The funds will provide scholarship monies for Armenian graduate
  students selected by the organization. Additional funds will be invested in
  our Mentorship Program, which aims to create valuable relationships among
  established professionals and young adults. Lastly, APS will also be using
  funds to host an annual GALA.

  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - San Gabriel Valley
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South LA
  - Westside
  - South Bay
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  The problem our organization is seeking to address is the lack of funding and
  support for our elemental programs. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and current
  political upheaval in Armenia, our ability to raise funds that would be used
  for creation, build-out, expansion and modernization of our programs is
  stifled. Additionally, as a non-profit organization, our operating budget
  derives from donations and membership dues, which makes it challenging to
  acquire a budget to support our programs. There are not many resources
  available specifically tailored for young Armenian professionals. Through our
  Scholarship and Mentorship programs, we can create positive and impactful
  partnerships with Armenian professionals in the Los Angeles area and beyond.
  This resource will grant participants first-hand insight on their aspiring
  career fields from seasoned professionals and will allow for training and
  opportunities to aid them in their early careers, which they would not have
  access to on their own.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  The Scholarship Program is the pillar of the organization. Each year,
  approximately $17,500 is awarded to eligible Armenian graduate students to aid
  in their educational advancement. Financial support from this grant will go
  towards marketing and program expansion, so that we may be able to support
  more Graduate students than we currently have the capacity to do.
  Additionally, the Mentorship Program, which is a newer program with
  approximately 45 mentors and mentees, is one the organization hopes to expand
  in size. This program’s goal is to garner conversation, understanding, and
  discovery of a similar or new professional industry among participants.
  Funding will be used for marketing, investment in managing programs, training,
  and other resources. In addition, the GALA is the vital event of the year,
  where scholarship recipients are recognized and members of the organization
  can come together to celebrate each other's accomplishments. It is also an
  integral networking opportunity.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  The programs mentioned in this proposal are not new programs, although the
  Mentorship Program is in its early years of implementation. The Scholarship
  Program and the GALA have been in existence since the founding of the
  organization in 1958. The Mentorship Program is a newer program, started
  around two years ago, which we hope to expand with the help of this grant. We
  measure the impact these programs provide for Armenian professionals by our
  membership numbers, monetary donations by individuals and organizations, and
  by surveying award recipients and making sure these awards are ultimately used
  to advance the individual professionally.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '120'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '500'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Currently, there are over 250,000 individuals on Armenian descent living in
  the greater Los Angeles area. WIth the proper networking and structure, the
  Armenian community can have a greater impact in professional fields and come
  together with one another to learn, educate, and connect with individuals from
  all different backgrounds. As a non-political organization, we take great
  pride in cultural advancement. With the help of LA 2050, we hope to be able to
  do just that for young professionals of Armenian descent. We understand that
  not everyone has the same resources to be able to advance and grow
  professionally, therefore APS aims to give back to those who need it the most,
  by investing in them so they can invest in themselves. With assistance into
  the Scholarship and Mentorship programs and the GALA event, APS can provide
  fundamental resources for young Armenian professionals to learn, grow, and
  prosper in their respective communities, paving the way for generations to
  come.
