project_video: ''
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
  - LAUSD (select only if you have a district-wide partnership or project)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Applying a proven model or solution to a new issue or sector (e.g., using a
  job recruiting software or strategy to match clients to supportive housing
  sites, applying demonstrated strategies from advocating for college
  affordability to advocating for housing affordability and homelessness, etc.)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Every year Los Angeles becomes an increasingly difficult city to afford with
  the steady rise in rent for commercial properties. We are looking to combat
  this obstacle by creating a co-operative space, first by sharing the cost of
  purchasing the building as a collective and then by maintaining the space as a
  collaboration. This shared environment will offer stability and security to
  the arts organizations, allowing these groups to focus on their work and their
  participants, rather than the burden of rising rent costs and building upkeep.
  By doing so, we ensure that the organizations and the participants will enjoy
  everlasting success. Additionally, through the role of The Neighborhood
  Investment Company this building will be purchased at below market rates,
  passing affordable rent on to the tenant organizations.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  The grant will alleviate start-up costs, site build-out and early maintenance
  of what will be a brand new arts community center and co-operative in Echo
  Park. This building will house three organizations who, through the role of
  The Neighborhood Investment Company, will operate with a stable and below
  market rent via a 20-year lease provided by NICO. The building will be
  dedicated to only house nonprofit organizations as tenants. The mission of
  this building is to serve the community through media programming, public arts
  and arts education. Its tenants, initial Dublab, and ArtworxLA, will conduct
  their day-to-day operations from this location including progressive radio,
  podcasts and video programing; arts education for alternative high school
  teenagers through sustained arts exposure and immersion; and the cultivation
  of diverse creative communities and practices. Furthermore, as these
  organizations exist together in one site, the opportunity for participants to
  engage with each group naturally increases - a symbiosis that exponentially
  benefits the individuals to grow with introductions to every organization
  located at the center. This center will be a beacon in the community, creating
  a wide impact on many levels. Behind the stability and security of this venue,
  we will be able to grow deep roots in Los Angeles and provide a space that
  prioritizes the interests of the Los Angeles youth and people overall, in a
  healthy and flourishing way.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Our success will first be seen by the number of participants and developed
  programs/events that come through the center. 3 - 4 cohorts per organization
  per 3-month term of 5 -25 participants each. Weekly panels, discussions and
  workshops. 14 hours of live radio programming. Finished work in the public and
  private sector - programs on air; published or produced written work and
  visual arts; and on the streets. Success of this project as a co-operative
  building, will be defined by the impact we make in the community through our
  programs and the financial stability it offers to the tenant organizations.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '800'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1000000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-

  empower how they participate in the world. A safe place where artists can have
  a platform and a voice with a means for amplification, and where Los Angeles’s
  creative communities can connect, learn, and network. Success will be the
