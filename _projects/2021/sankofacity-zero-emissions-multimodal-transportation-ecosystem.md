title: 'SankofaCity: Zero Emissions Multimodal Transportation Ecosystem'
project_summary: >-
  SankofaCity ZEMTE initiative will use grant funding to continue providing free
  on-demand shuttle services and e-bike rentals by extension of the quick start
  LACI ZEMCP, Leimert Park Multimodal Transportation efforts, currently
  available since fall 2020. Interim funding is necessary to avoid gaps in the
  aforementioned mobility services through the end of 2021. Alternative grant
  funding is allocated for a transition towards a Leimert Park community-owned
  and operated transportation provider solution, scheduled to launch services in
  early 2022.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Greater Leimert Park Village Crenshaw Corridor (GLPVCC) suffers from a lack of
  multimodal connectivity and shared mobility services, high incidence of
  pedestrian/cyclist injuries/fatalities due to vehicle collisions,
  cost-burdened households with above-average housing/transportation expenses,
  poor air quality, and low vehicle-ownership rates. Sankofacity transportation
  needs assessment reports, based on extensive community engagement with GLPVCC
  stakeholders, indicate significant gaps in the availability of affordable and
  safe transportation options, which residents of all ages need to access jobs,
  education, and other essential services. GLPVCC community stakeholders also
  indicated concerns regarding parking, traffic congestion, and adverse health
  effect due to poor air quality issues.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  SankofaCity seeks to address systemic transportation, employment, education,
  and health care inequities suffered by disadvantaged South LA communities of
  color, by developing a community-owned and operated Zero Emissions Multimodal
  Transportation Ecosystem with opportunities for sustainable economic
  development, employment, education, skills training, and cultural tourism
  within GLPVCC neighborhoods. Grant funding will be used to prevent a gap in
  multimodal transportation services currently provided by the quickstart LACI
  ZEMCP Leimert Park efforts, which employs local shuttle drivers and
  vehicle/e-bike maintenance staff, funds community outreach, and provides
  residents with on-demand access to numerous financial institutions, health
  care facilities, pharmacies, grocery markets, parks, public spaces, cultural
  events, performing arts venues, visual art galleries, and local schools, as
  well as first-last-mile access to public transportation bus stops and LA Metro
  Stations. Sankofacity has secured alternative 5-year grant funding, earmarked
  to develop a community-owned multimodal transportation provider and mobility
  innovation cooperative, that is scheduled to expand the aforementioned
  mobility services in the GLPVCC neighborhoods as early as January 2022.The
  goal is to sustainably operate zero-emission transportation-as-a-service while
  developing value add opportunities that include cultural tourism, mixed
  reality experiences, online user experiences, and network marketing POS.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  The SankofaCity, ZEMTE application is based on a Community Needs Assessment
  formulated with extensive engagement with GLPVCC community stakeholders;
  desktop research on safety, infrastructure, and accessibility; and initial
  results of a quick-start pilot program with LACI ZEMCP. In addition to meeting
  the needs raised by community stakeholders and confirmed by desktop research,
  our proposal will also expand and extend a successful 6-month, LACI ZEMCP
  Leimert Park Multimodal Transportation effort. Our proposal, if successfully
  granted, will build on best practices from the quick-start LACI ZEMCP by
  extending and expanding mobility services over the next year, in parallel with
  recently secured 5-year grant funding. Based on LACI ZEMCP findings, the
  GLPVCC community is most engaged with demand-responsive shuttle service and
  less receptive to e-bike library rentals. Thus funding would in part be
  utilized to provide more than 6 times the LACI ZEMCP.weekly shuttle hours of
  service.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '57993'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  SankofaCity empowers GLPVCC communities to self-sufficiently co-operate and
  maintain Zero Emission Multimodal Transportation with support from CBOs and
  Mobility Providers, collaboratively offering operational oversight and
  technical expertise; thus providing unique local economic development,
  intellectual property, jobs, and skills-training opportunities that socialize
  innovative mobility futures and track operational best practices. Utilizing
  co-operative and revenue-sharing business models SankofaCity redistributes
  profits directly back into under-served Angeleno communities to build both
  individual and collective assets for the neighborhoods serviced. Most
  importantly, SankofaCity ZEMTE provides community stakeholders with clean
  mobility options that mitigate dependencies on personal transportation,
  improve access to local resources, facilitate employment opportunities, ease
  parking scarcities, minimize pedestrian fatalities, and proportionally
  alleviate environmental concerns.
