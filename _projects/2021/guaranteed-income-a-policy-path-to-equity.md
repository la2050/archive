title: Guaranteed Income- A Policy Path to Equity
project_summary: >-
  The F4GI Compton Pledge is a landmark guaranteed income (GI) initiative that
  will distribute recurring cash relief to low-income residents for 2 years. GI
  is simple but powerful: unconditional, direct, and continuous cash payments
  delivered to all residents to supplement existing welfare benefits. By
  ensuring that no individual falls below a defined income floor over time, GI
  creates a true safety net. It enables families to weather crises, government
  actors, philanthropists to invest directly in the path towards economic
  justice.

What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  F4GI Compton Pledge has been dedicated to combating the stigmas associated
  with cash assistance programs and the reputation of Compton. Alongside local
  organizations and reputable non-profits we were able to enroll undocumented
  and formerly incarcerated residents otherwise excluded from welfare programs.
  Our team wholeheartedly believes that guaranteed income can be the policy of
  the future. It is a way to end systemic racism, cyclical poverty, enhance the
  dignity of our communities, and give people a moment to breath.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  F4GI Compton Pledge is the largest city-based guaranteed income pilot in the
  U.S. Our Pledge to the people of Compton is to invest in the economic
  self-determination of a community. Compton has been systematically
  under-resourced, which has only been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
  Located in Los Angeles County, a major epicenter in the spread of the virus,
  Compton has 100,000 residents, 30% of which Black and 68% Latino; 98% of
  residents are in high risk groups for COVID-19. A growing number of residents
  are relying on food pantries daily, and poverty rates have risen since the
  start of the pandemic, but many welfare programs exclude members of our
  community who are formerly incarcerated. Our team as created a direct online
  cash transfer program 800 low-income residents will receive unconditional cash
  installments for two years. This grant will help continue to maintain the
  pilot for the next two years and ensure operations, dashboards, and
  communication can continue. Additionally, funding the gap to continue adding
  more people to the Compton Pledge to provided desperate relief to one of the
  most vulnerable communities in LA County.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  To ensure our pilot program was representative of the diverse culture and
  people of Compton we worked with key stakeholders to help ensure that the
  impact GI was not limited as other government supported welfare programs are
  structures. Our vision has been to execute, and catalyze a GI pilot centered
  around serving the true Compton community. Compton Pledge’s vision came true
  with the help of both these groups by ensuring our process was not limiting
  “who” would become a participant, but expanded resources and research into how
  cash transfers can help the most vulnerable and neglected communities. Over
  the next two years we will conducting participant survey's to monitor and
  track the progress, and impact of the guaranteed income has had on the lives
  and families of our recipients. A planned full study and report is to be
  completed at the end of the two years.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1717'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': ''
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  With the successful development of the Compton Pledge Payments portal for
  recipients and admins, we are testing more inclusive and effective mechanisms
  for cash transfer delivery. By including the unbanked, formerly incarcerated
  individuals, and undocumented immigrants, the Compton Pledge will enhance the
  economic security of and self-determination of historically marginalized
  groups. Additionally, the F4GI Compton Pledge are creating coalitions in
  service provision with our financial literacy and coaching partners. We are
  removing paternalistic conditions or requirements around the cash transfer.
  Any additional services offered would be optional and requests to track
  outcomes would be minimal. With are local and national partners, we are
  enhancing our movement-building efforts, capabilities, and campaigns with our
  partners such as the National Council for Incarcerated and Formerly
  Incarcerated Women and Girls, A New Way of Life, and Essie Justice Group.
