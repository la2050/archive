title: 'BBFK: MORE Program'
project_summary: >-
  Building Blocks for Kids’ goal is eliminating poverty in underrepresented LA
  communities by giving high school students the chance to be financially
  literate and career ready. We’re motivated to lower student loan debt, shrink
  the wealth & opportunity gap, reduce the number of homeless, decrease the
  number of youth entering the juvenile system, and increase the use of
  undergraduate degrees. BBFK believes that by educating our youth at the right
  time, we can give them the mindset to achieve a path for success in the
  future.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - LAUSD (select only if you have a district-wide partnership or project)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  BBFK is seeking to eliminate generational poverty within underrepresented
  communities. People living within these communities are affected by certain
  determinant factors: Socioeconomic status, environment, and race. Having
  financial issues, lacking access to resources, and facing discrimination,
  plays a part in pre-determining the type of future the younger generation will
  have. These are roadblocks that hinder the true potential of high school
  students who easily become dropouts, criminals, unemployed, and impoverished.
  Although students are given the opportunity to go to school, they are not
  properly advised on what resources they can take advantage of to improve and
  excel both academically and socially. Essentially, high school students are
  not presented with enough options to succeed in life and we know this when
  around 70% of college graduates are not using their bachelor degree when they
  enter the workforce.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  High school students are not effectively prepared to face the financial and
  career-ready obstacles that come with becoming a successful college
  attendee/graduate. It's critical to give our students the right information at
  the right time. That's why the MORE Program empowers underrepresented students
  and schools by providing financial literacy and career based education during
  school hours. The MORE Program works directly with high school students for 40
  minute per lesson, once a week for 12 weeks each semester. The timeline for
  our MORE Program is based on the LAUSD calendar. We implement our first
  semester of financial literacy where we cover important topics such as taxes,
  loans, budgeting, insurance, etc. In the second semester, we dive into career
  development and expose the students to a plethora of careers in diverse
  sectors. Expert speakers or incredible individual volunteers come into the
  classroom to discuss these topics in further detail. Individuals go over real
  world experiences and scenarios to help bring the information to life so that
  students have a better understanding of what they are going to face once they
  graduate. During the presentation, students engage in team-based critical
  thinking activities to connect their own environment. The last five years
  we’ve run our program in after school programs and realized our program is
  more impactful inside the high school. Therefore, we emphasize working
  directly with students during school hours.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  In running our program, we will be evaluating the short-term success of
  students based on their performance through their quizzes and test scores. We
  can also keep track of attendance and record participation to gather data to
  analyze the effectiveness of our program. Our underlying goal for these
  students is to ensure that they have a better understanding of the weight of
  their financial decisions as they leave high school and become adults. In the
  long-term, we will evaluate long term success with our students executing a
  better blueprint for their future financial and career decisions. This means
  that students are going to the right schools rather than to the ones that are
  more prestigious, accessing scholarships/grants to graduate debt-free, using
  their degrees when they enter the workforce, and not falling into financial
  distress as adults. Our city and state will prosper if students are given the
  chance to grow as the wealth and opportunity gaps drop.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '152'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '160000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  We see Los Angeles County looking like a place that all students would want to
  stay, grow their lives, and be proud to call themselves Angelenos. Students
  who once were in our program will leave with an abundance of knowledge to make
  better financial decisions not only for their lives, yet for everyone around
  them. We see our former students returning and becoming helpful interns or
  volunteers for our programs' younger generations. Our program will also result
  in more Los Angeles students giving back to their communities, pursuing the
  proper degrees so they can enter the workforce right after college, less
  student loan debt, less individuals falling into homelessness, and lastly, but
  most importantly, ending the cycle of poverty which has plagued our great
  city. Our program will also make LA County a safer place because the students
  will gravitate towards legal activities because they will have the help,
  resources, and the incentives they need to stay away from illegal activities.
