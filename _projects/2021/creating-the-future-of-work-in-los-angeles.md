'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-

What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  We are seeking to address the retention rates of underrepresented and
  marginalized populations (Women, BIPOC, LGBTQIA+) in private and public
  institutions and workplaces. I'd like to run a county wide assessment and
  provide employees with a platform that helps to increase education and
  retention. Turnover within the workplace and within public and private
  institutions is costing our economies billions of dollars a year. It is also
  harming the potential for underrepresented populations to build generational
  wealth.

  company produces/provides the following products/services: DEI question banks,
  analytics assessments, benchmarking page, automated strategic planning and
  direct access to industry professionals. The project would launch a citywide
  assessment that helps us to gauge the root cause of discrimination and build
  solutions to make our workplaces and educational institutions a more equitable
  place to live and thrive.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-

  months.We have increased retention by 75% in the companies who use our
  technology and methodology, we are decreasing discrimination complaints by 15%
  and instances of microaggressions by 13%.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1000'
