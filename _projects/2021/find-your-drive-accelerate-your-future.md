title: 'Find Your Drive, Accelerate Your Future'
project_summary: >-
  Acceler8, an innovative new automotive education program, pairs at-risk teens
  and opportunity youth with volunteer law enforcement officers and automotive
  professionals, joined by a common passion for automobiles. We support youth at
  risk for gang and/or juvenile justice involvement in learning skills that
  prepare them for jobs in the automotive and trades workforce. We seek to
  secure a stationary garage facility and to build a staff adequate to the
  ever-expanding demand for our program.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Youth arrests in Los Angeles have affected over 31,000 youth from ages 10-24
  since 2016. One of the primary reasons young people become involved with gangs
  and crime is a lack of positive role models and direction. There is a distinct
  lack of opportunities for engagement and vocational education for youth that
  can provide structure. Gangs and crime involvement can then become a
  substitute for caring adults, addressing low self-esteem, the desire for a
  sense of belonging and safety or protection. This lack of direction and
  hopelessness, resulting in juvenile crime involvement, affects not only youth
  but also the Los Angeles communities in which they reside. A 2016 Los Angeles
  Times article reports that LA County spends $233,000 per year to hold each
  youth in juvenile lockup; money much better spent in providing education, hope
  and direction to assist them in becoming the responsible adults and stable
  leaders of tomorrow.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Acceler8 counters the influences of gang and crime involvement by providing
  stable mentorship and education in a growing trade field. Students build
  skills that will allow them to lift themselves and their families out of
  multigenerational poverty. Law enforcement officers build supportive
  relationships with youth and guide them toward success. Acceler8's classes
  center on STEM learning via automotive technology, from basic engineering,
  science and mathematics around the design of engines and drivetrain mechanics
  to the intricate computers and technology that tie systems together. Students
  also receive training in career and life skills, including resume and
  interview classes, dress/image, team building, communication and social
  skills. Acceler8’s goals for funding are two-fold: 1) To secure and lease a
  standing garage facility in which to conduct our automotive classes. We have
  been fortunate to hold classes in some world-class gifted garage spaces,
  including the Petersen Automotive Museum and Barrus Kustom Motors. As great as
  this has been for our students, dedicated space would allow us to accommodate
  more students and to store our tools and vehicles safely, as well as providing
  a work environment for our Instructors and lead staff. 2) To hire a full time
  Mechanic Instructor to lead classes each semester, reducing our reliance on
  the availability of volunteer instructors.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Acceler8 measures the effectiveness of the program by the number of student
  participants, the continued interest and demand for classes, and their
  increase in their skills and understanding. We utilize surveys and pre and
  post questionnaires, allowing us to examine the effectiveness of classroom and
  teaching material being used. We also observe and document the assistance that
  our students are using within our program, in order to help build on their
  future goals so that they may work towards an established career field.
  Through these measures we gain a better perspective of how our program can
  continue to improve on curriculum, classroom skills and equipment, to better
  serve our students.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '100'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '950'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Acceler8 echoes LA2050’s LEARN goal to allow all residents to contribute their
  skills, talents, and abilities to society. A study by the Brookings Institute
  of the at-risk students that we serve acknowledges that just 14% will complete
  4-year degrees. They state, “A better approach…would be to develop coherent
  pathways, beginning in high school, into authentic technical education
  options.” Our classes provide the opportunity for true economic equity for our
  students, 95% of whom are persons of color. We anticipate that they will build
  their skillset and confidence so that they are more empowered and capable of
  making better decisions for their future. Our vision is contained in the words
  of a father, who had just been released from prison, approaching us tearfully,
  “Oh my God, you saved my son’s life. If it wasn’t for this program, he would
  have ended up in prison like me.” That heartfelt moment is why Acceler8 was
  created and how we will make Los Angeles a better place.
