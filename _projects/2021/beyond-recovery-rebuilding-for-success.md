title: Beyond Recovery - Rebuilding for Success
project_summary: >-
  The Latino community continues to experience deep impacts from COVID-19 and
  the potential disruption to the prosperity of the Latino community for
  generations to come is too large to ignore. By prioritizing first-generation
  college students, broadening access to financial assistance, and maximizing
  existing infrastructures and programs, the Southeast LA region will create
  college attainment in a more supportive environment while also facilitating
  responsive and inclusive recovery plans that meet the short and long-term
  needs of the community.

  - 'Other:: Southeast LA (SELA)'
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Latino students in SELA that graduate from high school and access college has
  risen over the last few years. In 2009-10, the graduation rate in the Los
  Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) was 62.4% and in 2018-19, it rose to
  78.1% which is reflective of the overall growth in California. The percentage
  of SELA residents completing high school has remained consistent over the last
  decade. However, there are still large and persistent gaps for SELA students
  that include college preparation, access, and completion. These gaps are also
  on course to widen due to the pandemic with only an estimated 54% of the class
  of 2022 on track to graduate. The disparity is even wider in college: only 7%
  of SELA residents have a bachelor’s degree or higher, compared to 31.2% and
  32.6% of LA County and CA, respectively. A recovery plan that is responsive
  and inclusive is necessary to close poverty gaps, decision makers need to make
  meaningful strides to meet the educational needs in the SELA region.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  This grant will support the implementation of the College and Success in the
  Southeast (CASS) framework which has identified the following six policy
  values: (1) Maintain and Ensure College is Financially Accessible, (2)
  Prioritize Preparedness for First- Generation Students, (3) Increase College
  Preparedness Support Options in High School, (4) Strengthen Post-Secondary
  Support Options, (5) Create a SELA College-Going Culture, and (6) Prioritize
  Career Readiness and Expand Workforce Development. ABC will focus on
  collaboration and alignment efforts with partners, develop and align
  communication strategies to build awareness of educational needs,
  opportunities, and action on budgets and learning recovery plans, ABC will
  engage in relationship building with decision makers and convene
  cross-sectoral stakeholders to implement the framework and align systems - put
  solution ideas to action. ABC will also provide presentations, briefings, and
  capacity training to parents, targeting monolingual Spanish speakers, to build
  awareness of efforts.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Success will be measured by: Parents/caregivers and students are better
  prepared to complete the financial aid application evidenced by a pre/post
  survey Increase in the # of financial aid applications that are completed in
  specific SELA schools An increase in the college counselor-to-student ratio
  for high schools in SELA to support students in accessing financial aid
  information An increase in parent/caregiver understanding of options to meet
  admissions requirements for California’s public colleges and universities
  evidenced by a pre/post survey on A-G requirements Partnerships between at
  least one K-12 school district and local colleges/universities to promote
  access to higher education pathways Increased access to dual enrollment and
  concurrent enrollment programs in SELA Increased access to public and
  non-profit college and career readiness in SELA Cross-sector partnerships with
  8 key local organizations/educational agencies to further workforce
  development opportunities in SELA
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '3000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '440000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  By implementing the College Access & Success in the Southeast framework, ABC
  will lay the groundwork for an economic and educational recovery plan that
  ensures the SELA community is not left behind. ABC will implement a regional
  model that both grows workforce development opportunities and addresses gaps
  in higher education access. Through a coordinated collaborative effort,
  increased college access and completion rates intersecting with workforce
  needs and opportunities, the SELA region will have a more robust recovery from
  the pandemic and also increased opportunities for economic prosperity. By
  focusing on prioritizing support for first-generation students, broadening
  access to financial aid, and maximizing existing infrastructures and programs
  in the first year, SELA will create college attainment in a more supportive
  environment while also facilitating recovery plans that are responsive and
  inclusive to meet the short and long-term needs of the community.
