  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  An LA Times article identified a San Fernando Valley elementary school as “the
  L.A. Unified campus that has more students classified as homeless than any
  other,” while another highlighted that local residents “breathe some of
  California’s worst air and suffer from asthma-related hospitalizations at
  rates far higher than most of the state.” Structural poverty and racial
  inequity plague San Fernando Valley communities. The lack of public investment
  coupled with the overcriminalization brought on by social inequity, has
  created a culture of nihilism in youth that increases at-risk behaviors, as
  illustrated by a 25% increase in cannabis use by young people ages 18-25 in LA
  County in recent years. Further, the communities primarily served by AWOKE are
  some of the hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. Youth in these communities
  are disproportionately impacted by the pandemic, which has led to a drastic
  increase in disconnected, underserved youth in Los Angeles County.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Throughout the year, The GR818ERS x UNITE activates the UNITE Cultural Center
  to produce culturally-responsive platforms for youth engagement that include
  workshops, club programs, school-based programs, drop-in activities and other
  accessible entry points, including the leveraging of virtual platforms and
  social media. As participants grapple with the social isolation created by the
  global COVID-19 pandemic, virtual program activities keep them connected to
  others. Productive engagement in creative exchange reduces the feelings of
  nihilism and apathy that are heightened due to the prolonged conditions of
  social confinement during the pandemic. Program staff utilize
  empowerment-based approaches to mobilize the arts and athletics as tools to
  address trauma, transformative spaces that foster identity work, and
  organizing bodies that advance social change. Furthermore, through mentorships
  with veteran practitioners, youth are given unique vantage points through
  which to understand and develop their identity and learn to embrace a lifelong
  pursuit of knowledge. Virtual program efforts are integrated throughout the
  organization and provide safe, accessible entry points to services for youth
  regardless of physical location and ability levels. From youth arts programs
  to cultural arts experiences, virtual activities reduce barriers to
  participation and supplement in-person engagements.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Programs are evaluated through staff and participant surveys and interviews
  tracking socioemotional wellbeing and the efficacy of program approaches. The
  following self-reported factors are evaluated: self-efficacy; belonging;
  empowerment; peer support; reactions to social challenges; leadership in
  activity; decision-making in activity; and cultural responsiveness of
  activity. Additionally, at monthly staff meetings, program staff report
  participant progress. Program staff also report on the efficacy of participant
  referrals to local service providers and community networking efforts.
  Furthermore, annual listening sessions and community surveys are used to
  uplift the voices of youth and their caregivers to reflect on program efforts
  and make meaning of their experiences. These listening sessions provide
  crucial insight for program staff to assess impact, influence design, and fine
  tune measures of success to prioritize community needs.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '100'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '10000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  AWOKE maintains that developing a supportive social ecosystem for youth—one
  that extends to the home—contributes to reductions of at-risk behaviors and
  leads to positive health outcomes. Recognizing that youth may not have a safe,
  productive living environment, the UNITE Cultural Center serves as a drop-in
  center and resource hub to a significant number of migrant first- and
  second-generation students. AWOKE’s approach to youth development is based on
  a cradle-to-career framework that prioritizes wellbeing throughout the arc of
  human development. Program efforts are designed to develop youth resilience,
  social cohesion, and community wellbeing to ensure youth can healthily
  navigate their community and the demands of adulthood. By intentionally
  fostering inclusive spaces, AWOKE leverages its creative platform to connect
  local and international communities to build racial solidarity, promote
  cultural exchange, and nurture global citizenship.
