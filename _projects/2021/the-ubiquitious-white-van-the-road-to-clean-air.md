title: The ubiquitious white van; the road to clean air
project_summary: >-
  Maxwell Vehicles has figured out how to get cleaner air in LA, while
  benefiting community organizations and small businesses with reduced
  transportation costs. Now we need help getting it out there and connecting
  with organizations to give them more equitable access to clean air
  transportation.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Of the million commercial vehicles registered in LA county, many are the
  ubiquitous white van. Unfortunately, they emit high levels of pollution,
  especially highly toxic PM2.5 particles. Each day, LA experiences
  transportation-related pollution that is 60% higher than the CA state average.
  In addition, low income communities are exposed to 25% more than those with
  higher incomes and LA’s POC are exposed to average levels between 21- 43%
  higher than white residents. There has been no viable option to replace these
  vans and there is a misconception that the problem can be solved by replacing
  them with new electric ones, but often old vehicles stay on the road and there
  is a high climate and energy cost to produce the new van. A more sustainable
  manufacturing process is needed and the cost of entry needs to be reduced so
  that small local organizations, and large fleet operators can eliminate
  emissions and reduce operating costs while serving their communities.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Maxwell Vehicles has spent 2 years developing a robust electric van solution
  that will achieve a marked reduction in operating cost, be more reliable with
  lower maintenance, and as a side benefit will not emit any local pollution.
  The Maxwell ePro system takes a customer’s existing van and replaces the
  engine and fuel tank with an ultra-reliable Tesla powertrain and battery
  making it a zero emissions vehicle with minimal maintenance (tires and
  windshield washer fluid). Maxwell is invested in helping nonprofits and
  community serving organizations gain access to this state of the art electric
  vehicle technology which can preserve their existing capital investment by not
  requiring them to invest in a new vehicle. The demand is there, now we just
  need help expanding our production capacity to deliver as many vans as
  possible. Ramping up production requires large investment in people,
  facilities, and tools, but once we have this production can scale rapidly, and
  the shortened delivery times means we improve cash flow and can put more money
  back into growing our capacity sooner.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  We have had customer owned vans on the road for over a year, and our
  telematics system allows us to collect aggregate data from the fleet so we can
  quantitatively calculate how many total miles of operation, how many gallons
  of petroleum have been saved, and how many tons of carbon and particulate
  matter emissions have never been created. Since we also have the total
  electrical energy logged, we can even demonstrate the actual savings just from
  fuel costs alone. We can furnish this data to anyone interested.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '40'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '4000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  With the success of this project, the streets of LA will become much cleaner
  and quieter. Gone will be hundreds of vans that mainly spend time noisily
  idling away their engines. Small businesses and community organizations will
  enjoy lower operation costs of their transportation operations, and their
  clean renewed vehicles will stay on the road many more years with an electric
  powertrain engineered to last a million miles, each van taking an internal
  combustion engine off the road. Without Maxwell’s system, there is nothing
  else available or even in the planning stages that will truly be affordable.
  In addition, no other electric vehicle program will actually remove a
  polluting vehicle from the road.
