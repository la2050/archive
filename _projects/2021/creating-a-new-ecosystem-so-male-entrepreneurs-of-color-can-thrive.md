title: Creating a New Ecosystem So Male Entrepreneurs of Color Can Thrive
project_summary: >-
  The Global Eye Entrepreneurs Fellowship Program brings together a cohort of
  BIPOC and GBTQ Men of color with new business ideas and provides a
  comprehensive array of programming that facilities both personal and
  professional growth and creates a network of support and mentorship from
  industry leaders that, combined with linkages to capital, result in
  successful, thriving business. Currently in the pilot phase with the first
  class of entrepreneurs, Global Eye is looking to solidify and expand the
  programming based on its results.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Despite recent progress, BIPOC, women and LGBTQ founders are underrepresented
  in the entrepreneur community. More than half of companies that have black
  owners were turned down for loans, a rate twice as high as white business
  owners. While men of color are 80% more likely to be entrepreneurial than
  their white counterparts, only 5% ever make it past the start-up phase.
  There’s an entire community of BIPOC and GBTQ men with world changing ideas
  who feel called to a life of deep purpose, alignment, and success, yet they
  face discouragement at every turn. The COVID crisis has only served to
  exacerbate these inequities with inequities in distribution of PPP loans.
  Global Eye imagines a world where the business ventures, ideas, companies, and
  inventions of these men exist and thrive. At its core, Global Eye is a
  community of support, mentorship, and learning to help male and non-binary
  entrepreneurs of color realize their deepest, most audacious visions.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Global Eye is creating a new type of ecosystem where male entrepreneurs of
  color have access to role models, mentors, and capital so they can thrive. It
  provides a platform where the next generation of entrepreneurs are more aware,
  conscious of corporate social responsibility, eager to give back to their
  communities, and accepting of differences and diverse backgrounds. The
  cornerstone of its offerings is the 10-month Fellowship Program. The
  applicants selected as fellows have already taken the first steps in their
  entrepreneurial journey. They have a start-up business that is less than three
  years old in the following industries: Arts & Entertainment, Technology,
  Online Retail, and Social Enterprises. Each has experienced barriers to
  starting or growing their business. The program provides insight and
  instruction in these and other areas: - Financial Literacy & Wellness -
  Product Development - Market Research & Business Model Design - Accounting -
  Human Resource Management and Organization Design - Branding & Marketing -
  Business Plan Writing - Funding, Pitching, and Investor Consults - Access to
  Venture Capital Opportunities Ideas are a dime a dozen--we invest in people,
  specifically male entrepreneurs of color that pursue their passions; implement
  and lead; create thriving teams; meet their measure; and fulfill their dreams.
  The world is full of ideas and businesses; we unleash the entrepreneurial
  spirit of BIPOC and GBTQ men of color. We invest in people, not just ideas.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Success for the fellows in the program is measured by: • Increase in the size
  of the professional networks developed. • Number of connections to capital per
  fellow • Percentage of fellows receiving investment capital • Increase in
  wellness scores across pre- and post-program social-emotional indicator

Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  While the overall wealth of US families increased over the last 30 years, the
  wealth gap continues to grow for black families and other underrepresented
  groups. Institutionalized factors like family income, savings, and home
  ownership coupled with below average lending rates impact the ability of BIPOC
  business owners to succeed. This lack of access to investors and mentor
  networks costs the U.S. economy dollars and jobs—about $1.5 trillion per year.
  Average business development programs do not focus on—nor understand—the
  unique challenges faced by entrepreneurs of color. That’s why the work of
  Global Eye is so important. Investing in these emerging business leaders makes
  LA a better place because of: Closing of the wealth gap Increased employment
  opportunities Equitable distribution of investment capital Creation of
  pipelines for the next generation of entrepreneurs Increased tax base for our
  communities Expanding hope and success for BIPCO and GBTQ men of color
