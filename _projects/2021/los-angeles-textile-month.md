In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Textile Month Los Angeles is an opportunity to celebrate textiles and raise
  awareness of their critical role in our lives, our fortunes, and our futures.
  Textiles swaddle us at birth and shroud us in death. They offer us shelter and
  warmth through clothing, furnishings, and building materials; they signal
  allegiances and status. They are flags, uniforms, costumes, sails, band
  t-shirts, sheets, and shoes. They can be studied as an art form or practiced
  as a design craft, and are the basis of one of LA's largest manufacturing
  sectors - the garment industry. Textiles are at the epicenter of a global
  conversation about climate change, racial justice, and social disparities. Our
  challenge is connecting the power and storytelling of textiles across
  industries: fashion, film and tv, art and design, and academia, to the
  economic, social, and civic value of nurturing and sustaining this universal,
  essential object-craft.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Los Angeles is rightly recognized as a leader in global cultural trends and
  boasts a vibrant economy and a bold civic landscape. To celebrate and promote
  awareness of textiles is to support our collective economic, artistic, and
  social health. Textile Month Los Angeles is a multi-location,
  multi-disciplinary event that features artist talks, author talks, research
  presentations, workshops, exhibits, studio tours, and demos in virtual and
  small audience live events. Last year's participating venues and speakers
  included (partial list) Craft Contemporary, Craft in America, Museum of Latin
  American Art, Wende Museum, Studio 203, artists Jovencio de la Paz and Michael
  Olszewski, researcher and poet Teju Adisa-Farrar, and curator from NYC's
  Museum of Art & Design Elissa Auther, also the author of String, Felt, Thread,
  a critical text expanding on textile arts' position in the fine art pantheon.
  We offered 16 artist talks, 4 author talks, more than a dozen exhibits and
  half a dozen workshops. Textile Month 2021 seeks to expand our slate of
  participating artists and institutions; increase the participation of
  commercial partners such as fashion brands, architecture and interior design
  studios; improve our outreach among BIPOC and LGBTQ communities, and add more
  panels that bring together industry, government, and education to explore how
  our community can enliven the study and practice of textile arts.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  We measure traffic to our website, attendance at our events, and anecdotal
  evidence by way of stories shared with us. In September 2019, year one, we had
  2800 website visitors, earned $8100 in revenues, and sold 92 "units." In
  September 2020, year two and hosted virtually, we had 5600 website visitors,
  earned $5,700 in revenue, and sold 456 units. These are not all inclusive
  (many events are hosted off our platform) nor are they apples to apples, as we
  hosted considerably more free events due to the pandemic. But we are showing a
  significant increase in traffic, which tells us we are growing. Our revenues
  are almost entirely turned around as speaking fees, which indicates that we
  are creating an economic platform for artists and speakers. Anecdotally, we
  know that artists have been discovered and commissioned, graduate students
  enrolled, designers hired, partnerships formed, projects launched, and
  opportunities uncovered.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '250'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '5000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Textile Month Los Angeles is an opportunity to host a conversation that
  naturally weaves together commerce, art, and culture, about a subject that is
  familiar to us all yet profound in its reach and depth. TMLA offers a
  creative, accessible platform to celebrate, educate, and enliven our
  communities. It creates a series of public spaces to respond critically to
  timely questions in manufacturing and education, in art and craft; offers
  multiple creative and economic touchpoints; signals that an art practice can
  have a transformative, meaningful role in the community; provokes dialogue
  that addresses textiles' relevance to racial-social-community issues; engages
  artists in making, across socio-economic, racial, geographic landscapes;
  fosters a sense of shared purpose. We have an opportunity to re-imagine the
  collective health and wellbeing of ourselves as individuals, citizens, and
  consumers. Los Angeles will be recognized as a leader in the re-emergence of
  re-imagined textile future.
