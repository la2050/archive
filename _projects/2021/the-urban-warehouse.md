title: The Urban Warehouse
project_summary: >-
  Mentoring inner-city youth to value a higher education mindset through our
  after-school program. Utilizing skateboarding as an incentive to meet their
  education goals including an increased proficiency in reading and math and
  increased GPAs. Coming full circle when these same participants return to our
  program as mentors to younger participants and continue to engage in community
  service.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - East LA
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  The program’s primary goal is to reduce the inequality in education in the
  historically disadvantaged community of East LA. School funding has
  consistently fallen behind the LAUSD average & as community advocates, we feel
  compelled to help create & develop the resources our students lack. Providing
  our participants with both group & one-on-one tutoring has proven to be a
  catalyst in helping each participant increase their reading & math proficiency
  &, as a result, an increase of their overall GPA. Our program focuses on
  engaging high risk youth in the community including foster youth. The need
  became especially acute during the on-line learning environment. Prior to the
  switch, our youth consistently increased their grade point averages. However,
  with the switch to an on-line learning environment, many had none or limited
  access to wi-fi & were unable to keep pace with their courses. For those that
  had wi-fi, we found they lacked the structure that our learning model
  provided.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Our existing program provides a structured learning model that includes both
  group and one-on-one tutoring. Most importantly, a group that supports and
  encourages our youth to believe that they can achieve more. While most past
  participants have come back to mentor the others, they are unable to stay on
  as volunteers. As adult members of their households, they are expected to
  contribute to the family's living expenses and are forced to take on paying
  jobs. This grant would help our program provide these tutors with a living
  wage so that they can continue to work with us. Our current student to tutor
  ratio is 10 to 1. With additional tutors, we can reduce the ratio and focus on
  more one-on-one tutoring, where we see the most improvement. Our need became
  more critical in the current on-line learning environment for two reasons.
  First, it is more challenging to engage participants when they are in a group
  setting online. Secondly, many of our students lacked consistent wi-fi access.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Initial acceptance into the program requires that each participant submit
  their most recent GPA & test scores; both verified by their school counselor.
  Each quarter they are required to submit their grades. Different levels of
  improvement are rewarded via the skateboarding program points system. For
  example, if their GPA increases to a C-average, where previously they were
  failing, they are awarded a certain number of points. They can redeem their
  points for small items (i.e., t-shirt or hat) or they can accumulate a larger
  number of points to redeem towards larger items like a skateboard deck or fees
  to enter a skateboarding competition. We also reward A-graded individual
  school projects & increased test scores. Our current high school graduation
  rate is approx 79% with the majority of our participants enrolling in
  community colleges, Cal State or UC schools. During the current on-line
  learning environment, we increased initial participation by 200% & have a 100%
  retention rate.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '2000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '10000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Our measure of success is to increase our current high school rate of
  graduation among participants from 79% to 100% with the help of additional
  mentors/tutors. Of those who graduate from our program, we expect to continue
  to have them move into higher education via the community college and CalState
  and UC systems but we are also working to develop our reach into local trade
  and vocation programs. In addition to the educational aspect of our mentoring
  program, we also require that each participant volunteer in the community via
  trash pick up and graffiti removal events and our Food Bank Fridays and daily
  food pantry, which feed an approximate 500+ families. Our program aims to
  generate a generation of education-focused, business-minded and
  community-based young men and women. An "All for One and One for All" mindset.
