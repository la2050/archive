  The RightWay Foundation is dedicated to ending the cycle of trauma that leads

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Within 18 months of leaving foster care, over 40% of foster youth will become
  homeless. Nationally, 50% of the homeless population spent time in foster
  care. 65% of youth leaving foster care need immediate housing upon discharge.
  Within less than 12 months of release, more than 80% of transition-age youth
  who have been incarcerated or justice involved experience homelessness. This
  crisis is exacerbated by the limited availability of transitional housing,
  high cost of living, inflated rental market, and high rate of unemployment. In
  LA County, over 50% of former foster youth will be unemployed by age 24, while
  those employed earn an average of only $7,500 a year. The unemployment rate of
  former foster youth is rooted in unresolved trauma from the foster care
  system, with the rate of PTSD for former foster youth more than twice that
  American war veterans, and structural racism that compounds trauma and
  increases risk of socioeconomic immobility.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  RightWay developed Operation Housing First to combat increased housing
  instability fueled by the COVID-19 pandemic. With Operation Housing First,
  RightWay provides a permanent apartment with rental subsidies for homeless
  former foster and justice-involved youth, along with intensive case
  management, financial capability services, job training and placement, and
  therapy. While living in their safe, dedicated apartment, transition-age youth
  will have access to an array of supportive services: 1) Employment Services
  (job readiness training, trauma-informed workplace mentoring, one-on-one job
  coaching, paid internship/job placement); 2) Mental Health Services
  (one-on-one therapy, emotional support, empowerment and mental well-being
  workshops); 3) Financial Capability (basic finance workshops, credit-building
  services, credit check assistance); 4) Case Management (resource referrals,
  24-hour crisis response); 5) Supportive Services (flex funding to support
  youth needs, including haircuts and essentials, internet connectivity,
  interview and workplace attire, transportation assistance, food assistance);
  and 6) Alumni Events (access to mentors, holiday celebrations, social events
  and outings, concerts). By providing immediate housing in an apartment of
  their own, intensive individualized mental health and employment services,
  basic needs assistance, healthy life skills workshops, and a dedicated
  community, RightWay partners with system-involved youth to build their own
  stability.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Data shows that RightWay’s revolutionary, multidimensional approach is
  transforming outcomes for foster and reentry youth. Last year, 70% of
  participants secured and retained employment/paid-internship. 86% of
  participants have stable housing; 24% are enrolled in college. 90% of
  participants reported an increase in social support and a decrease in social
  isolation; 86% of participants receiving mental health services reported
  progress toward identified treatment goals; 80% experienced a decrease in
  symptoms and behaviors related to their mental health diagnoses. 86% who
  complete our programs return for supportive services. Only 2% have faced
  incarceration since being in our program. RightWay is breaking generational
  cycles of poverty and trauma. Together with our youth, RightWay creates a
  secure community that provides a sense of possibility that enables youth to
  move beyond structural and psychological barriers and prevent retraumatization
  and marginalization in adulthood.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '50'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  The biggest drivers of youth homelessness are the foster care and justice
  systems. In 2020, 4,775 youth experienced homelessness in LA County, a 19%
  increase over previous year. Homeless youth are more likely to be Black or
  Latinx due to systemic racism and trauma. To promote racial equity and stop
  generational poverty, comprehensive service-enriched programming is crucial in
  mitigating barriers to stability. In LA County, homeless youth must seek
  needed services at multiple locations, making it difficult to receive help.
  RightWay provides all supportive services in house, ensuring youth have the
  tools to propel themselves to stability. Our trauma-informed programs address
  the complexity of their needs and provide comprehensive support to overcome
  obstacles to a healthy adulthood. Operation Housing First will serve as a
  model, showing how universal basic income and/or rental assistance combined
  with intensive services transforms lives and possibilities for our most
  vulnerable youth.
