title: Create New Paths for Economic Equality
project_summary: >-
  The mission of Jenesse's Workforce Development Program is to give survivors of
  domestic violence the skills, tools and support they need to achieve
  self-sufficiency, transforming their lives through vocational training,
  entrepreneurship, social enterprise, and employment opportunities that
  recognize honor, and capitalize on their strengths, interests, and aptitudes.
  Jenesse helps survivors plan their future and amass the skills they will need
  for a lifetime of stability because poverty keeps women vulnerable to abuse
  and oppression.

'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Most of Jenesse’s clients live below the federal poverty level and arrive at a
  Jenesse shelter with one or more children—who are the most affected victims of
  domestic violence (DV). Ninety percent of the women in Jenesse's DV programs
  are unemployed upon entrance and 60% have not completed high school. Yet these
  women must raise their children on their own after leaving their batterers.
  They must maintain stable housing in a city where the median home price is
  $650,000 — twice the national cost — and rents are more than 40% higher than
  the national average. Lack of employment and employable skills exacerbates the
  cycle of DV by limiting viable options for self-sufficiency. Furthermore,
  during the pandemic, individuals of color with lower educational attainment,
  are more likely to have been laid off or furloughed as businesses have
  shuttered or to have jobs that are considered higher risk in terms of the
  coronavirus.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Jenesse helps survivors amass the skills they will need for a lifetime of
  stability and assists them with all aspects of the employment process from
  resume development and interview readiness to workplace skills. Workforce
  development (WD) case managers assess clients’ current work history and job
  skills, literacy, English and Math proficiency, and computer skills. Based on
  this assessment, the case manager and participant work together to design
  short and long-term objectives and prioritize service needs. The WD Program
  has four core areas of emphasis. These four areas are offered within an
  overarching framework of life and workforce skills, training, and support: 1)
  Jenesse provides Vocational Training to survivors of DV to prepare them to
  enter the workforce in a variety of positions. Jenesse created an online
  vocational assessment that allows clients to receive expedited employment
  services. 2) Jenesse has provided an Entrepreneurship program to support women
  who have an interest in starting their own business and pursuing
  self-employment. 3) Social Enterprise: Jenesse will underwrite the operating
  expenses for a retail boutique (online and – when possible – a physical
  location) where items created by survivors can be showcased and sold. 4) The
  Employment Readiness program facilitates career exploration and assists in
  employment placement in career sectors that are predicted to experience
  significant growth in the coming years such as education, health, and
  medicine.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  This program has four core areas of emphasis. The following are the success
  metrics we track for each area: • Vocational Training: - Number of clients
  participate in vocational training preparing them for specific careers. -
  Number of clients attend local community college to increase skills. - Number
  of clients obtain required certification and enter the workforce. •
  Entrepreneurship: - Number of clients participate in entrepreneurship courses.
  - Number of clients create business plan. - Number of clients launch their own
  business. • Social Enterprise: Since this area is a new component of this
  program, the focus is not making a profit but rather creating an opportunity
  for Jenesse to join the social enterprise world and a training opportunity for
  the clients. • Employment Readiness: - Number of sessions of courses and
  workshops provided. - Number of clients develop a resume and cover letter. -
  Number of clients secure employment.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '500'

Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Empowering and educating DV survivors on how to live a life free of violence
  not only impacts those victims and their loved ones but can have profound and
  positive reverberations on how communities and economies operate. Research
  estimates the economic cost of intimate partner violence at nearly 3.6
  trillion at a population level. Achieving economic equality for survivors not
  only leaves them less vulnerable to violence from an intimate partner, but the
  financial stability also improves their lives and that of their immediate
  family. This in turn provides a significant overall economic boost for the
  community. Economic equity – defined here, as the way that income and
  opportunities are distributed – and empowerment are also vital to a
  violence-free existence. It must be an integral component to the healing
  process and foremost in our support strategy. Also, this program supports
  minority- and women-owned businesses by offering counseling, start-up funds,
  and other support services.
