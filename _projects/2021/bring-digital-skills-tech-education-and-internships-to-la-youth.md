title: 'Bring Digital Skills, Tech Education and Internships to LA Youth'
project_summary: >-
  In 2019, AOT expanded its footprint to LA with a school-based tech program to
  decrease the economic and racial wealth gap in underestimated communities.
  With LA2050 Challenge support, AOT will further innovate its LA programming
  by: Recruiting and training 200 students in computer science and technology
  Developing partnerships in high need communities: 10 high schools to advance
  their STEM initiatives 10 companies to engage students in internships and/or
  career days Implementing virtual tech programs for 150 students amid COVID-19.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - East LA
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South LA
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Technology education and training is a critical component of a young person’s
  ability to succeed in a 21st century economy. They are the most in-demand
  skills that a young person needs in order to be competitive for jobs – many of
  which have yet to be created. Yet, many young people – particularly Black and
  Latinx low-income youth – are not given the same playing field to engage with
  technology to be competitive in today’s educational and professional
  environments. The reality is that Blacks and Latinxs represent less than 18%
  of the tech industry nationwide. Further, they make up less than 10% of
  degrees conferred in Computer Science and IT annually. They are ultimately
  shut out of opportunities for economic advancement. AOT’s programs are
  structured to ensure that low-income young people of color have the ability to
  economically succeed and secure a future for themselves in spaces of
  innovation – whether they decide to enter the workforce or become technology
  entrepreneurs.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  AOT’s Teacher Professional Development Program (TPD) prepares high school
  teachers to teach AOT’s Web Development curriculum in their own classrooms.
  This year-long curriculum covers the fundamentals of front and back-end web
  development and also embeds sessions on professional development topics that
  include resume building and interviewing etiquette. Teachers participating in
  the TPD Program participate in two, week-long professional development
  training sessions in the fall (August) and spring (January) of each academic
  year. During these sessions, teachers learn the Web Development curriculum
  from AOT Program Managers and build out their own portfolio of
  curriculum-aligned projects that demonstrate mastery of topics including HTML,
  CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript and API’s. By the end of each week-long session,
  participating teachers develop their knowledge of computer science and coding
  and build their capacity to deliver AOT’s Web Development Curriculum to their
  own students in their own classrooms. In addition to these week-long sessions,
  teachers are provided ongoing training, teaching resources, and a network of
  AOT support to ensure successful implementation of the Web Development
  curriculum. Students who complete this program the curriculum gain a technical
  and professional skill set that allows them to tap into the innovation
  economy, gaining the confidence to pursue degrees and careers in technology.
  They also become eligible for paid internships.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  AOT will track programmatic and youth metrics including key performance
  indicators for student success. To monitor these metrics, evaluation data will
  be maintained in AOT’s internal data systems. Staff will track GPAs,
  attendance, assessments, project and internship completion and other
  information that helps AOT make decisions on how to improve the outcomes of
  its programs and students. During the LA2050 grant year, AOT anticipates that
  of the 350 students engaged: 80% will graduate from the program with a
  portfolio of technical projects. 80% will complete an industry standard
  assessment scoring 80 or above. Off the 10 schools engaged: 80% will renew
  their partnership with AOT in the year ahead. 80% will report Agree/Strongly
  Agree to recommending our program to other schools Of the 10 technology
  employers engaged: 80% will renew their partnership for another year. 80% will
  Agree/Strongly Agree to recommending our program to other technology
  companies.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '300'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '460'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  AOT’s approach is intersectional and cross-sectorial, as we believe that in
  order for high quality programming to take place, we need to engage
  stakeholders overseeing STEM education policy in the local community; work
  directly with staff at the schools we aim to serve; and engage the technology
  industry’s resources, knowledge and funding to help train and hire our
  students. Achieving success means AOT will have a broader impact beyond any
  one program year – by fostering systemic change that changes the face of tech
  in LA to increasingly include the presence of low-income youth of color
  receiving high quality computer science/STEM edu
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  In developing our Los Angeles footprint, AOT met with educators to genuinely
  understand the current landscape and scope of technology education – including
  the lack of opportunities for young people of color. The above guidance and
  insight resulted in initial partnerships with Alliance Marine and Innovation
  Technology High School and STEM Prep Schools. These two schools are our
  partner schools. Classes at their schools take place twice weekly for 2.5
  hours each session at each school by trained instructors over nine months.
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?: >-
  Access to the LA2050 community,Hosting virtual events or
  gatherings,Communications support,Capacity-building and training,Strategy
  assistance and implementation,Volunteer recruitment
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.: >-
  Alliance Marine and Innovation Technology High School STEM Prep Schools in Los
  Angeles
Which metrics will you impact?:
  - Enrollment in afterschool programs
  - ' High school graduation rates'
  - ' Proficiency in STEM'
Indicate any additional LA2050 goals your project will impact.:
  - LA is the best place to CREATE
