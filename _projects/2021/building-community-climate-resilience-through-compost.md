title: Building Community Climate Resilience through Compost
project_summary: >-
  LA Compost is working to restore lost connections to the soil and one another.
  We recognize that the root cause of environmental destruction is a
  disassociation with the natural world, and through co-creating spaces for
  local compost access and engagement, we seek to restore individual and
  community connections to the soil that feeds us all. Cooperatively with a
  diverse human network of Angelenos across LA County, we aspire to make LA
  robust in its access to community level composting, climate change and
  ecosystem resilience.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  In the midst of climate-induced changes, LA’s urban-dwelling residents,
  specifically communities most impacted by environmental racism and historic
  disinvestment, are vulnerable to a lack of soil ecosystem protections that
  provide vegetative cooling, carbon mitigation, and local food production.
  Specifically, the chronic erosion, nutrient loss and contamination of our
  soils resulting from industrialization in LA County requires innovative
  solutions that rebuild soil health and equip our communities to establish
  resilient green spaces. Every day, 8-12 million pounds of food waste is taken
  to landfills within LA County. The presence of food waste in our landfills
  creates methane, a greenhouse gas emission 87 times more potent in its
  earth-warming abilities than carbon dioxide. If this food waste were
  transformed into compost and returned to our soils, greenhouse gas emissions
  in LA County could be drastically reduced, while simultaneously building the
  soil ecosystem resilience we need.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Community knowledge is central to effective community engagement and to
  building climate resiliency within our local ecosystems and soils. LA Compost
  incorporates the three principles of Conocer (get to know), Compartir
  (participate/engage), and Co-crear (co-create) for all new compost hub
  locations. These principles come alive through our intention to build a human
  network of local residents, engage individuals around the significance of
  compost, and utilize the community’s contextual and cultural knowledge to
  design relevant compost and ecosystem infrastructures. The activities that LA
  Compost will use to engage our communities around ecosystem resiliency include
  our Contact-Free Drop-Off Locations, Soil Farmer Program, and establishment of
  new compost hubs and infrastructure throughout Los Angeles County.
  Contact-Free Drop-Off Locations: LA Compost seeks to expand its number of food
  scrap drop-off locations at LA-based farmers markets to 3 more communities by
  the end of 2021. Soil Farmer Program: LA Compost seeks to develop 20 new Soil
  Farmer Program locations, helping to bolster the network of LA residents who
  are growing healthy food and building healthy soils. Establish new compost
  hubs: LA Compost seeks to establish 30 additional community compost hubs and 2
  larger-scale, regional hubs across Los Angeles County.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  In 2020, LA Compost utilized its measuring strategies to identify: - 739,050
  total pounds of organics diverted from landfills - 616 new compost co-op and
  community hub members onboarded from socially-distanced trainings - 7 new
  compost drop-off locations established with the potential to serve an
  additional 475 households - 34 community engagement events held in person and
  virtual LA Compost continues to measure its impact through utilizing the
  following measures to collect quantitative and qualitative data: - Number of
  people served through COVID-conscious education & workshop attendance - Number
  of community partners served, including community garden spaces, urban farms,
  public parks and local businesses - Number of pounds of food waste diverted
  from landfill - Number of pounds of locally-generated compost produced and
  provided to community residents and green spaces
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '2000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '6000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Short term, 2 Contact-Free Drop-off locations will provide access to over 1000
  drop-off members, 30 community hubs will provide opportunity for over 700
  households to participate in community composting, education and soil
  enhancement, 2 regional hubs will divert an additional 520,000 pounds of
  organics annually, and 20 Soil Farmer Program locations will engage 200 LA
  residents to strengthen ecosystem resilience efforts in their neighborhoods.
  Additionally, regular distributions of compost, seedlings and trees will be
  provided to communities. Long term, 3 Contact-Free Drop-off locations,
  combined with 30 community hubs and 2 regional hubs will divert an estimated
  500 tons of organics annually from landfills and transformed into compost for
  LA’s landscapes, equating to an environmental impact of 1,140 cars being taken
  off the road. Additionally, countless vegetative cooling and local food
  production investments will be made through our regular compost, seedling and
  tree giveaways.
