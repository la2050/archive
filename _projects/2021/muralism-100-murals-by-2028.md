What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Muralism was founded in 2018 with the knowledge that people with special needs
  can do productive, valued and beautiful work, but their job prospects are
  limited. Adults with autism report poorer social and vocational outcomes than
  any other disability group. They often don’t earn a living wage, have a
  partner, or participate in the community. (Solomon, M. “How to help young
  adults with autism transition to adulthood" 7 Aug. 2018) Muralism addresses
  this lack of inclusion by employing these individuals to paint public art. Our
  artists gain work experience, social skills, confidence and competence. Kevin
  Titcher, has worked for 18-months, ”I enjoy the creativity and I’m learning
  something new every day, not just with art but with tools and new techniques.”
  By involving community volunteers to help paint, our artists engage with a
  range of personalities. Each mural is unique and creates a sense of place and
  belonging. Our initiative aims to propel adults with ASD toward self-reliance.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Muralism provides paid work experience and social interaction to adults on the
  autism spectrum while creating public art. Muralism will paint 100 murals
  across Los Angeles County by the 2028 Summer Olympics. As of April 2021, our
  team and community volunteers finished 17 projects, including 30 individual
  utility box murals across Valley Village. A 100K grant will fund operating
  costs to complete 10 large-scale wall murals. In collaboration with business
  owners, neighborhood councils, and city council staff, Muralism will identify
  public facing walls that will be impactful when painted. Our artists design
  the mural, prep and prime the wall, outline and color code the image in a
  paint-by-number fashion. We recruit volunteers to paint alongside our crew.
  During the COVID pandemic, we transitioned to focus our efforts on small-scale
  utility box murals that allow for social distancing. We provide PPE including
  masks, gloves, aprons and sanitizer. Volunteers are assigned specific time
  slots. Our work readiness classes are offered via Zoom. This has limited the
  in-person social contact that is so vital to our ASD employees. However, we
  have been able to grow the number of participants in our online work readiness
  forum. When business leaders see the work our artists do and volunteers work
  alongside our team, there is a shift in perception that those with special
  needs can contribute in impactful ways to our city. We hope our platform opens
  doors to future employment for our artists.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Muralism has completed 17 projects on our way to a goal of 100 by 2028. Each
  project is distinctive and allows us the ability to engage a range of
  stakeholders in the process. Our artists with special needs have painted
  alongside LAPD officers & cadets, burn survivors, Veterans, business owners,
  neighborhood council representatives, families and the general public at
  community events like NOHO Summer Nights. Typical peers interact and learn
  from our special needs artists while our artists gain confidence. “You learn a
  lot from them too,” says Muralism artist Kevin Titcher, “It’s great when you
  can put your minds together and get something done faster and better.” We
  measure our impact by counting the number of volunteer participants and hours
  worked on each mural. To date, we’ve enlisted 1200 volunteers and logged 3850
  volunteer hours. Additionally, through resume development and interview skills
  training, Muralism has helped three artists secure additional employment in LA
  County.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '15'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '250000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Each mural project is an opportunity to engage underrepresented young adults
  in the LA County workforce. Our initiative aims to increase disability
  inclusion, increase the percentage of LA residents who volunteer, and move the
  needle toward greater participation in neighborhood councils. In the short
  term, Muralism will continue to employ 7 artists with special needs with the
  goal of growing that number to 15 by the end of 2021. In the long-term, we
  anticipate the work readiness skills learned on the job with Muralism will
  propel these individuals to their next job opportunity. Jacob Riess, diagnosed
  with Asperger’s Syndrome, works part time for Muralism while going to school
  to be a 3D animator. “It’s nice to show we give back to the community.” The
  long-term impact of our initiative is lasting public art pieces that add
  beauty, foster neighborhood pride and promote community involvement.
