What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  With a focus on youth ages 11-18 from under-resourced communities, NFTE serves
  many students who live in communities plagued by poverty and related
  hardships, including crime, violence, substance abuse, and family instability.
  Some of our students are homeless or living in foster care, and for those
  students who do go on to college, many will be the first in their families.
  NFTE counters these challenges by providing students with new opportunities
  that give them skills, confidence, and know-how to recognize opportunities,
  develop talents, discover potential, and chart their own course.
  Entrepreneurship changes the way young people see their futures. And when that
  happens, they succeed personally, educationally, and professionally – and
  communities are stronger. Through the lens of entrepreneurship, NFTE brings
  relevancy to core academic subjects alongside business startup skills, helping
  students gain new knowledge, use their creativity and insights to develop
  unique ideas.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  As NFTE students, teachers, and staff continue to cope with an ongoing
  pandemic, deep inequities and a widening wealth gap threaten to divide us even
  more. Our nation faces a long overdue reckoning on systemic racism. NFTE finds
  hope in the fact that many in our country appear ready to face the deep-seated
  inequalities that have persisted for far too long and we are deeply committed
  to doing the work of equity. We are approaching this work through the lens of
  inclusive capitalism and we have seen the promise of this concept realized in
  young NFTE alumni who have achieved their goals of starting a business and
  creating jobs within their communities. By investing in their communities,
  these young entrepreneurs are providing sustainable opportunities that can
  create access to training, technical assistance, and financing. The overall
  impact of such examples of inclusive capitalism will help level the playing
  field across entire communities. NFTE is nurturing the next generation of
  diverse young entrepreneurs and building a world where all young people will
  have equitable access to economic opportunity. We believe diverse
  entrepreneurs can drive innovation and economic growth – and that lifts
  communities. When every young person can reach their full potential, families
  can build generational wealth, communities can thrive, and the country can
  build an economy that is both vibrant and inclusive.
