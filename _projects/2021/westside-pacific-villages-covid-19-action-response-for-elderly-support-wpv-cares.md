  Westside Pacific Villages COVID-19 Action Response for Elderly Support (WPV
  CARES)
project_summary: >-
  This grant will support the continuation and growth of Westside Pacific
  Villages COVID-19 Action Response for Elderly Support (WPV CARES), a program
  that provides services to keep seniors physically, mentally, and emotionally
  healthy during the pandemic. When pandemic precautions are no longer
  necessary, the program will shift towards helping our seniors transition back
  to “normal” life. Whether virtually or perhaps soon in person, this grant will
  help WPV’s 300 volunteers support, engage, and connect with seniors.

What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  WPV strives to keep seniors physically healthy and emotionally well.
  Currently, our programs are focused on helping seniors remain safely at home,
  so as to reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19. Given our members’
  vulnerabilities, including their age, health conditions, and other
  complicating factors, this is critical. We are also cognizant of the toll
  isolation takes: loneliness is a serious health threat. While it has been
  exacerbated by the pandemic, older Americans have been in the midst of a
  loneliness crisis long before this year. Isolated seniors have a 45% greater
  risk of death and other health emergencies, increased stress, and higher rates
  of depression/cognitive decline. According to the APA, loneliness can be as
  damaging as smoking 15 cigarettes a day, an even greater public health hazard
  than obesity! The HRSA states that 43% of older adults regularly feel lonely.
  Though the pandemic will subside, loneliness and a lack of connection will
  remain a concern for our seniors.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  WPV CARES provides seniors with necessary services as well as connection and
  emotional support. The program currently offers: 1. Contactless delivery of
  groceries and other essentials 2. Transportation to and from necessary medical
  appointments 3. P.P.E. and proven educational wellness materials 4. Virtual
  activities 5. Weekly check-in calls through our CAN (Call a Neighbor) program
  6. Individual technology training to guarantee that our virtual events are
  accessible. 7. Weekly delivery of special care packages. To counteract
  loneliness in this challenging time, we’ve created ways to engage and connect
  with our elderly neighbors without risking their health, including telephone
  check-ins, virtual activities, socially-distanced visits, and Friday special
  care package deliveries that seniors look forward to each week. WPV CARES is
  freely available to any senior and is rapidly growing. As the pandemic
  subsides, WPV CARES will evolve, allowing us to continue addressing the
  important needs of our seniors as they change. We currently have prepared a
  program to ensure that all our seniors received the COVID-19 vaccine. We will
  organize appointments and provide transportation to and from a health care
  provider for all our seniors.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  WPV CARES launched in March 2020; the program will continue as we transition
  our seniors back to “normal” life. We currently measure impact as follows:
  -Track services provided, maintaining data on service request types, date
  completed, time spent and as applicable, miles driven. Since the onset of
  COVID-19, our team of 300+ volunteers has provided 8,000 services to 200
  members. Since 2010, we have completed 50,000+ service requests, and 1,500+
  volunteers have served 75,000 hours. -Ensure that seniors (who have requested
  it) receive at least one weekly phone call throughout the pandemic. -Ensure
  that seniors (who have requested it) receive one-on-one, socially distanced
  at-home technology training. -Ensure 95% of ride requests (to necessary
  medical appointments) are filled. -Ensure 95% of contactless grocery delivery
  requests are filled. -Ensure 95% of members receive a weekly care package (not
  all request one). -Ensure over 90% of members receive PPE and educational
  health materials.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '600'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '5000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  WPV envisions a future in which individuals and organizations/groups come
  together to share the mission of assisting the oldest residents in our
  community to age with grace, dignity, and respect. Seniors in Los Angeles will
  not be cast aside to be forgotten, left to sit alone in isolation, or sent off
  to facilities/institutions. Instead, through our many program benefits and the
  skill, talents, time, and generosity of WPV’s staff and many volunteers,
  senior citizens will continue to enjoy the places they call home in the
  neighborhoods they love. In addition to receiving support, older adults will
  find meaning and purpose in the latter stages of their life by giving back to
  WPV and others in ways that suit them. As part of a growing national movement
  of villages, WPV represents the future of aging and how communities will come
  together to ensure the oldest in our community are not overlooked or forgotten
  but continue to receive the respect and attention they deserve.
