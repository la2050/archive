title: 'Mental Health Services for High-Risk Foster, Probation, and Homeless Youth'
project_summary: >-
  For nearly 115 years Optimist has served one of the most vulnerable
  populations in Los Angeles – probation, foster, and homeless youth. These
  high-risk youth have histories of family dysfunction, emotional and mental
  health problems, substance abuse and behavioral issues. Through individual and
  family counseling, therapy, and psychiatric care, Optimist’s Mental Health
  Services work to address the profound effects of trauma, correct problems in
  family/social relationships, and stabilize families to avoid institutional
  placements.

What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  There is a growing understanding of the role of childhood trauma plays in
  mental health. The groundbreaking Adverse Childhood Experiences Study found
  Adverse Childhood Experiences, or “ACEs,” have a profound, lasting impact on a
  child’s developing brain and body. There are ten recognized ACEs which fall
  into three general types: (1) abuse; (2) neglect; and (3) household
  dysfunction. The study found that a person with four or more ACEs is “more
  likely to experience chronic disease and engage in negative health behavior.”
  These individuals are more likely to attempt suicide, use injection drugs, be
  an alcoholic, suffer from depression, smoke and more. The youth served by
  Optimist have four or more ACEs and require specialized care to allow them to
  overcome their trauma. It is imperative to provide meaningful intervention to
  youth impacted by trauma as soon as possible. Guidance from responsible adults
  and developmentally-appropriate programs can change the course of their lives.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Optimist provides the specialized care and unbounded love and understanding
  every Probation and foster child needs. Our services are deeply rooted in
  equity and leveling the playing field so high-risk youth have the best chance
  to succeed. In partnership with the Los Angeles County Department of Mental
  Health, Optimist offer individual and family counseling sessions for our
  residential and foster family-placed children and the community at large
  through outpatient clinics. The goal is to improve self-esteem while assisting
  with adjustment issues and family relations, as well as stabilize families and
  avoid institutional placement of their children. We provide therapy and
  psychiatric care to children and youth. Individual therapy is used to treat
  the effects of trauma, problems in social relationships, and/or family
  problems that affect the client’s emotional well-being. Therapists work with
  clients to address mental health symptoms and impairments within their
  families and primary support systems, communities, and schools. Optimist also
  offers Wraparound services to help avoid out-of-home placement by “wrapping”
  services around each client’s family. These services help families to build on
  existing supportive relationships and develop new ones. A multidisciplinary
  team—Facilitator, Therapist, Child and Family Specialist, and a Parent
  Partner—address complex needs on varied levels of support within multiple
  community and/or treatment settings.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  In a recent client survey, 89% of clients reported report the level of care
  and treatment provided by Optimist was Good, 92% reported meeting their
  treatment goals, and 86% reported the therapist gave valuable information. In
  2020, our outpatient mental health program served 819 youth, with an average
  age of 11. The average length of service was 6 months. At Optimist, our
  biggest accomplishment is the long-term difference we make in the lives of the
  high-risk youth we serve. Through our aftercare program, we find that youth
  emancipating from Optimist are 31.5% more likely than the national average to
  make a successful transition to life in the community during the first year
  following their 18th birthday, meaning they maintain stable employment and/or
  attend college or trade school, abstain from alcohol and/or drugs, and
  maintain positive adult relationships. Of these, nearly 90% maintain that
  success in the second year as well.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '835'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1670'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  A 2017 Los Angeles County Juvenile Probation Outcomes study reported that
  one-third of juvenile probationers are re-arrested within one year of their
  release. Approximately 65% of probation youth had family members who had also
  been arrested/incarcerated. At least one-fifth of youth had some type of
  Department of Children and Family Services contact prior to their arrest. The
  Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention suggests community-based
  interventions, like those offered by Optimist, are much more effective at
  improving long-term outcomes than long-term incarceration. These youth are in
  crucial states of mental and emotional development. Optimist provides
  treatment, prevention, and early interventions that change the trajectory for
  high-risk probation and foster youth in Los Angeles, increasing access to
  mental health services now as well as decreasing the likelihood that these
  youth will develop severe mental illness as adults.
