  - Central LA
  - Westside
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
  - 'Other:: Mid cities'
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  There is a profound lack of gender and racial diversity In the digital and
  technological sectors of the entertainment industry. In almost every tv
  studio, recording studio, or soundstage you’ll find the majority of white men
  working the sound, lighting, and animation boards. We want to address this
  problem here in Los Angeles, the entertainment capital of the world, by
  developing skill sets in high school girls that can provide the foundation for
  careers in sound, design, and music studios. The varied backgrounds of GALA
  girls can provide unique perspectives that will help create unique and novile
  content in the entertainment industry.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  The grant will support a number of programs at GALA. In the music area, we
  would acquire new music production software that would be instrumental in
  establishing a dedicated space for producing new music. This technology would
  help us establish a Recording Club for aspiring musicians and sound engineers.
  The grant would also help us expand our broadcast technology. Specifically, we
  could advance our lighting and graphics/animation capabilities,which would
  allow increased collaboration between students and teachers that promote novel
  initiatives and diverse campus voices. Teachers on campus will have
  opportunities to receive training on new software systems, equipment, and
  specialty curriculum to develop the students’ skills and professionalize their
  own expertise. The grant will provide GALA girls with the experience and
  confidence to secure internships in the entertainment industry as well as
  build and foster community relationships with web developers, art directors,
  architects, game developers, broadcast operations professionals, and sound
  engineers. These relationships between GALA girls and industry professionals
  can provide the opportunity for targeted career days that will expand the
  reach of the programs as more and more students become aware of the myriad of
  career options open to them.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Our broadcasting elective is one of the top three sought after electives at
  GALA. The broadcasting students produce a weekly Good Morning GALA news
  segment that is projected to each classroom and posted to a YouTube Channel.
  The students have expressed interest in designing better graphics and web
  integration. The older girls are ready for more exposure via community
  partnerships or internships at studios. We’re measuring impact by tracking
  views and shares of the YouTube content. Future measurement of success will
  include the number of mentorships, internships, and media integration projects
  undertaken. Ultimately, we will measure jobs in the entertainment industry
  made possible by the foundations created with the LA2050 grant. With the
  support of the LA2050 grant, there can someday be businesses owned and
  operated by the women and minorities who developed their skills in this
  program.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '700'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '5000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  With this grant from LA2050 we intend to change the playing field for young
  women entering the fields of music technology, sound engineering, broadcasting
  tech, graphic arts, and lighting. A successful program will create a pipeline
  of talent, developing young women entering the tech sectors of entertainment.
  By the time these students are high school seniors, they can change the face
  of the traditionally white male entertainment industry. Our vision is to bring
  passionate, qualified people into the networks that are crucial for landing
  STEAM jobs in the entertainment industry. The LA2050 grant will provide GALA
  girls with a shot to become an integral part of the.Los Angeles hub of
  creativity by merging technology, the arts and personal expression.
