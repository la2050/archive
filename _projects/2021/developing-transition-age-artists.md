In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Each year, more than 23,000 young adults exit the American child welfare
  system without family ties or reliable support systems. Foster care alumni are
  diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) at a rate of 21.5%,
  versus 4.5% of the general population. As they transition into adulthood, many
  struggle with a lack of life skills and high rates of unemployment. Over 40%
  will also experience homelessness. Traditional services for these
  transition-age youth (TAY) are severely limited, and those affected often
  suffer in silence due to stigma or a distrust of the system.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Green Pines Media is a for-profit California benefit corporation. The startup
  was established by a child welfare social worker to build trust and supportive
  services for transition age youth. The company accomplishes this by monetizing
  the work of TAY artists and teaching life skills in the context of
  entrepreneurship. This is done in a stigma-free, trauma-informed environment.
  Green Pines Media partners with TAY visual artists to create, sell, and/or
  license products. They also partner with TAY vocalists and musicians to
  license their music for TV, film, video games, and commercials. All artists
  are provided with a modest advance to help them pay for living expenses.
  Artists may also draw additional funds to help with emergency housing and
  other necessities. After recoupment, profits and royalties are split 50/50
  with the artist. Transition Age Artists is a documentary about the origins of
  Green Pines Media and their innovative approach to supporting creatives who
  have "aged-out" of the system. The film is currently in pre-production with
  plans for a crowdfunding campaign to cover the costs of filming. The LA2050
  grant will help us expand the number of TAY artists who are involved in the
  film. This allows more TAY artists to reap the financial benefits of
  merchandising, and the creation of music that will be licensed for the film.
  The grant will also be used to hire a professional film editor who is willing
  to host TAY interns during post-production.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  TAY Artists: Green Pines Media has established trust among a vulnerable
  population that has a tendency to avoid seeking help from traditional social
  service organizations. To date, Green Pines Media has paid over $31,800 to
  (14) TAY artists. During the pandemic, the company also assisted with
  emergency housing and other necessities. FILM The work done in pre-prodction
  has set us up for a successful production period. We have also established a
  clear vision of the story. This has allowed us to engaged an audience of
  interested partners, organizations, and individuals who believe in the social
  impact of Green Pines Media and the film. AUDIENCE The film will allow us to
  reach a wider audience that has little knowledge of the experiences facing
  transition age former foster youth.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '58'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '200000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Short-term: This grant will assist over (30) TAY artists in Los Angeles County
  earn an income using their art and music. It will also give them the ability
  to participate in the creation of a film. If our work is successful, they can
  leverage this experience to launch their own projects, or secure employment in
  other areas. This grant will help Green Pines Media and associated companies
  generate revenue after the devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
  Long-term: This grant will help create intellectual property that will educate
  viewers about the need for innovation within social services. It will also
  inspire others to create social enterprises to address social problems. If our
  work is successful, Los Angeles County will have the first full-service
  creative agency and production company for disconnected youth who have
  emancipated form the child welfare and probation systems. It will also create
  a safety net for former foster and probation youth of all ages.
