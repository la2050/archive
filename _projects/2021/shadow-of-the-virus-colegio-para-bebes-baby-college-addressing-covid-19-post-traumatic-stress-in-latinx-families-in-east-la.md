  Shadow of the Virus: Colegio para Bebes/Baby College Addressing Covid-19 Post
  Traumatic Stress in Latinx Families in East LA
project_summary: >-
  Our community bears disproportionate number of infections, family loss and
  economic hardships. Colegio para Bebes/Baby College offers a free bi-lingual
  mentoring program 'Non-violent Parenting' for families with young children at
  risk for Post Virus Stress Syndrome, targeting immigrant, DACA and the
  low-income families of East LA. The program addresses the emotional impact and
  offers emergency supplies.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - East LA
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  We blame the schools being closed, but we are avoiding the truth that children
  under extreme stress have difficulty with short term learning, exhibit
  hyperactivity behavior that is environmentally induced, regress or remain
  frozen in cognitive development, and lose language and social skills. Families
  are compromised. The Department of Social Services released a warning that the
  possibility of child abuse and domestic violence will increase, as indicated
  in the research based on Gearhart, et.al. 2018. Joblessness, food insecurity,
  housing issues, immigration status, DACA worries, and loss of family members
  to the coronavirus are all stressors unaddressed by the ‘lockdown’. (LA Times
  USC survey reports 75% of families lost income and experience food
  instability). LA County Health state that Boyle Heights had 50% more deaths
  per capita than the city. Post Virus Stress Syndrome (PVSS) is a reality in
  the Latinx community. We have to change our thinking.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Our programs must take a therapeutic model for the whole family to heal the
  damage caused by Covid-19. Underemployment 50%: Because of food insecurity and
  school closures, at this time we offer weekly curbside Covid-safe food boxes,
  emergency diapers, children’s books and Art/Science curriculum bags for
  families with children under 5. Child Abuse: We will reinstate our bilingual
  parent support groups “Parenting without Violence”, and Fatherhood program to
  mitigate possible child abuse and family violence. Currently we hold online
  classes. Loss of Loved Ones and Depression: “Saying Good-bye after Covid-19”
  Dia de Los Muertos/Day of the Dead celebration art exhibit slated. Individual
  families will display Ofrendas (family altars) and publicly recognize those
  lost to the pandemic. In preparation for the exhibit, we will resume our Adult
  Crafts Workshops which prepare traditional art sugar skulls, papeles picado,
  retaldos and family memorabilia for the Ofrendas. Social Isolation: Our team
  is committed to rebuilding our in-person progressive Reggio-Emilia therapeutic
  play-based model program in a Covid-safe environment. Our goal is to increase
  attachment between the parent and child, creating a strong bond that will
  endure through space and time. Research indicates this positive relationship
  ensures school success.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Evaluation Process and Outcomes: The ‘Parenting without Violence’ Program
  served over 200 families per year in East LA providing a safe and positive
  environment where families actively engage in bonding and building trust-based
  relationships. Parents reported (Guidubaldi-Clemshaw Parent Education
  Satisfaction Scale, ACE Stress Assessment, Veteran’s Adm. PTSD) to using more
  effective ways to parent and deal with post-traumatic stress issues.
  Specifically, parents reported their children’s growth (through ASQ survey) in
  the use of academic language, self-regulation, and conflict resolution skills.
  Additionally, we empower parents to advocate for themselves and their children
  when needing access to health, education and special needs intervention
  services. Our goal is 100% post-enrollment in pre-K, TK or Kindergarten, Early
  Intervention or Special Needs Services. After pandemic shutdown, through
  3/20/21, we have delivered over 2,500 art/science bags and over 2,000 food
  boxes.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '825'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '3000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Short term In one year, we hope to mitigate food insecurity, isolation, child
  abuse/family violence and other effects of COVID-19 Post Traumatic Stress in
  our families. Our goal is to develop strong effective attachment between
  children, parents, and teachers, as 100% of our children transition to Head
  Start, TK, or Kindergarten. We know this bond will lead to success in school.
  Long Term Hundreds of families will experience the benefits of Non-violent
  Parenting taught in our workshops. Their children will have a positive
  educational experience and thrive in school and society. Our programs connect
  with these Latinx children who grow into productive, self-actuated healthy
  adults, making LA in 2050 (when these US-born citizen children are in their
  30’s), a better place to live. Getting a great start now, by addressing the
  Covid Post Traumatic Stress, will lead to greater resiliency in families and
  children.
