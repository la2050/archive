title: 'SAFE House: Survivors Are Free of Exclusion'
project_summary: >-
  Voices Beyond Assault seeks to provide a SAFE, healing and uplifting
  enviroment for survivors of any form of sexual violence. Post trauma aid,
  resources and therapy are essential in healing and thriving after sexual
  trauma; a SAFE House of advocates, therapy and tranquility, this will amplify
  the well being of survivors post traumatic needs. Through our three pronged
  approach of education, advocacy and resource delivery, we aim to provide a
  SAFE place for survivors to become the newfound leaders in our world’s fight
  against sexual violence.

'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Sexual violence impacts survivors in all areas of their lives which includes
  their housing. More than 90% of rape and sexual assault victims know their
  attacker, because of this there are many safety concerns and trauma ‘triggers’
  in their daily lives. A SAFE space where advocates, therapists and innovative
  therapy options are readily available is crucial to every survivors healing
  journey. While sexual assault post trauma organizations connect survivors with
  the services they need immediately following a sexual assault, needs related
  to a SAFE enviroment may be unaddressed and this is where our SAFE House is
  valuable. According to the NSVRC, “Safe and affordable housing is a necessary
  foundation to lead a healthy and productive life. Housing and sexual violence
  can have a reciprocal relationship.” Sexual violence has soared radically in
  the current COVID-19 pandemic, and thus, should be of primary concern in
  today’s world. The needs of survivors should be addressed accordingly.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  This would be a novel survivor-centered empowerment project, with the core
  objective of being able to provide emergency trauma relief for survivors in
  the city of Los Angeles. Because of the effects of sexual trauma which have
  neurobiological impacts on the brain and nervous system causing PTSD, drug
  use, anxiety, and even suicide. The need for rehabilitation is required. In
  sum, this would be a home facility located within Los Angeles County where
  survivors could visit for a period of time to receive aid, resources, rest,
  rejuvenate, and heal following an incident(s) of sexual trauma, or moment of
  ‘triggers’ by their surroundings. Specifically, this house would have an array
  of on-site facilities available to our survivors; such as a (1) writing room,
  (2) meditation centre, (3) a quiet room, (5) optional therapy services, (6)
  yoga studio, and (7) temporary residency. Through this project, VBA would be
  able to immediately act and provide survivors of sexual violence with
  advocates, therapists, self care options and a space to heal and more
  importantly be SAFE. This program is unique, as there are an array of survivor
  shelters within the LA district [focused on re-housing and long term
  sheltering] but not focusing on direct healing and rejuvenation that survivors
  so readily need. Our Survivor SAFE House is imagined with the aim of providing
  an immediate life line to any survivor in need of post-trauma aid.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  VBA plans to define and measure the success of the Survivor Safe House project
  through metrics such as: (1) amount of survivors serverd [per annum], (2)
  daily/weekly capacity rates, (3) number of lodging/retreat days offered, (4)
  amount of therapy sessions completed [per annum], (5) amount of victim
  advocates requested on site, (6) amount of referrals offered to survivors [to
  more long-term emergency accommodation]. This information will all be
  collected, stored and published through our annual reports. The true success
  with having our SAFE House is the rehabilitation and lives that will be
  changed within our community and truly changing the face of survival and
  making our city of Los Angeles a healthier and happier place for survivors to
  thrive.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '250'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '2000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  The number of rapes reported in Los Angeles, CA was 62.73 per 100,000
  population, a 2.38% increase from 2017. This is staggering. Some of the
  immediate and life long effects of sexual trauma are: self harm, substance
  abuse, panic attacks, PTSD, sleeping disorders, and suicide. By creating a
  SAFE atmosphere for survivors that is secure, efficient in support systems,
  therapists, advocates, post traumatic resources and assistance needed for
  rehabilitation will alleviate the many issues that do not allow survivors to
  live their best lives in society. VBA’s SAFE House will assist in survivors
  being productive citizens within our Los Angeles community. Our SAFE House
  will create a SAFE and healthy community of surviviors of sexual violence.
  With better immediate post-trauma services and a SAFE environment, survivors
  in Los Angeles can better serve the community and other survivors within Los
  Angeles County. There will be a new face of survival and a healing paradigm
  created!
