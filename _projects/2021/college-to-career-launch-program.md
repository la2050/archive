  HOLA seeks to address educational and career inequity by providing access to
  those in our community with the least educational resources. Through this
  project, HOLA serves college-enrolled alumni who came through its rigorous
  after-school programs, beginning as early as 1st grade. More than 96% of
  HOLA’s families live below the poverty line (defined by free/reduced lunch),
  now reaching 100% due to COVID-19 and subsequent job loss; all are impacted by
  educational inequity. HOLA serves a majority Latino community in LA’s Rampart
  District with one of the lowest rates of educational attainment in the nation
  (48% holding a high school diploma, 14% a Bachelor's degree). The majority of
  HOLA’s youth are first-generation college students. HOLA has seen significant
  outcomes in its college access work, yet many graduates struggle to land
  career jobs or advance to leadership due to real barriers including lack of
  social capital, experiences of imposter syndrome and family financial
  hardship.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  HOLA is poised to grow our work to improve outcomes for college graduates in
  attaining career-aligned jobs, a boost needed now more than ever due to the
  impact of COVID-19 on the economic landscape for college graduates entering
  the workforce. Following Safer at Home protocols, HOLA’s comprehensive
  programming is delivered through digital platforms with plans for in-person
  opportunities as soon as it is safe to do so. HOLA’s College to Career Launch
  builds on our successful college access model and includes the following:
  Career Readiness Fellowship: 3-day intensive bootcamp providing an immediate
  professional opportunity for recent graduates to include a stipend, resume
  building, goal setting, job search strategies and one-on-one mentorship.
  Career Readiness Workshop Series: 3-part series for college-enrolled HOLA
  alumni to include professional speakers, career development and leadership
  workshops, networking and wellness services. Mentor Matching with Industry
  Professionals: HOLA will recruit established professionals from our vast
  network in a wide array of industries to provide field-specific guidance to
  recent HOLA graduates seeking entry level roles. HOLA will invest in the
  hiring of its first-ever Career Coach who will work one-on-one with HOLA
  students graduating from and post-graduate alumni to support their workforce
  journeys, with an emphasis on nurturing social capital and pathways aligned
  with professional interests and educational background.

  Founded in 1989, HOLA serves more than 2,100 youth each year through
  transformational programs (academics, music and youth orchestra, visual arts,

  school students perform at or above grade level and more than 95% of our high
  school seniors graduate and go on to college. All programs are completely free
  and offered to youth who wouldn't otherwise have access to quality
  after-school activities, college access programs and college scholarships.
  Since 2009, HOLA has seen 642 seniors complete its senior programming, 99% of
  whom graduated from high school and 98% matriculated to college. Through its
  formal Scholarship Program, HOLA has awarded more than $4.7 million to HOLA
  youth since 2009, helping to further eliminate barriers to their education. In
  recent years, HOLA has seen its 5- and 6-year bachelor completion rate
  steadily increase, this year reaching a record 87%.

  College to Career Launch will result in more college graduates finding
  in-roads to career-aligned jobs, bringing well-educated, yet

  grant, HOLA will achieve: - 75% of college students will show increased
  understanding of career field options and steps to career attainment. - 100%

  vast college access network, including Southern California College Access
  Network, an alliance of 100+ organizations working together to support the
  college and career aspirations of 150,000 students in the region. Through this
