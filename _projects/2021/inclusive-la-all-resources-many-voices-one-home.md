In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  There is a renewed urgency to address social justice issues, diversity,
  equity, and inclusion, and to combat the rising wave of hate acts and
  violence. Many efforts are being launched by many organizations in the public,
  private, & non-profit sector. These efforts range from street art exhibits and
  integrating art healing into educational and mental health programs, to
  efforts to support victims of discrimination and acts of hate, to connecting
  people to culturally competent resources, to expanding training and awareness
  to create inclusive workplaces and communities, and more. While momentum is
  expanding quickly, the reach and adoption of these efforts is limited by it
  having no single place to find and explore them all. The LA 2050 Connect goal
  seeks to build a civically engaged, active, connected LA County. In order to
  accomplish that goal, as a County, we need to demonstrate a real commitment to
  bringing down the barriers to diverse, equitable, and inclusive civic
  participation.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  211 LA will create a virtual, multilingual portal that brings all Diversity,
  Equity, Inclusion, and Social Justice resources in LA County together in one
  home-increasing access to and exposure for existing and new work, creativity,
  and resources, while addressing the needs of people and communities living
  under the legacies of exclusion, discrimination, criminalization, and erasure.
  With Inclusive LA, we will provide all Angelenos a place to: Learn to
  challenge stereotypes and empathize with different human experiences &
  identities by providing educational content from Explore Justice and other
  sources. Heal from traumas and develop wellness practices by collecting
  arts-based and trauma-informed mental health and wellness services and
  activities. Report & Redress discrimination & hate wherever they occur by
  providing multilingual online or phone-based reporting and victim supports.
  Celebrate diversity and social justice wins in our arts, culture, and
  community through a community-based art & culture map & events calendar.
  Spread effective DEI practices & values in workplaces, businesses, & services
  by gathering toolkits, training opportunities, and best practices on creating
  inclusive environments and becoming Upstanders. Connect to culturally and
  identity-appropriate community services & engagement opportunities through
  curated, searchable service directories, live chat support with 211 LA
  Community Resource Specialists, and notifications on events and opportunities.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
