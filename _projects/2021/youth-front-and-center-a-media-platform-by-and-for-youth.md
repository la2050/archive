title: 'Youth, Front and Center: A Media Platform By and For Youth'
project_summary: >-
  Youth, Front and Center will be a youth-led online platform for LA youth and
  young adults who have experienced homelessness, foster care or the criminal
  justice system. Since 2016, FMC has been training young people with such
  experiences in producing journalism, and paying them for their work. This
  platform will be a showcase for youth with similar experiences to connect and
  elevate their voices to a broader audience.

project_video: ''
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Youth-serving systems must be informed by the perspectives of the people most
  impacted by them, especially because they have the most at stake. L.A. County
  is home to more than 18,000 foster youth, thousands of whom “age out” between
  ages 18-21. The 2017 Cal Youth study found almost half of 19-year-old foster
  youth surveyed had experienced homelessness or housing instability. It is
  common for young people exiting foster care to also face other challenges like
  unemployment, unplanned pregnancies and the struggle to find educational and
  career success. Part of the challenge in addressing the negative outcomes and
  disproportionate effects of the juvenile justice system in Los Angeles is the
  lack of information available to the public. Despite pressing need for
  sustained public attention, budget cuts in local media mean the challenges
  faced by Los Angeles’ foster or justice-involved youth receive little
  coverage. FMC fills the gap in information by elevating youth perspectives.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  FMC intends to build a media platform dedicated to amplifying at least 60
  youth voices in Los Angeles and connecting a network of youth leaders and
  stories across the county. Los Angeles is FMC’s headquarters, and the center
  for all our work under our Youth Voice Program. This program, launched in
  2016, hired its first full-time program manager in 2020. Since, the program
  has expanded and published nearly double the number of stories compared to
  2019. This included series on police brutality and racism, COVID-19’s impact
  on education and reflections on LGBTQ+ challenges intersecting with the foster
  care or justice system. This project will build on Youth Voice’s growth by
  linking Los Angeles’ young content producers on an easy-to-use website and
  connected social media channels -- all designed to feature youth-produced
  content in these main areas: -Reflections, personal narratives or essays
  -Opinions and analysis on policy, practice and law -Creative writing such as
  poetry and fiction -Video and audio projects While the basic maintenance of
  the site would be handled by a nonprofit, and would always require a
  professional copy editor, its operation and direction will be governed by a
  board of directors made up entirely of current and former homeless, foster or
  justice-involved youth. We believe that every youth who has been overlooked by
  media and policy should have the chance to tell their story. We hope to build
  a platform that offers them that opportunity.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  The success of this project will be defined in the short term by the
  completion of a basic website to amplify the voices of system-involved youth
  in LA, and in the mid-term by our ability to engage partners and youth to
  produce a steady supply of written, visual or artistic work. Our aim is to
  provide a safe, online space for these young people to share their perspective
  with the world -- and develop lifelong storytelling skills. Ultimately, the
  success of this venture is contingent on sound design and effective
  connections between the site and the people it is built for. We will also
  measure success based on how many regular followers are engaging with the work
  that is produced on this new platform. We intend to conduct an aggressive
  social media campaign to raise awareness around the project, seek other media
  partners willing to feature the work of young contributors and hold public
  events around subjects of importance to LA youth with lived experience in
  these systems.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '60'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '3000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Our ultimate goal is to develop greater awareness and deeper understanding of
  youth justice and child welfare issues in Los Angeles and beyond. The project
  will be shared to our core audience in LA, which consists of people who are
  working directly with young people or are in positions to make decisions that
  can impact youths’ futures. This includes policymakers and their staff, social
  workers, probation officers, nonprofit and philanthropic leaders and foster
  parents. Success will mean leveraging and expanding our existing Youth Voice
  program, empowering youth to develop a complete platform for creative
  expression. This may mean integrated social media pages, photography or places
  to create short filmmaking that can be shared on platforms like TikTok. In the
  end, the voices lifted up through this project will add context to
  conversations on policy and practice in child welfare and youth justice areas
  of work in LA County in a way they haven’t before.
