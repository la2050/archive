title: ENVISIONING A SUSTAINABLE ECONOMY FOR ALL
project_summary: >-
  WORCS: Worker Ownership Resources and Cooperative Services
  (http://www.workercooperatives.org) is working in coalition with Downtown
  Crenshaw Rising (http://downtowncrenshaw.com). WORCS is coordinating an effort
  to develop worker cooperative businesses within the mall and surrounding
  neighborhoods that will be locally and democratically owned and operated. The
  grant will go toward our first development project, a worker cooperative
  bakery, plus a business services hub for a future network of worker
  cooperatives.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - South LA
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  We will reduce income inequality and increase community wealth by creating
  locally, democratically owned and operated businesses that empower more Los
  Angeles residents in the low income neighborhoods. A worker cooperative
  structure recirculate wealth within the community and brings more stability to
  businesses. Members in a cooperative can routinely join or leave the business
  without dissolution. Worker cooperatives are resilient and flexible in
  uncertain economic environments. The democratic structure of a cooperative
  ensures that it serves its members’ needs, putting people before profits. The
  equation used is 1 worker:1 vote:1 share, which means worker-owners control
  the decision-making process and share the wealth. An economy based on worker
  cooperatives helps build a more equitable and stable community. We will be
  developing worker cooperatives in South Central LA where communities of color
  (POC communities) need a greater equity share in the Los Angeles economy.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  We are establishing a worker cooperative business developer by first working
  to develop a worker cooperative bakery as part of the Downtown Crenshaw
  development project. During this initial program, we have engaged the
  assistance and support of the Arizmendi Association of Cooperatives to
  recreate their business model in Los Angeles. WORCS will become a business
  services and development hub for a series of worker cooperative development
  projects starting with this initial project, a cooperative bakery in the
  Crenshaw district. In a worker cooperative, all the workers are owners and
  learn to manage the business democratically. This has proven to increase the
  income of the workers as well as engagement and equity share each worker has
  in the community and the economy. A study by The Democracy Collaborative found
  that worker cooperatives can increase worker incomes by 70 to 80 percent.
  Worker Cooperatives will stabilize our economy because they are more resilient
  and flexible. Studies have found that worker cooperatives have a 29% smaller
  chance of closure after controlling for variables such as industry.
  Communities around the world, such as Mondragon Spain, Emilia-Romagna Italy,
  and Preston England, by adopting the strategy of an economy built on worker
  cooperatives, have proven to recirculate wealth in those communities,
  benefiting all types of local businesses and residents, significantly
  decreasing unemployment, increasing the standard of living.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  One quantitative metric would be the incubation of at least one new
  cooperative business or conversion of existing businesses per year for the
  next decade. These new worker co-ops will support subsequent businesses and be
  supported by existing businesses to build a network of worker-owners. A
  consequent metric would be the increase in average wages, with cooperatives
  providing better and more consistent pay to workers. Additionally, the
  literature shows that cooperatives lower the unemployment rate where they are
  deployed and provide greater job security in times of economic downturn, so we
  anticipate more stable employment for our workers. Success is also measured
  qualitatively in the social equity of a circular economy that empowers members
  of the local community who have democratic control over their economy. This
  recirculating wealth will allow other businesses to benefit from a more
  vibrant economy and the city’s tax base will grow to provide services.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '100'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '10000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Los Angeles will have a stronger more engaged business community that pays
  taxes into the local tax pool because we will increase the number of Los
  Angeles residents that are business owners and increase the equity that Los
  Angeles residents have in our local economy. Worker cooperative businesses
  strengthen our communities through broader democratic ownership and control of
  business and jobs. It builds on local talents, capacities and institutions,
  rebuilding capital to strengthen and create locally, democratically owned
  businesses that are anchored in place.These structures and models are part of
  a growing system that aims at improving the ability of communities and
  individuals to: increase asset ownership; create anchor jobs locally by
  broadening ownership over capital; help achieve key environmental goals
  (including decreasing carbon emissions); expand the provision of public
  services by strengthening the municipal tax base; and ensure local economic
  stability.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  Our coalition partner, Downtown Crenshaw Rising, is currently sponsoring
  community member trainings in workplace democracy with an average attendance
  of 40+ residents with the goal of recruiting the first cohort of worker-owners
  for these worker cooperative business developments. Downtown Crenshaw as a
  part of the Liberty Land Trust will determine a location for the worker
  cooperatives businesses incubated by WORCS. Arizmendi Association of
  Cooperatives has a 30 year successful history of developing worker cooperative
  businesses in the Bay Area including 6 bakeries. Arizmendi is providing
  business development support services for this project. The Arizmendi network
  includes cooperative businesses and a business support hub that we plan to
  recreate this ecosystem in Los Angeles.
