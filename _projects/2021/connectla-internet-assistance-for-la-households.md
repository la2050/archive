title: '.connectLA: Internet Assistance for LA Households'
project_summary: >-
  An internet connection is no longer a luxury; it’s a necessity. One that is
  out of reach for tens of thousands of low-income Angelenos. That is why our
  team of Internet Assistance Advocates works to connect as many households as
  possible to affordable broadband solutions by offering unbiased guidance to
  struggling households as they identify and sign up for low-cost internet
  plans. Through this program, human-I-T empowers low-income households to
  access the limitless vital online resources and opportunities from their own
  homes.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  In some LA neighborhoods, as many as 62% of households lack an internet
  connection according to Census data. While in the past, one could survive by
  using public WiFi at local libraries or fast food restaurants, the COVID-19
  pandemic turned the world upside down and eliminated even those public
  connectivity options. It is becoming the new norm for aspects of everyday life
  to exist predominantly online - managing finances, attending school,
  consulting with a physician using telehealth platforms, and working remotely
  are a few common examples. As a result, in-home broadband has become an even
  greater imperative than ever before. That is why human-I-T is working hard to
  connect as many households as possible to affordable internet connectivity
  solutions, empowering them to access the vital resources and opportunities
  that exist online in the safety and privacy of their own homes.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  human-I-T’s .connectLA program connects low-income households with high-speed,
  low-cost internet options starting at $10-25 per month, roughly 70% less
  costly than the average plan. While Internet Services Providers (ISPs) are
  required to offer low-cost options, most do little to market these offerings.
  Research shows that up to 70% of consumers who qualify for these low-cost
  programs are unaware of their existence. This makes the process of finding an
  affordable internet plan difficult to navigate for households already
  experiencing the stress of financial instability. To combat this, our Programs
  Team conducts rigorous outreach efforts within communities with low internet
  adoption rates. We form relationships with schools, community-based
  organizations, and other nonprofits to identify households that could benefit
  from low-cost broadband options. Through our community partnerships and word
  of mouth, we’re able to expand our internet assistance program and encourage
  people without home internet to contact us for assistance at no cost to them.
  Our team of Internet Assistance Advocates then supports eligible households by
  educating residents on the various plans that are available to them based on
  income level, zip code, and other demographic factors. Our Assistance
  Advocates offer neutral guidance in selecting an internet plan depending on a
  user’s need via text and phone support in English and Spanish.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  We measure impact by the number of households we assist in signing up for
  low-cost internet. Since the program’s inception in 2012, we have assisted
  over 65,700 households. We also regularly send out recipient surveys to gather
  valuable data about the impact that a digital connection has on peoples’
  lives. Some of the impact metrics we gather include: number of recipients that
  unlocked new job opportunities, number of student recipients that saw an
  increase in academic performance, and the number of recipients that began
  managing their finances online. Our team never pressures a household to sign
  up for a plan before they are fully confident in their decision. This builds
  community trust and allows our team to provide compassionate service. It also
  opens access to provide additional support such as digital literacy training
  and low-cost devices. Even if a household does not sign up for an internet
  plan through us, we provide community education and support to vulnerable
  Angelenos.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1666'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '4998'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Successful implementation of our program will end digital disenfranchisement
  for low-income families, helping them break the restraints of generational
  poverty. Our scalable solution to internet connectivity can easily set off a
  long-term ripple effect of accessibility to low-cost broadband options,
  leading to an intergenerational bridging of the digital divide for the over
  800,000 LA County residents currently living without an internet connection.
  By assisting residents to connect, we’re empowering struggling Angelenos to
  tap into the limitless opportunities for upward social mobility that exist
  online. In the long term, our program leads to higher graduation rates, better
  job prospects, and a lower Gini coefficient - i.e. greater economic equality -
  for Los Angeles. human-I-T hopes to play a key role in the LA2050 community as
  we strive to make Los Angeles the best place to learn, connect, and live.
