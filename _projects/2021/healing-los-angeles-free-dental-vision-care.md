title: 'Healing Los Angeles: Free Dental & Vision Care'
project_summary: >-
  Healing California believes that access to quality health care is a basic
  human right. We provide free, quality dental and vision care to uninsured and
  underrepresented Los Angelenos, including veterans and homeless individuals
  and families. In collaboration with health clinics and veteran organizations,
  we deploy our mobile health care van to neighborhoods across LA County that
  have the highest need for our services and provide care to 20 dental patients
  and 25 vision patients per day.

'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Healing California was created by a group of concerned health care
  professionals and community members who recognized the dire need for free,
  quality dental and vision care for uninsured and underserved residents of
  California, where 3.9 million people lack access to basic dental and vision
  care. In LA County, more than 10% of people under age 65 lack health insurance
  of any type. Additionally, LA has the largest population of homeless veterans
  in the country. According to 2019 U.S. Census data, 3,874 veterans were
  homeless in LA. This number is likely higher now due to a myriad of stressors
  caused by the pandemic. Living on the streets makes it extremely difficult for
  a person to access basic preventative health care services. Poor vision and
  oral health severely limits the ability of individuals to thrive in their
  work, home life and communities and often leads to and exacerbates other
  health problems.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Healing California provides low-barrier, comprehensive dental and vision care
  services at no cost to individuals who would otherwise not have access to
  quality care. By partnering with other community and nonprofit organizations
  and a vast network of volunteer licensed health care professionals, we serve
  patients at community health clinics, Veteran Stand Downs and other locations
  throughout LA County. We remove as many barriers as possible to patients
  receiving care. We do not require identification or proof of income or
  citizenship; we limit paperwork to the minimum necessary; we do not charge for
  our services; we provide language interpretation when possible. Above all, we
  treat our patients with dignity and respect. In response to the pandemic, we
  adapted our service model to include a mobile health care van that allows us
  to travel to neighborhoods that have the highest need for our services. We can
  serve up to 20 patients per day with dental care services and 25 patients per
  day with vision care services. Our dental services include cleanings, x-rays,
  fillings, extractions and more. We provide all tools, supplies, equipment and
  PPE that dentists and other dental professionals need to deliver high quality
  services. Our vision services include complete eye exams and on-site
  fabrication and distribution of custom prescription eyeglasses. More complex
  prescriptions are filled at no cost to patients within 7-10 days with the aid
  of a partner optical laboratory.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  We implement qualitative assessments and collect quantitative metrics to
  assess the impact of our services. Qualitative assessments include general
  evaluations to measure program effectiveness in addressing patient needs. We
  also conduct focused follow-up discussions with partner agencies to determine
  the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations, analyze the overall
  success of each event, and determine additional needs and areas for
  improvement. We utilize feedback surveys to determine patient and volunteer
  satisfaction and identify areas for improvement. Quantitative measures to
  assess the impact of services at each clinic and service site include tracking
  the number of patients served, the dollar value of services provided per
  patient and per clinic, and the number of prescription glasses produced. We
  are committed to the highest standard of care and consult the American Dental
  Association and California Optometric Association for industry best practices
  and service rates.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '900'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': ''
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  By working to improve the dental and vision health of low-income, uninsured
  and underrepresented individuals throughout LA County, Healing California is a
  champion for equitable health care coverage and access for all people. We help
  people live life free of infection and pain; we help people see well enough to
  read again; we help people move beyond the misery of a toothache or blurry
  vision so they can meet the opportunities and challenges presented to them as
  individuals and as community members. Our patients are predominantly non-White
  (70%) and low-income (89%). Last year, nearly 41% of our patients identified
  as female. Every single one of our patients has powerful potential to
  contribute to meaningful and positive change in their lives, communities and
  neighborhoods. By providing access to basic health care, we are helping make
  it possible for our patients to seize their important role in making LA the
  best place to learn, create, play, connect and live.
