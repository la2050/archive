  Union Station Homeless Services: Championing the Lived Experience to connect
  with community and advocate for change
project_summary: >-
  Ending homelessness in LA County requires effective community engagement to
  educate people and dispel myths in order to build support for systemic change
  and equitable policy solutions. Union Station’s Lived Expertise Advisory Panel
  (LEAP) amplifies the voices of people who have experienced homelessness in an
  advisory capacity on policy and program planning. With LA2050 funds, we will
  provide training and civic participation opportunities to LEAP members and
  launch a texting campaign to educate and engage others in advocating for
  change.

What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Every day, Union Station sees the impact of widening inequities in income,
  wealth, and opportunity in LA County. Stagnant incomes have combined with the
  dire shortage of affordable housing to produce a devastating homelessness
  crisis. Despite LA County providers housing more individuals than ever before
  in 2019, the lack of affordable housing is outpacing the sector’s capacity,
  resulting in 82,995 individuals falling into homelessness. The pandemic has
  only exacerbated this issue. The inability to meet this growing demand
  highlights the need for broad, structural reform. A key barrier in creating
  the systemic change necessary to address this crisis is a lack of education
  and awareness among the public and policymakers on the experience of
  homelessness and the varied factors perpetuating it. As such, ending
  homelessness in LA County requires changing the narrative around homelessness
  to garner widespread support for more equitable and informed policy solutions.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  With nearly 50 years of direct service experience, Union Station is well
  positioned to lead regionally-focused advocacy efforts to advance the
  structural reform necessary to end homelessness in LA County. In the coming
  year, Union Station will pilot a program designed to empower individuals with
  lived experience of homelessness to serve as advocates for more equitable and
  informed housing, criminal justice, and drug policies. Union Station will
  offer members of our Lived Expertise Advisory Panel (LEAP) advocacy training
  and facilitate opportunities to speak at community events including city
  council meetings. LEAP members, who are individuals who are currently or have
  formerly experienced homelessness, will be paid a stipend for participation in
  monthly LEAP meetings and for speaking events, and will also receive a gift at
  the end of the year, such as furniture or other home goods, as compensation
  for their work. Given the expertise conferred by lived experience, Union
  Station believes LEAP members are uniquely equipped to educate others about
  the causes of and solutions to homelessness. To engage the broader community
  in this work, Union Station will launch a new texting platform to share
  information about advocacy and civic engagement opportunities, local elections
  and ballot initiatives, and community events. We aim to lead one texting
  campaign per month with the goal of changing the narrative around homelessness
  and advancing equitable policies at the local level.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Union Station seeks to measure the effectiveness of the proposed program in
  inspiring and mobilizing more community members to take an active role in
  identifying the systems that have failed people and advocating for equitable
  solutions. Ultimately, we seek to change the narrative around homelessness
  through public education and push for the policies and structural solutions
  necessary to address this crisis. Within the 12-month grant period, we aim to
  produce the following outputs: • Host one LEAP meeting per month for a total
  of 12 meetings; • Train at least five LEAP members on how to lead campaigns on
  the texting platform; • Lead one texting advocacy campaign per month,
  following training and the launch of the platform, for a total of 10 text
  campaigns; • Engage LEAP members in 1-5 speaking events per month for a total
  of 12-60 events; • Send at least 500 initial texts and 250 text responses per
  advocacy campaign for a total of 22,500 texts; and • Engage at least 500
  individuals.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '520'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '5000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Union Station seeks to provide meaningful avenues for all community members to
  engage in the civic process and contribute to the development of a more
  equitable county. We aim to build a base of effective community advocates with
  lived expertise to educate others about the experience of homelessness, dispel
  myths, and work with policymakers to advance solutions at the local level to
  address this growing crisis. Key areas of focus include affordable housing,
  permanent supportive housing, criminal justice, and drug policy reform. By
  engaging with and educating community members on these critical issues, we
  seek to foster greater support among the public for models of service
  provision and polices that are evidence-based and informed by a comprehensive
  understanding of the experience of homelessness. If successful, this advocacy
  work will be a driving force in changing the narrative around homelessness and
  creating the public awareness and support required for broad, structural
  change.
