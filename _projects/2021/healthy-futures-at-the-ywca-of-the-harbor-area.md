title: Healthy Futures at the YWCA of the Harbor Area
project_summary: >-
  YWCA Harbor Area’s Healthy Futures program is a food and earth cycling
  program. Along with providing healthy food to community members, we believe we
  have a responsibility to participate in the recycling of materials and have
  formulated an intervention that addresses food insecurities, access to healthy
  food, and air quality. Our vision includes the expansion of our food
  distribution and composting program and the addition of a community garden and
  nutrition program.

What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Based on the Food Insecurities Factsheet via UCLA, in many California
  communities, the official federal poverty measure does not reflect the true
  level of need. Though the living wage for basic needs varies by California
  county, in all cases that wage exceeds the highest allowable income for public
  nutrition programs such as CalFresh (UCLA Factsheet). In Los Angeles County,
  one in eight children do not have enough access to fresh fruit and vegetables.
  San Pedro and Wilmington communities currently have little to no options for
  weekly food banks in the area and many rely on YWCA Harbor Area for weekly
  food to feed their families. Furthermore, according to the USDA Food Access
  Resource Atlas much of the area we serve is considered low-income, and has low
  access to healthy food, and According to the CalEnviroscreen 3.0 results, San
  Pedro scored in the 97th percentile for factors that make communities most
  affected by many different sources of pollution.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Our Healthy Futures vision is a food and earth recycling concept of rescuing
  food, redistributing, and using scraps for composting, while educating the
  community. Based on community needs, we plan to expand our food distribution
  and composting program, a community garden, and an after-school nutrition
  program. Expand the Food Program: Increasing the reach of food distribution by
  increasing the number of distribution days, creating secondary drop off
  locations, more food diverted from the landfill, and eventually, we hope to
  have a full food bank serving the surrounding communities. Diverting more food
  from the landfill will decrease methane emissions in the Los Angeles area.
  Expand the Composting Program: Expanding the composting program includes
  expanding the composting space, volunteerism associated with the process and
  distribution of compost to the community, and a community garden with an
  educational component for youth in the community. Add a food and agricultural
  after school program: The nutrition education initiative named, “Food Champ
  Jr.” provides socially disadvantaged, school-age children and their families
  with fun and engaging knowledge about food literacy, nutrition, basic healthy
  cooking skills, and how to build sustainable food systems in their local
  areas. The combination of serving healthy food while delivering hands-on
  education nourishes a child’s mental and physical well-being while developing
  lifelong healthy eating habits.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Tracking plan: Pounds of food rescued from landfills and distributed to
  families. # families receiving food packages weekly # families reporting a
  decrease in food insecurity with program support. Pounds of compost managed
  weekly. # youth participating in after-school nutrition program # youth
  reporting increased knowledge of healthy choices. Goals: Healthy Futures will
  increase the number of pounds of food distributed by 100% from baseline at the
  beginning of the grant cycle. Healthy Futures will decrease the number of
  families reporting food insecurities from baseline at the beginning of the
  grant cycle. Healthy Futures will increase composting results by 50% from
  baseline at the beginning of the grant cycle. Healthy Futures will begin
  distributing 50% of all composting materials. Healthy Futures youth will
  report increased knowledge of healthy food choices. Healthy Futures will
  produce a community garden to serve the community and supplement the
  afterschool program.

Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  For over 100 years, YWCA of the Harbor Area, dedicated to eliminating racism
  and empowering women, has provided services and programs to improve the lives
  of people of Los Angeles County. We have provided hope and dignity to hundreds
  of families in need, and in alignment with the LA2050 vision, we are poised to
  contribute to the citizen visions and proposed metrics. Our vision is to
  improve the health of the people of LA through the cycling of food and waste
  through a process of service, reuse, and education. We intend to do this by
  expanding our current food distribution program, composting leftovers, and
  adding an educational component via a community garden and after-school
  program. Over the long term, this intervention will increase access to fresh
  foods, decrease emissions, and increase community knowledge of the benefits of
  healthy foods and sustainability.
