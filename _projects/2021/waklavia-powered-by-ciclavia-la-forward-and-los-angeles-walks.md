In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  The coronavirus pandemic is causing an epidemic of loneliness and social
  isolation, carrying with it, significant health and emotional risks for all
  Angelenos. Two-thirds of adults say they are experiencing social isolation,
  and 66 percent say their anxiety levels have increased during the pandemic.
  Meanwhile, in LA County, the communities hardest hit by COVID-19 have the
  least access to the safe streets and green gathering spaces that are so
  important for our physical and mental wellbeing. Black, brown, and immigrant
  communities have historically been left out of the city planning process and
  are not being served by LA's current street infrastructure, green spaces, and
  transportation systems. As a result, many Angelenos don't feel safe enjoying
  the outdoors in their own communities — increasing feelings of isolation and
  preventing a broad-based recovery from the pandemic.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  WalkLAvia is an engaging week-long experience designed to rebuild Angelenos’
  confidence in communal, outdoor recreation while starting to address the
  pandemic’s social/emotional toll. We’ve planned for an in-person and virtual
  WalkLAvia launch. If large outdoor gatherings are allowed, the Dec. 2021
  CicLAvia will bring thousands of people together to start WalkLAvia Week. By
  combining the data-driven goals of traditional “walk audits” with the joyful
  spirit of CicLAvia community gatherings, WalkLAvia will uplift the voices of
  diverse residents about how they want to live and play in their own
  neighborhoods. Angelenos will be able to provide concrete data and anecdotes
  to influence design and infrastructure projects by joining in. Our simple yet
  playful “How to WalkLAvia Guide” will include a series of fun and easy
  challenges—like selecting a local business to visit or picking a green spot
  for a picnic—along with survey questions to collect observations and
  suggestions related to the walkability, street safety, transit options, and
  open space in their communities. Then, a robust digital outreach campaign will
  be paired with in-person/virtual workshops and group walks to encourage
  participation. The project culminates in "WalkLAvia Next Steps Guide to
  Neighborhood Advocacy," part of LA Forward’s acclaimed LA 101 Guide, and data
  shared with stakeholders at all levels, from our partners at the LA Department
  of Transportation to dozens of Neighborhood Councils across the city.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  WalkLAvia will engage Angelenos in the city’s largest, most joyful, community
  organizing tool. It will build on the success and demonstrated impact of
  CicLAvia events, LA Walks’ community walk audits, and LA Forward’s grassroots
  advocacy. Together we will: *Engage thousands of LA residents in conversations
  and actions around safer streets in a fun yet meaningful way measured by:
  attendance at outreach workshops; social media engagement; and the number of
  community members engaging in the local community planning process. *Survey
  residents to collect measurable data around how they feel about their built
  environment, and ideas for improving safety and joy in local neighborhoods.
  *Share actionable data and insights with decision makers and local
  stakeholders, including community groups working on these issues, to aid their
  efforts in making streets and public spaces more equitable. We’ll leverage our
  deep relationships with local leaders to ensure this data improves urban
  planning.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '50000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '500000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  A just recovery from COVID-19 depends on Angelenos getting back outside and
  engaged in the process to make streets safer and more enjoyable for
  pedestrians, cyclists, and motorists. If WalkLAvia is successful, residents
  will have the tools and confidence to become active participants in their
  built environments. To start, WalkLAvia will get Angelenos outdoors and
  active, immediately relieving some of the social/emotional stresses of
  COVID-19. It will help people of all ages and demographics feel comfortable
  connecting safely together in public spaces again. Long-term, WalkLAvia is
  designed to give residents in LA County—especially those underserved and
  overlooked—a greater voice in neighborhood design, resulting in more
  accessible and inclusive public spaces that promote health, community
  wellbeing, and sustainability. Engaged residents equipped with measurable data
  will give communities what they need to push for meaningful changes that
  improve safety and quality of life for all.
