title: 'Our Town: The Gamification of Civic Engagement'
project_summary: >-
  Our Town is a mobile app that allows schools, organizations, and neighborhood
  groups to report, post, and track community improvement projects, competing
  internally or between groups. Our Town allows members to establish teams and
  for the teams to establish the parameters of their “game,” setting the terms
  of competition, including duration, scoring, and point value. Points are
  scored by reporting community problems and by completing community
  beautification or improvement projects.

project_video: ''
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  The problem is the mindset of "I can't make a difference." The problem is the
  lack of transparency between the "public" and "public services." The problem
  is civic engagement and caring about your community not being cool or fun. The
  problem is the belief that the individual is powerless. The problem is the
  trash and graffiti that we all hate, but which never goes away. The problem is
  all the trauma and pain behind that trash and grafitti.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Our Town was born from a project in another Wildwoods program. While on a
  community walk with 5th-grade students, we use the MyLA311 app and use it to
  help them report graffiti and trash in their neighborhood. As one of the kids
  was about to photograph a discarded refrigerator say, we overheard him say,
  "Wouldn't this be cool if it were a game!" Cue the light-bulb emoji. That
  inspiration led to this proposal. The “game” or competition aspect of Our Town
  is self-defined by each member group. Each group can set up as many “teams” as
  desired. In turn, each team can set up internal teams, and so on. (For
  instance, a member group might be a school, which could have sub-groups of
  grade-levels. Within the grade-level, the different classes are teams.
  Additionally they can establish teams within the class. A team could
  conceivably be one person. Each group will create a competition page where
  they will set the terms of their competition (geographic boundaries,
  finish-date, team-participation rules, etc.), plus they can set the value and
  scoring aspects of their specific competition. For instance, reporting a
  graffiti tag that is ultimately removed is worth 2 points, while planting a
  garden may be 10 points, painting a mural 20, etc. Each participating team
  will have a page that is populated by the status of their filed reports along
  with pictures and blog posts about their community improvement and
  beautification project(s).
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  At the close of the grant period, we will measure success in the following
  ways: Number of app downloads: 25,000 Number of registered teams: 500 Number
  of reported and completed cleaning/greening/beautification projects (over
  previous year): 5,000
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '5000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '25000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Communities will be cleaner. Organizations will be stronger, Individuals will
  feel more empowered and more connected. They will have a greater sense of
  ownership of their neighborhood. They will understand the connection between
  greener neighborhoods and improved quality of life. People will smile more.
  They will say hello when they walk in their neighborhood.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  The Wildwoods Foundation is directing the project, setting the app
  functionality requirements. Ripe Media will bring those ideas to life and
  create an intuitive user interface with a welcoming and engaging visual
  design. The Wildwoods Foundation is responsible for the pilot, the roll-out,
  and the marketing campaign to launch the app.
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?: Access to the LA2050 community
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.: Ripe Media
Which metrics will you impact?:
  - Government responsiveness to residents’ needs
  - ' Neighborhood council participation'
  - ' Volunteerism'
