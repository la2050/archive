'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  There is a shortage of, and/or highly unequal, arts and real art world
  education in low income areas of Los Angeles. This needs to be addressed early
  and often, especially in the age range of 12-24, as these are years in which
  arts can play a huge role in the direction of a person's life. There are some
  organizations that help with this on a daily basis, and yet there needs to be
  much more added to their ranks, in specific organizations such as ourselves
  who have the position within the art world to not only teach them how to be
  creative and eventually exhibit the best of their work, but most importantly
  nurture careers in the art world as artists and in arts administration,
  education, documentation, conservation, support staff, infrastructure, and the
  myriad supporting businesses.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  We mentor at-risk and disenfranchised youth and young adults to provide them
  with the confidence, skills, and expertise they will need to succeed in a
  career in the arts. Through study, training and education, students will learn
  how they can be a vital part of the art world we serve. During Covid, many of
  what used to be in-person mentoring will often need to be online, and we can
  readily serve that as well. The Venice Institute of Contemporary Art presents
  exhibitions both physically and online, publishes articles and books, creates
  documentaries, and does online zoomcasts originating locally and across the
  globe to tell stories of the creative people that live here and abroad. We
  will mentor and instruct these youth and young adults in real world projects
  in skills such as arts administration, education, documentation, conservation,
  support staff, and infrastructure that they can use to succeed in the art
  world, and any other world they choose to live in thereafter.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  We have worked with the Felix Organization and the LA Unified School District
  to identify and mentor youth in the arts, and are keeping in touch with them
  to see progress in our efforts. In their regular reports, they have identified
  and implemented demonstrably successful programs and we emulate and expand
  upon. Most importantly we plan to keep in touch with our mentees and
  supporters to document evidence of the sustained success of the people we
  serve.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '100'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1500'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  If our work is successful, we will provide the art world with a much needed
  infusion of people previously marginalized, formerly at risk youth, and people
  of color that the art world needs. For us to be a truly diverse community we
  must embrace and empower everyone who has the goal to speak freely, especially
  our young people. We must provide the environment to help people tell the
  stories that matter to them, and to us.
