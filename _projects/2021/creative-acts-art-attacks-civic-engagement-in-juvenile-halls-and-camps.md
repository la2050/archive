title: 'Creative Acts - Art Attacks! : Civic Engagement in Juvenile Halls and Camps'
project_summary: >-
  Our Art Attacks! Program is designed to civically engage incarcerated youth
  through play. Using visual art, music, and theatre games, participants learn
  the value of their voice and their vote in local community organizing and
  engagement. They also forge relationships with students from the March For Our
  Lives anti-gun violence organization and those with lived experience of
  incarceration to make real change together in their communities as they return
  from prison. In 2020, 100% of our eligible students voted in the Presidential
  election!

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Often people who are incarcerated have had their access to play cut short by
  violence, trauma and gang involvement. A study from the National Center for
  Biotechnology Information describes how play activates the brain’s reward
  circuitry, which can facilitate attention and action. Through play, young
  people practice social interaction and build skills and interests to draw upon
  in the years to come, while also bringing down the barriers of gang
  affiliation and race that are so prevalent behind bars. This program inspires
  our students to raise their voices in their communities and become leaders in
  movements that create meaningful change, through play. We are firm believers
  that substantive, effective reform can only come from those who are impacted
  by the harms of systemic racism, a punitive justice system, poverty, and
  violence. Our students know what their communities need, and our program shows
  them how their participation and leadership can help achieve it.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Art Attacks! is a civic engagement workshop for incarcerated youth that uses
  the arts and play as a means to teach students about the many paths they can
  take to community involvement and the value of their voices in the local and
  national conversation around political and social justice issues. A typical
  class may include theatre games, slam poetry writing, music, drawn art and
  open discussion centered around such topics as the history of peaceful
  activism, local government, community organizing, etc. Each teaching team
  consists of an artist, a formerly incarcerated teacher, and a youth
  representative from the March For Our Lives anti-gun violence organization.
  The inclusion of peer teachers and people who are formerly incarcerated is
  vital to showing our students how powerful their voices can be. In 2020, we
  brought the program into all 7 LA County camps and halls virtually, due to
  COVID, and 100% of our students voted in the Presidential Election, an
  unprecedented turnout. In addition, we made connections between our students
  and March for Our Lives, so that they could join their local chapters upon
  returning home. At the end of the session we took student-created protest
  signs and poetry to display in the community in order to amplify the voices of
  our youth and change public narratives about who they are.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Each iteration of Art Attacks! has included pre and post anonymous surveys
  which have been created in partnership with a Mental Health Expert who
  specializes in the re-entry of incarcerated individuals. These surveys help us
  understand how the program has affected our students' mindset and ultimately
  their potential re-entry success. The results have been astonishing. Our
  students have gone from answers like "How does my vote as a young, black,
  incarcerated woman matter as much as a white person's?", to answers like "We
  have community. We built something in this short time...my peers, my brothers,
  we're all in this together." Additionally we have been able to measure voter
  turnout amongst our students, which reached 100% in 2020. In future programs
  we will keep track of students who contact us or one of our partner
  organizations to join in engaging in their communities, as well as interview
  staff at the camps and halls about the impact on the students while they are
  inside.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '650'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '2000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Our vision of Los Angeles County is one where the voices of those most
  impacted by systemic racism, the legal system, poverty, and gun violence are
  amplified and centered in the community dialogue and the passage of
  legislation that so deeply affects their lives. As witnessed in the 2020
  election, the involvement of youth from the most underestimated communities in
  this country can completely transform the outcomes. The recent passage of
  Measure J in LA County is a good example of legislation actuated including
  voices of our systems-impacted youth. Art Attacks! is not only about
  education, but also empowerment. Often our youth have been confronted with low
  expectations, through play and access to the Arts, our program presents them
  with an alternative view of themselves which they rise to. We envision a Los
  Angeles County where they are involved in meaningful change that ultimately
  creates a safer, more equitable, inclusive, playful community for us all.
