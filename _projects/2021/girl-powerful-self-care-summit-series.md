What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  During the pandemic, Gen Z was the labeled the generation trapped in their
  bedrooms. GP knows that female youth's mental health is an issue. First
  pandemic related studies reported that 7 out of 10 teens are struggling with
  their mental health in some way, with 43% of teens feeling depressed, over 50%
  having anxiety and 20% reported having suicidal thoughts. (Statistic Site:
  National 4-H Council) This isn't news to us, as we work with youth / foster
  youth every week and they use Girl Powerful as a safe space to talk about
  their emotions with GP counselors and their peers. We hear straight from their
  mouths that they feel lonely, isolated, suffocated and anxious about their
  futures. Youth are missing out on their social support systems and feeling of
  belonging, they are being unable to celebrate milestones, family life and
  abuse has been magnified and over 2 million youth went missing from school due
  to inequities in our communities.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  We are all living day-to-day right now and Girl Powerful teaches youth that
  they have the power to be in control of their mental health. Girl Powerful
  strongly believes that movement and self-care is the biggest mental health
  tool to manage stress, allow emotions to come and go and feel emotionally
  supported. Girl Powerful Summits empower tween and teen girls to take care of
  themselves by teaching Girl Powerful Journal self-reflective journal exercises
  and discussions, positive self-talk, movement, meditation, writing, cooking,
  etc. lessons, giving the girls tools to carry with them throughout their
  entire lives. Not only will girls learn how to take care of their bodies, but
  they will know how to take care of their minds, by learning SEL tools that
  help process emotions, build self-esteem, communicate with others, make
  healthy decisions and practice self-love. A Girl Powerful parent who received
  a scholarship in February 2021 said, "My daughter Alex really enjoyed the Girl
  Powerful Summit because they gave her a lot of tools to help her stay
  positive. They showed her how to self love, how to remind herself every
  morning that she’s enough, how to use “I am” statements and how fitness is not
  just good for your body but it keeps you grounded and centered. I appreciate
  what you do. It’s amazing. Thank you" - Evelin Rojas Girl Powerful also works
  with foster youth through DCFS and ChildHelp, giving ALL girls the opportunity
  to feel seen, valued and heard.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Girl Powerful measures the impact of the Girl Powerful Self-Care Summit by
  multiple factors. The impact of this project will go as follows: - Project
  Management: Keeping the project on track to ensure that as many tween and teen
  girls are in attendance to benefit from the series. This includes reaching out
  to schools, community centers, DCFS, ChildHelp, and community partners such as
  Athleta Girl and the Girl Scouts to raise awareness of events. - Participant
  Questionnaire: Each participant will fill out a post event questionnaire
  relating to their self-esteem and participation in Girl Powerful activities. -
  Quality: The end of a project phase is a good time for a quality review,
  tracking participant attendance, growth, testimonials from participants and
  parents. - Feedback: Collect reports from social workers and counselors who
  work directly with the foster youth who are in attendance. Girl Powerful also
  collects feedback from Girl Powerful mentors.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1218'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '3600'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  LA County will be different by giving tween and teen girls access to Girl
  Powerful's virtual self-care summits because it will teach Gen Z that they
  have the power to change their mood, mindset and outcome by being in charge of
  their own health. Girls are able to safely register that it feels good to
  acknowledge their feelings instead of turning to drugs, alcohol, emotional
  eating or self-harm. Girl Powerful is also a resource for parents, educators
  and social workers. GP received this email from a parent and now her daughter
  is heavily involved and benefitting from the program. "My 16 year old daughter
  is currently going through depression and suffering from anxiety. Through all
  these years, she has struggled but now during the pandemic things have become
  more difficult. She lost interest in school and she was not able to pass all
  her classes. She doesn't motivation, cannot focus and feels overwhelmed. I
  honestly do not know how to help my daughter anymore." Girl Powerful helped.
