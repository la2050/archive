title: 'Building Pride: Creating an LGBTQ home in the SGV'
project_summary: >-
  The LGBTQ+ Center lost its physical space in 2020 due to the Covid-19
  pandemic. Our goal is to create a physical space for the LGBTQ+ community in
  the San Gabriel Valley. This space will allow for socially-distant meetings
  while the pandemic continues, and regular in person meetings when it is over.
  It will also provide resources for those who need emergency services and/or
  healthcare referrals. The space will provide trainings for numerous causes,
  including safe space training, ally-support, family-support, and healthy
  living training.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - San Gabriel Valley
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  The COVID-19 pandemic has made every single person in Greater Los Angeles feel
  less safe in innumerable ways. More so for LGBTQ+ individuals living in unsafe
  homes, unable to genuinely and safely express who they are. Currently, there
  is no physical space for the LGBTQ+ community to gather, especially LGBTQ+
  youth. With over one-sixth of Gen Z identifying as queer and this is likely to
  increase with future generations, the SGV's LGBTQ+ community requires a
  physical safe space, where there is otherwise none. The SGV needs this now
  more than ever given the rise in attacks aimed at people of color and the
  LGBTQ+ community. SGV residents are predominantly those of Latinx (45%) and
  Asian (28%) descent. The SGV LGBTQ+ Center serves a unique population in terms
  of both geography and demographics. We are a unique community and require a
  safe space to meet our unique needs.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Building Pride seeks to provide a physical location for the San Gabriel Valley
  LGBTQ+ community. The location will be a safe space to connect with peers,
  learn from other members of their community, find resources to address both
  mental and physical health issues, and look for support. This grant will help
  us establish a physical location to hold our popular peer social groups, host
  LGBTQ+ specific services such as health screenings, and to serve as an
  emergency haven in the event it is needed. Many LGBTQ youth live in unsafe
  homes due to bigotry. Building Pride will give them a space to be their
  authentic selves without fear. There is a desire to coordinate and strengthen
  the community in the SGV as we are currently working on collaborations with
  SGV Pride, Free Mom Hugs, Planned Parenthood, and the excellent local school
  districts of Arcadia, Alhambra, El Monte, Monterey Park, Rosemead, San Marino,
  San Gabriel, South Pasadena, and Temple City. This is critically important for
  youths who are only open about their sexual orientation at school and to their
  friends. With a physical location, we will also have a safe space to protect
  them from unsafe home lives, be able to talk about preventing suicide, and
  teach parents how to support their children. We would be able to expand on our
  already successful senior groups and establish mentor/mentee programs. Lastly,
  a permanent home tells those who want us to disappear that we are not going
  anywhere.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  We will define success if we establish a physical location by August 2022. Our
  other metrics of success would be to expand our peer support groups in both
  number of groups and attendance. Doubling the overall number of participants
  in peer support groups by August 2022 would be a huge success. We conducted a
  community needs assessment for the SGV LGBTQ Community. We received hundreds
  of responses from the diverse population of LGBTQ individuals. Overall, there
  was significant desire for a physical LGBTQ Center. Our metric of success for
  this is whether or not we have that physical location by August 2022. The
  survey also revealed that the SGV LGBTQ seniors desire a physical location to
  foster connection and a broader sense of community. We have over 60 seniors
  that participate in our virtual programs. This aspect has two metrics for
  success: do we have 120 seniors actively engaging in our programs per month
  and have we successfully launched our intergenerational mentoring program.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '10000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '100000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  With a physical safe space location for the LGBTQ+ Community in the San
  Gabriel Valley, Los Angeles County will continue to be a shining light of
  progress and acceptance. Our physical space will serve the immediate needs of
  the community. This includes physical personal safety, physical and mental
  health needs, and communal fellowship. By creating a space where if someone is
  in a harmful situation, they can get the help they need to extricate
  themselves from that situation. The SGV LGBTQ+ Center has an amazing working
  relationship with Planned Parenthood of the SGV. We plan on expanding this
  relationship to include educational programs at Building Pride location,
  addressing our communities physical and mental health needs. One of our
  strongest programs is our peer-support groups. We plan on continuing our
  current groups and expanding new ones, creating a connected LGBTQ+ Community.
