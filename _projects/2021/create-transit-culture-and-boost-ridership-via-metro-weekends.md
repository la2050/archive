title: Create transit culture and boost ridership via Metro weekends!
project_summary: >-
  While LA spends heavily on transit, our ridership numbers remain low, at a
  shocking 6.8% even before the pandemic. Ridership-boosting projects
  traditionally focus on work commuting. However, we found this strategy to be
  quite ineffective because changing an engrained habit on a busy workday is
  very difficult. But what about on days where people go out of their way to
  seek novelty: weekends? So this project aims to create transit-oriented
  weekends with the aim of familiarizing Angelenos with Metro and thus boost
  ridership over time!

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South LA
  - Westside
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  We aim to address traffic, pollution, C02 emissions, and mobility equity
  stemming from LA’s car-centric transportation system. Traffic: LA leads the
  nation in traffic, 167 hours every year Pollution: LA County is home to “14 of
  the nation’s 25 worst cities for air pollution” negatively impacting the
  health of millions Emissions: Cars & trucks are responsible for 33% of green
  house gases in LA County Equity: Owning a car costs over $9000 per car every
  year putting enormous financial burden on lower income families An option to
  the private car is public transit. Yet LA Metro continues bleeding riders,
  culminating in a ridership collapse from the COVID pandemic, even as LA
  invests billions on new lines. Interviews of Angeleno commuters revealed a
  stunning lack of familiarity with Metro lines and exposed the challenge of
  changing habits during busy workdays. Our goal is to help grow Metro ridership
  by addressing these two problems, to help decrease driving and its associated
  harms.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  We aim to boost transit ridership by habituating Angelenos to Metro via
  transit-oriented weekends. We will kick off this project with a beautiful
  poster-map showcasing the many exciting points of interest found along LA’s
  Metro Rail & BRT network. This piece is designed to mirror the fun and utility
  of illustrated tourist-style maps inviting urban exploration, while serving as
  a weekly visual reminder & word-of-mouth generator as a poster. The poster
  will launch with an IndieGoGo campaign in June 2021, in time for a post-COVID
  LA. We will use this pilot to gather feedback as well as seed social media
  with the next phase of the project: once a month events curating points of
  interest along with local shops, eateries, parks, and bars to create fun
  weekend plans for Angelenos! We will post these monthly events on a dedicated
  site and spread the word via social media, blog, and press coverage as well as
  leverage Have A Go’s growing audience of 5000+ to promote them. We will also
  put ad dollars to work as well as encourage participants to document their
  adventures with a dedicated hashtag to further spread the program. The final
  phase would be creating physical activations along Metro stations. These can
  start off small, with signage at participating locations and scale up to
  entire festival-sized events. The breadth of these activations will depend on
  learnings of the first two phases as well as the size of grants, sponsorships,
  coverage, and additional partnerships earned.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Have A Go is a startup that believes in clear and measurable goals. First, we
  will gauge initial interest in this idea during phase one via our crowdfunding
  goal of $20,000 raised. Second, we will measure the actual use of the poster
  via the number of a dedicated hashtag used after initial delivery of posters
  as purchasers capture their Metro weekends: 100 social media posts (to start)
  Third, we will gauge continued interest in this idea during phase two with
  number of website visits: 8,000 unique views per month (to start) Second, we
  will measure the actual use of the poster via the number of a dedicated
  hashtag used after the website launch as visitors to the site capture their
  Metro weekend experiences: 1000 social media posts (to start) These metrics
  will then be used to sell sponsorships, collect grants, and sell additional
  merchandise to grow the program at each phase.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '7000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '35000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  In the short term, success for Have A Go on Metro would create at least
  several thousand more transit riders, taking thousands of cars off the road.
  But the goal of this program is longer in term: creating a sizable,
  CicLAvia-style program (which has a 100K attendee rate) to help spark a
  weekend transit culture and cultivate mass habituation with transit in LA,
  leading to a shift in Metro ridership. Paired with continued investments Metro
  is making, we could help LA County be a very different place over the next
  decade. LA could start resembling cities that reduce their car dependance:
  healthier, wealthier, more sustainable, more equitable, and more pleasant. And
  shockingly, it doesn’t take that much behavior change to lead to cascading
  positive changes: Two examples: -It only takes a 10-20% decrease in car
  traffic to go from gridlock to flowing traffic. -“Choosing a bike over a car
  just once a day reduces an average citizen’s carbon emissions from transport
  by 67%.”
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  Intersect LA: A Los Angeles based strategy and design studio has been working
  with us on designing the poster for months, an intricate design job with over
  70 separate illustrations.
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?: >-
  Access to the LA2050 community,Communications support,Strategy assistance and
  implementation
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.: Intersect LA
Which metrics will you impact?:
  - Public arts and cultural events
  - ' Travel time to work'
  - ' Public transit ridership'
Indicate any additional LA2050 goals your project will impact.:
  - LA is the best place to PLAY
  - ' LA is the healthiest place to LIVE'
