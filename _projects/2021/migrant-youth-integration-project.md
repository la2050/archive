title: Migrant Youth Integration Project
project_summary: >-
  CARECEN’s Migrant Youth Integration Project empowers recently arrived youth
  through civic, social, and educational engagement. We provide holistic
  workshops that ensure recently arrived youth, ages 14-24, have access to
  essential integration support services, and in turn, become effective
  community leaders. Participants can also access other Parent & Youth Center
  programs, such as College Head Start, Youth Leadership, and English Language
  Learner instruction, developing their leadership skills & increasing
  confidence in their academic pursuits.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South LA
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  According to the U.S. Dept. of Education, the graduation rate for migrant
  youth with Limited English Proficiency (LEP) was only 61% compared to the
  nationwide graduation rate of 81%. This subset of students in the LAUSD school
  system require extensive support from schools and social services to address
  their unique socio-economic barriers. In the last decade alone, we have seen a
  growing trend of migrant youth from the Northern Triangle of Central America
  (Honduras, El Salvador, & Guatemala) seeking asylum at the U.S. southern
  border. The reasons for migration are directly linked to increased levels of
  poverty, gang violence, and political instability. To make matters worse, the
  COVID-19 pandemic, as well as two powerful hurricanes, further devastated the
  region. Consequently, migrant youth are forced to flee and seek refuge in the
  U.S. and adapt to a new life. In order for migrant youth to successfully
  integrate, they require support that centers their needs, language and
  culture.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  CARECEN’s Migrant Youth Integration project will support 20-40 recently
  arrived migrant youth in their civic, social, & economic success in the US. We
  will provide them with holistic support & programs that cover legal, social
  services, advocacy, & educational needs. For the past year, CARECEN has
  collaborated with LAUSD staff, to connect migrant youth, by holding workshops
  with various high schools in the district. The LA2050 grant will strengthen
  our partnership with three schools; Helen Bernstein (East Hollywood), Miguel
  Contreras (Pico-Union), and Santee High School (South Los Angeles), all
  schools with a large migrant youth population. Through this partnership we
  will be able to connect students directly to our network of support services &
  programming. If awarded, the grant will help cover the costs & extended
  services of our team of experienced FTE Case Managers and Organizers
  overseeing the project’s implementation. In addition, it allows us to
  sub-contract mental health workshops at our site. CARECEN staff have developed
  considerable experience in understanding & addressing migrant youth’s various
  needs. Following the first surge of Unaccompanied Children (UAC), we supported
  litigation that established a right to counsel for minors in removal
  proceedings, provided free legal counsel to migrant youth, accompanied many
  UACs on their journey from the southern border to Los Angeles, & connect them
  to critical social services, housing, health, and case management.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  CARECEN collects data to measure the effectiveness of its Migrant Youth
  Integration Project efforts on a regular basis in order to improve the quality
  of the programs & to ensure that outcomes are met. Our coordinators maintain
  accurate & up-to-date records for youth participating in our trainings &
  workshops, community forums, stakeholder delegations, & meetings. We also
  implement registration forms & an evaluation at the end of the training where
  youth can give input on what they learned, and how to improve trainings.
  Through these measures, we will determine the levels of engagement & gauge its
  retention efforts. In addition, our case manager will track all internal &
  external referrals with our Deportation Defense Unit, mental health services,
  Youth Center, Organizing Department & partner organizations to determine the
  efficacy of our programming & services. In addition, our qualitative efforts
  include measuring our participant's emotional baseline & how they've improved
  over time.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '40'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '150000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  CARECEN's Migrant Youth Integration Project is rooted in transformative change
  and a well-informed community that is equipped with the right tools necessary
  for equitable systemic change. Our integration programming is already
  transforming the social landscape of Pico-Union/Westlake into a community of
  knowledge and grassroots power, led by migrant youth who are capable of
  navigating the complex socio-economic barriers that plague newly arrived
  migrants. In a city where monolingual Spanish-speaking Latino immigrants from
  Central America makeup nearly 65% of households, CARECEN envisions a future
  Los Angeles as a place where migrant youth and all other communities live in
  peace and dignity, enjoy economic well-being, social justice and political
  empowerment. We can achieve this vision by ensuring we educate, empower and
  integrate migrant youth into the social fabric of Los Angeles.
