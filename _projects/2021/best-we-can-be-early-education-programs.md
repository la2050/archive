title: Best We Can Be Early Education Programs
project_summary: >-
  PTN’s Best We Can Be Early Education Programs address disparity gaps among
  toddlers at-risk of lower educational success due to moderate to severe
  impairments by helping them reach developmental and academic milestones as
  well as gain independence and social skills in preparation for preschool and
  community-based programs. By enhancing our service delivery to include a
  robust hybrid program model, grant funds will expand PTN’s capacity to deliver
  innovative early education services to the growing number of children in
  crisis in LA County.

  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  First5LA reports 1 in 4 California children under the age of six are at risk
  for developmental, behavioral, or social delays. The American Academy of
  Pediatrics recommends all children be screened for delays at regular
  well-child visits as early intervention has been proven to advance long-term
  academic and economic success. However, research shows fewer than 1 in 3
  children in California receive such screenings. Sadly, the pandemic has only
  exacerbated health, economic, and educational disparities for vulnerable
  populations, and many of the families we exist to serve are delaying health
  related services such as routine well-child visits and early intervention
  services because of concerns about exposure to COVID-19, cost, accessibility
  and access. With the current pandemic quickly becoming an educational crisis
  with devastating long-term implications, it is essential that PTN expand the
  delivery of innovative early education services that lay a foundation for
  life-long learning.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  To address the early development and educational needs of underserved children
  with and at-risk for developmental delays and disabilities, PTN provides
  families throughout LA County access to evidence-based, family-centered
  education and therapeutic services during the most critical time of
  development, birth to age three. With the onset of COVID-19, PTN immediately
  recognized the need to innovate our programming to provide a continuum of care
  to young children isolated at home. This included transitioning the full scope
  of our Best We Can Be early education services to a tele-health platform as
  well as developing an extensive catalog of digitally accessible, free
  resources for families. Developed initially as an interim response to the Stay
  at Home order, PTN has come to fully embrace the use of technology as a
  valuable component of our early intervention programming and is now delivering
  a hybrid early intervention program model. This new model allows us to connect
  prospective clients to therapeutically-enriched early education content even
  before they are enrolled in our programs, and these virtual resources,
  designed by trained therapists and experienced educators, are available to the
  general public, providing support to even more children and families in need.
  PTN will use grant funding to continue this trajectory, providing
  educationally-enriched programming to young children throughout the County
  both digitally and in-person.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  To evaluate efficacy of its Early Education initiatives, PTN utilizes
  developmental, learning and behavioral assessments including the Ages and
  Stages Questionnaires® Third Edition (ASQ-3), Early Start Denver Model (ESDM)
  Curriculum Checklist, and Hawaii Early Learning Profile instrument as well as
  treatment notes and surveys. Baseline data is gathered for all children
  enrolled in PTN’s Early Education programs and measured against
  post-intervention assessments. Progress is tracked by therapist/teacher
  observations throughout the course of treatment. Program data and survey
  results from the most recent fiscal year substantiate the effectiveness of our
  targeted early education services; 90% of Leaps & Bounds clients demonstrated
  developmental improvements in speech, language, physical, cognitive,
  social/emotional and motor skills upon completion of the program, and 90% of
  ESDM clients demonstrated improvements in intellectual ability and behavior
  upon completion of the program.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1083'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '7050'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Through the expansion of our hybrid early intervention program model, PTN is
  increasing our ability to mitigate developmental setbacks as a result of the
  current pandemic and expand the potential for realizing each child’s maximum
  level of self-sufficiency. Our long-term intended impact is to promote school
  readiness by providing at-risk, underserved children with comprehensive early
  education and therapeutic services, whether they be virtual or in-person. We
  expect in the short-term for 90% of our early intervention clients to
  demonstrate improvements in their physical, cognitive, sensory and
  social/emotional capabilities and development. PTN’s vision of success for
  this project is twofold: expand access and increase participation in
  high-quality, early education programs for young children with and at-risk for
  developmental delays; and engage and support parents/caregivers as they act as
  their child’s in-home therapist and educator during this public health crisis
  and beyond.
