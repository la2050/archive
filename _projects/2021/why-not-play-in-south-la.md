title: Why Not? Play in South LA
project_summary: >-
  Why Not? Play in South LA addresses play equity. In South LA, youth do not
  have the same access to sports programs as their more affluent peers. LA
  Promise Fund has partnered with NBA star Russell Westbrook to operate the
  Russell Westbrook Why Not? Academy in South LA, with a shared vision centered
  on the needs of the whole child, striving to support students as athletes,
  activists and academic achievers. LA2050 funding will support the “athletes”
  component of this vision, helping us to build a robust sports program.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Why Not? Play in South LA addresses play equity. In South LA and other
  low-income communities, youth do not have the same access to sports programs
  at school and through year-round clubs as their more affluent peers. Lack of
  access to organized sports is coupled with limited green space and unsafe
  parks. This inequity has been exacerbated by COVID. Across LA County, school
  sports programs have reopened at private schools and public schools in
  wealthier areas but remain unavailable to South LA youth. A 2020 report by the
  LA84 Foundation found that 68% of youth from households with income below 35K
  participate in sports, compared with 93% of youth from $150K+ households and
  that lower income households are four times as likely to be inactive.
  Low-income families cannot afford the costs of year-round club sports, so they
  are reliant on schools for sports activities, but schools such as Russell
  Westbrook Why Not? Academy do not have the resources to support robust sports
  programming.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  LA Promise Fund (LAPF) has partnered with NBA star and Los Angeles native
  Russell Westbrook to operate the Russell Westbrook Why Not? Academy in South
  LA, comprised of a middle and high school. Russell and LAPF share a vision for
  the schools that centers on the needs of the whole child, striving to support
  students as athletes, activists and academic achievers. LA2050 funding will
  support the “athletes” component of this vision, helping us to build a robust
  sports program for both middle and high school students that encompasses girls
  and boys basketball and soccer, girls volleyball, co-ed cheer/dance, and co-ed
  cross country. Starting with Russell’s first love, LA2050 fund will support
  the launch of the basketball program. The Russell Westbrook Why Not? Academy
  is partnering with LA84 Foundation and After School All Stars to create a
  model athletic program, but needs additional funding to bring our vision to
  fruition. There is an abundance of research showing the positive impacts of
  sports on both the physical and mental well-being of youth and sports
  participation vehicle for leadership development. Many of our students at
  Russell Westbrook Why Not? Academy and youth in the broader South LA area have
  experienced trauma. Our sports program will be developed through a
  trauma-informed lens so that youth’s participation has healing potential.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  We will measure success across three key domains: 1) Leadership: Students will
  show growth in leadership, as measured by a pre and post survey 2) Physical
  Fitness: Students will demonstrated increased fitness through improved Body
  Mass Index scores, increased ability to do push-ups and sit-ups, and decreased
  mile run time. 3) Mindfulness: Students will be able to identify times of
  stress/anxiety in their lives and have at least one means of managing or
  preventing stress/anxiety, as measured by a pre and post survey
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '60'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '240'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Although our initial efforts will focus on school-based sports programming,
  our longer-term vision is to create opportunities for youth to be involved in
  year-round club sports, as these opportunities are out of reach for most South
  LA families. We believe that the Russell Westbrook Why Not? Academy is the
  perfect vehicle for spotlighting play equity and creating a replicable model
  for comprehensive sports programming in lower-income communities that embraces
  athletics as a key component of healthy youth development. Having an athlete
  of Russell Westbrook’s caliber supporting South LA youth by partnering with
  LAPF will bring additional visibility to the issue of play equity, raising
  awareness across LA County about this critical gap for low-income youth.
