title: The Engineer Factory
project_summary: >-
  The mission of the Engineer Factory is to strengthen the K-12 STEM education
  pipeline and increase the number of African American, Latinx and female
  students from underserved communities who pursue degrees and careers in
  Engineering and STEM. This is accomplished through: project-based learning ;
  coaching of competition-ready teams; culturally responsive math support;
  professional development for K-6 educators; exposure and linkages to the
  engineering industry; and by awarding scholarships to deserving high school
  seniors.

project_video: ''
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
  - South Bay
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  COVID-19 has revealed that technology and computer science is ubiquitous.
  However, computer literacy is still often confused with computer science.
  While computer literacy refers to word processing and use of the Internet,
  computer science refers to the study of algorithmic processes, hardware and
  software designs, and ways to impact society with technological innovation.
  People with coding skills are not only being hired in the tech industry, but
  in fields like journalism, entertainment, and health care, too. But not
  teaching computer science to minority, immigrant and low-income students keep
  them behind wealthier students who’ve had the opportunity to learn it much
  earlier on. Engineer Factory has worked with Inglewood USD for five years.
  Currently NOT ONE middle or high school in the district offers computer
  science courses. Lack of access to computer science instruction places
  Inglewood students at a disadvantage when competing for employment
  opportunities in the 21st century.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  The Engineer Factory is partnering with Piper to introduce Inglewood and South
  LA students to computer science and hopefully put them on a STEM track. The
  Engineer Factory will conduct an eight-week, 32-hour Piper course for at least
  500 Inglewood middle and high school students to introduce them to computer
  science. The Piper five phase learning experience meets science standards and
  upon completion of the five phases, students will earn micro credentials
  issued by UC San Diego Extension. The five Piper Computer Phases include:
  Phase 1: Build the Piper Computer – Students will explore physical connections
  of computer components, construct a model of a working computer system,
  practice troubleshooting and perseverance skills. Phase 2: Discover
  Electronics – Complete levels in Piper’s custom Raspberry Pi Edition of
  Minecraft to learn about circuits, inputs, outputs, breadboard, wiring,
  buttons, switches, buzzers, and LEDs. Phase 3: Learn to Code – Follow project
  tutorials to code for physical devices in the block-based language, Blockly,
  and learn foundational computer science principles like loops, sequences, and
  events. Phase 4: Extend with Design Thinking –Students are challenged to
  design and create their own solution to a real-world challenge and explore
  making. Phase 5: Deconstruct & Reflect – Disassemble the Piper Computer Kit
  and take inventory to ensure all the parts are in the box for reuse by future
  students.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Engineer Factory will measure the impact of the Piper Computing Program in a
  variety of ways: 1. The Piper Computing System aligns with multiple science
  standards: the California Computer Science Standards and Next Generation
  Science Standards (NGSS); Computer Science Teachers K-12 Computer Science
  Standards;, and California Common Core State Standards. There are “exit
  tickets” built into the system to ensure the lesson was understood and
  learned. 2. We will deem students successful for completing the building of
  the laptop if it functions. Students will also have the capacity to
  troubleshoot and to create their own “hacks”. 3. If students complete the five
  (5) Piper phases and meet the requirements to earn the micro credential from
  UCSD. Engineer Factory strives to have 90% of our students earn this
  credential. 4. Impact is further measured if students continue to participate
  in other Engineer Factory STEM and particularly computer science
  activities/classes.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '550'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '5000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  The pandemic has revealed that computer and innovative uses of technology is
  what has kept the world moving. Computer science is needed in all
  industries—healthcare, education, business, and entertainment. It is
  imperative that students in underserved communities are no longer relegated to
  being consumers of technology, but also producers. We believe that the next
  Zuckerberg or Musk or Katherine Johnson is in a classroom or playground in
  Inglewood or another underserved community. The Engineer Factory Piper
  Computing Program is step one in what we plan to be a comprehensive computer
  science learning path in underserved communities. We will build upon this
  program with additional classes in computer hardware and software. Engineer
  Factory will fill a gap the education system and prepare them to thrive in the
  21st century workforce. When proven successful, our program can be replicated
  to other underserved communities.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  Engineer Factory will provide program oversight and implementation. Piper
  Computers will provide discounted computer kits; train Engineer Factory on
  Piper curriculum and make recommendation of Piper curriculum playlist required
  to meet the UCSD Micro credential; provide technical assistance; and
  facilitate the awarding of the UCSD micro credential. Homeboy Refurbishing
  will train the Engineer Factory staff and provide technical assistance during
  the program. They will also invite some of their students to share their
  experiences and best practices.
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?: >-
  Access to the LA2050 community,Capacity-building and training,Strategy
  assistance and implementation
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.:
  - Piper Computer Systems
  - Todd Ullah
  - Chief Academic Officer Homeboy Electronics Recycling
  - Chris Zwicke
  - Chief Operating Officer
Which metrics will you impact?:
  - Enrollment in afterschool programs
  - ' Proficiency in STEM'
Indicate any additional LA2050 goals your project will impact.: []
