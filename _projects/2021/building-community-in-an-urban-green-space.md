title: Building Community in an Urban Green Space
project_summary: >-
  Building Community in an Urban Greenspace is a program to encourage safe
  community engagement, sustainable healthy living, and increased access to a
  rare neighborhood amenity - an organic community garden, where people can
  gather around the benefits of a green oasis in a densely populated urban area.
  The FCG Steering Committee will plan, organize, and host innovative workshops
  and creative garden events to connect, teach, uplift, and enrich our
  beneficiaries while supporting the environment

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - 'Other:: High Population Density Area'
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  We’ve all heard of the many adverse effects of high population density in our
  urban areas. High population density has been linked to the spread of disease,
  increased crime, and unhealthy living. Population density invariably affects
  many, and that surfaces in high obesity rates, the loss of open spaces, and
  poor quality health. The problem of high population density must be confronted
  effectively to guarantee better management of these problems. Research has
  shown a positive correlation between population density and obesity in middle
  aged and older adults. In 2020, a global study of the virus demonstrated a
  link between the virus’ spread and population density. Often, Population
  density is the culprit of many of the cities’ pain points. How does Building
  Community in an Urban Green Space address these urban problems? Building
  Community will confront population density by bridging the connection between
  increasing open garden hours, program benefits, and program participation.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Increased hours, an available garden workforce, and community support, all
  anchored by a friendly green space, are the primary targets for the grant
  funding. To serve residents of the high density area, this program will start
  by increasing the number of scheduled hours at the garden. The goal will be to
  create a maximum number of garden engagement opportunities during this grant
  program period. During scheduled hours, visitors should have direct access to
  planned enrichment offered through innovative workshops, events, and other
  garden engagement. In addition to making increased scheduled hours possible,
  this grant should also fund the planned enrichment including innovative
  workshops, events, and other garden engagements. The costs associated with
  this project will be controlled under marketing, entertainment,
  transportation, and labor budgets for Extended Hours and Community Engagement.
  This Building Community model is unique in that it will require stakeholders
  to actively engage solutions to population density by growing their community
  garden. Ideally, this project will support stakeholders as they explore the
  best innovative solutions to population density with an emphasis on the
  community garden. In the event of any disruptions, during this programmatic
  journey, and or if there is a failure to lift restrictions, the grant related
  activities will be amended and provided via ZOOM, GOOGLE MEET, TEAMS, OR
  JITSI.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  This program is prepared to look at the impact of increased scheduled garden
  hours and a public engagement program. A significant product of this program
  will be the beneficiaries, stakeholders, and high density residents. During
  this program, stakeholders will be brought into early project planning to
  increase the garden's visibility, and help inspire beneficial community
  engagement around organic gardening. This program has already begun early
  organizing with project stakeholders and a project kick off scheduled to occur
  in June 2021. Subsequent meetings with steering committee members, current
  gardeners, and other stakeholders will further our first steps towards
  successful project planning. Ultimately, iterative measures of stakeholder
  involvement and stakeholder satisfaction will help refine major milestones
  throughout the project planning, and an increased and continuing number of
  satisfied beneficiaries will communicate a secondary milestone of successful
  programming.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1110'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '2220'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  In a post Covid world, Los Angeles County would be able to use more community
  garden areas or natural green spaces. Sadly, converting concrete urban areas
  for gardening is beyond the scope of this application. For a garden
  experiencing population density pressures, the most direct and affordable
  solution to any garden problem, is to do what it does best – grow the organic
  gardening community. That being the short-term goal, and basis for increasing
  scheduled hours, the long-term impact will be derived from the benefits of
  garden enrichment take-aways. At the close of this project our aim will be to
  ensure stakeholders are aware of the benefits of healthy organic gardening in
  an urban area. Throughout project work, we will track membership numbers, and
  community engagement using workshop attendance, surveys, questionnaires, and
  checklists. While managing project specific objectives, the challenge will be
  to complete the full scope of our project within budget and on schedule.
