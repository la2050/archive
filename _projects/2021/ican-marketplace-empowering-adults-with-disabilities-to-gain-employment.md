title: 'ICAN Marketplace: Empowering Adults with Disabilities to Gain Employment'
project_summary: >-
  This grant will allow us to relaunch and expand our Marketplace Initiative
  program. This program is comprised of micro businesses we started like the
  ICAN Photo Booth and Hermosa Coffee Co., a mobile coffee cart business, all of
  which create employment opportunities for adults with Intellectual and
  Developmental Disabilities (IDD). For many of our clients, this is their only
  opportunity of employment, and the work our clients do fills them with an
  invaluable sense of purpose and provides them with a consistent source of
  income.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Westside
  - South Bay
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  The problem our Marketplace Initiative addresses is the unemployment rate for
  adults with IDD, and more specifically, unemployment among clients in our
  Partial Work Community Inclusion Program (PWCIP), a program that meets
  Monday-Friday to help our clients live more independently. This past decade,
  the unemployment rate for adults with IDD in California hasn't gone below 80%,
  and this problem has been exacerbated by COVID-19. Most of the clients who
  work for our Marketplace Initiative businesses are a part of our PWCIP and
  don't have work outside of this program. And due to COVID, the clients in our
  PWCIP have been without work opportunities for a year now. Not only is the
  income they earn through their employment important for them to gain financial
  independence, their jobs fill them with pride and a strong sense of purpose
  and community integration. But because of the dangers posed by COVID, we also
  need to ensure that we create the safest possible work environment for our
  clients.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  We so strongly believe in employing people with Intellectual and Developmental
  Disabilities (IDD) that we decided to create our Marketplace Initiative
  program in 2016 to employ our clients. Today, there are three different
  businesses in this program: The Hermosa Coffee Co., the ICAN Photo Booth, and
  our Etsy shop, which sells artwork and crafts created by our clients. Our goal
  is to provide employment opportunities for our PWCIP clients and to do
  everything in our power to protect them from the pandemic in the process by
  helping them get vaccinated, providing them with masks, and placing plastic
  barriers between them and the customers. This program will help us to shrink
  the unemployment gap that people with IDD face. Not only will we hire clients
  from our PWCIP directly, providing them with a job and an income, but our
  Marketplace Initiative also acts as a springboard to help prepare our clients
  for work outside of our organization. For example, if one of our clients
  cannot find a job at a local coffee shop, we will hire them to work at our own
  mobile coffee business. Once this client has been trained and gained work
  experience, we'll put our client in another one of our programs, the Supported
  Employment Program, which will then work directly with our client through the
  application process to find a relevant job outside of ICAN. Overall, we will
  help adults with IDD in the South Bay, Westside, and Long Beach by employing
  them and training them for future work.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Due to COVID-19, our Marketplace Initiative has been on hiatus since April
  2020. However, now that businesses are reopening and our clients are getting
  vaccinated, we are in the process of relaunching and expanding this program.
  We will measure the success of our Marketplace Initiative in the following
  ways: -The number of employment opportunities we are able to provide our
  clients. -The amount of clients able to get jobs outside of our organization
  through the work experience they received in our program. -Increased donations
  due to working events out in the community, which will allow us to hire more
  clients. -Increased awareness of our program in our communities, leading to
  more work for our clients. Before COVID, we were able to consistently grow our
  Marketplace Initiative by working events throughout our communities, allowing
  us to provide increasingly more job opportunities for our clients. We firmly
  believe this model will continue to work for us as we relaunch this program.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '150'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Our primary goal and marker of success will be if our program helps toward
  lowering the unemployment rate for people with IDD. If we succeed in this,
  which we strongly believe we will and which we had prior to the pandemic,
  we'll expand our organization to more areas in Los Angeles County to help
  people with IDD throughout the County to find and maintain employment. When
  our organization began in 2012, we had one client who we had provided a job
  for from a small space in Hermosa Beach. Now we have employed hundreds of
  clients throughout the South Bay, Westside, and Long Beach with four different
  office spaces and two large buildings in Long Beach and Torrance, which host
  multiple PWCIPs. Finally, we firmly believe that by lowering the unemployment
  rate for adults with IDD and by providing jobs for them throughout Los Angeles
  County, we will help to create a County with less stigmatism against people
  with IDD in the workforce, inspiring more local businesses to hire people with
  IDD.
