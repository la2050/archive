title: Space for high-quality child care for babies!
project_summary: >-
  Build two new classrooms for young children in a childcare desert! Babies who
  experience few high-quality interactions are at risk of having their brain
  development damaged or delayed, with severe consequences for the rest of their
  lives. Long Beach Day Nursery has a 4-phase expansion plan in place to provide
  much needed space and high-quality care for our most vulnerable population. We
  have played an essential role in supporting economic recovery during Covid-19
  by allowing families with children to return to work, help us do even more!

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South Bay
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Babies are born with unlimited potential. However, 87 out of every 100 babies
  who need childcare do not have a licensed place in LA County. These babies are
  our society’s next generation of parents, workers, and leaders. We can’t
  afford to squander the potential of a single child—nor is it acceptable that
  so many have barriers. When babies do not have the support they need to
  thrive, their development suffers which leads to lifelong consequences. Long
  Beach Day Nursery’s West Branch is located in the 90813 zip-code, which is
  considered one of the most impoverished in the city, plagued with high
  poverty, crime and violence. 32% of the population lives in poverty.
  Notwithstanding the challenges, many working families call this area home.
  This includes 3,877 children ages 0-5 with working parents earning below 70%
  of the state median income, of which half are ages 0-3. Despite this high
  number of children, the childcare capacity is bleak with insufficient space
  available.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Founded in 1912, Long Beach Day Nursery (LBDN) is always seeking out new ways
  to improve or expand upon our work on behalf of working families. In response
  to the lack of child care, LBDN is going to significantly expand services to
  our youngest children in the 90813-zip code. Through a 4-phase approach we
  will bring infant care to the West Branch for the first time in our 108-year
  history and also expand access for toddler and preschool aged children.
  Expansion will provide new space for 27 infants, increase Toddler spaces to
  from 12 to 40 and our Preschool to from 57 to 64 for a nearly doubled capacity
  of 131 children! Expansion will include new construction to accommodate 3 new
  classrooms, early intervention, and training space for families all on our
  current campus. It is critical to note that the 4-phase approach allows us to
  continue to provide our much-needed services for free or at low cost, while
  undertaking this effort. All enrolled children receive LBDN’s high quality
  early care and education which nurtures their social, emotional, physical,
  linguistic and intellectual development. We partner with families, provide
  individualized attention, offer a free on-site early intervention program,
  healthy, balanced breakfast, lunch and snacks daily and early literacy, art,
  music, social emotional and STEM curriculum. Specifically, this LA 2050 2021
  opportunity will support Expansion Phase 2 through the construction of 2 new
  classrooms.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  LBDN measures expansion success by completing each phase and expanding
  enrollment for young children. The already completed Phase 1 has allowed us to
  serve 12 newly enrolled toddlers. LBDN’s ultimate desired impact is that
  students succeed in school, lead healthy lives and become productive members
  of society. Our main goal is that all students receive quality early care and
  education and graduate LBDN kindergarten-ready. LBDN's overall program quality
  is measured through numerous annual assessments which include: a
  self-evaluation with the California Department of Education (CDE) followed
  with an onsite review, classroom environmental assessments, and parent and
  staff surveys. Both our West and East Branches are Nationally Accredited
  through the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC)
  which requires intense ongoing self-evaluation, the highest industry
  standards, and an on-site evaluation and observation from a trained NAEYC
  program assessor.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '300'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '30000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  This initiative will expand quality programming and the number of children we
  serve. Upon completion we will have doubled our capacity! When children
  graduate from LBDN we are confident the high-quality early education received
  within our program has prepared them for success in kindergarten and beyond.
  For the family, quality childcare provides stability that allows for economic
  success and growth of working parents. When paired with a comprehensive family
  engagement approach quality care also increases parenting skills and
  knowledge. High-quality childcare programs like LBDN are proven to raise
  academic performance and give children the skills and tools to be successful
  and contribute to society. Programs like LBDN’s have been proven to lead to
  lower crime rates, youth who are significantly more likely to graduate from
  high school and are 2.5 times more likely to continue on to higher education.
  Unemployment rates, income inequality, prevalence of trauma, and homelessness
  decreases.
