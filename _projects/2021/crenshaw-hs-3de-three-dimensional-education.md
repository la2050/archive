title: Crenshaw HS 3DE – Three Dimensional Education
project_summary: >-
  LAUSD has approved JA SoCal to bring the 3DE curriculum model to Crenshaw
  public high school using real-life case studies that promote problem solving
  tied to CA core curriculum standards. The 3DE model helps students see
  connections between their knowledge, mindset and behaviors, and choices they
  will have in the future, increasing graduation rates. 3DE dramatically
  equalized educational disparities at other schools, showing increase of 4-year
  graduation rates from 62% to 92%, 38% reduction in absenteeism and 72%
  outperformance on state exams.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Data show that high school graduates are more likely to be employed and
  students who go on to graduate college are twice as likely to be employed as
  non-high-school graduates. High concentrations of young adults who did not
  complete high school result in fewer employable young adults, lower average
  incomes, higher unemployment rates, and deepening economic disparities that
  regularly disproportionally affect black and brown communities. Crenshaw HS
  dropout rates range from 15% to 17% recently, compared to LA averages of 9% to
  11%. These high rates enable existing cycles of economic disparity and unequal
  opportunity to continue to deepen in the community. Kamarie Brown, a special
  student board member of LAUSD, from Crenshaw HS, posed the question, “Will we
  fully commit to creating schools that function as the keys to unlock a
  student’s limitless potential?” Students need to see school as key to their
  survival and success in the real world to electrify the motivation to make it
  through.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  This grant will support the LAUSD approved launch of the “Three Dimensional
  Education”, or “3DE” school model for incoming freshman at Crenshaw High
  School in the 21-22 school year. 3DE builds curriculum around real-world
  case-studies and practical problem solving, drastically improving students’
  perceptions of the relevance of school and the importance of completing a high
  school degree. In a 3DE school, there are three national case study and three
  localized case study approaches to learning introduced into academic courses,
  while still maintaining CA core curriculum standards. Students progress
  through interdisciplinary critical thinking related to the real-life actual
  case study dilemmas that partner companies described to 3DE curriculum
  developers. Students’ natural, instinctive motivation to want to learn despite
  challenges and pressures is re-awakened. More students stay in school and
  experience increased opportunity of choices and equality as young adults. This
  grant will help fund the placement of two 3DE staff embedded at Crenshaw HS to
  train and support the regular public school administration and teachers in 3DE
  programming. It also funds the work of JA SoCal to secure community
  partnerships to provide local, inspirational and rigorous case study stories
  for the curriculum. 23 schools around the country have launched 3DE
  curriculum. Surveys show greater student interest in learning, including
  improvement of graduation rates at some schools from 62% to 92%.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  This is a pilot effort to apply this educational model to the Los Angeles
  area, learning from the successful launches of 3DE in 23 public schools
  located in Atlanta, Tampa Bay, Washington D.C. and Houston. The program has
  been proven successful in participating schools thus far, showing 71%
  outperformance in state end-of-course assessments, 92% student retention rate
  and 42% reduction in chronic absenteeism, and 94% four-year graduation rates.
  Written evaluations by students reveal that 98% of students from previously
  high drop-out rate schools now feel excited about their futures. At this
  implementation at Crenshaw HS, student attendance will be monitored and
  compared to prior years. As the 21-22 incoming freshmen matriculate through
  the grade levels to the senior year, cohort 4-year graduation rates will be
  assessed. Students will be offered ongoing surveys to help assess students’
  experiences of 3DE and understand the benefits they describe.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '45'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '118'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  3DE educational models have significantly improved disparities in educational
  outcomes in other major urban communities. We believe 3DE will achieve similar
  success at Crenshaw HS and later at additional LA schools brought into the
  model. 3DE data repeatedly show increases in attendance and decreases in
  dropout rates. Measures of success for the 1-year grant will include increases
  in freshman attendance rates, as compared to other recent freshman classes,
  and student surveys showing high rates of student motivation, interest, and
  intent to stay in school, regardless of socioeconomic background. The program
  will expand one grade per year. In its fourth year, the full student body will
  be 3DE, and success will be defined by improved 4-year graduation rates,
  improved attendance rates, academic performance indicators and positive
  student and parent surveys. Long-term, 3DE will reduce dropout rates and
  equalize opportunities available to LA youth, helping break down entrenched
  inequities.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  Crenshaw High School – Executes the 3DE curriculum for 9th grade in regular
  school operations. Principal, teachers and staff responsible for adopting the
  3DE model based on training and support of 3DE staff. Teachers and staff at
  Crenshaw remain employees of the public school system and part of LAUSD.
  Crenshaw staff are dedicated experts in the needs of the students and families
  they have served for decades. 3DE by JA – the 3DE national partner – The 3DE
  model has been launched in 23 schools in other cities, and staff have the
  practical experience from these pilots. They understand the needs and
  expectations of teachers, students and community families. The embedded staff
  for the site are recruited from a variety of backgrounds and are trained
  extensively by 3DE national staff.
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?: >-
  Access to the LA2050 community,Communications support,Capacity-building and
  training
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.: • 3DE by JA • Crenshaw High School
