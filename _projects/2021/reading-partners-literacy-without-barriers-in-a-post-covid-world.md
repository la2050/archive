title: 'Reading Partners: Literacy Without Barriers in a Post-COVID World'
project_summary: >-
  In Los Angeles public schools, COVID-19 has stalled progress for our most
  vulnerable students. While Reading Partners has pivoted programming to adapt
  to the online environment and provided intensive, individualized literacy
  tutoring and seen incredible results, we know there is more work to be done.
  Through our new virtual programming, Reading Partners plans to extend our
  reach to the countless number of students who need support building
  foundational reading skills after a disrupted learning, reaching 1000
  additional students by 2025.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - San Gabriel Valley
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Students from economically disadvantaged communities are at the highest risk
  of COVID-19 related learning loss. A June 2020 report from McKinsey and
  Company anticipates that most students will have lost an average of 7 months
  of learning due to COVID-19, but Black students may fall behind by 10.3
  months, Latinx students by 9.2 months, and students from low-income households
  by more than a year. While this study is startling, it doesn’t account for the
  additional eight months of virtual learning we’ve experienced in the Great Los
  Angeles Area. Without quality, regular instruction from their teachers,
  adequate educational resources, and our continued support, these students are
  at risk of falling further behind their peers who have access to more
  resources. This disruption in learning will widen existing achievement gaps by
  15 to 20 percent and have lifetime effects on our students’ educational
  opportunities, income, and health.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Reading Partners empowers students to develop mastery of key reading skills
  through data-informed, curriculum-driven, one-on-one tutoring led by trained
  volunteers. Our traditional program works as follows: In each of our partner
  schools, we transform space into a reading center and work with school staff
  to identify 40-80 students for tutoring. We recruit at least 50 volunteer
  tutors per school. Student-tutor pairs work for 45 minutes twice per week,
  using an individualized reading plan based on regular student skill
  assessments. During the 2020-21 school year, our program model looked quite
  different. We introduced to the virtual space Reading Partners Connects,
  bringing our traditional, structured lessons and curriculum to an online
  environment. Using video conferencing and our digital library, tutors provided
  students with a 45-minute tutoring session twice per week, echoing our
  in-person model. Although our program method of program delivery is different,
  our overarching goal remains the same as we pursue educational equity for our
  students and help them achieve measurable literacy growth. With this new,
  virtual program, Reading Partners is eliminating barriers for students who
  need individualized, one-on-one support, giving us the ability to extend our
  reach to any corner of Los Angeles with the power of technology. Using this
  new tool, Reading Partners plans to double the number of students we support
  in some of Los Angeles's most vulnerable communities.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  In the 2020-21 school year, we measured the success of our program against the
  following metrics: Objective 1: 78% of all Reading Partners’ students will
  meet or exceed their primary, individualized end-of-year literacy growth goal.
  Objective 2: 85% of all K-2 students will master grade-appropriate
  foundational literacy skills, putting them on track to read at or above grade
  level by third grade. Objective 3: 70% of all students in grades 3-4 will show
  growth in reading scores compared to a national group of peers in the same
  grade. Objective 4: 70% of students show improvement in academic behaviors
  such as class participation and homework completion, as measured by surveys.
  Objective 5: 90% of teachers and principals identify Reading Partners as a
  valuable asset to their school, as measured by surveys. As of April 1, Reading
  Partners has only collected middle-of-year assessment results, and early
  indicators show that our students are on track to meet or exceed the above
  goals.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1500'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '3500'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Reading is the foundation of all learning. While we know that according to the
  2019 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) data, only 21 percent
  of fourth-graders from low-income communities are reading proficiently, we
  also know that literacy tutoring, particularly in grades K-3, can have a
  profound, positive impact on student literacy achievement. In fact, when
  systemically disadvantaged students are reading at grade level by third grade,
  they are thirteen times more likely to graduate on time from high school
  (Sparks, “Study: Third Grade Reading Predicts Later High School Graduation”).
  Equipping students with the foundational literacy skills they need to succeed
  unlocks lasting opportunities that can have a profound impact on their
  academic achievement and lifelong learning.
