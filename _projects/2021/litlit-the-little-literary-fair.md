title: 'LITLIT: The Little Literary Fair'
project_summary: >-
  LITLIT brings together independent publishers and literary arts organizations
  from LA, SoCal, and beyond for a two-day festival of books, panels, and
  discussions. This free and public event creates space for cross-cultural and
  collaborative dialogue between writers, readers, and publishers about the
  literary arts as a form of community activism, enrichment, and engagement.
  LITLIT is dedicated to cultivating and promoting the Los Angeles literary
  scene by raising public awareness and creating new opportunities for
  collaboration and engagement.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Literary production can feel like an insider's world, concentrated in and
  around New York’s publishing scene and largely dominated by a handful of
  ever-consolidating corporations. California’s thriving independent publishing
  houses have long offered more inclusive, diverse, and adventurous
  alternatives, but lack the interconnective network, outreach infrastructure,
  and financial resources wielded by larger firms. Independent literary arts
  organizations, driven by community rather than pure profit, serve communities
  often underrepresented in and misrepresented by big trade publishing. LITLIT
  offers local independent publishers and literary arts organizers the
  opportunity to forge and reinforce direct connections with their readers and
  fellow professionals. By bringing together California’s literary arts
  community and the reading public, LITLIT will foster a more diverse cultural
  landscape, increasing access to the arts for writers, publishers, readers, and
  curious passers-by alike.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Over the course of a weekend, LITLIT will gather together 30-40 local
  publishers and literary arts organizations and host 6–7 panel discussions and
  workshops. The free, outdoor book fair will run from 10AM–5PM on both days,
  with ample room for socially distanced and masked activity, should such
  precautions be necessary. Attendees will have the opportunity to mingle with
  booksellers, authors, publishers, and organizers from their communities, and
  to engage in printing workshops and other interactive craft projects. We will
  feature panels and discussions between literary artists and publishers on a
  range of topics. We will tailor programming to the groups and causes our
  exhibitors serve, inviting those interested to not only participate in panels,
  but also to cultivate these discussions with us. This year, we plan to feature
  conversations on topics such as Politics & Publishing, Art & Poetry Across
  Borders, Adaptations from Page to Screen, and more. This grant will facilitate
  participation from small presses and nonprofit publishers by helping us offer
  exhibitors booths free of charge, rather than at the often prohibitive
  standard rates of $350–950+ for comparable events and conferences. It will
  also support advertising and outreach efforts to communities all over Los
  Angeles and fund panel discussions, which will be recorded and uploaded onto
  LARB’s YouTube channel and website to maximize content accessibility and
  engagement, and for archival purposes.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  In our inaugural (and as-yet, because of the pandemic, only) run, our
  exhibitors garnered between 25–150+ new email sign-ups, building their
  following and customer base. LITLIT 2019, co-hosted by LARB and Hauser & Wirth
  Publishers, welcomed over 5,000 visitors across two days, and our goal is to
  host over 6,000 this year. Exhibitors reported that they sold more books at
  LITLIT than at other book fairs and events, and some sold out on the first
  day. We have learned that regular in-person check-ins with exhibitors are
  essential during the event to create a welcoming and casual atmosphere
  conducive to a positive experience. After the event, we also provided
  exhibitors with emailed surveys for more extensive feedback about the quality
  and efficacy of the event, details regarding the number of products exhibitors
  sold and new contacts and collaborations made, and their willingness to
  participate in future events. (All of our respondents were eager to join us
  again.)
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '40'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '6000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Cutting-edge and attuned to the needs of local communities, independent
  presses in California have done much to shape Los Angeles’s cultural identity.
  LITLIT will strengthen public and institutional support for their work and
  bring broader recognition of the vibrant literary community here in LA. It
  will also foster access to and engagement in the world of literary production,
  especially among readers and writers from underserved populations. By bringing
  together publishers and readers, LITLIT will help each of our exhibitors,
  which have included Tia Chucha, World Stage Press, Kaya Press, Red Hen, and
  others, to increase their audiences and better tailor their products to the
  communities they serve. LITLIT exposes the public to local literary
  communities, generating dozens of new library card enrollments each day and a
  long list of new volunteers for programs such as WordsUncaged. Our goal is to
  attract at least 6,000 members of the public in 2022.
