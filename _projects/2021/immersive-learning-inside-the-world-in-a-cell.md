title: >-
  Immersive Learning inside the World in a Cell, uses emergent technologies such
  as Virtual Reality, Interactive Games, and World Building to take Los Angeles
  youth on an artscience journey inside the complex world in our cells to better
  understand how their bodies work.
project_summary: >-
  Immersive Learning inside the World in a Cell, engages young people to learn
  more about the molecular world inside their body. This knowledge will empower
  them to make healthy choices and inspire them to consider future careers in
  artscience and STEAM. Using the collaborative and interdisciplinary practice
  of World Building allows young people to integrate their imagination and
  emergent technologies such as Game Design, Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual
  Reality (VR), creating new stories and pathways for exploration of any
  inquiry.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - South LA
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  It is perhaps not an exaggeration to say that it is a public health imperative
  to create an informed and knowledgeable population who are able to make good
  decisions about how to manage their health and wellness. Last year provided a
  dramatic demonstration of this as public health experts needed to provide
  rapid guidance for people with a very basic background in fundamental biology
  to avoid catastrophic disease based on the understanding of the transmission
  and etiology of COVID-19. Another illness impacting Los Angeles, where
  knowledge of biology is essential for its mitigation, prevention or possible
  cure is type 2 diabetes (T2D). There are many books and traditional classes
  that teach this content, but our program has created innovative learning tools
  using emergent technologies to teach youth because this generation of students
  and patients pay more attention to these platforms and therefore, have a
  long-term engagement with what happens to their body at the cellular level.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Our program equips classrooms and clinics with tools that can address the
  problem of science literacy by using storytelling and design as a means of
  accessing core concepts in molecular, cellular, and structural biology. By
  merging art and science, our learning tools are multidisciplinary STEAM
  experiences. We created an interactive game called Pancreatic Beta Cell
  Station, where patients and students take an avatar through a “metro line”
  experience in the Pancreatic Beta Cell. Understanding the systems of this cell
  is paramount for T2D patients to understand why adherence to their treatment
  regimens is essential. We work in conjunction with Nancy Chang, USC Faculty at
  The Keck School of Medicine, who is a researcher at the Type 2 Diabetes clinic
  at CHLA. This grant will support the completion of the game and Beta testing
  at the T2D diabetes clinic. Once completed, the game will be tested in a
  feasibility and acceptability clinical trial in Spring 2022. Our program
  developed learning modules and a VR experience that are ready to share with
  highschools. The grant will support taking our learning tools into a Sequoyah
  High School classroom in the fall to work with a dedicated group of students
  and faculty to test the curriculum and create effective learning modules for
  all high school students that are aligned with NGSS science standards. In the
  spring, the lesson plans, teacher guides, and classroom tools will be
  available for use in partner public high-school classrooms.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  For the clinic, we would conduct beta testing with a group of 30 youth
  patients to share the interactive game with them and administer pre and
  post-surveys to measure the following metrics: 1) Does exposure to the game
  show an increase in patient understanding of their condition and T2D. 2) Does
  exposure to the game increases their adherence to their treatments and health
  regimes. With the high school classroom, we would track the following metrics
  by conducting pre and post surveys with the students to evaluate comprehension
  and engagement: 1) Does participation in our program increase students’
  current interest in the Arts and inspire future majors and career paths. 2)
  Does participation in our program increase students’ current interest in
  Science and inspire future majors and career paths. 3) Do students understand
  the general function of the Pancreatic Beta Cell and Cells in general, the
  molecular components, the pathways, and interactions that lead to Insulin
  production.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '150'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1500'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  This project will help educate youth with T2D diabetes about their disease
  using technology that will make it easier to understand difficult concepts
  that patients have a hard time grasping. Having VR games also spark more
  interest in this population than the traditional methods currently used. If
  our work is successful, young people and the general public will have more
  fluency in understanding the molecular systems in their bodies and can use
  that knowledge to make informed decisions and participate in finding solutions
  to future scientific questions. Los Angeles should be a leader in taking STEAM
  into high schools. Immersive Learning inside the World in a Cell could change
  the way schools approach teaching the fundamentals of cellular biology for
  generations to come. Our focus is on using immersive learning experiences to
  create curiosity, self-discovery and challenge youth to take a deeper look at
  the world around them.
