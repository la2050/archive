title: 'LA Podcast: Key to the City'
project_summary: >-
  The LA Podcast crew is teaming up with local journalists and organizers to
  bring accountability and transparency to City Hall. We’re launching a new
  website to track and publicize key pieces of legislation in City Council
  *before* they become policy — while they’re still in committee and you can
  weigh in. And we’re producing a companion podcast to make City Hall more
  accessible, reveal the impact of local policies on everyday Angelenos and our
  most vulnerable neighbors, and give you the tools you need to get involved and
  make a difference.

What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  What happens inside City Hall has an enormous impact on our daily lives — and
  right now, local government is not working for most Angelenos. LA has more
  people living on our streets than any other city in the country, and is one of
  the least affordable places for housing anywhere in the world. We have some of
  the highest rates of poverty and income inequality, the worst air quality, and
  the deadliest streets. Underlying these larger problems is the fact that City
  Hall feels totally inaccessible to the average Angeleno. This is especially
  true of City Council’s 13 committees, which is where the most important
  policies are made. As a result, most of us are stuck reacting to policies
  after it’s too late to change them — if we hear about them at all. The
  inaccessibility of City Hall makes our problems feel insurmountable, but
  that’s only because most Angelenos don’t understand how local government and
  policymaking works, and what they can do to help make LA a better place for
  everyone.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Our project has two main components: (1) A new website and newsletter to track
  and publicize key pieces of local legislation from inception through the time
  they become policy; and (2) a podcast miniseries explaining how City Hall
  works, the impact of policies on people on the ground, and how you can get
  involved and make a difference. For our legislation tracking website and
  newsletter, which we’re calling “LA on Deck,” we’ll spotlight priority pieces
  of legislation that will have the biggest impact on people’s ability to live,
  work, and thrive. We’ll track these bills through City Council’s committees —
  little known entities that provide the most important opportunities for public
  input. In clear and interesting ways, we’ll cover what bills are important,
  how the proposed policies will impact people’s lives, where they’re at in the
  process of becoming law, and when there are opportunities for you to weigh in.
  Our companion podcast miniseries, “Key to the City,” will offer a unique
  combination of on-the-ground reporting and in-depth policy analysis. We’ll
  employ local journalists to do interviews and reporting, and work with our
  friends at LA Forward to demystify the ways that policy and local politics
  have created our current crises. Every episode will include specific actions
  that listeners can take to make a difference in their communities and ensure
  LA becomes a place that we are all proud to call home.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  The LA Podcast and LA Forward teams have a proven track record of reaching and
  educating tens of thousands of Angelenos on local civic issues. LA Podcast has
  produced nearly 170 episodes and averages 10,000 weekly listeners, LA Forward
  has dozens of volunteer organizers who’ve helped run 100+ civic education
  workshops and events over the past year, and both groups produce voter guides
  to local elections that have been read and shared hundreds of thousands of
  times. We will measure the success of our new joint initiative by a number of
  metrics, including: - How many people use, share, and act on the legislative
  information on LA on Deck. - How many people listen to the podcast and engage
  with our social media content and calls to action. It’s important to us that
  those engaging with this project mirror LA’s amazing diversity, and we will
  work with our partners to make sure all of our content reaches and resonates
  with communities across LA.

Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Our ultimate goals are to make City Hall more accessible and give Angelenos a
  greater voice in the systems and policies that shape our lives. In the short
  term, we hope this project will lead to: - Greater awareness of and
  participation in the workings of City Council and its committees. - More
  Angelenos of all backgrounds participating in neighborhood councils, mutual
  aid groups, and other community-based volunteering initiatives. Long term, we
  believe that a more engaged and knowledgeable population can better push for
  policies that meaningfully improve life for Angelenos. Long term goals
  include: - Bigger, bolder, and more effective policy solutions to address our
  most urgent crises — developed from the ground-up with extensive community
  input. - More people running for office and other positions of power in their
  own communities. - More representative government better in tune with the
  needs of people on the ground, especially those who are struggling under the
  status quo.
