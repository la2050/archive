  lets the entrepreneurs focus on what they do best -- serve great, new food to

project_video: ''
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Prior to On The Go LA, expanding your business as a food entrepreneur meant
  incurring significant startup costs and operating expenses associated with a
  food truck or brick-and-mortar location. This was always a big risk -- one
  that became even more pronounced by COVID-19. As a result -- most food
  entrepreneurs are shut out and there are thousands of Latinx/African-American
  food entrepreneurs in Los Angeles that are disenfranchised by the high costs
  of traditional kitchens.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  On The Go LA is a service that helps local food entrepreneurs easily &
  affordably formalize their business and grow their customer base by offering
  full-service, short-term food truck rentals. We provide food entrepreneurs --
  including local chefs, pop-ups, and catering companies -- the opportunity to
  grow their business and revenue through single and multi-day food truck
  rentals. On The Go LA makes this seamless for the entrepreneurs, by providing
  the truck, permits, high-traffic stops, marketing, and operational support,
  which lets the entrepreneurs focus on what they do best -- serve great, new
  food to local Angelenos. By providing affordable access through a low-cost,
  low-risk solution, we are allowing them to continue their dreams of
  formalizing their business without additional barriers. We are effectively
  democratizing an opportunity for expansion, revenue growth, and distribution
  to all local food entrepreneurs in Los Angeles.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  With no food industry experience but with plenty of determination and
  scrappiness, we quickly launched a minimum viable product in June of 2020 and
  have since experienced 200% growth across more than 50 food partners. Most
  importantly, over the last 5 months, we have been at an 80% monthly booking
  capacity, with 70% of our partners booking multiple times. Today, On The Go LA
  is seeing significant demand and we are poised for growth and expansion. We've
  just implemented an online reservation system, and are pre-booking multi-day
  bundles. Given the demand from local food entrepreneurs, we are preparing to
  launch a second and third truck. As we grow, we have an opportunity to
  leverage our local data to deliver a recommendation engine to further help
  entrepreneurs select hot stops, and in the longer-term, allow us to expand
  across the greater Los Angeles area.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '150'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '41350'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  In the last 10 months, we have been able to provide a lifeline for more than
  50 local food entrepreneurs in Los Angeles. On The Go LA is now in a position
  to scale by adding additional trucks and helping up to 3 different local
  entrepreneurs on a daily basis. We hope to provide them the necessary
  experience in formalizing their food business through the days they are on our
  truck so they can feel the confidence to take the next step on their journey.
  We hope to help more than 100 additional food entrepreneurs in the next year
  (reaching thousands more in LA over the next few years) and are looking to
  graduate at least 10-20% of them to their own truck or their own
  brick-and-mortar location. This is especially important as we hope to enable
  them to create their own generational wealth and chart their entrepreneurial
  path to leave a positive impact on the next generation of Angelenos.
