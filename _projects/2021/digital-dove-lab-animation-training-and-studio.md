title: 'Digital Dove Lab: Animation Training and Studio'
project_summary: >-
  Youth – particularly youth of color - experiencing homelessness in L.A.
  deserve high-end training that will lead to careers far above the poverty
  line. L.A.’s entertainment/digital effects workforce and economy is in dire
  need of new, unique voices and talents. This program – the Digital Dove Lab:
  Animation Training and Studio – prioritizes the training of youth of color in
  the latest animation and digital effects processes as they permanently
  transition to FORMERLY homeless youth.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Young people – particularly youth of color - who are experiencing homelessness
  do not have access to the training and relationships necessary to have a
  successful career in L.A.’s digital arts industry, which is itself in need of
  their creative skills, intellectual capacities, and unique perspectives. There
  are more than 6,000 youth experiencing homelessness in L.A., and the programs
  that exist to help them develop skills and sustainability are overwhelmingly
  targeted to low-wage, unfulfilling jobs. To live comfortably in L.A., a person
  needs to earn $74,371. The jobs that are most often trained in employment
  programs are service industry that pay an average of $27,827. What does this
  mean besides the obvious disparity between target and reality? It means that
  our most vulnerable youth work relentlessly to increase their earning
  capacity, their agency, and their confidence only to exit the program into a
  job that puts them directly back into a cycle of poverty.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Digital Dove Lab: Animation and Training Studio will provide youth leaving
  homelessness behind – primarily youth of color – with training & career
  opportunities that lead to long-term financial sustainability and career
  success in animation and special effects. The six-month, 20-hour/week training
  program specializes in predetermined processes of the production train. It
  focuses on 1) model & character rigging; 2) digital painting; and 3)
  animation. While youth are training, their time is paid. When the training
  period has ended, youth can either A) continue their training, B) become
  employed by the lab, or C) become employed with an outside company that
  produces/uses animation; it is at once a training program and a company that
  produces real work for real studios. Adding to the viability and
  sustainability of this collaborative program is the fact that we have secured
  four major studio partners who A) have prioritized this emphasis upon
  providing better access to high-end entertainment career paths for youth of
  color and B) have agreed to both purchase the creative content that Digital
  Dove Lab will produce and employ graduates of the program. This program is the
  best way to address the employment barriers of youth of color because it
  assumes the best of its participants and trusts in their capacity to enter
  into high-level training immediately. It’s a housing first approach to
  employment; why tiptoe into a career when we have a way to dive straight into
  the deep end?
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  We will measure success as follows: 1) The training portion of the program
  leads directly to employment. The objective is that 75% of participants will
  become fully employed by Digital Dove Lab – conducting its core work of model
  and character rigging, digital painting, and animation – after their six-month
  training period has ended. Further, we expect that 20% will become employed
  (most commonly via contract work) by outside agencies/production companies at
  the end of the training period). 2) A network of paying clients sustain and
  grow the program into perpetuity. This is a capstone objective for the
  program. We have already secured four major studio partners/clients who have
  committed to growing projects specifically for people of color. Their
  commitment to A) underwriting access to high end creative careers and B)
  purchasing the work they create make a visible statement to the larger
  community as well as supporting the sustainability of this program.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '36'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1000000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  From 2011 to 2016, the L.A. County Film and Digital Media industry added
  49,500 jobs. The average wage in said industry is $117,000 – a +95% wage
  premium compared to the average wage economy-wide ($59,900) in the County.
  When our work is successful, we will be adding unique creators with culturally
  relevant stories to that economy. Providing only access and training for jobs
  ‘above poverty wage’ is every bit as unjust as the inequities that deny youth
  experiencing homelessness access to the community in the first place. L.A. –
  and one of its most prestigious and lucrative industries – will be richer,
  more informed, and, more just when it accommodates a new stream of youth with
  new, unique stories and journeys. In the short term, that means a minimum of
  18 youth entering the local digital media landscape within six months. In the
  long term, the work these youth create will be integral to a more learned,
  culturally literate industry.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  The partner organization for this collaborative proposal is Studio ‘C’, which
  is led by Mr. Carlos Arguello. Mr. Arguello – and his staff of three
  trainers/instructors – will be responsible for the implementation of the model
  & character rigging, digital painting, and animation curriculum. This will
  involve group instruction in the classroom and one-on-one attention to each
  student as needed. The Studio ‘C’ team will be responsible for ongoing
  progress management for each student and communicating said progress (or
  challenges) to each youth’s CHC case manager. It is through this communication
  that the program can at once address the training needs of each student, but
  also their therapeutic needs to ensure a trauma-informed program.

  implementation
