title: The Right Kind Of Black Girl
project_summary: >-
  The Right Kind of Black Girl provides a pathway to freedom from oppression
  through unity, economic advancement, and living a life of wholeness. We
  envision a world where Black people are free from racial disparities,
  depression, and isolation. We take a holistic approach to supporting
  specifically Black women and girls between the ages of 15 and 60 who stem from
  generational poverty to cultivate sisterhood and empower women and girls of
  the African diaspora to lead, innovate, and serve our communities. We are
  committed to our mission.

What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  The historical legacy of the racial wealth divide coupled with gender and
  racial inequality has left Black women at a severe disadvantage. Individuals
  may not see themselves as racists, but they can still benefit from systems
  that white privilege perpetuate. This practice prevents Black families from
  amassing and maintaining wealth in the same way that white families could,
  resulting in the growth of the racial wealth gap and housing insecurity that
  persists today. Nearly every social indicator of well-being from income and
  earnings to obesity and food security, Black women and girls rank low or last.
  The numbers below spotlight the inequalities and resulting injustices Black
  women face on a daily basis as they work to obtain full economic security and
  to create a better life and future for their families We Know that for us to
  LIVE, Oppressions Must Die
