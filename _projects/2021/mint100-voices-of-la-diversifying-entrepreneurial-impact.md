title: 'MINT100 Voices of LA: Diversifying Entrepreneurial Impact'
project_summary: >-
  MINT100 project is a video series that combines storytelling and research to
  increase the visibility and amplify the voices of entrepreneurs of color in
  the eyes of those with the ability to provide funding. Over the course of one
  year, we will identify, connect with, and share the journeys of 100
  entrepreneurs of color based in LA County. We will base our project on
  researching facts and statistics on the ROI that a funding provider would gain
  by funding a diverse group of entrepreneurs while documenting the MINT100
  through video interviews.

project_video: 'https://youtu.be/z3oniADTsFI'
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  A study released in 2020 by Rate My Investor and Diversity VC was done looking
  at the top 100 U.S. VC firms by deal activity and the 3,304 companies they
  invested in. The study showed that 25% of the startups that received funding
  were Asian, 1.3% Latinx, and 1.7% Black. And of all of the founders, only
  10.7% were women. The funding disparity has only become more glaring during
  the COVID-19 pandemic as Black and Latinx-owned businesses have faced the
  heaviest amount of revenue loss in Los Angeles County. This would lead some to
  think that the small percentage of funding directed towards businesses of
  color must be due to their lack of success. Well according to a study by the
  Small Business Majority Organization published in 2021, the nearly 8 million
  businesses owned by people of color have generated $1.4 trillion in revenue
  and employ more than 7 million people. The problem is not ability. The problem
  is visibility.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  This grant will support increasing the visibility of a diverse and successful
  demographic of entrepreneurs impacting Los Angeles County. Through
  research-based visual storytelling, investors will see, beyond the numbers,
  the return that investing in entrepreneurs of color can have for themselves
  and the community. Over the course of the grant year, we will identify,
  connect with, and share the journeys of 100 entrepreneurs of color based in LA
  County while compiling data and facts on the success of their businesses to
  present to potential investors. A unique aspect to this project is the
  intention to work with LA County community college students to intern on this
  project. To identify the MINT100, we will hire a Communications major to
  develop a campaign that will be a call for entrepreneurs to be considered for
  this project. After choosing the MINT100, we will connect them with Business
  major students that we hired to gather quantitative data on their success. In
  order to share the quantitative data and also the qualitative data, which is
  the entrepreneurs’ personal stories, we will put out another call to find a LA
  County-based videography team of color that will film and edit short
  interviews of the MINT100 under the direction of a hired Film student. The
  MINT100 project is bringing a community-based approach to increasing funding
  diversity.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  For this proposed MINT100 project, we will define and measure success by the
  reach that the video series produces in terms of viewers as well as the dollar
  amount in funding access that the MINT100 entrepreneurs are connected to
  during the course of the project. We believe that the more individuals that
  view the stories of the MINT100, the more normalized it will be for people to
  see and expect excellence associated with entrepreneurs of color. We also
  believe that opening the door to as much direct funding access as possible to
  the MINT100 will allow them to have the opportunity to create even more impact
  in LA county through their businesses.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '112'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '6000000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  LA County can become the center of a diversely impactful funding hub and the
  MINT100 project will be the catalyst for this change. Through the success of
  this project, 100 entrepreneurs of color, multiple LA County based community
  college students, and every person that views the video series will be a part
  of a shift in the culture of private investment funding allocation. The top
  100 U.S. VC firms by deal activity accounted for $68 billion in funding with
  only 3% of that going to Black and Latinx entrepreneurs. In LA, the total
  funding received for all founders in the U.S. was 4.2% in comparison to 35.3%
  according to the 2020 study by Rate My Investor and Diversity VC. Shining a
  light and increasing visibility of the MINT100 entrepreneurs in LA County will
  increase the percentage of funding being funneled into our county in the
  long-term while driving local customers and supporters to the businesses in
  the short-term which will directly impact the economy of the county as a
  whole.
