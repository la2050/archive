title: 'Wealth in Waste: LA''s Textile Upcycling and Recycling'
project_summary: >-
  Rewilder exists to convince the world that there is wealth in waste. We focus
  on textile waste, partnering with industrial giants to identify, divert, and
  upcycle waste materials that are worthy of a second life. Upcycling materials
  is the best end-of-life solution for the environment. The LA2050 grant will
  fund the expansion of our current successful operation - R+D design lab plus
  high-tech upcycling - into a larger facility including closed-loop textile
  recycling (old clothes and fabrics into quality recycled fibers).

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Over 11 million tons of textiles are landfilled globally. Our entire business
  revolves around decreasing textile waste to landfill, and shifting the
  conversation about trash from where we put it, to what can we make with it?
  With design thinking, we can do better than landfill by upcycling and
  closed-loop recycling that uses existing materials rather than making new.
  Most of our trash heads to a landfill where it will sit for hundreds of years,
  all the while releasing toxins. According to the EPA, there are at least 564
  operational landfills and 480 candidate sites. Since the 1960s, predominantly
  BIPOC communities have been targeted as sites where it has been acceptable to
  dump our trash. The pre-pandemic prosperity was a facade that maintained a
  failing system, but now, we are in a better position than ever to tackle
  bigger issues because it’s what the world needs. In parallel, the world will
  also be more receptive to what we have to offer: completely rethinking textile
  waste.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  When we think about waste, we always think about post-consumer. But industrial
  manufacturing generates massive amounts of trash: the brewery we work with
  tosses 2 tons of beer filter cloth every 3 days, and the auto industry trashes
  100K tons of material a year. Much of it is non-recyclable and
  high-performance. Our work targets these industrial processes to intercept the
  materials before they go to the landfill, and transform them into usable raw
  materials for cross-industry applications. This grant will immediately support
  the expansion of our facility to include a larger space for rehabilitating
  industrial trash in order to offer these materials widely to designers and
  manufacturers across the country. The grant will also allow us to prioritize
  the new technology of closed-loop textile recycling, which complements our
  work and increases our impact. We are working with an expert liaison to this
  new material science and will be bringing in technology to shred old fabrics
  like t-shirts (consumer scale), uniforms, and sheets (commercial scale) and
  reconstruct fibers to make new fabric of equal quality. The technology will
  sort input fabric by color, thus reducing the need for dyeing or additional
  processing. We have made great progress already, and will use the LA2050 grant
  to propel this quickly forward. Our goal is to make a significant impact on
  textile waste sent to landfills in Los Angeles.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  We have a proven track record of high-impact material diversions with partners
  including Disney, PepsiCo, UCLA, Hollywood Bowl, Imperfect Foods, LA Metro,
  and more. For each of these projects, we measure and report the weight of the
  material, as well as CO2 diverted from landfills. This has a direct impact on
  human health and the health of the planet. With this expansion, Rewilder will:
  - Divert waste sent to landfill - Recapture resource value - Measure and
  provide clear impact metrics - Accelerate “zero waste to landfill” initiatives
  Beyond waste diversion, the project reduces carbon emissions in 3 ways: -
  Landfilling footprint – reduce CO2 from landfilling - New material footprint –
  reduce CO2 required to grow, create, process, and manufacture new materials -
  Logistics footprint – reduce CO2 used to transport Landfill reduction has a
  direct health impact on low-income BIPOC. Fighting against climate change is
  fighting against issues like social justice and inequality.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '50'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1010572'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Our Los Angeles is a leader in innovation and sustainability, a leader in
  technology with global influence. The pandemic, however cruel, shows the need
  for social capitalism. Now is the time for business to work for a greater
  good. Rewilder will jumpstart a sustainable textile revolution, where the
  robust apparel industry here has easy access to high-tech sustainable
  materials, plus impact data to back it up. We are committed to building a
  facility that reflects our company ethos of sustainability, transparency,
  honesty, fairness, diversity, community and good design. We are innovators -
  finding solutions to the world’s trash problems that incorporate both
  upcycling and recycling, and forward-thinking research and development that
  fuels innovation. Our company is woman owned and operated. Jenny is Jewish /
  LBGTQ, and Stephanie is Chinese-American. We are committed to making this city
  a better place to live and work by building a unique place that benefits
  people and the planet.
