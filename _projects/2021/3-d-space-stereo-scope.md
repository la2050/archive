title: '3-D SPACE: STEREO/SCOPE'
project_summary: >-
  STEREO/SCOPE: Looking Forward By Looking Back utilizes the latest virtual
  reality technology to create a simulacrum of a Victorian era stereoviewer, in
  which participants will experience life in the 19th century through historical
  immersive 3-D still photography, digitized and enhanced for the digital age.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - San Fernando Valley
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Most people aren’t aware that stereoscopic imaging has a very rich history
  that dates back to the 19th century. 3-D image creation and VR as we know it
  today has its earliest roots in the 1800s, dating to the very origins of
  photography. From the 1850s until the 1920s, stereographs were a popular form
  of personal entertainment, as common in Victorian culture as TV is today. Much
  of the appeal of stereoscopic photographs was the same as modern VR - the
  ability of 3-D imagery to immerse and virtually transport people to faraway
  places that they wouldn’t be able to visit in person. By juxtaposing popular
  analog stereo photos of the 1800s with digital VR technologies, this project
  will demonstrate that motivations for immersive experiences today are the same
  as in the past, and that VR techniques culturally achieve the exact same
  goals. This will provide a means of immersive exposure to our history, that
  the public would not otherwise have the opportunity to experience.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  This project will utilize the latest virtual reality technology to create a
  simulacrum of a Victorian era stereoviewer. Participants will experience life
  in the 19th century through historical immersive 3-D still photography,
  digitized and enhanced for the digital age. and will view entire collections
  of digitally scanned vintage stereo photographs in a new and interactive way .
  This project will create high resolution scans of over 10,000 analog
  stereograph photographic cards. Concurrently, a VR software application will
  be developed for multiple platforms. The stereoscopic digital image files will
  be integrated into the VR environment so that any image in the database can
  instantly be searched for and viewed in the virtual stereoscope. A room-scale
  virtual reality installation will serve as a destination where participants
  will be able to explore the Victorian environment and view the stereo images
  just as they were intended when they were produced over a century ago. Scanned
  images will also be digitally converted into lightfield representations for
  public viewing on glasses-free holographic displays, which will allow large
  groups to share the immersive experience of the VR user. An internet based app
  will be made available at remote locations and for distant participants to
  explore the project. Participants will have a transportive experience within a
  transportive experience, and will learn how the analog of the past directly
  informs the digital of the future.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  During the project’s working phase, the public will be invited to beta test
  the apps. Upon completion, a room-scale VR installation will serve as a
  destination for public participation and the web version will be available so
  distant participants can engage. Groups will be able to view holographic
  installations at locations throughout Los Angeles. Our work will be directly
  evaluated by the public who engage with the installations. The people who
  attend our exhibitions will be able to provide feedback to shape future
  programs.The project will be exhibited in various public venues including art
  galleries, film festivals, and online, where the Los Angeles community at
  large will be able to see, experience, and comment. Our internal evaluation
  will be based on measuring levels of continuing engagement with the public,
  growth of audience size, attendance numbers at our events, and public demand
  for increased activities.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '50'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Our hope is that the VR applications and content developed through this
  project will be of interest to other museums, archives, and libraries in Los
  Angeles. The finished VR applications can be made available to organizations
  and individuals who would like to utilize them to make their own collections
  available, and will invite future collaborations with the 3-D SPACE. The
  project will provide a roadmap to making new assets available in the same
  manner, and potentially spawn a publicly accessible network of digital
  stereoscopic images that can be shared among institutions and with the public
  at large.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  There is no specific collaborative partner for this project. 3-D SPACE is the
  singular applicant for this grant. Funds will not be disbursed to any
  partners. In the past, 3-D SPACE has collaborated creatively with
  organizations throughout the Los Angeles arts and education sectors, including
  the Los Angeles Central Library, Columbia Memorial Space Center, LA Filmforum,
  the Velaslavasay Panorama, the Echo Park Film Center, Captured Aural Phantasy
  Theater, Monsterpalooza, Heritage Square Museum, the Academy of Motion Picture
  Arts and Sciences, and the LA 3-D Club, as well as other arts and science
  organizations, museums, galleries, libraries, and schools. When funded, this
  project will offer multiple collaborative opportunities with these and others.
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?: >-
  Access to the LA2050 community,Hosting virtual events or
  gatherings,Communications support,Strategy assistance and
  implementation,Volunteer recruitment
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.: ''
