title: Give Your Gift Los Angeles
project_summary: >-
  SBCC believes that lasting social change happens when communities come
  together to support each other by sharing their gifts, talents, and abilities;
  and that every individual has something unique to contribute. SBCC will create
  a digital platform to facilitate this exchange on the local level and help
  build a more equitable and just society. Give Your Gift (GYG) is about
  organizing and scaling a community’s capacity to help itself. SBCC is paving
  the way for an alternative “gift economy” that will result in a more inclusive
  local economy.

'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Marginalized and oppressed communities are often invaded, captured and
  colonized by professional services, robbing them of their agency, self-worth,
  and belief in their ability to make a change. This deficit model damages
  individuals by undermining their sense of self and inherent capacities. These
  negative effects on self-concept have been thoroughly explored where people
  labeled deficient come to see themselves as less than. These dis-empowering
  effects are clearly evident in the data about low measures of self-efficacy
  and hope in marginalized communities. SBCC’s Give Your Gift campaign is a bold
  response to this deficit model. Oppressed communities have their own culture
  of wellness and powerful strategies to enhance well-being. They are generous
  and caring. SBCC believes not in the power of social services but in the power
  of community strength. As John McKnight wrote, “Revolutions begin when people
  who are defined as problems achieve the power to redefine the problem.”
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  SBCC’s GYG is challenging the deficit model and creating a scalable structure
  to leverage all of the assets, gifts, and talents within a community. SBCC’s
  GYG drives social change by surfacing, elevating, and activating the assets
  within individuals and neighborhoods. The first step in this strength based
  revolution is to empower 10,000 LA residents to discover their gifts and
  talents through a digital strength finding platform. SBCC’s website and social
  media will be the primary channels for the two components of this initiative:
  the first being an opportunity to barter and share gifts within the community.
  The second is an easy to use, localized resource map in the spirit of Yelp to
  reveal the often unknown resources throughout SBCC’s LA County reach. Both of
  these new sections will provide value to residents on their journey towards
  positive, self-initiated change. GYG scales its digital strength finding
  through a broad network of partners who are committed to challenging the
  deficit model. Next, SBCC through GYG will develop a “gift exchange”. The SBCC
  Gift Exchange will be a communal space that welcomes everyone in with a simple
  on-boarding question/response wizard that adds them to a community map.
  Leveraging the platform, SBCC’s goal will be greater accessibility to the vast
  personal capacity within SBCC's community. The map will be both desktop and
  mobile friendly with provisions for SBCC community members to personalize
  relevant mapped elements and information.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  SBCC will utilize both qualitative and quantitative data to measure the
  success of this campaign, which launched in 2020. “Give your gift” allowed
  residents to feel a connection to others. Initially, over 350 people responded
  and sent a video describing their gift and how they would give it. This
  campaign aligned with SBCC’s core value, that everyone has a gift and can
  contribute. LA2050 is an opportunity to expand the network of people. SBCC
  observed the same phenomena and data collection in our community organizing
  program. The data is evidence the campaign was impactful and effective. The
  number of people who created a video was additional evidence that this
  strategy would work to promote civic engagement, reduce social isolation and
  ensure that every person has an opportunity to contribute. SBCC has a diverse
  collaboration of partners, which is further evidence this a successful
  strategy. We believe that there is value in expanding this project into a
  countywide initiative.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '10000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '100000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  9. Most public information about communities is deficit based. SBCC flips that
  script, allowing residents, CBOs, and public systems to share the strengths
  and assets of communities that can be leveraged to create lasting change. SBCC
  is laying the groundwork for a new kind of “gift economy,” which reinforces
  the importance of each individual contribution. GYG is about organizing and
  scaling a community’s capacity to help itself. Asset Based Community
  Development (ABCD) is the philosophical cornerstone of building a resilient,
  connected, thriving community. SBCC’s GYG is boldly solving what John
  McKnight, founder of the ABCD model, called the social services and
  professional problem. By building strengths and supporting residents rather
  than trying to solve deficit-based problems, communities will drive lasting
  change. After the grant, this initiative will continue to drive a conversation
  around a shared asset based economy completely owned and driven by the
  residents themselves.
