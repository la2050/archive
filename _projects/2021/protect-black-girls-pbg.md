  Protect Black Girls (PBG) is a media campaign and exclusive collaboration
  between CISE and the non-profit organization, Justice for Black Girls. PBG was
  initiated to amplify the voices of Black girls, connect them to programs
  designed to engage Black girls in academic and policy work that is centralized
  around Black girlhood, and ultimately, give Black girls a platform to shine.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  The problem to be addressed is the lack of advocacy initiatives geared towards
  Black girls in LA County. While the Black community has been historically
  underserved, Black girls are particularly marginalized due to an array of
  socioeconomic factors that subject them to a perpetual cycle of hardship. In a
  2019 study, Black girls reported receiving less support from authority figures
  than their non-black counterparts and indicated that such figures punish them
  more harshly than their peers. According to Monique Morris, EdD, “racialized
  and gendered expectations inherent in the public school system leave Black
  girls feeling simultaneously targeted and invisible.” Morris additionally
  indicates that Black girls are the only group of girls overrepresented in all
  discipline categories for which data are collected by the U.S. Department of
  Education Office of Civil Rights. Furthermore, 35% of girls in juvenile
  facilities are Black, according to the Prison Policy Initiative.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Part 1: CISE will donate 100 exclusive PBG Bags (valued at $15,000), which
  boldly state “Protect Black Girls” to JBG in support of their three primary
  initiatives: Freedom Fighters Fund, JBG Ambassadors Program, and JBG Annual
  Conference. Part one of this initiative will culminate in CISE x JBG’s Protect
  Black Girls campaign and photoshoot, highlighting JBG Ambassadors. This
  campaign tasks folks with the safekeeping of Black girls while centering Black
  girl joy and creativity. Part 2: PBG Fashion Cohort | CISE will partner with
  JBG Ambassadors to elevate Black girls as experts and center their voice and
  advocacy. Here, CISE team members will partner with five JBG Ambassadors to
  collaborate on products tailored towards Black girls. JBG Ambassadors will be
  trained by CISE staff with foundational knowledge in fashion,
  entrepreneurship, and product development through a series of virtual
  meetings. This will then culminate in a second photoshoot and campaign, led
  and designed by the CISE x JBG team (COVID safety measures will be implemented
  accordingly). JBG Ambassadors will be awarded $500 stipends each for
  participating in the program. JBG will also receive a portion of proceeds
  connected to the PBG products release to help fund the three aforementioned
  initiatives.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  CISE will donate 100 exclusive PBG Bags to JBG in support of their three
  primary initiatives, which will ultimately be gifted to Black girls in Los
  Angeles County. CISE will sell 300 PBG bags throughout the 12-month award
  period and donate over $5,000 worth of proceeds to JBG. CISE will track
  audience engagement on Instagram to gauge traction gained from the PBG
  campaign. Insights from CISE’s initial post introducing our partnership with
  JBG indicated that the post garnered 715 likes, 14 comments 111 direct
  messages, and 69 saved posts. CISE anticipates on maintaining and/or exceeding
  these insights throughout the PBG campaign. CISE will evaluate the
  effectiveness of PBG Fashion Cohort by administering a questionnaire to JBG
  Ambassadors at the end of the project to gauge their attitudes towards the
  program and the extent to which they gained knowledge in the areas of fashion,
  entrepreneurship and product development.

Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  CISE x JBG’s vision of success for PBG is to bring the highest level of
  awareness possible towards issues centralizing around the welfare of Black
  girls in Los Angeles County, as well as to make a positive impact on the lives
  of Black girls in the region by connecting them to programs such as those
  provided by JBG and enabling them to participate in the PBG fashion cohort. We
  believe that placing Black girls in Los Angeles County at the forefront of a
  large-scale advocacy campaign will create widespread awareness that will spur
  civic engagement that ultimately serves in the best interest of Black girls.
  Additionally, providing monetary support and merchandise to JBG will support
  critical programs designed to situate Black girls in positions of power,
  including the Freedom Fighter’s Fund, JBG ambassadors program, Black girl
  Curriculum, and JBG national conference, which will take place in Los Angeles
  County.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-

  following initiatives: Freedom Fighters Fund, JBG Ambassadors Program, and JBG
  Annual Conference, which will transpire in Los Angeles County. Ambassadors
  participating in the PBG Fashion Cohort will be current beneficiaries of JBG
  who reside in Los Angeles County. JBG will also partake in the media campaign
  by sharing PBG on their social media channels.
