What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Today’s students face challenges with healthy habit-forming, fitness, and goal
  achievement. The 2018-2019 FitnessGram results for students in Los Angeles
  County indicated only 21 percent of fifth graders, 26 percent of seventh
  graders, and 30 percent of ninth graders achieved the “healthy fitness zone”
  for all six assessed standards. 84% of the schools RSG! operates in are Title
  1, serving a majority of low-income students and students who are
  disproportionality impacted by health, wellness and academic challenges.
  Closing the achievement gap and ensuring every child is college and career
  ready will take a complex and multi-pronged approach by all stakeholders
  including schools, teachers, families and the community at large.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  The RSG! virtual program was developed in response to the emergent needs of
  distance learning, and has been a game changer for so many young people. The
  30-minute Virtual Ready,Set,Gold! lessons give students the opportunity to
  exercise with a talented Olympian or Paralympian at home. The virtual
  curriculum focuses on results-based physical activity conducted without
  equipment, and SEL topics for teachers to leverage. The fitness portion of the
  lessons range from endurance and flexibility to balance and strength training,
  and is developed by Dr. Karen Bloch who led the Sports Medicine and
  Performance Department for Team USA. The thematic units include lessons on
  goal-setting, perseverance, and leadership –all brought to life by the real
  personal experiences of RSG!’s Olympic and Paralympic mentors. The RSG!
  virtual program is a great success. School districts throughout Southern
  California and across the nation are seeking RSG! programming. The series is
  available for free online to all students. Due to the high demand and positive
  returns, RSG! continues to enhance its virtual content offering.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  The RSG! team defines success of the virtual program by reaching students
  beyond the barriers of COVID. The RSG! virtual program was launched in
  response to COVID in spring 2020. With the tremendous response received from
  educators and school districts, this virtual resource brought inspired
  positive programming to youth confined to their homes. As students move to
  in-person and hybrid learning, funds for physical education are being
  allocated to added safety protocols. A successful RSG! virtual program will
  reach all seven partnering school districts, and expand student participation
  to eight for the 2021-2022 school year. The RSG! team assess outcomes through
  an exit survey at the student, teacher and administrator level and tracks
  demand for future engagement. RSG! has eight schools on a waiting list to
  receive in-person programming for next school year. RSG! outcomes are measured
  by the required annual CA FitnessGram and the results directly correlate with
  RSG! program offerings.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '400'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '20000'

  Ready, Set, Gold! is designed not only improve student’ health, but also to
  position them for advanced and sustained academic achievement. Across all RSG!

  survey conducted with participating schools, there is an 82% performance
  increase on the FitnessGram test; teachers reported an 82% growth in teamwork
  skills, and 91% increase in participation among students. Exit interviews
  reveal students develop character building assets like grit, determination,
