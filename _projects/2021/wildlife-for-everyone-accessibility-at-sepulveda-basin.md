title: 'Wildlife for Everyone: Accessibility at Sepulveda Basin'
project_summary: >-
  The Sepulveda Basin Wildlife Reserve is a heavily used haven in the San
  Fernando Valley for all manner of wildlife, and humans seeking the nature
  experience. But this is not the case for those with disabilities. This
  proposal will provide a means to access for blind, deaf, seniors, wheelchair
  users and developmentally disabled individuals who desire to experience the
  healing properties of this natural reserve.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - San Fernando Valley
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  The Sepulveda Basin Wildlife Reserve (SBWR) offers trails and a lake teeming
  with wildlife in a riparian setting, adjacent to a public park, all managed by
  LA City Parks and Recreation. The San Fernando Valley Audubon Society (SFVAS)
  offers regular birding outings, and works with Resource Conservation District
  of Santa Monica Mountains to offer LAUSD Title 1 students a day of outdoor
  curriculum. But for anyone with a disability or even limited stamina, the site
  is a problem. There is nowhere for anyone to rest along the trail, no
  accommodations for the deaf or blind, and no accommodations for wheelchairs.
  Disabled Veterans, North Los Angeles Regional Center(NLACRC) consumers
  (28,0000) who are blind, in a wheelchair or have physical limits do not use
  the SBWR. Massive numbers of studies (bibliography available on request) show
  that being outdoors and bird watching helps reduce stress, depression,
  improves mental focus and immune function. We aim to fix the access deficits
  at SBWR.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  This proposal seeks to address inequalities at SBWR by making it accessible
  for everyone, despite physical or cognitive disabilities. The first basic need
  is for visitors to be seated briefly as they proceed around the lake. At
  present there are only two seats, while there is a need for eight more. The
  benches proposed are ADA and LA City Parks & Rec approved. This proposal also
  includes a new cell phone audiotour package, that allows visitors to learn
  about ecology by listening to pre-recorded segments, using signposts at each
  bench that have the dial-in information, and in Braille (the system also
  provides captions for the deaf, and has a GPS interactive map). Anyone can
  access the system and the system provides usage data reports. This software is
  used by NPS and many museums and community entities. For wheelchair users,
  equipment is requested that would allow scopes and binoculars to be attached
  to the wheelchair and adapted to individual needs. Beach wheelchairs are also
  requested for those whose chairs cannot deal with the gravel trail. Teaching
  modules will also be developed so that faculty can teach LAUSD special needs
  kids, and equipment to allow tactile teaching is requested (taxidermy birds
  and teaching skins that can be touched, necessary for the blind and for
  cognitive issues). These tools would allow a child or client to actually touch
  the feathers, wingspan, the head and feet of a bird (e.g., hawk, duck,
  pelican) and fully understand the subject.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  This proposal will eliminate barriers for the disabled in the existing SBWR
  setting and teaching curriculum. Teacher satisfaction is already measured
  during the school year program, and will now include special needs classes.
  The audiotour software allows for year-round usage data, and satisfaction data
  can be collected. For the classes and birding outings, SFVAS checks out
  equipment and tracks it, so that data can be reported out. The VA clinics are
  anxious to resume outings, and number about 600 individuals per year (with
  satisfaction), so that data will be collected. NLACRC also has significant
  numbers of clients who wish to use SBWR. SFVAS, which already offers birding
  trips, will add a data column to track disabled users. No data is collected
  about these agencies use of SBWR at present, but they are all expressing a
  keen interest in our activities, and therefore the data collected will be
  significant.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '75'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '3500'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  All of these efforts seek to make SPWR an experience for all citizens in our
  area, not just those who are able. Birding and ecology will be available to
  Special Needs as well as regular LAUSD Title 1 students; blind, deaf, and
  senior visitors will be served by the additional seating and improved
  curriculum. The ecology and conservation information will be available to all
  using the principles of Universal Design on the audiotour system. SFVAS will
  share our knowledge with all Chapters of Audubon all around Los Angeles, and
  will serve as a model for LA City Parks and Rec to roll out across the City.
  We will engage with the local VA to bring disabled Veterans to the SBWR and
  enable them to access the outdoors and birding. We are already reaching to
  Lion's Club, Braille Institute, Paralyzed Veteans Association, and AARP, to
  increase use. We will work long-term with these organizations to measure
  client satisfaction, attitude to the outdoors, and general mental health
  impacts.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  SFVAS: birding trips faculty; LAUSD school/homeschool instruction; inventory
  control of equipment; creating narrative, loading/reporting out data of audio
  tour system, tour subscription (beginning 2022), outreach to other Chapters.
  RCDSMM: Providing faculty for schools, including new teaching modules, and
  techniques for tactile education for low vision or low cognition students. LA
  City Parks & Rec: Receiving 8 benches, coordinating with SFVAS on concrete
  pours, installing benches and signage (developed by SFVAS), rolling out SBWR
  as model. NLACRC: publicizing birding opportunities for their 28,000 clients,
  assisting with outreach. VA Greater LA Healthcare System: Outreach to Veterans
  for individual birding outings, assisting with group outings to SBWR once
  COVID restrictions are lifted.
Which of LA2050â€™s resources will be of the most value to you?: >-
  Capacity-building and training,Other:: We believe that all citizens of LA have
  the ability and right to enjoy nature, birding and the outdoors and with just
  a few enhancements the concept of "disability" will not be a barrier.
