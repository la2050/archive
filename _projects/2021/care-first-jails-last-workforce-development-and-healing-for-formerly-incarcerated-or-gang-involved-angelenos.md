  Care First, Jails Last: Workforce Development and Healing for Formerly
  Incarcerated or Gang Involved Angelenos
project_summary: >-
  Homeboy Industries seeks to change the way the world views, treats, and judges
  the most marginalized and demonized – formerly gang involved and incarcerated
  men, women, and youth. Our core program, the 18-month reentry program, is at
  the heart of our work, and delivers comprehensive wrap around services and job
  training through a trauma informed, healing focused lens. At Homeboy, those
  who are formerly gang involved or previously incarcerated, regardless of
  background, can get the help needed to find the best version of themselves.

What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  LA County is home to the nation’s largest jail system; each year, over 163,000
  individuals pass through and 45,000 people are paroled. When systems-involved
  Angelenos return to their communities, they face a barrier-steeped environment
  preventing successful reentry, fueling recidivism, and impacting gang
  involvement. COVID-19 has also led to significant entry-level job loss and
  financial difficulties after more than one million jobs evaporated from LA
  County at the onset of the pandemic. Homeboy welcomes those who have no other
  options. Our clients have undiagnosed mental health issues including
  depression, anxiety, PTSD, and mood disorders. Many have histories of intimate
  partner violence and sexual abuse and ALL have experienced neglect, violence,
  trauma, and abject poverty. As the majority of our clients have never held a
  job nor completed any formal training and less than half have graduated from
  high school, finding financial stability through employment is even more
  difficult.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Homeboy is the largest and preeminent gang rehabilitation and reentry program
  in the world. For 33+ years, we have offered an “exit ramp” for those stuck in
  a cycle of violence and incarceration, helping them develop the strength and
  skills to transform their lives. Homeboy serves people who other agencies will
  not serve. We are known, in our community, as the go-to resource for
  gang-involved and formerly incarcerated people seeking sanctuary and a
  community of hope, compassion, kinship, and an opportunity to change.
  Individuals come through our doors on their own, and we have a strong
  word-of-mouth referral network, demonstrating how deeply rooted Homeboy’s
  programming is in our community. Our core program is a paid, therapeutic
  18-month reentry program that offers wraparound supportive services designed
  to heal formerly incarcerated or gang-involved individuals and provide
  education and employment opportunities that lead to stability and
  self-sufficiency. Each year, we support 300 men, women, and youth seeking to
  address the complex issues of gang involvement, recidivism, unemployment, and
  complex trauma through comprehensive wraparound services. Within the 18-month
  reentry program, we provide income, therapeutic services, education, and
  employment through a community of acceptance and growth. At the center of the
  model is a set of social enterprises, where clients learn essential jobs
  skills, while working in vibrant, economically viable social enterprise
  businesses.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  At intake, Homeboy collects data on our trainees throughout their
  participation in the program. We have a payroll system and a client management
  system where we cross tabulate job and program variables. We track job data
  such as length of time of employment, average hours worked, wage rate and
  growth, scheduling, and retention. We have developed a Work Maturity
  instrument to track learning on the job and employee engagement as well as
  potential for mobility. Employment Development Plans are written in the first
  three months of employment and re-visited quarterly. In 2020 we had the
  following results in our workforce development program for formerly
  gang-involved and incarcerated individuals: 476 received occupational skills
  and work readiness training 205 received basic adult education College
  readiness and support services were extended to 74 clients 10 received a Solar
  professional certification and a job in the industry 154 participants secured
  a job as a result of our services.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '4400'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '17600'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  We are on the verge of establishing a new paradigm in LA County – Care First,
  Jails Last – that will set a precedent for what is possible when we
  acknowledge the fundamental dignity and worth of communities that have
  frequent contact with the criminal justice system. Our theory of change for
  the successful reentry of offenders has long differed from existing methods
  because it is anchored in kinship, seeing and serving the whole person, and
  building relationships via those with lived experience as part of the healing
  process. Homeboy’s impact is most clearly seen in the transformation of people
  like Keith, who arrived after his parole officer recommended the program. He
  says of Homeboy, "I've had time to evolve…I've done things I never thought I
  could achieve in my life. I've been working with [one of our social
  enterprises] for two months. I like that I get to interact with different
  individuals from all over the world that come inside the store…I enjoy telling
  my story to them."
