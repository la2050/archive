title: Little Angels Project Help Program
project_summary: >-
  Our HELP Mobile Clinic not only responds to the needs of disaster victims, but
  to help those under served and homeless communities and folks impacted by the
  pandemic. For many the comfort, love and companionship provided by a pet is
  helping them cope with isolation, fear, maintain sobriety, and connect to
  society. Pets are family and no one should have to give up a family member. By
  providing free and low cost veterinary care, financial aid, and supplies we
  were able to help animals remain healthy and stay with their owners.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South LA
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Our helping homeless, seniors and under served communities has a direct impact
  on our shelter system intake and euthanasia and on that same population caring
  for themselves. For the elderly, they will often neglect their own care to
  provide for their pets. For homeless, many will not seek out assistance
  because it might require giving up their pets. Our program provides wellness
  for their pets but we have also teamed with Adult Protective Services to care
  for animals that then allows those people to seek out care they need. By
  keeping the animals healthy, we prevent owner surrender to our already
  overcrowded and under funded shelters. This takes the burden off of their
  having to find rescues to take in and pay for care, or for the agency to get
  care just to get that animal re-adopted. We have collaborated with numerous
  organizations to provide resources for food, litter, medicine and other
  necessities that allow the humans to have funds towards their own well being.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Prevention of surrender has a direct impact to the shelter euthanasia numbers.
  Taking care of animals for pet owners before they make that decision keep them
  with their families and removes the care impact from rescues that would then
  shoulder that financial burden to save the life. On average the cost is $70
  per pet to keep them with their owner. The Covid-19 pandemic crisis has put
  significant strain on people’s finances and LAP Help has been providing
  financial aid to pet owners who may have fallen on hard times. We are handling
  this need both in providing payments for care directly to providers or in our
  own clinic, as we are doing monthly outreach events with a team of
  organizations who have partnered with us for mobile clinics to give care and
  prevent surrender. The medical intervention and care being given ranges from
  dental work and surgery to spay / neuter and vaccination. Our goal is do do
  more outreach in communities that are not getting these resources and it is
  beneficial to both the population and the city. For people who have pets as
  companionship or to protect them in challenging areas, they might not have the
  funds to properly care for those pets. They get ill and then they surrender
  them. They love them, but economics forces them to make decisions they don't
  want to make. Helping when problems are small prevent them from becoming huge.
  Our goal is to be a zero kill city, often the shelters take in animals in such
  bad shape they have no choice.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Patient is evaluated for medical need (dental, wound care, surgery), cost of
  care / surgery is estimated. Client completes a financial need form as to
  ability to pay and must consent to take the animal back rather than be
  surrendered to a rescue or shelter. We are also working with other area vets
  to provide supportive funds and care to owners who want to keep their animals.
  All statistics are kept on what care was given and approximate cost. Many
  organizations are offering low cost or free spay neuter, but presently only
  two organizations are offering other services. This leaves a very wide gap in
  the community. We measure our success by the number of animals we treat each
  year with advanced surgery and/or care that the rescue organization or pet
  owner cannot afford to provide. The result is the animals should be remaining
  with their owners once care is administered, versus being surrendered to a
  rescue or shelter.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1500'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': ''
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  • Of the dogs entering shelters, approximately 48% are adopted and 20% are
  euthanized • Of the cats entering shelters, approximately 50% are adopted and
  27% are euthanized Returning a pet to a rescue or surrendering to a shelter
  can be devastating to the animal physically and emotionally. Many shut down,
  stop eating, become combative, and by not engaging people lose the opportunity
  to be adopted once there. Working together as a humane community we can reduce
  one aspect of the reason shelters have to kill for space. Your funds will fix
  health issues that are perfectly treatable and help drive down the euthanasia
  rates. By our providing surgery and hospitalization to medically needy animals
  at low to no cost to the owners , we estimate that in our area of Los Angeles
  County we can save more lives It will keep beloved pets with their owners
  where they are loved and wanted and that companionship has a positive impact
  on our population.
