title: Creating Equity and Access Through the Arts for Students along the LA River
project_summary: >-
  As an education partner for the comprehensive revitalization plan for
  communities along the LA River, Turnaround Arts: California will launch
  partnerships with two schools to support them in boldly re-designing their
  approach to teaching & learning with the arts at the center. Through
  professional development, coaching, planning & financial support, we will
  build the capacity of teachers & principals to leverage the arts to create
  safe, inclusive, & engaging learning environments where all students have the
  opportunity to thrive & succeed.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
  - >-
    Other:: LA River Project is focused in South and Southeast LA but our work
    supports schools across the county of LA
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Communities along the LA River are disproportionately impacted by poverty and
  racial inequity. Lower socioeconomic status translates to other disadvantages
  including little to no access to arts and culture and under-resourced schools.
  LA County data shows that schools with a larger share of students of color
  offer less and lower quality arts instruction. Quantity and quality are also
  lower in schools with larger percentages of students enrolled in free and
  reduced price meals and schools with larger percentages of English learners.
  This is an issue of basic equity. While there is a clear connection between
  arts education and positive outcomes - including increased student engagement,
  sense of connection, academic achievement, attendance and graduation rates,
  and more - low income and students of color are routinely denied access to
  high quality arts education.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  TACA is serving as the education partner of the LA River revitalization
  project, a comprehensive plan to support nearby communities. We launched
  partnerships with four Southeast LA schools in 2018 with a commitment to
  expand to ten over a five year period. During the 21/22 school year we will
  launch partnerships with two additional schools. Along with an intensive
  onboarding process, we will provide: Arts Integration Coaching - We partner
  with P.S. ARTS to provide ongoing hands-on technical support at each school to
  help with implementation of school-wide arts goals, such as helping teachers
  design lessons that integrate arts into core subjects. Principal Coaching -
  One-on-one coaching helps principals build their leadership skills in and
  through the arts. Artistic Residencies and Community Engagement Projects -
  TACA will match each school with partner arts organizations to provide two
  hands-on artistic residency experiences for students during the school year,
  underwritten by TACA. This may include theatre with the Actor’s Gang or poetry
  with Get Lit: Words Ignite. In addition to exposing students to new artistic
  mediums, these residencies also build the capacity of teachers to integrate
  these art forms into curriculum. Funding also supports projects to engage
  families and boost school culture, such as Family Art Nights. Convenings with
  Statewide Network - We bring our schools from across CA together regularly for
  planning, peer exchange, and professional development.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Our eval tools including surveys, arts logs, and mid-year and year-end reports
  gather extensive qualitative and quantitative data. We track and have seen
  significant impact in 4 key areas: 1. Teachers have increased capacity to
  integrate the arts into classroom instruction to provide multiple, culturally
  and linguistically responsive entry points for learning. 2. Principals,
  teachers and other school staff share a clear vision and model collaborative
  leadership. 3. School culture and climate is improved and embraces an equity
  and growth mindset, supports risk-taking, collaboration, and empathy, and
  honors student voice and agency. 4. Family and community members are engaged
  as participants, advocates, volunteers, and equitable partners in learning. We
  also see improvements in English Language Arts and math proficiency, as well
  as a decrease in suspension and chronic absenteeism rates. We are currently
  exploring and piloting the measurement of more student-centered impacts.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1550'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '15000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  TACA’s innovative approach leverages a collaborative model for expanded
  impact. Through our partnerships with arts and education organizations in LA
  County we are supporting and complementing their work while also bringing
  together a diverse set of expertise to provide holistic solutions to the
  complex and interwoven social issues impacting the school communities along
  the LA River. In communities that have historically been denied access to
  resources and who have faced trauma, the arts are an effective tool to build
  connections across teachers and students from different backgrounds, and
  create an equitable and inclusive environment where students feel seen,
  celebrated, and supported. We empower teachers to take risks and create spaces
  that nurture innovative, critical 21st century thinkers who will be better
  prepared for the ever-changing job market and economy. Through the arts, we
  envision vibrant school environments where all students can thrive and
  succeed.
