project_summary: >-
  Crayon Collection has donated over 20 million crayons into vulnerable schools
  along with access to free Art Education lesson plans.Created by professional
  artists and using crayons as the main tool, these lesson plans teach
  vulnerable students STEM, literacy and social emotional learning connections
  through engaging art projects. With your support, Crayon Collection will add
  14 new lesson plans, translate all lesson plans into Spanish and Chinese and
  provide the materials for volunteers to make crayon donations to an additional
  5,000 students.

  - Central LA
  - East LA

  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Over 700,000 students attend Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), 80%
  (est. 560,000) of which are eligible for the Free and Reduced Lunch Program
  and are classified as coming from ‘low-income’ families. Currently, only 40%
  of these students have access to art programs while well-served schools report
  60% of students having access. “A growing body of evidence suggests that at
  virtually every stage of life, the arts can foster openness to novelty,
  encourage connections to people, places, things, and concepts, and promote the
  ability to take multiple perspectives, among other positive outcomes (National
  Endowment for the Arts, 2011)”. This makes art a powerful, but often missing,
  tool for supporting vulnerable students in the classroom, especially students
  from communities who face exacerbated stress and trauma in their daily lives.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  The National Endowment for the Arts reports that “a family’s low
  social-economic status (SES) can be a significant risk factor for delayed or
  maladaptive social-emotional development. In the evidence reviewed, the arts
  were linked with positive impacts for children from low-SES families.” Crayon
  Collection is committed to bringing art access to students in traditionally
  vulnerable communities. Our Crayon Recycling program is an easy to implement
  solution that helps to close funding gaps Title 1 schools and Head Start
  centers face that prevent them from providing students with the materials they
  need to create art. Utilizing community volunteers of all ages, we are able to
  redirect thousands of crayons that would have otherwise been thrown away into
  the hands of students who, in many cases, have never had crayons of their own.
  Our commitment to connecting donors with schools within 5 miles of the
  donation site ensures that our volunteers are supporting their neighbors
  directly, strengthening their community connection. We provide students with
  art lessons created by professional artists exhibited in major museums, such
  as the LACMA, MoMA and the Whitney Museum. Through these lesson plans we use
  art as a tool to encourage students to collaborate and support their peers,
  embrace new ideas and process their emotions. We reinforce STEM and literacy
  standards to support students academically, helping them reach potential goals
  that break cycles of inequity.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Crayon Collection tracks impact for this project based on the number of
  crayons recycled, number of vulnerable students served, volunteers, lesson
  plan views and social-emotional learning of the students served. To track
  changes in SEL, Crayon Collection utilizes teacher surveys to determine how
  our programs changed students' confidence, participation and interactions with
  others in the classroom. Crayons Recycled: 20,000,000 + Students Served:
  30,000 + per year Volunteers: 550 Lesson Plan Clicks: 6,000 per year
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '5000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '6000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Through our work, we are providing materials to help make Los Angeles a place
  where residents are encouraged and empowered to engage with others. Currently,
  only 40% of students who qualify for the free-reduced lunch program in Los
  Angeles county have access to art programming while their well-served
  counterparts have 60% access. Our goal is to close this gap and, concurrently,
  to close gaps in academic achievement and social-emotional growth. Our Crayon
  Recycling and Art Education programs inspire residents of all ages to
  volunteer their time to support students from their communities. Volunteerism,
  diversity, and social-emotional health are at the core of the work we do. We
  work daily to inspire a commitment to these values in schools, companies and
  individuals across Los Angeles. We want to build a future where residents
  support their neighbors, have the tools to seek out and process new
  perspectives and take an active role in building a better, more connected Los
  Angeles.
