  Re-Entry Growth Collective Initiative is a collaborative training program for
  re-entry that provides a database for small service businesses to source

  springboard for employment or entrepreneurship by teaching a skill set and
  business basics to those seeking re-entering society.

project_video: ''
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Re-Entry Growth Collective Initiative (REGCI) aims to tackle two problems,
  recidivism and small business scalability. Although African Americans and
  Hispanics only represent 32% of the population, they make up 56% of the
  incarcerated population. About 650,000 people are released from prison
  annually in the U.S., and about two-thirds of those are re-incarcerated within
  three years. According to the Center for American Progress, the black
  unemployment rate has been consistently twice that of the white unemployment
  rate from 1972-2019, and incarceration is a major barrier for many to get
  permanent and good-paying work. On the business front, small companies
  interested in bidding for contracts at the city, county, or state level have
  problems being able to scale and meet the demand of government contracts. This
  makes it harder for them to grow, harder for them to increase their bottom
  line and take advantage of the benefits and programs the Los Angeles
  municipality has to offer.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Re-Entry Growth Collective Initiative creates support structures to prevent
  recidivism and enable these men and women to find dignity in work and
  financial agency. Structures include: partnering with small businesses to
  provide skill-based education, creating job fairs, offering lessons in
  entrepreneurship, and partnering with other similar organizations to provide
  psychological and community support. The grant will also help address the
  economics of small businesses being able to scale by creating a database of
  skilled service providers. REGCI will offer job fairs, both live and virtual,
  where re-entry candidates can speak to small business owners in a large range
  of service fields. Then, once matched, the candidate will attend skill
  training sessions with those business owners for a specified number of days
  either at the job site or at a city college or community center. Once the
  candidate has successfully completed the training, they are entered into the
  database where they can be found by any of the business owners either
  participating or paying into the program. Since business owners will be
  interacting with the re-entry candidates, they will be able to witness the
  quality of their developing craftsmanship and also be able to connect with
  them personally. This not only will help remove the barrier of fear on part of
  the business owners, but also help the re-entry candidates bridge the gap and
  develop soft skills as well as salable ones to rebuild their lives.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  We intend to develop an expandable database and measure our systems and
  behavior change along with organizational, financial and partnership
  development processes. Direct impact – 120 small businesses by providing 250
  trained returning citizens (re-entry program participants) as candidates for
  employment. Indirect Impact – we will develop systems for matching small
  businesses with employees using database developed which will potentially
  impact over 500 businesses and 1,000 returning citizens as the database is
  expanded.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '370'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1500'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Re-Entry Growth Collective Initiative will help formerly incarcerated
  individuals re-enter society by offering educational programs and support

  unemployment rates while also positioning small businesses so that they have
  the ability and opportunity to scale.
