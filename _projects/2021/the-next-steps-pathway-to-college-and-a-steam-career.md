title: 'The Next Steps: Pathway to College and a STEAM Career'
project_summary: >-
  Through our interactive and engaging educational workshops, we teach parents
  "how to" truly help their children plan for higher education. Our goal is to
  educate parents and how they can help their children achieve their full
  potential by graduating from college and pursuing a rewarding career in STEAM.
  Our education program is uniquely positioned to make Los Angeles a better
  place for all since we focus on teaching parents and students how to make
  college graduation a reality for students in low-income and underserved
  communities.

'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Applying a proven model or solution to a new issue or sector (e.g., using a
  job recruiting software or strategy to match clients to supportive housing
  sites, applying demonstrated strategies from advocating for college
  affordability to advocating for housing affordability and homelessness, etc.)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Only 30 percent of the Los Angeles County residents have a bachelor’s degree
  or higher. Over 31 percent of high school graduates across Los Angeles County
  do not enroll in college nor pursue a higher education degree. Over 25 plus
  percent of the students enrolled in college drop out during the first and
  second year due to the lack of preparation academically and financially. Over
  25 percent of the students are not proficient in math and do not meet the math
  standards in the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments. 90 percent of parents
  in Los Angeles County do not have a college fund or are financially prepared
  to support the high cost of education. Many high schools in Los Angeles County
  only have one College and Career Counselor per every 3,000 students. Parents
  and students in low-income and underserved communities in Los Angeles County
  do not receive the necessary guidance to learn about the many financial aid
  resources available through scholarships and FAFSA.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  What makes our program different and innovative is that we take a holistic
  approach to the whole child that also involves the father, the mother, and the
  child. Our family education program supports and nurtures all areas of
  children’s development and learning–from social-emotional and cognitive skills
  to literacy, math, and science understanding. With the support of this grant,
  we will focus on two key areas that we feel will contribute to a significant
  increase in the number of residents who would obtain a bachelor’s degree or
  higher during the period of the grant and beyond: During the grant period of
  one year, we will present our series of workshops “College Bound and STEAM
  Career Awareness” to Middle and High Schools in low-income and underserved
  communities throughout Los Angeles County where there is a high percentage of
  disengaged youth and high suspension and expulsion rates. During our
  workshops, we will provide parents and students with the knowledge necessary
  to support their children to be academically and financially prepared to
  enroll and graduate from college. The Next Step: Pathway to College and a
  STEAM Career: A selected number of parents and students in Middle School 8th
  Grade and High Schools, who participate and complete the series of workshops
  presented will meet with our College and Career Coaches/Advisors to design a
  custom-designed a strategic plan to graduate with a bachelor's degree or
  higher and a career in STEAM.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Parents who have attended our workshops appreciate the quality and interactive
  nature of our workshops. We have consistently received very positive feedback.
  These are some of the benefits that residents of Los Angeles County are
  experiencing as a result of participating in our parent workshops: a) Parents
  and students are better informed as to what is required to be admitted at a
  university. Furthermore, parents and students are taking the necessary steps
  to meet the academic challenges and high cost of higher education. b) Parents
  have learned to use technology effectively to communicate with the school and
  to be more engaged in the children's education. c) Parents have observed a
  significant improvement in their children's behavior and academic performance.
  Our innovative program is composed of two key areas that will ensure success:
  a) Parent and student college and STEAM Career education. b) One-on-one
  written strategic plan for College and a STEAM Career.

Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Over the one-year grant period, we will present our College Bound and STEAM
  Career Awareness workshops at Middle and High schools located in low-income
  and underserved communities of Los Angeles County. Our program will provide
  parents and students with the knowledge to be better prepared to graduate from
  high school, enroll in college/university and pursue a higher education career
  in STEAM. Our interactive workshops use technology to teach parents and
  students how to research the different colleges and universities options,
  admission requirements, research careers opportunities, apply for FAFSA and
  scholarships, and research job compensation opportunities. We will also
  provide one-on-one college and career planning to a selected group of parents
  with students in 8th grade and in High School to prepare a written strategic
  plan "The Next Steps: Pathway to College and a STEAM Career" to help define
  the path to attend and graduate with a bachelor's degree or higher.

  resulting in a higher number of students graduating from High School,
  enrolling, and graduating from Colleges and Universities. Our interactive
  workshops use technology to teach parents and students how to research the
