project_video: ''
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  The literary and co-working world has a race problem. According to the 2019
  Diversity Baseline Survey by Lee and Low Books the publishing industry overall
  is 79% white. Additionally, out of nearly 4,000 co-working spaces across the
  country, only 56 are Black owned (Statista Research Department, 2020). With
  Inglewood’s population at roughly 50% Latinx and 44% African-American, there
  is a great need for a community-based, mission driven bookstore and co-working
  space. Last summer, I crowdfunded $83k in start-up funds to secure the lease
  and build out of the shop. I am currently a team of one working diligently to
  open, but with several unexpected construction barriers and delays, I am in
  need of additional funding to carry out the vision and hire local support.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  The Salt Eaters Bookshop is committed to community development. We dream of a
  co-working component to the shop with four desks each equipped with a desktop
  computer, writing materials, and printer access for local Black women, femme,
  or nonbinary writers, students, entrepreneurs, creatives, or organizers in
  need of an affirming co-working space. The funding from this grant will help
  support the technology and materials required for the desks as well as payroll
  for our first part-time employee to manage the co-working space and assist
  with bookkeeping.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  This is an early stage initiative that we are determined to launch this year.
  We will allow the community to define our success through qualitative research
  - questionnaires, interviews, and personal observations. We are excited to
  collect feedback and adjust the program as needed to better serve our
  community.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '9'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '300'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Black people in Los Angeles County represent roughly 8% of the population, but
  34% of the houseless community, many of them Black women, femmes, and members
  of the LGBTQ+ community, with many newly houseless from sudden changes in job
  status. Having access to an inspiring, affirming, and safe environment to
  complete project and work-related tasks can change the financial destinies of
  Black women, femmes, and nonbinary Angelenos who are a valuable part of our
  city. As mission-driven bookstore rooted in Black feminist theory and
  Womanism, we align with the liberation philosophy of the Combahee River
  Collective (1974 - 1980) that states “If Black women are free, it would mean
  that everyone else would have to be free since our freedom would necessitate
  the destruction of all the systems of oppression." Investing in the success of
  Black women, femmes, and nonbinary people in an investment in Los Angeles
  County as a whole.
