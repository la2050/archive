title: Downtown Crenshaw Rising
project_summary: >-
  Los Angeles’ Black community has a right to own its future. There is a
  national groundswell of financial support for Black community ownership of the
  40 Acre Crenshaw Mall. The people of Crenshaw have been organizing for a
  moment like this for decades. Securing this mall will provide a new model of
  economic development that uplifts instead of uproots the community. Our vision
  is literal community ownership that will include affordable housing, locally
  owned commercial space, a 6-acre park, and an arts and music center.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  We are in an unprecendented time with the national/international public
  conversation only recently highlighting the increasing wealth inequality and
  systemic anti-Black racism in this country. It is because of this historical
  moment that finally a project like Downtown Crenshaw Rising can flourish. We
  are bringing together the best practitioners to the center of one of America’s
  most rapidly changing Black communities, to establish a new paradigm of
  development, using proven principles. We are creating permanent affordability
  in the Crenshaw community with 3 core principles - Community-centered,
  Community-owned, and Community-wealth building (For us. By us.). Our model is
  literal community ownership. We are providing the community an opportunity to
  buy shares and literally own a piece of the project. Now is the time for our
  #40AcresandMall.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  We will sustain the mall’s existing community-serving businesses and have an
  intentional strategy to bring home the offices of community-serving and Black
  businesses. We will apply worker standards throughout (both in construction
  and in operation) and focus on local procurement to spread the wealth/keep the
  dollars circulating in the community. The redeveloped space will include: -
  Training facilities to prepare the next generation for 21st-century jobs and
  within the entertainment industry. We are advancing conversations with anchor
  educational institutions, members of local community colleges foundations, and
  LAUSD to create a pipeline program. - A for consumer-owned cooperative
  businesses. - Truly mixed-income housing that is mindful of the community’s
  current economic demographics. Market-rate units will “subsidize”
  homeownership opportunities for the very low-income (roughly 12-15% of current
  90008 residents can afford market-rate units) - A 6-acre central park, a
  “Commons” for cultural/entertainment events to showcase Black culture and
  community gatherings. - Space for two grocery stores (a home for SoLA Food
  Co-Op) - Urban garden, Hydroponic farming, and Year-around gardening - A
  commercial kitchen for culinary artists and catering chefs
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  This is a pilot program 100+ years in the making. With the Crenshaw mall, we
  have an opportunity to thrive and set a new degree of excellence to prepare
  the Crenshaw community for now and the future. We will define and measure
  success through community participation, regeneration of the neighborhood,
  affordable housing, access to green space, and through our programming that
  focuses on access to skilled jobs.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '30123'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '10004000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  The traditional model of “community development” at best provides select
  individuals or favored organizations an opportunity to sit at a table where
  ultimate control is maintained by a for-profit developer, whose primary
  purpose is their personal/investors profit. The client is the community and we
  are bringing the best developers in the world to execute a people-centered
  plan. With the land under the control of Downtown Crenshaw Rising, the
  developers work to execute the community’s vision and can be required to build
  in the interest of the people, not simply in the interest of the profits of
  investors. This is an opportunity to realize community ownership, economic
  justice, and cultural celebration, and can also be a moment to actualize
  sustainable development. We think in systems, not silos. A systems-wide
  approach can address the Crenshaw community’s exposure to environmental
  hazards, heat island impacts, food deserts, lack of access to green space, and
  community mobility.
