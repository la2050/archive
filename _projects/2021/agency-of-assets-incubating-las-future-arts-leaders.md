title: Agency of Assets – Incubating LA’s Future Arts Leaders
project_summary: >-
  ICA LA’s Agency of Assets program introduces youth to professions in the arts
  to foster a diverse and inspired arts workforce for tomorrow and shape the
  course of LA’s creative potential. Agency of Assets provides high school
  students from Downtown, East LA, and South LA paid summer jobs, workshops,
  excursions, and one-on-one consultation and mentoring. This seven-month
  diversity pipeline program engages local arts institutions, creative
  businesses, artists, community organizations, and the City of Los Angeles to
  serve 15 students each year.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - South LA
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Agency of Assets (AoA) addresses the lack of diversity in the arts, especially
  in leadership. People of color now comprise 69% of LA County’s population, but
  its largest cultural institutions do not yet reflect this reality. This
  disparity can be attributed in part to arts leaders not committing sufficient
  resources to enact systemic changes and narrow visions for our collective
  future. In a 2018 American Alliance of Museums study, Dr. Johnetta Cole
  explained, “The need for seeking and sustaining diversity has never been
  greater... All of our museums must boldly commit to rethinking what takes
  place in our museums, to whom our museums belong, and who the colleagues are
  who have the privilege of telling important stories.” The 2015 Mellon
  Foundation Art Museum Staff Demographic Survey found that people of color only
  hold 16% of museum leadership positions in the US and called for “diverse
  educational pipelines” to these positions to achieve “truly diverse staff and
  inclusive cultures.”
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Agency of Assets addresses the lack of diversity in the arts by shifting the
  opportunity disparity for local youth today and incubating a diverse and
  inspired arts workforce for tomorrow. The program empowers underserved youth
  through: - Personal Agency and Community Empowerment: AoA is offered at a
  critical and formative period of young people’s development to recognize and
  grow their capacity as creative leaders, civic stakeholders, and community
  advocates. - Important professional skills: As their first real-world
  experience in the creative sector, students develop essential work skills,
  including: using software/hardware, verbal and written communication,
  interpersonal skills, teamwork, office management, and workplace attire. -
  Understanding of the arts sector: Art projects, direct encounters with arts
  leaders, and immersive professional experiences give participants an
  understanding and appreciation for the range of arts organizations that make
  up the cultural sector--museums, commercial galleries, artist-run spaces, and
  studios, as well as the businesses that support them--and introduces them to
  the professional roles in creative development, production, conservation,
  communications, publishing, fundraising, relationship management, and
  administration. - Financial literacy: Students, all of whom come from LMI
  households, receive training to develop fiscal survival skills, such as how to
  exercise good judgment about earning, spending, investing, and saving.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  "I always think about my time with AoA and the Ball-Nogues Studio. It was
  there that I found out that architecture is where I belong." - Angel Simental
  (2019) studies architecture at Santa Monica College, and founded a chapter of
  the National Organization of Minority Architecture Students. Total number of
  internship placements: 31 = 11 students (2017), 9 (2018), and 11 (2019). Total
  number of host sites: 17 Following our 3-year pilot period, AoA is already
  making an impact. 100% of AoA’s 13 high school seniors are now attending
  university (54%) or community college (36%). Of the 54% already working on art
  career paths, 18% still work at their AoA site. ICA LA will continue
  collecting qualitative and quantitative data on college attendance, employment
  status, and alumni retention. AoA will deepen its student/alumni engagement,
  expand its partnership network, build bridges to extant diversity pipelines,
  and hire a program evaluation consultant.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '200'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '30000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  The success of Agency of Assets will play an integral and significant role in
  creating a vibrant, equitable, accessible, and inclusive arts industry in Los
  Angeles County that truly reflects and aligns with the diverse populations it
  serves. As a member of the City of Los Angeles’ Invest in Youth Coalition, our
  goal is for alumni to pursue and complete academic careers and attain
  professional and economic mobility, leading to greater potential for gainful,
  steady employment, financial independence, and healthy families and
  communities. By entering and committing to the arts workforce, AoA alumni will
  be leaders in the cultural sector who will ensure that it remain diverse and
  inclusive for many generations to come. By diversifying the creative labor
  force, arts organizations will support the work of those who have been
  marginalized in the past, tell the stories of diverse communities, and commit
  to structural change that will make these institutions truly equitable.
