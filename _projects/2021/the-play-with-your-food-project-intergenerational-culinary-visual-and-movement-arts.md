  The Play with Your Food Project: Intergenerational Culinary, Visual and
  Movement Arts
project_summary: >-
  The connections and joy fostered through the preparation and sharing of food
  span across time and culture; RuckusRoots and FEAST aim to honor this
  tradition in The Play with Your Food Project, which strives to increase
  physical and social wellbeing in underrepresented Los Angeles communities.
  This holistic program combines healthy food access and education with dynamic
  arts experiences for food insecure families, providing free produce (from
  local farmers’ markets), healthy cooking classes and interdisciplinary arts
  workshops for youth!

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - South LA
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Our program seeks to address a lack of physical and social wellbeing in
  low-income neighborhoods of Los Angeles, caused by a range of interconnected
  factors. Poor nutrition, unhealthy eating habits, and social isolation are the
  leading contributors to diet-related diseases, including diabetes, high
  cholesterol, and heart disease. While these issues impact an overwhelming
  number of Americans today, families in under-resourced neighborhoods are
  impacted the most. Low-income communities in Los Angeles also face a lack of
  cultural opportunities, which play an important role in fostering social
  connection and inclusion. Studies show that people with decreased access to
  arts experiences are less likely to volunteer or to be civically engaged.
  Conversely, low-income neighborhoods with cultural resources have 14% fewer
  cases of child abuse and neglect, and 18% less serious crime than low-income
  neighborhoods without these resources. Source: Culture and Social Wellbeing in
  New York City, 2017
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  The Play with Your Food Project is an intergenerational culinary, visual and
  movement arts experience for South and East Angelenos. The project is
  comprised of a food-focused program for adults based on FEAST’s existing
  Wellness Program: food education, nutrition information, recipes, cooking
  demonstrations, free access to fresh, whole foods through a weekly grocery
  scholarship, and support through peer-to-peer sharing circles designed to
  uncover the underlying causes of current eating habits and create steps
  forward on the path towards a healthier life. Simultaneously, RuckusRoots will
  offer interdisciplinary art classes for youth that will serve two purposes 1)
  provide childcare so that parents or caretakers can freely and consistently
  attend the adult food classes, and 2) provide cultural enrichment and
  education to foster creativity and the mind-body connection for children who
  would otherwise not have access to such programing. Classes will incorporate
  various forms of movement and visual arts, including a mindfulness practice at
  the beginning of each lesson (meditation, breathing and mind-body connection).
  Pre-pandemic programs took place in schools, hospitals and other community
  settings throughout L.A. Our pandemic-responsive version of this program
  includes contactless food and art supply delivery and/or pick-ups paired with
  virtual, online classes for both adults and youth. We will continue in this
  format until it is safe to resume in-person offerings.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Previous versions of this program have been evaluated through pre and post
  testing of participants, yielding the following results: 2020 RuckusRoots
  participants reported a 64% increase in feelings of community connection and a
  73% increase in feeling creatively inspired. 2019 RuckusRoots youth art
  programs resulted in 67% improvement in drawing and painting techniques and
  50% improvement in civic engagement methods. 88% of parents/teachers believe
  our programs lay the foundation for youth to become effective change-makers.
  In 2020, 61% of FEAST families reported they were eating healthier during the
  pandemic compared to prior. A similar county-wide survey by USC indicated that
  only 28% of households reported the same outcomes. By program-end, 90% of
  graduates report confidence in their ability to cook recipes, eat healthy
  meals on a budget, and understand nutrition labels. Participants reported
  greater life satisfaction, feelings of worthiness and positive attitudes
  toward self.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '225'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '375'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  RuckusRoots and FEAST share a vision of Los Angeles that is healthy, equitable
  and resilient; we see art and food as essential ingredients in this “recipe.”
  Creating opportunities for families to engage with cultural experiences
  centered on food, creativity and togetherness will help build a shared sense
  of connection, belonging and strengthen feelings of community cohesion. Our
  intended impact is to reduce instances of hunger in the families we serve,
  while increasing healthy eating habits and feelings of community identity and
  social wellbeing. These impacts are achievable based on previous results
  reported by RuckusRoots and FEAST.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  RuckusRoots and FEAST have been collaborating since 2019, and have
  successfully implemented two programs combining culinary and visual arts. This
  program would build on these existing relationships and our past experiences
  to ensure a successful program and achievement of desired outcomes.
  RuckusRoots has over 10 years experience bringing collaborative arts
  experiences to under-resourced populations in Los Angeles, and our role in
  this program will be to design, implement and evaluate the holistic arts
  program for youth. FEAST will design, implement and evaluate the food-based
  piece of the program, including supplying free groceries to food insecure
  families, and the online or in-person healthy cooking classes.
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?: >-
  Access to the LA2050 community,Communications support,Capacity-building and
  training,Strategy assistance and implementation,Volunteer recruitment
