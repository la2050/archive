title: 'Virtual YouthCare, a Memory and Respite Care Program'
project_summary: >-
  Virtual YouthCare is an intergenerational respite and memory care program. For
  one hour, twice a week, student-senior pairs play games, participate in
  artistic activities, and deliver the research-backed Brain Boot Camp to help
  address cognitive decline - all in a virtual setting. Our program aims to help
  family caregivers reduce stress, address social isolation for persons with
  dementia (PWDs), and prepare students for careers in aging.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  There are 6.2 million people in America with Alzheimer’s Disease, and over
  160,000 live in Los Angeles. There are over 11 million unpaid caregivers in
  America, and as many as half a million in LA alone. Caring for someone living
  with Alzheimer’s or dementia can lead to financial, emotional, and physical
  difficulties, therefore leading to other health problems. More than 40% of
  these family caregivers of people with dementia develop depression, a rate
  much higher than seen in non-dementia caregivers. On top of this, there are
  not enough students entering fields of aging to fulfill the workforce needs
  that the rising aging population requires. Since the beginning of the COVID-19
  pandemic, the already common issue of social isolation that older adults face
  has been exacerbated. Older adults have experienced a disruption in their
  routines and an inability to meet and connect with loved ones. This affects
  both persons with dementia and their caregivers.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  YouthCare, an intergenerational respite care program that partners trained
  student volunteers with older adults who have early-to-mid stage dementia,
  addresses these issues of depression in caregivers, social isolation in older
  adults, and workforce development in students. Volunteers meet with PWDs for 3
  hours, twice a week to engage in memory care activities. YouthCare was set to
  launch 3/9/20 but was postponed due to COVID. Last fall, we successfully
  transitioned it to a virtual setting and continued to serve families from the
  safety of their homes. Virtual YouthCare maintains the program structure of
  in-home YouthCare, with several adaptations to better meet the needs of our
  participants. The sessions were reduced to 1 hour, twice a week to account for
  the likelihood of lower attention spans of older adults when interacting via
  Zoom. Student volunteers meet caregivers once a week to discuss the progress
  through the BrainBootCamp curriculum, developed by UCLA Longevity Center to
  stimulate concentration and memory. This model is a win-win-win for
  caregivers, students, and PWDs. By giving caregivers a break, YouthCare
  improves their quality of life and empowers them to provide better care for
  their loved ones. By providing students with volunteer experience, YouthCare
  inspires them to join the fight against AD and increases interest in fields of
  aging. By providing PWDs with a consistent friendly face, YouthCare fights
  social isolation and brings light back into their lives.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Virtual YouthCare’s success will be defined by its ability to reach its
  ultimate objective of decreasing the prevalence of depression in caregivers of
  PWDs in LA who use this program by 10% after participating in one program
  cycle. We administer a pre- and post-program survey to determine if
  participants have successfully achieved the selected metrics. By monitoring
  levels of depression, we are able to quantify the individual and aggregate
  impact Virtual YouthCare has made on the participating caregivers. Our
  volunteers track the PWDs’ progress through the program and make qualitative
  observations regarding PWD improvement and engagement. Our staff also monitors
  student satisfaction with their volunteer experience and integrates their
  feedback into improving the program. With over 80% student satisfaction and
  over 80% of families returning to participate, we recognize that Virtual
  YouthCare meets our goals of activating students in aging and alleviating the
  burden of caregiving.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '200'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '2400'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  For our Fall 2020 cycle of Virtual YouthCare, 83% of the student volunteers
  who responded were satisfied with the program. In addition, 85% of the
  families returned to participate in the current Spring 2021 cycle. We are
  already seeing students who are more interested in Alzheimer’s awareness and
  families who feel engaged and supported. If Virtual YouthCare continues to be
  successful, we will see a decrease in the rates of depression, stress, and/or
  anxiety in caregivers of those living with dementia. Caregivers will be
  healthier and better able to care for themselves and others. Older adults will
  have formed intergenerational bonds and be able to age in place for longer.
  Students will have increased interest in careers in aging, bolstering the
  aging workforce in LA and California. Overall, we will have a healthier,
  happier, more engaged community and will have made LA a better place to live.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  The USC School of Gerontology provides a pool of student volunteers. Their
  professors also serve as advisors for YouthCare. We collaborated with the UCLA
  Longevity Center to create a memory care program that can be delivered by our
  student volunteers. Alzheimer’s Los Angeles acts as a referral partner and
  helps train our students on cultural diversity in the dementia community. The
  National Center on Elder Abuse help train our students on elder abuse and
  neglection prevention HFC acts as a promotional and referral partner. They
  also help train our students on brain health using their AlzU courses.
  UsAgainstAlzheimer’s serves as our nonprofit’s larger partner organization and
  helps us find funds for cost subsidies. The USC Family Caregiver Support
  Center is our main referral partner.
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?: >-
