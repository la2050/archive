title: Staying Strong
project_summary: >-
  YES’s Staying Strong program ensures that the youth in our charge maintain the
  positive attitudes, behaviors, and connections that they develop while living
  in one of our homelike shelters. Our approach goes beyond providing an entry
  point for homeless individuals. Our five-year commitment at the time of intake
  ensures that the youth we serve can still turn to us after they have made the
  transition from YES housing. Staying Strong extends our work into the
  community so that future challenges do not become long-term crises.

project_video: ''
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Now estimated at 65,000, LA’s homeless population is projected to grow,
  particularly due to the acute challenges of the pandemic. This crisis impacts
  not only the unhoused individuals who wrestle with survival on a daily basis,
  but our entire community. For youth, whose ranks among the unhoused rose by
  19% between 2019 and 2020, the problem of homelessness is one they could face
  for years to come. The system offers few solutions for youth, and as with the
  adult system, where points of entry are not matched adequately with thoughtful
  exit strategies, the LA continuum of care fails to meet the challenges faced
  by youth whose homelessness too often reflects an acute lack of permanent
  connections. Agencies addressing the youth homelessness problem must focus on
  those connections by recognizing that positive youth development includes the
  establishment of strong and supportive relationships.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  YES’s Staying Strong program was designed to end the cycle of homelessness for
  the individual youth we serve. When a youth enters one of our supportive
  shelters, they arrive with histories of trauma and few, if any, positive
  connections. We immediately address their needs in key areas—mental health,
  education, employment/income, life skills—and as our case management staff
  works with the youth, a trust is established that allows the youth to reframe
  their pasts and re-imagine their futures. They envision themselves as college
  material for the first time in their lives. Or they learn to believe that
  their most passionate interests can be parlayed into a living-wage job. They
  also begin to interact with others in the community who can help them realize
  their goals for adult self-sufficiency. These positive connections—with YES
  staff and with individuals/agencies in the community—are essential to
  sustaining the healthy trajectories that are begun while in shelter, and YES’s
  Staying Strong program guarantees those connections will be cultivated. Our
  commitment to each youth is for 5 years—most often, 1-2 years in shelter and
  2-3 years in the community—and because of that commitment, we are able to work
  with youth as they confront the challenges that young adults often face. By
  sticking with them through these early years of their independence, we prevent
  challenges from becoming crises. We prevent the youth we serve today from
  becoming the adult homeless of tomorrow.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  We measure impact through youth-directed Individualized Service Plans that are
  introduced at intake and then guide programming through the articulation and
  revisiting of weekly SMART goals in five key areas: education,
  employment/income, life skills, mental health, and permanency. We’ve witnessed
  success as youth obtain their high school diploma or GED and then go on to a
  2- or 4-year institution, often the first in their family to do so. We’ve
  witnessed success as youth complete paid internships, in the process honing
  employable skills they didn’t know they had. We’ve seen youth save thousands
  of dollars to create the nest-egg that will help them through unknown future
  challenges. We’ve watched as youth redefine relationships with family members
  who were previously unable to provide emotional support. But these
  developments must be fortified through ongoing, substantive support, and
  Staying Strong’s long-term structure is essential to realizing lasting
  impacts.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '100'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '400'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Every homeless youth who does not later experience adult homelessness
  represents a better future for LA County, and YES’s intended impact is to
  reduce homeless recidivism, one youth at a time. Our programming approach is
  individualized, and the impact of our work is witnessed in individual growth
  and ultimate self-sufficiency. For the youth who benefit from our 5-year
  commitment and the Staying Strong program that sets us apart from other
  agencies’ work, the short-term impact will be a positive sense of the future
  as they work with their case management team to address mental health issues,
  identify and realize educational and employment goals, and learn and practice
  the types of life skills that result in everyday independence and
  self-sufficiency. In the long term, those immediate impacts will lead to
  fulfilling lives free of crisis and supported by individuals and resources
  that support realistic goals.
