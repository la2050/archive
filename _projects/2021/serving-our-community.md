title: Serving Our Community
project_summary: >-
  "Serving Our Community" provides healthy, nutritious, and delicious meals to
  at-risk people affected by the COVID-19 pandemic by re-employing laid-off
  hotel and event center culinary professionals in good union jobs with benefits
  to prepare and package food for delivery. Since May 2020 we have brought back
  to work more than 1,100 people and fed more than 3.3 million meals to nearly
  10,000 home-bound seniors, low income families, people experiencing
  homelessness, survivors of domestic violence or human trafficking.

What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  The spread of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (“COVID-19”) has profoundly
  disrupted social and economic life throughout the world. These losses and
  costs are not equally distributed. The effects of the virus have been
  concentrated in economically disadvantaged and minority communities, and in
  industries where these individuals work. In 2019, 1 out of every 8.5 County
  residents were employed in the travel, tourism & hospitality industry, which
  was all but completely shut down because of the pandemic, leaving hundreds of
  thousands out of work. The pandemic has also made providing services to the
  most vulnerable communities, such as those affected by food insecurity a far
  greater challenge, with a spike in need at the same time as decreases in
  supply of human resources able to gather to meet demand.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  In March 2020, HTA and UNITE HERE Local 11 launched "Serving Our Community,"
  (SOC) in collaboration with shuttered hotels and event centers to reopen their
  industrial kitchens and re-employ laid-off union members, representing LA's
  finest culinary staff to produce safe, healthy and delicious meals for our
  most vulnerable during the pandemic. SOC partners with the City of LA Dep of
  Aging, LA County WDACS, LAHSA, and others to provide and deliver meals to
  those who do not otherwise have access to food. (i.e. homebound seniors and
  shelters for the homeless and/or survivors of domestic violence and human
  trafficking). As HTA and its partner hotels have extensive experience in
  banquet, cafeteria, and event catering, with SOC we are able to produce
  thousands of high-quality meals daily. Using our employer partners' industrial
  kitchens which comply with federal, state, and county health protocols,
  including, but not limited to, physical distancing, disinfection, and contact
  tracing. HTA offers a holistic solution encompassing every aspect of SOC, from
  training to HR, ordering, food preparation, packaging, delivery, and
  accounting/reporting oversight. The Local 11 members preparing meals are
  protected by collective bargaining agreements with living wages, comprehensive
  health/dental care, defined-benefit pensions and continuous professional
  development training. So far, we have provided over 3.3 million meals, nearly
  10,000 people, and employed 1,100+ people.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  We are measuring the program's impact not only with the numbers of meals
  served and the good union jobs that the program creates, but also from
  testimonials from participants in the program, both recipients of meals and
  workers who have a job thanks to the program.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '95'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '300'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  During these challenging times, as the pandemic remains a high threat
  throughout Los Angeles County, those most vulnerable in our communities not
  only continue to be unemployed or underemployed, but also will most likely be
  the last to bounce back from the recession. As these people struggle to
  survive and make ends meet, they shouldn’t have to decide do they pay the last
  little bit of money to their landlord to cover rent or do they use for
  basic/essential necessities for themselves and their family such as buying
  groceries and putting food on their tables. Accordingly, with support from the
  My LA2050 Grants Challenge, we can make a difference in the lives of 95
  families in great need throughout Los Angeles so that they don't have to make
  that impossibly hard decision and can weather this storm and get back on their
  feet.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  Food will be cooked and packaged by the employees at Pomona College, Westin
  Bonaventure Hotel & Suites, JW Marriott Los Angeles LA Live, Levy Restaurants
  at the LA Convention Center, Sheraton Grand Los Angeles and The Beverly
  Hilton, who are members of Unite Here Local 11. HTA will oversee and
  coordinate the project including training of employees,sourcing packaging,
  coordination of delivery, and accounting/reporting oversight.
