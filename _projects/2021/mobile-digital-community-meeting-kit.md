title: Mobile Digital Community Meeting Kit
project_summary: >-
  Our Mobile Digital Community Meeting Kit will help bridge the "digital divide"
  in low-income, immigrant, and primarily BIPOC neighborhoods that prevents
  stakeholders from engaging in community planning and improvement projects. We
  will provide supported, COVID-safe access to digital meetings, surveys, and
  other community-wide interactions using Meeting Kit laptops, tablets, and WiFi
  hotspots. We will also offer general digital literacy resources to help people
  more broadly connect to technology and information.

project_video: ''
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - South LA
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  In 2020, consistent internet access became even more essential. But too many
  people who live, learn, and work in LANI neighborhoods struggle to access
  technology, which makes engaging them in planning and improvement projects
  that will impact their daily lives more challenging. Some conditions that
  cause this "digital divide" include the expense of a laptop, tablet and/or
  internet service; language barriers; not having email or social media
  accounts; and concerns about internet security and privacy. These challenges
  overlap with traditional barriers to equitable stakeholder involvement in
  underserved communities; limits on gathering in-person have added even more
  complication. A prior focus on digital access in rural areas has not addressed
  the same problem in low-income urban communities, which often are also
  majority BIPOC or immigrant communities. In an era of virtual meetings,
  telehealth, and online shopping for necessities, the digital divide poses
  significant equity issues.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Our pilot project is a Mobile Digital Community Meeting Kit. We will bring a
  "kit" of laptops, tablets, and Wi-Fi hotspots to a safe public location and
  help people access digital meetings, surveys, and other online interactions
  related to community improvement projects. The kit will also be utilized at
  on-site events, like project-specific charrettes, street fairs, or farmers'
  markets. With full funding, we will engage a new part-time staff member for
  the grant period to manage support at Digital Meetings and provide materials
  to help participants with general online literacy, like establishing email or
  social media accounts, ensuring internet safety and privacy, and accessing web
  translation tools. During the pandemic, virtual meetings and online data
  gathering have replaced the in-person outreach and engagement strategies we
  have long relied on, and post-pandemic, online community engagement will
  continue to be a component of neighborhood improvement projects; we have seen
  that virtual engagement can even increase community participation because it
  does not require transportation, childcare, or extended time away from work or
  family. To engage diverse stakeholders in the planning process during and
  post-COVID, the digital divide must be addressed so that senior citizens,
  non-English speakers, families with young children, people with disabilities,
  and others can fully engage in decisions about how the built environment in
  their neighborhoods can make life better.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  We will measure success by the number of neighborhoods and individuals we are
  able to engage with our Mobile Digital Community Kit. Metrics we will track
  include: number of individuals/businesses assisted to participate in an online
  meeting or survey using the Kit; number of neighborhood planning projects
  where stakeholders are engaged using the Kit; number of individuals who
  receive general online access resources (ie set up an email, set up a social
  media, learn about internet safety/privacy, learn how to use Zoom, learn how
  to view the internet in their preferred language); number of individuals
  engaged at community events (ie street fairs, right of way charrettes, etc)
  using the Kit. As a pilot, we will also be watching for opportunities to share
  the Kit with partners in municipal agencies and community-based organizations,
  and considering opportunities to scale application of the Kit in the future.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '200'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '180000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  If our pilot project is successful, L.A. County will have a scalable model for
  bridging the digital divide in neighborhoods that are low-income and/or home
  to primarily BIPOC and immigrant residents who have historically been left out
  of the community planning process. It is generally considered best practice
  for neighborhood-scale improvement projects to be initiated and led by local
  stakeholders; doing so fosters community pride, helps secure buy-in, and
  ensures that improvements are responsive to genuine community needs and
  desires. LANI's long-term goals for this program are to continue to meet
  people where they are, to support them in envisioning changes to their built
  environment, and to enhance their capacity to be advocates and decision makers
  for their own communities by improving their access to and understanding of
  the digital tools that are becoming increasingly integral to this work.
