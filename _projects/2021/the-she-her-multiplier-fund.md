title: The She/Her Multiplier Fund
project_summary: >-
  The “Shecession” and the pandemic have hurt women, especially women of color,
  more than any other demographic. Small businesses are the foundation of our
  economy. 40+% of brown and black businesses are not coming back and the
  majority are women. Capital to Female founded companies decreased by 27% in
  2020 while investment in men increased. We fix this by funding women
  investors. Female investors are twice as likely to invest in startups with one
  female founder, and more than three times more likely to invest in a female
  CEO.

project_video: ''
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Applying a proven model or solution to a new issue or sector (e.g., using a
  job recruiting software or strategy to match clients to supportive housing
  sites, applying demonstrated strategies from advocating for college
  affordability to advocating for housing affordability and homelessness, etc.)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Only 5% of assets under management in Venture Capital are managed by female
  owned firms; Latinx female Founding Partners represent .1% and Black represent
  .2%. And in 2020 only $3.2B of Venture Funding went to women-led startups. In
  contrast the Robinhood platform recently raised $3.4 Billion in one round.
  While legacy venture capital firms are implementing diversity initiatives, it
  will take generations to see a meaningful increase in female funders, which is
  why female funders that have taken action to start their own firms Female
  Funders especially women of color often do not have the resources or
  connections to endure the 18-24 month fundraising cycle. Female funders need
  catalytic capital in the same way that underrepresented founders need early
  investment capital. Early capital from investors provides a base from which to
  raise additional capital.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Female Funders are twice as likely to invest in startups and existing
  businesses with one female founder, and more than three times more likely to
  invest in a female CEO. And Female executives are more likely to hire diverse
  teams. The She/Her Multiplier Fund will activate a Donor Advised Fund to
  invest catalytic capital into Female Funders. Grant funding will be used to:
  1. create the DAF vehicle. The DAF allows tax-deductible donations to be
  pooled and deployed to female funders. 2. Provide a stipend to consultants
  involved with: Crafting the thesis of the fund Creating the Slate of Managers
  Designing the marketing collateral 3. Paying professional fees, legal,
  accounting, and platform 4. Providing ongoing management
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  We will track the DEI impact resulting from the investments in terms of DEI at
  the startups. Over time the Fund will be self-sustaining as it receives
  distributions from its investments into funds.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '20'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  In the short-term we will provide catalytic capital to female funders that are
  currently in the market raising funds and help propel them to the finish line.
  Over the one-year grant period, we will have established the infrastructure,
  raised at least $20million in tax-deductible donations, and allocated that
  capital to at least 10 female funders based in Los Angeles. We will track the
  DEI impact resulting from the investments in terms of DEI at the startups.
  Over time the Fund will be self-sustaining as it receives distributions from
  its investments into funds.
