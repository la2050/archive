title: 'Learning Together: Los Angeles Families Engage in STEM'
project_summary: >-
  PowerMyLearning’s programs and services provide access, opportunity and
  innovation to youth at critical engagement stages by exposing them to
  interactive STEM programs that they can engage in with their families.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - South LA
  - LAUSD (select only if you have a district-wide partnership or project)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Our STEM programming addresses a need that has been highlighted by the
  COVID-19 pandemic: schools need support with authentically partnering with
  families to ensure students successfully master STEM subjects. Families are
  now playing an outsized role in the learning process, and our focus on
  activating the exponential power that occurs when teachers, students, and
  families collaborate on the same learning goals is critical now more than
  ever.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  PowerMyLearning’s programs help families become more involved in students’
  learning through the following: 1. Online Educator Coaching: Our Professional
  Learning Specialists work one-on-one with STEM teachers to help them adopt
  innovative strategies to increase family engagement. 2. Online Family
  Workshops: Beginning in March 2020, our workshops fully transitioned online
  and are being delivered via Zoom. These workshops leverage technology to raise
  student achievement in STEM subjects by training families on how to access
  STEM digital activities available on PowerMyLearning Connect, our free K-12
  online education platform, and through our Family Engagement Toolkit:
  https://powermylearning.org/learn/resources/.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  This is an existing program that we have been offering since 2008. Our
  approach brings families into the learning process in an impactful way that
  results in improved student outcomes. PowerMyLearning determines impact
  through internal and external evaluations, analyzing state test scores and
  other publicly available data, as well as administering surveys. A meta-study
  completed by the Department of Education on family engagement found that,
  during primary school years, the level of family engagement had a bigger
  impact on student achievement than did the quality of the child’s school. In a
  recent study, PowerMyLearning schools outperformed comparison schools in math
  proficiency by an average of 8.6 percentage points. After participating in our
  programs, 88% of students in partner schools say they know how to find
  resources to help them learn things they do not understand in math, and 95% of
  parents in partner schools become more confident that they can help their
  child learn.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '400'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '8500'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  We hope to see a transformation in education – one where effective family
  engagement is a standard for the education system. A report published by the
  RAND Corporation in 2020 titled, “COVID-19 and the state of K-12 Schools”
  found that 57% of teachers and principals surveyed rated engaging with
  families as a somewhat higher or much higher priority when looking ahead to
  the new school year. Principals and schools do not yet have the necessary
  supports and resources to do this effectively. PowerMyLearning can play a key
  role in providing the tools and training teachers need in order to effectively
  engage families in the learning process, especially in STEM subjects. With
  strong communication and trust in place, all families can provide unique
  insight to teachers, help students set and work toward goals, and support
  ongoing STEM learning and exploration at home.
