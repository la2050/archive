What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Musical Theatre is a uniquely American art form, but one that has been
  dominated by white males. On Broadway alone, 95 percent of all plays and
  musicals were both written and directed by Caucasian artists (Playbill.com).
  The recent success of Hamilton demonstrates the interest in using this art
  form involving People of Color. NMI is invested in moving musical theatre
  beyond its Eurocentric origins to include more diverse writers and audiences.
  Few in the Los Angeles BIPOC community may have had the opportunity to be
  trained in musical theatre, and to bring their culturally relevant music and
  stories to the stage. For the past decade, NMI has been launching programs to
  diversify our pool of writers (Asian American initiatives in 2006/2016; Latinx
  initiative in 2007, the Deaf Community in 2016/2019; Veterans in 2020/21).
  NMI’s BIPOC project addresses the lack of diversity in musical theater by
  developing programming that promotes musical theatre’s evolution beyond
  traditional roots.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  This grant will support funding for our Los Angeles based programming to
  elevate the voices and create short musical theater pieces featuring artists
  and members of the BIPOC community. Our project nurturing BIPOC artists will
  begin in the Fall of 2021. NMI will develop the professional musical theatre
  skills of these Los Angeles-based artists. Working with the BIPOC community,
  we will identify local writers and musicians and invite them to participate in
  a six-month NMI mentorship program which culminates in presentations of their
  finished musical theatre pieces. NMI’s professional, proven curriculum
  prepares writers and musicians to bring their stories to the musical theatre
  stage. Individuals will participate in a mentor-based workshop encouraging
  them to express their own unique ideas and world-views brought to life through
  the artform of musical theatre. Each participant will complete their own
  musical theater piece, which will be promoted, presented in a public forum,
  and then showcased online. NMI’s project will serve approximately 17 writers,
  plus an additional 60-70 actors, directors, music directors, and stage
  managers. Our goal is to develop the scripts and songs of a diverse community
  of writers, actors and musicians. All of our artists and crew receive
  compensation for their participation in this project.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  NMI has a strong history of success, which is evidenced by the organization’s
  40 years of accomplishments. We have developed over 400 musicals, working with
  such producers as the Celebration Theatre, Deaf West Theatre, Latino Theatre
  Company, Northern Sky Theatre, and the University of California Irvine's
  prestigious Department of Drama. We are active members of the National
  Alliance for Musical Theatre; a national network of musical theatre producers
  and theatre companies. We have worked with established writers such as Jeff
  Marx (Avenue Q), Mark Hollmann (Urinetown), Hunter Foster (Bonnie & Clyde),
  Stiles & Drewe (Mary Poppins), and Placido Domingo, Jr. (Soul of Darkness). We
  will define the success of our BIPOC project by 1) the successful development
  of a library of musical theatrical pieces created by artists reflecting their
  own unique worldview and, 2) the successful promotion of each piece, performed
  in a public forum and; 3) the final showcase of each piece presented online.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '85'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '4000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  A 2019 Community Survey found that Los Angeles County's racial makeup is over
  48% Latinx and nearly 8% African American;.yet over 90% of musical theater in
  the United States is created and produced by white males. Since musical
  theatre is not at all representative of Los Angeles’ rich and diverse
  community, NMI’s vision is to elevate the authentic voices of our community
  and tell their stories. Our BIPOC initiative aims to offer People of Color the
  opportunity to share their experiences through a unique art form that they may
  not have experienced. The success of our project will be reflected by the
  thousands of individuals who view these musical theater pieces online. Los
  Angeles will be different because these distinctly unique stories will be
  professionally developed, promoted and showcased.
