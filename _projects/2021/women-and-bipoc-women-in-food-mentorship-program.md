In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Businesses owned by women, BIPOC and immigrants are being disproportionately
  impacted by the economic realities of the pandemic, according to a National
  Bureau of Economic Research report. An “unprecedented” 25 percent drop in the
  number of women business owners could hurt gender equality in the restaurant
  industry and beyond, the report notes. Independent restaurants are the ones
  that truly add diversity to LA's food scene. Over the last 9 months, we’ve
  witnessed the total inaction on the part of national leadership to provide
  meaningful support for independent restaurants, coupled with the outsized
  negative impact that COVID-19 has had on women and BIPOC women in the
  workforce. Regarding Her was created to not only drive business for
  participating restaurants during a historically slow period, but also provide
  a grants and mentorship programming, directly to women and BIPOC women
  operators who are struggling to keep their businesses afloat.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  By combining mentorship and leadership skills development, Regarding Her's
  mentoring program connects women and BIPOC women in the food industry and
  helps them to develop their leadership potential and build specific skills to
  be successful leaders and restaurant owners. Mentees will participate in a
  6-month mentorship program that will address the following areas: (1) Gender
  income inequality. (Females make about 20 percent less than their male
  counterparts); (2) Work-family life balance; (3) Gender bias and stereotypes;
  (4) Career advancement barriers; (5) Harassment; and (6) Workforce
  Development. There is an opportunity for program mentees to receive a
  designated grant to help future their success. Once mentees complete the
  program, they will have access to industry-focused resources, virtual events
  that celebrate, connect and promote women in food and beverage, including
  being a part of an annual restaurant festival, 10 Days Re:Her.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Mentorship not only opens the door to opportunities that would have never
  before been accessible, it can also propagate change on a broader scale at the
  industry level for women and BIPOC women. The only way you can get that skill
  set in a kitchen or as a business owner is by having a mentor, a chef, or a
  teacher teach you how to do it. The evaluation process for the Women and BIPOC
  Women in Food Mentorship Program will entail goal tracking intended outcomes,
  conducting participant surveys and measuring the impact on retention with
  women owned business by conducting quarterly interviews.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '225'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '5000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Our vision is fueled by the responsibility we feel to recognize and uplift all
  members of our industry, especially those whose contributions have been
  historically minimized and/or erased. Historically, individuals from these
  marginalized communities typically have a harder time accessing capital, often
  resulting in having to “boot strap” a business with personal debt or loans
  from friends and family. The success of Regarding Her's Women and BIPOC Women
  in Food Mentorship Program will help dismantle systemic barriers and racial
  inequities that prevent many women from moving into positions of leadership
  and/or ownership in the food and beverage industry and throughout Los Angeles
  County.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  Regarding Her is thrilled to collaborate with some of the top women and BIPOC
  women owned restaurants in Los Angeles County. This collaboration and specific
  role of each strategic partner (All Day Baby, Hotville Chicken, Guelaguetza,
  Botanica Restaurant & Market, Gasolina Cafe, Socalo/Border Grill, Guerrilla
  Tacos, Love & Salt and Rossoblu) will bring the breadth of knowledge, advocacy
  and guidance that will spearhead the success of the Women and BIPOC Women in
  Food Mentorship Program. Each partner brings business acumen, front of the
  house and back of the house experience and leadership training.
