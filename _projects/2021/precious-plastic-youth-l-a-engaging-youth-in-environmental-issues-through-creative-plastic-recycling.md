  Precious Plastic Youth L.A.- Engaging Youth in Environmental Issues Through
  Creative Plastic Recycling
project_summary: >-
  By bringing simple recycling machines and mobile workshops to schools, we can
  engage students in sustainability education and help them understand the
  process of recycling. Ultimately, spreading education amongst youth will grow
  a new generation active in the fight against climate change.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  With each new generation, plastic pollution becomes an ever increasing problem
  worldwide, with wide reaching impacts on wildlife, the ocean, and human health
  (1 in 3 fish caught by humans contains plastic that could've absorbed harmful
  chemicals like DDT's and PCB's). In LA County alone, 28 tons of solid waste
  are produced annually, while only around 10% of this waste is recycled. While
  youth often claim that they deeply care about the environment, recycling and
  sustainability are rarely, if ever, taught in the classroom. It's difficult
  for students to be introduced to concepts that they can't visibly see or
  interact with, that they feel doesn't directly affect them, which is where our
  machine comes in. By having a tangible, memorable experience with recycling
  and sustainability, they'll gain a more complete understanding of the problem,
  what they can do to fix it, and what they can do to preserve it.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  We plan on traveling to different schools weekly to hold educational events
  where students can learn about recycling their own plastic waste and gain the
  opportunity to turn waste into new functional products. Through a hands on,
  kid-friendly experience with the recycling process, students will be able to
  better understand the ramifications of their own waste. The machines can shred
  plastic waste into smaller pieces that can be easily melted and reshaped. The
  melted plastic can be shaped into bowls, and cups, wound into hats, or even
  used as filament for 3d printers. It can also fill small molds with plastic-
  anything that can be molded can be created, such as combs, small toys, key
  chains and earrings. The machine is relatively easy to transport which makes
  it perfect for traveling to different events, and additionally is easy to set
  up on site. These machines make plastic recycling easily understandable and
  can be readily operated by anyone, making them perfect for widespread usage
  and education. By operating the machines, students can both reduce the amount
  of plastic sent to landfills and gain experience in fighting against the
  pollution problem, along with gaining a better understanding of the process of
  recycling, and the necessity for sustainable prevention work. We will adhere
  to the LA County public health guidelines in every event, limiting group sizes
  to 12 students at a time,maintaining social distance outdoors, and abiding by
  strict disinfecting procedures.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  We plan on measuring the tangible impact (such as a decrease in plastic
  pollution) and cultural impact (a decrease in the consumption of plastic)
  through several methods: 1. Tabulating the decreased plastic waste in school
  or individual household - through surveys done BEFORE and AFTER participation
  in the workshop. 2. Weighing the amount of plastic waste recycled at the event
  3. Tracking the number of active student participants. 4. Tracking the number
  of schools that participated. 5. Record the number of schools that acquired
  precious plastic machines to continue their in school education/awareness. 6.
  Record the number of schools that have adopted and continued the project
  through clubs. While any measure of reduced plastics and ongoing recycling
  would be considered success, our overarching goal would be to do 100 events
  producing 10,000 up cycled products yearly and 50% decrease in plastic
  consumed by affected households.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '2000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '7680'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Our goal is to spread a greater understanding of sustainability, consistently
  partnering with a wide range of schools and educating students across LA
  County. Eventually we plan for expansion by having numerous mobile machines to
  travel to even more schools monthly, increasing our impact. Additionally, as
  part of our expansion, a permanent workshop would be created where the LA
  community could come to recycle their own plastic. Plastic products created
  from a permanent workshop with the more robust non-mobile machines would be
  larger and tougher, with a wide range of uses, e.g. tables, chairs, or even
  durable bricks that could be used to create shelters and donated to those in
  need With less plastic pollution, our community would be cleaner and safer for
  all of it's inhabitants, regardless of species. Additionally, widespread
  education would create daily change for the students and their families as
  they learned to implement sustainable practices and prevent new plastic waste.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  Precious Plastic LA is a registered 501c3 organization, and they are willing
  to support our cause. They've had a great success in organizing their own
  events and managing plastic machines, so the support that they would provide
  would be perfectly tailored to our project. They would be our advisor and
  consultant. The Sea monkey Project has provided successful mobile recycling
  and sustainability educational events to elementary students in schools all
  over Malaysia and have shared the blueprint of their success to us.
Which of LA2050â€™s resources will be of the most value to you?: >-
  Access to the LA2050 community,Hosting virtual events or gatherings,Strategy
  assistance and implementation,Volunteer recruitment
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.: 1. Precious Plastic L.A. 2. Sea Monkey Project 3. Harvard Westlake High School
Which metrics will you impact?:
  - Public arts and cultural events
  - Arts education
  - ' Enrollment in afterschool programs'
  - ' Proficiency in STEM'
Indicate any additional LA2050 goals your project will impact.:
  - LA is the best place to CREATE
  - ' LA is the healthiest place to LIVE'
