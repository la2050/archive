title: Emergency Food Partnership
project_summary: >-
  Venice Family Clinic and UCLA are combatting food insecurity in our community
  through the Emergency Food Partnership. Our program harnesses the talents of
  UCLA food service workers to create nutritious take-home meals for hundreds of
  people in need, which promotes health and economic stability for our most
  vulnerable patients while preserving employment during the pandemic. It
  combines access to healthy meals with evidence-based education that teaches
  participants about the value of using food as medicine to help them get well
  and stay well.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Westside
  - South Bay
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  More than half of low-income households across the Westside and South Bay
  struggle with food insecurity. Many people equate food insecurity with hunger,
  but the terms are not entirely synonymous. Food insecurity encompasses not
  having access to the quantity, quality, or variety of food needed for a
  healthy diet. Its costs are far-reaching: it increases the risk of chronic
  disease and can negatively impact mood and focus, impairing one’s ability to
  work and learn. Consequently, food insecurity perpetuates poverty and harms
  our community’s health. COVID-19 has intensified barriers families face in
  obtaining fresh and healthy food. Many people have lost jobs or hours, leading
  to tighter meal budgets. Others have become caretakers for children or ill
  family members, reducing their time and energy for grocery shopping and
  cooking. Low-income Angelenos—especially those at greatest risk of poor health
  outcomes—need access to programs that can provide affordable, healthy, and
  ready-made food.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Venice Family Clinic and UCLA are fighting food insecurity by connecting
  hundreds of households to free, nutritious meals. With only 10% of students
  returning to campus last fall, UCLA sought a way to keep its dining workers
  employed that would help the community at large. UCLA and our Clinic saw an
  innovative path forward together: the university could deploy its staff to
  make meals for patients in need and we could supply the ingredients. Through
  the Emergency Food Partnership, UCLA Dining prepares about 2,500 take-home
  meals every weekday for distribution at Clinic sites. Nutrition and flavor are
  front and center. Imagine a bed of Spanish rice topped with grilled chipotle
  chicken, colorful organic veggies, and fresh salsa. This is the standard for
  every meal. Distributions are powered by our health education staff and
  volunteers, who conduct sign-ins and hand out packages to patients on foot and
  in cars. Patients receive four meals for themselves and for each member of
  their household weekly. We are hopeful that COVID case rates will continue to
  fall, and that soon, adults will return to work and students to school. Our
  program, however, cannot realistically be maintained at its current level
  after UCLA resumes at capacity. We know the program improves the health of our
  most vulnerable patients based on their feedback and the actual changes we see
  in their lab work. For this reason, we are committed to sustaining a smaller,
  tailored version for our highest need patients.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  To date, the Partnership has distributed over 270,000 meals to 400 households.
  Patients have reported the program has made it easier to access healthy food
  in their neighborhoods, eat together with their families, and save income for
  other pressing needs. But our success is not just anecdotal: we have seen
  changes in our patients’ lab work, including improved blood sugar and iron
  levels. Goals over the project period for a new tailored program include: •
  Distribute 23,000 meals total to patients and their families. Staff will track
  meals using sign-in sheets. • Enroll 120 patients in classes focused on the
  value of food as medicine. Attendance logs and surveys will capture
  engagement. • Improve vital health markers: 45% of diabetic patients will
  improve their blood sugar and 60% of prenatal patients will reach normal iron
  levels. Physicians will order labs and monitor results. • Preserve jobs for
  dining workers through community service. UCLA will track employment in its HR
  system.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '480'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '4000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Our tailored program will provide nearly 500 meals weekly to patients who will
  benefit most from regular access to healthy food, including those with
  uncontrolled diabetes and expectant mothers, and their families. In addition,
  patient participants will engage in online group classes based on the theme of
  embracing food as medicine to treat disease and achieve wellness. They will
  learn how to make healthful dishes on their own, watch live demos conducted in
  our Teaching Kitchen, create grocery budgets, and more. Our program will serve
  as a novel model for how a community-university partnership can successfully
  and sustainably target food insecurity. It will make Los Angeles a better
  place to live by ensuring people in need not only have access to nutritious
  meals but also to education that helps them build key skills and better
  understand the role between food and wellness. Importantly, by targeting
  entire families, our program has the potential to build intergenerational
  health.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  Venice Family Clinic and UCLA have a legacy of partnership dating back to the
  1970s. Per our agreement for this project, UCLA Dining Services is responsible
  for managing activities related to food ordering, meal preparation, and
  delivery. Its team is also in charge of menu-setting and nutrition planning.
  Our Clinic is responsible for managing distributions, including aspects
  related to volunteer recruitment and training. Additionally, nutrition
  education activities and clinical care fall under the Clinic’s purview.
  Although each organization has its respective responsibilities, our
  collaboration is synergistic, motivated by a shared commitment to service.
  UCLA staff are not just behind the scenes: many stay on at distributions to
  help pass out meals to patients!
