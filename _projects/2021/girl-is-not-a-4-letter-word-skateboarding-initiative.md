title: Girl is NOT a 4 Letter Word Skateboarding Initiative
project_summary: >-
  Girl is NOT a 4 Letter Word is the go-to destination for any girl or womxn in
  skateboarding that wants to be heard, or just needs help or advice dealing
  with the “boys club”. GN4LW helps fund events for female skaters and donates
  products for girls who wish to skate but may not be able to afford to do so.
  We have an online website that promotes female and non-binary skaters & events
  daily, and we also work behind the scenes to encourage (and PUSH) large
  male-dominated skate companies to step up and support female riders.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Getting more girls and womxn skateboarding. That comes from having events,
  meet-ups, and getting more female and non-binary people together on
  skateboards as well as those who may not be able to afford the gear and
  creating an environment that feels safe when learning or skating at the
  skatepark. If this is not possible during the COVID timeline - we feel that
  virtual meetups via zoom have been a good way to have meet-ups and even
  discuss techniques and encourage skaters. Girls usually drop out of
  skateboarding in their late teens as they can not pursue a career as a skater
  - like boys can - due to lack of financial support. We feel that the more
  girls are out there skating, the more skate companies - and others will start
  changing that financial landscape. If you want to skate for fun, we love it -
  if you want to pursue it at the pro or Olympic level we feel that the support
  should be there for the women too.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  If COVID does not allow in-person strategies, we plan on continuing visual
  support through multiple social media channels, interviews on the website,
  donation of our "It's Not About Pretty" skateboard book to libraries and
  schools that can not afford them. IF ALLOWED we'd also add in - Monthly
  meet-ups and skill-building / learn to skate groups, events and contests. Also
  identifying and donating gear to communities where female and non-binary
  skaters live and play.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  We have been the co-chair, along with our fiscal sponsor, of the Venice Ladies
  Skate Jam for 4 years and each year more and more girls and womxn come out,
  take over Venice Skatepark, make new friends, and skate - our goal continues
  to be to have it grow every single year. While we are dealing with COVID we
  have shifted our focus to more social media representation and website
  coverage. A hardback book we self-published continues to show these young
  womxn that there are many other female skaters out there - they are not alone.
  Visual representation is key. We'd like to continue our interviews with these
  skaters on our website as we know from past web traffic - those interviews are
  a big source of inspiration. We also do collaborations and create products
  that give back financially to womxn in skate.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '900'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '5400'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  We will have more gender equality at community skateparks through Los Angeles
  County. Girls and womxn will feel safer and more confident going out to skate
  at these skateparks if there are more girls skating. By creating a larger
  network of female and non-binary skaters it assures the skaters that they can
  go skate and are not alone in a male-dominated atmosphere. This equals a
  thriving skate scene that is not all about the boys as it has been since the
  beginning.
