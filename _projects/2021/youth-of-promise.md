title: Youth of Promise
project_summary: >-
  There are two Pasadenas. The city has one of the largest wealth disparities in
  California, and this disparity traps communities in cycles of poverty,
  violence and incarceration. Flintridge Center works to break these cycles
  through the Youth of Promise program, an afterschool enrichment program that
  invest deeply in youth exposed to trauma and adverse childhood experiences. We
  know that when we provide care instead of punishment and opportunity instead
  of incarceration, youth will realize their full potential.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - San Gabriel Valley
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Pasadena ranks second in the largest income gap become richest and poorest
  households among California’s 50 largest cities. In 2019, Pasadena Unified
  School District identified over $10.1 million in long-term cuts. This
  disparity and depletion of resources acutely impacts Flintridge Center’s
  target community of Northwest Pasadena, where 35-50% of families live in
  poverty and youth disproportionately experience trauma and adverse childhood
  experiences (ACEs). The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated these inequities:
  Pasadena saw an 85% increase in gun violence in 2020, and a Flintridge Center
  survey indicated that 70% of families participating in the Youth of Promise
  (YOP) program lost income. A focus group with YOP youth participants revealed
  that 90% of youth see someone arrested weekly; 70% see drug use daily; and 50%
  witness a fight weekly. Without deep investment in youth exposed to trauma and
  ACEs, cycles of poverty, violence, and incarceration will be perpetuated in
  Pasadena.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  This grant will support Flintridge Center’s Youth of Promise (YOP) program, an
  afterschool enrichment program that breaks down barriers faced by youth
  exposed to trauma and adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). All youth receive
  individualized case management services that utilize an asset-based approach
  to goal planning and are responsive to youths’ unique needs. Core program
  elements include: mentoring, academic support, clinical mental health support,
  leadership development opportunities, community service experiences, life
  skills and family engagement activities that strengthen familial protective
  factors. The program is unique in its participant population of youth and
  families most impacted by Pasadena’s inequities and systems of poverty,
  violence and incarceration. The program specifically targets Pasadena youth at
  high-risk of justice involvement – as determined by: credit deficiency;
  failing grades; chronic truancy; or exposure to multiple ACEs including
  familial incarceration – and youth diverted to our services by the Pasadena
  Police Department in lieu of justice involvement. Through this grant, we will
  launch a stipend initiative for YOP participants in which youth receive modest
  financial compensation for each hour of program engagement. Beyond
  incentivizing engagement with program activities, stipends compensate youth
  for investing in themselves. Financial stipends are an evidence-based
  intervention that support positive social emotional outcomes for youth.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  YOP is modeled after the Eisenhower Quantum Opportunities Program (QOP), an
  evidenced-based framework that posits that a combination of educational
  support, service opportunities, youth development opportunities, and financial
  stipends will improve academic and socioemotional skills. While YOP has been
  in operation since 2015, financial stipends will be a new initiative made
  possible by this funding. Outcomes for the 2019-2020 school year include: •
  85% of youth did not enter or return to the justice system • 90% of youth
  decreased or did not demonstrate high-risk behavior, demonstrated by decreased
  discipline reports and noted changes in behavior. • 85% of youth participating
  for one year or more demonstrated improvements in interpersonal communication,
  conflict resolution and self-management. The new stipend initiative will be
  evaluated by measuring 2021-2022 outcomes against the above metrics and
  evaluating youth engagement and retention in program activities.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '100'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '500'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Exposure to trauma and adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) can cause severe
  or persistent harm, also known as toxic stress that disrupts brain development
  and positive self-identify. ACEs have a deep impact on violence victimization
  and perpetration, and community health (CDC-Kaiser). The Youth of Promise
  (YOP) program builds resilience in youth exposed to ACEs, while simultaneously
  building protective factors that create a safe and nurturing community. YOP
  provides pro-social alternatives to incarceration and pathways to opportunity
  that break cycles of poverty and violence, ultimately resulting in increased
  neighborhood safety, lowered prevalence of trauma, and lower crime rates. By
  establishing this impact in Pasadena, we advance equity in a uniquely
  disparate community of Los Angeles County. YOP provides a roadmap for a Los
  Angeles which invests in opportunity instead of incarceration, and in which
  all youth have equal access to a safe environment to discover, explore, and
  play.
