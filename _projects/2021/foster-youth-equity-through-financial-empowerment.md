title: Foster Youth Equity Through Financial Empowerment
project_summary: >-
  United Friends of the Children and TWINSPIRE are partnering to provide
  financial literacy workshops to 50 youth in Los Angeles County’s foster care
  system. Participants will gain valuable knowledge and economic opportunities
  to disrupt generational poverty. Led by former foster youth and financial
  expert, Demonte “Tray” Thompson, TAY foster youth (ages 16-24) will
  participate in cohort-based workshops designed to increase the financial
  health and stability of foster youth as they transition to college and
  adulthood.

project_video: ''
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Each year, youth in LA County’s foster care system emancipate into young
  adulthood ill prepared for life on their own. High school graduation rates are
  significantly lower than their non-foster peers (58% vs. 81.6%), only 3-7%
  will ever matriculate and earn a bachelor degree, and foster youth continue to
  be overrepresented in LA’s annual homeless counts. Additionally, the foster
  care system is racially biased against the Black community with Black youth
  making up just 7% of the overall youth population, yet 24% of youth in LA’s
  foster care system. This project seeks to increase the financial literacy and
  management skills of transition age foster youth (16-24) to immediately
  improve their educational and life situations. Studies have shown a better
  understanding of how and why to pay for training and education after high
  school increases the likelihood of degree completion, career fulfillment, and
  manageable debt (Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, 2017).
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  TWINSPIRE Financial Literacy Program will host a Financial Literacy workshop
  every two weeks over a week 2-month period. An initial Intake Survey will be
  used to understand the current needs of the students and tailor the material
  to meet them where they are. Target youth will be transition age foster youth
  in UFC’s education and housing programs. Each session we will include
  community builders, financial literacy curriculum and activities, and Q&A
  time. Participants who complete the entire workshop series will receive a $200
  “investment” stipend to use toward establishing financial stability (savings
  account, college tuition, work readiness, etc.) Workshop topic schedule
  includes: Session 1: Intake Survey and Review  Session 2: Budgeting  Session
  3: Credit Cards & Debt Management  Session 4: Credit Reports & Scores Session
  5: Identity Theft / Social-emotional goal setting Session 6: Workforce
  Development / Career Exploration  Session 7: One-on-One Sessions Session 8:
  Program Graduation UFC staff will be provided a two-day financial counseling
  training provided by TWINSPIRE. Staff members will receive an overview of
  personal financial literacy and management skills necessary for young adults
  to become self-sufficient. Staff members will integrate training components
  into current case management and workshops.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  This project will be an extension of UFC’s existing programs, Scholars
  (education-focused) and Pathways to Independence (transitional housing for TAY
  foster youth). UFC will leverage the financial expertise of TWINSPIRE to build
  the financial literacy and health of TAY foster youth as they pursue higher
  education and/or a stable life after experiencing homelessness. While outcomes
  for youth in UFC's programs are significantly higher than their foster peers,
  a comprehensive understanding of personal finances is currently not being
  provided by UFC. Outcomes measures will include: 1. 85% of youth will complete
  all workshop sessions 2. College-focused youth will have student loan
  repayment plans consisting of 8-10% of expected gross monthly income 3. 100%
  of program participants will have a personalized budget and spending plan 4.
  100% of program participants will receive credit score and report 5. 100% of
  UFC staff participants will increase their ability to financially counsel
  youth
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '50'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '580'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  In the long-term, this project will create stronger communities and
  neighborhoods throughout LA County by providing youth with the knowledge and
  skills needed to create generational wealth in the places and families where
  they live, work, and go to school. This will be achieved by increasing the
  financial independence and self-sufficiency of foster youth. Rather than
  suffering from the effects of poor money management or lack of financial
  advice, youth will be able to create balanced personal budgets and achieve
  their financial goals including establishing strong credit histories, opening
  checking and savings accounts, financing higher educational degrees, securing
  a livable wage job/career, and eventual homeownership. By building the blocks
  of financial stability, foster youth participants will transition from
  recipients of public assistance, to self-sufficient community members
  investing their time, talents, and resources back into their local economies,
  families, and neighborhoods.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  Twinspire is the collaborating partner for the project and will provide
  financial literacy workshop curriculum and facilitation. Tray Thompson, a
  founding member of Twinspire and former foster youth will facilitate group
  workshops. Tray brings a professional background in finance and lived
  experience that will benefit youth in UFC’s programs. United Friends will
  provide workshop space, free transportation to all program participants and/or
  technology (laptops and wifi) if conducted virtually, and logistics support.
