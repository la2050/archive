title: '100 Youth Democracy Leaders. 10,000 New Youth Voters.'
project_summary: >-
  The biggest obstacle to youth voting is not apathy; it’s voter registration.
  Seventy-five percent of 18-year-olds who were registered to vote turned out to
  vote in Los Angeles County in the 2020 general election. We empower high
  school students to be youth democracy leaders, organizing their peers to use
  existing laws that allow young people to preregister to vote beginning at age
  16.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
  - 'Other:: We work with students from all of these areas'
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  A 20% voter registration gap persists among young and older voters. This
  registration gap suppresses youth turnout. Our democracy needs young people to
  be involved. California has a variety of helpful laws to promote high school
  voter registration, yet our public agencies have done little to implement
  these laws. Our voter preregistration rate for 16 and 17-year-olds in Los
  Angeles County is just 10%. In LA County, 75% of 18-year-olds who were
  registered voted in the November 2020 general election. Scholarly research
  shows that increasing youth preregistration increases turnout. The lack of
  consistent funding, training, programs and policy disenfranchise LA youth. We
  believe young people are at the center of their own political empowerment. Our
  programs and initiatives create youth democracy leaders. They know they can
  vote and use their voices to create change in their communities.They know why
  democracy is important, and they know how to get their peers involved and
  voting.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Youth Democracy Leaders–LA (YDL-LA) provides a diverse group of high school
  students an opportunity to join a community of young people and lead their
  peers in improving LA County youth voter participation rates. Students learn
  valuable leadership skills, meet local leaders, gain experience in organizing,
  and collaborate on tactics for making change. This four-month program
  incorporates community-building exercises in which each student develops a
  “public narrative,” a practice of storytelling that connects their personal
  experiences to larger public issues facing Los Angeles. Students then
  participate in three learning modules consisting of one-hour long Zoom
  meetings as well as individual and collaborative projects. The modules cover
  the foundations of youth voter engagement, opportunities to improve youth
  voter registration policies, and organizing nonpartisan voter registration
  efforts. Each project provides students with opportunities to use a variety of
  methods to overcome challenges to youth voter participation. Participants also
  serve as role models to high school students across the County, encouraging
  them to promote voter registration in their schools and to support policies
  promoting youth voter registration. The program concludes when students
  organize and hold a voter registration drive for their high school. Through a
  collaboration with Student PIRGs, we will incorporate college students as
  mentors and ambassadors to high school students and their schools.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Our YDL-LA Program is in its inaugural run. We are measuring our impact in
  several different ways. We measure the number of young leaders we train, the
  number of drives they lead, and the number of students registered to vote
  through their efforts. We also measure changes in county-wide preregistration
  rates through reports generated by the California Secretary of State, and we
  measure overall registration rates and turnout rates among young voters with
  the aid of the LA County voter file. We know our approach works because we
  have been implementing similar programs for two years. Most of the students we
  train go on to hold voter registration drives. Nationwide, students who have
  gone through our programs (Future Voters Action Week (FVAW), High School Voter
  Registration Week (HSVRW), the 2020 Youth Fellowship, and online workshops).
  These efforts have led to hundreds of student-led drives in 35 states and more
  than 10,000 young people registering to vote.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '100'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '10000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Our work with teens will uplift LA County by increasing youth enfranchisement
  and engagement and will foster student leadership and activism within high
  schools, creating the leaders of tomorrow. During the grant period, we plan to
  train high school students in LA County, and they will lead at least 100 voter
  registration drives in LA County high schools, thus resulting in at least
  10,000 young people registering or preregistering to vote. Our main aim, in
  the long run, is not just the number of registrations, but to foster youth
  leadership that lasts a lifetime. We expect these efforts to amplify in the
  years to come as such participation becomes integrated as an activity in
  student life, such as prom or graduation. We believe that changing the culture
  of youth voting will result in systemic change, ensuring these efforts are
  sustainable without a high degree of outside organizing. Our 2020 report
  further details our efforts to uplift LA County:

Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  The Civics Center will collaborate with local Student PIRGs in our YDL-LA
  program, with an aim to integrate college students into high school voter
  registration efforts, creating opportunities for an “Adopt-a-High School”
  voter registration program for college students and building mentorships among
  youth activists. In the summer of 2021, college student leaders associated
  with the LA Student PIRG chapters at UCLA and USC will apply to participate as
  small group discussion leaders in the program, developing mentoring
  relationships and experience working with high school students across Los
  Angeles. The Student PIRGs’ New Voters Project has helped more than 2 million
  young people register to vote and created over 3 million personalized,
  peer-to-peer Get out the Vote contacts.
