title: Sparking Girls’ Interest in STEM
project_summary: >-
  DIY Girls provides hands-on STEM coding and electronics programs for girls of
  color in the Northeast San Fernando Valley that are designed to spark their
  interest in STEM fields and careers as well as support their self-confidence,
  curiosity and persistence. We do what we do in order to change the way girls
  perceive STEM careers. We believe that creating with tech builds the
  confidence needed to make anything possible. We want our DIY Girls to apply
  the technical skills they learn to projects they love so they know the future
  is theirs to make.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - San Fernando Valley
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  As tech products have become ubiquitous, whether the apps in our smartphones,
  the systems self-driving cars or the programs making advances in healthcare,
  and well-paying careers in STEM fields have multiplied, women -- especially
  women of color -- have not benefited equitably from this exponential growth.
  Women represent only 28% of overall employed scientists and engineers in the
  United States, and just 2% are Latinas. There is significant opportunity to
  right this unbalance as the U.S. expects to have 3.5 million vacancies in STEM
  jobs by 2025 and demand for workers is expected to grow faster than the
  overall labor market. And we know when to do so. This inequality begins early
  in the education pipeline and the greatest disparities are among girls of
  color. Nationally, only 15% of girls between 4th-8th grade demonstrate, or
  even express, interest in STEM. Solving this problem acts as a form of
  economic mobility, providing a direct path to personal growth and long-term
  prosperity.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Our hands-on and real-world STEM, coding and making programs are designed and
  proven to engage 5th- through 8th-grade girls. DIY Girls is the only
  organization providing a continuum of STEM curriculum exclusively to girls of
  color in the Northeast San Fernando Valley, and by introducing girls to STEM
  early, we are able to dramatically alter the trajectory of their education.
  Our two core programs are: Creative Electronics, an intensive 10-week
  after-school program for 5th-grade girls held at partnering elementary school
  sites. This program will engage 210 girls, sparking curiosity and exploration
  with technology by providing experiences that promote the development of
  technical skills, expression of creativity and confidence in their abilities.
  Instructors meet with participants for 2-hour sessions once per week in
  on-site classrooms. HustleNCode, which is tailored to develop students'
  interest in coding and computer science. We will partner with Urban TXT to
  implement HustleNCode, which has proven successful due to its simple and
  straight-forward presentation and foundation. While learning to build personal
  websites, middle school girls explore themes like college and career as they
  learn how to code. This highly engaging 10-week curriculum will be provided to
  144 girls, who will meet with instructors for 2 hours per week. If COVID
  protocols require, we can adjust to distance learning as we have since Spring
  2020, as detailed below.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  DIY Girls measures outcomes through regular pre- and post-surveys of
  participants, which have demonstrated consistent, remarkable success in
  supporting girls’ increased interest in and pursuit of STEM education and
  careers. Surveys of 5th-grade girls in pre-COVID programs found that 91% would
  like to participate in more activities related to science and engineering and
  97% felt comfortable using electronic tools to make new things. Fall 2020
  results during distance learning found 93% would be interested in taking an
  engineering and technology class and 76% believe they can help solve problems
  in their community with the skills they have. Pre-COVID surveys of middle
  school girls found 91% knew what a computer scientist does and 97% felt
  comfortable using computer programs to make things. Fall 2020 results found
  80% want to participate in more engineering and technology activities and 82%
  reported thinking about different ways to solve a problem to come up with the
  best solution.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '11'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '354'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Our vision for success is best illustrated by 4 girls from our first program
  at Telfair Elementary School in 2012. Lori, April, Marisol, and Maritza all
  developed lasting interest in STEM and the skills and knowledge to pursue
  their dreams. Participants as well in our high school Invent Girls program,
  they graduated in 2020. Lori attends UC Riverside, majoring in Environmental
  Engineering. April is a Mechanical Engineering major at CSUN. Marisol attends
  Brown University, majoring in Biomedical Engineering. And Maritza is at UCLA,
  majoring in Financial Actuarial. They embody our goal of increasing the number
  of women in the STEM workforce and prepared for STEM jobs by fostering girls’
  skills and competitiveness and finding new ways to help young girls create,
  build, and experience technology. In the near term, we seek to be a supportive
  community, providing mentors to supplement girls’ experiences and encourage
  their self-confidence, academic interests, and socio-emotional development.
