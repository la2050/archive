In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
  - LAUSD (select only if you have a district-wide partnership or project)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Applying a proven model or solution to a new issue or sector (e.g., using a
  job recruiting software or strategy to match clients to supportive housing
  sites, applying demonstrated strategies from advocating for college
  affordability to advocating for housing affordability and homelessness, etc.)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  In the last year, individuals and institutions have been grappling with our
  roles in American racism and racist institutions in new and long overdue ways.
  As a Classical Theatre company noted for Shakespeare and other Classical
  productions, new American plays, and as a nationally recognized provider of
  arts education, we believe that we must look to and genuinely engage with our
  history in order to make authentic progress. Through this adaptation of
  Trouble the Water, we hope to tell the story of Robert Smalls, and through
  telling that story to engage deeply with the realities of slavery, the Civil
  War, the Reconstruction era, and the beginnings of Jim Crow, alongside the
  ways these events continue to reverberate in the present day. We hope to
  reckon with this legacy and the real attempts to avoid authentically teaching
  this chapter of American history to young people and adults alike by
  rightfully placing Robert Smalls' story alongside the great American heroes.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Theatricum Botanicum seeks support to stage the full world premiere production
  of Trouble the Water by Ellen Geer, adapted from the novel by Rebecca Dwight
  Bruff and directed by Gerald C. Rivers. This original play will tell the story
  of Robert Smalls, from his dramatic seafaring escape from slavery right under
  the Confederate army’s noses, to his election and service in the House of
  Representatives, and his valiant yet ultimately thwarted attempts to stop the
  abhorrent rise of Jim Crow laws. Alongside a cast of ~17 multiethnic actors,
  Theatricum will collaborate with members of a local Gospel choir, Agape
  International Choir, as part of each performance, forming a total cast of
  25-30. In addition to Repertory performances, and student matinees through our
  School Days Field Trip program, the schedule will include a public Q&A with
  creative team and actors and a “pay what you can” performance. As we consider
  and re-consider our relationship to American history, we must also reevaluate
  what is included in the canon or considered “Classic.” We must present more
  Black histories - which is to say, American history - and lift these stories
  up alongside other iconic Americans. This production will powerfully speak to
  the history and present of race relations in the US and spark necessary
  conversations about racism. This production will also create ~40 paying jobs
  and create a pathway for union membership for up and coming actors and stage
  managers through our internship program.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Theatricum Botanicum has been one of the premier arts providers in Southern
  California for nearly 50 years, with a sterling reputation for professional
  theatre as well as private and school-based arts education. Our Repertory has
  been honored with NAACP, Backstage West, Ovation, LADCC, and other awards and
  nominations. Theatricum’s School Programs serve over 15,000 K-12 students and
  teachers yearly, are part of LA County Arts Commission’s arts education
  database and have been a recipient of the Arts Midwest Shakespeare in American
  Communities Grant for 15 cycles. We are a dynamic group of artist-educators
  whose artistic skill is accompanied by a passion for education, for the role
  of art in spurring social change, and for uplifting conversations that
  increase our ability to understand and support each other. We must truly
  reckon with American racism in history and at present to move forward
  together. We intend to contribute to that honest healing with this world
  premiere production.

Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Theatricum’s core values include building community by inviting a diverse
  populace to the table; brokering conversation and fostering understanding
  through art; and passing on this responsibility of inclusion to the next
  generation through robust education programs for all ages. Theatricum is
  committed to fighting against the silos of culture that threaten to separate
  the diverse communities of Los Angeles. We work towards these goals by
  continuing to broaden inclusion of audiences, artists, stories, and histories.
  We are committed to true diversity in gender, age, ethnicity, sexual
  orientation, and socio-economics being represented on our stages and
  throughout our educational programs. This production of Trouble the Water will
  put all of these values into practice, contributing meaningfully to the
  broader, vital Los Angeles cultural landscape. Success will be measured by
  audience and student participation numbers, the quality of the production, and
  by overall critical engagement.
