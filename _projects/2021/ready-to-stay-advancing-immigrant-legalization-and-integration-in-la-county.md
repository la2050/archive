title: 'Ready to Stay: Advancing Immigrant Legalization and Integration in LA County'
project_summary: >-
  For years CHIRLA has helped mixed-status immigrants navigate uncertainty and
  inequities caused by the immigration system. To prepare for policy changes
  that may create pathways to legalization, we will expand our community
  education and legal services to inform, legally advise, and empower immigrants
  in LA so they can live free from fear. CHIRLA co-chairs a national effort that
  is building a case management and legal infrastructure system to help
  immigrants stay in their community. This project will be our local effort
  called Ready to Stay LA.

  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  The current immigration system has devastating effects on the lives and mental
  health of immigrants who face constant fear of deportation and barriers to
  education, employment, and social services due to their legal status. An
  estimated 750,000 Lawful Permanent Residents and 886,000 undocumented
  immigrants live in LA County, with the majority from Mexico and Central
  America, while California has 118,000 essential workers with Deferred Action
  for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and 473,000 DACA-eligible people — all of whom
  need permanent solutions and will be affected by immigration reform. With
  fast-changing policy changes and recent state budget cuts to programs that
  assist immigrants with legal fees, there is an overwhelming need among
  low-income immigrants for in-language information, financial support for legal
  services, and legal advice to navigate options and obtain legalization. Older
  immigrants facing language and technology barriers especially need support
  with accessing resources.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  CHIRLA’s Ready to Stay LA project will expand our infrastructure to help
  immigrant workers, youth, and families in LA County adjust their legal status
  under immigration reform and other measures. Currently we are working to make
  this reform a reality by uplifting immigrant stories at the state and national
  level. At the local level, CHIRLA will use the power of community education,
  case management, and legal services to move immigrants into legal status so
  they can work, live, and thrive in their communities without fear. As a
  trusted resource, we have already seen increased demand for information and
  services in response to DACA’s reinstatement and the ban of the public charge
  rule. With recent legislative proposals to create pathways to legalization and
  citizenship for undocumented immigrants, DACA recipients, LPRs, Temporary
  Protected Status holders, and essential workers, CHIRLA anticipates a huge
  influx in requests for in-language resources and legal aid in the coming year
  to help immigrants understand policy changes and access the benefits of
  immigration reform. To meet this demand we will expand our capacity to provide
  services through a community-centered approach: hiring more staff to offer
  individualized assistance and legal consultations, addressing questions from
  the community and making referrals via our Immigrant Assistance Hotline and
  webinars, hosting educational workshops about available legal pathways, and
  building networks to support immigrants in need.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  CHIRLA measures our impact by the numbers of immigrants informed, engaged, and
  assisted, which we track on a daily basis. In 2020 we educated over 94,587
  individuals through 216 events and 214,200 viewers via Facebook Live on Know
  Your Rights and immigration policy changes, while our hotline assisted at
  least 3,000 callers per quarter with information about their eligibility for
  immigration programs and legal services referrals. When CHIRLA was selected to
  distribute state disaster relief to undocumented immigrants in LA and Orange
  County, our phone lines and website crashed with over a million hits with
  inquiries, highlighting both the need and our role as a trusted resource. As a
  Department of Justice-recognized organization since 2011, CHIRLA also provides
  direct legal representation to over 3,500 low-income immigrants statewide each
  year. Currently we offer 50-60 virtual consultations and a DACA clinic each
  week, which we will expand through this project to serve more immigrants.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '360000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '2011000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  In the short term, CHIRLA will connect thousands of immigrants in LA County to
  legal services, information, and resources to educate them about new
  immigration policies and changes, and to help them file applications to adjust
  or gain legal status, starting with over 47,000 community members from our
  base. Our long-term vision is to build on the infrastructure developed through
  this project to ensure healthier, more inclusive communities in LA County and
  beyond, where immigrants can live and seek social services, healthcare,
  education, and employment without fear of deportation and discrimination based
  on status. In addition to including immigrants in COVID-19 relief, ending
  detention and deportation, and advancing the welfare of immigrant workers,
  CHIRLA’s advocacy aims to open up legal migration and citizenship for 2.5
  million undocumented immigrants in California and 11 million nationwide.
  CHIRLA will also engage immigrants in civic and leadership opportunities to
  use their voices.
