title: A WOC-Owned Healing Space for Equitable & Sustainable Health on the Eastside
project_summary: >-
  Todo Verde, in collaboration with People’s Yoga, is opening a
  community-powered studio for wellness, learning, & production in East LA. Our
  studio will serve as an accessible space for culturally-relevant
  skills-sharing through the practice of yoga & healthy eating, & provide job
  opportunities as a site of production for Todo Verde’s plant-based packaged
  food goods. Featuring both virtual & in-person initiatives, our community
  center will host culinary demonstrations & yoga programs as tools to reclaim &
  reimagine community wellness & economy.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - East LA
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  In LA, low income communities of color have limited access to both healthy,
  nutritious food as well as well-resourced healthcare & alternative wellness.
  Lack of access to good food plagues neighborhoods throughout the Eastside of
  LA with preventable diseases that diminish quality of life & prematurely kill
  us with cancer, diabetes, & more. In addition to facing severe health
  disparities, our community also faces barriers to economic resources & have
  experienced a rise in mental health issues like depression & PTSD related to a
  volatile political climate. These problems aren't currently addressed with
  adequate financial or cultural resources. Todo Verde & People’s Yoga were
  founded by women of color from Eastside communities in response to intimate
  lived experience with the scope of these issues. Our work stems from the
  narratives that underlie the data: in 2015 only 53% of East LA residents lived
  in close proximity to a grocery store & 33% reported difficulty accessing
  healthcare.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Todo Verde’s work is to create lifestyle shifts within the Latinx community,
  guiding us towards enjoying healthier ingredients in a new way while enjoying
  recipes that we know & love. When our culturally-relevant plant-based dishes
  are introduced to new clients, we often hear them say “if I could eat this way
  everyday, I would go vegan!” This is the shift we are working to create
  through sharing affordable meals, accessible recipes & ancestral knowledge
  grounded in decolonizing foodways. Our culinary programs will address access
  to healthy food by facilitating hands-on cooking classes preparing nutritious
  recipes & hosting inclusive dialogues around food justice. These programs are
  designed to impact both everyday cooking & career development in the food
  industry. Our plant-based consumer packaged goods distribution will address
  access to healthy food & job opportunities in the community. Our initial
  product line includes 3 seasoning blends [carnitas, al pastor, tinga] for
  jackfruit, a popular plant-based meat alternative with low processing as
  compared to other highly processed meat alternatives on the market. Together,
  with People’s Yoga, we plan to create a community space in accordance with CDC
  guidelines. Similarly, all programming will be filmed from our studio until
  in-person classes can resume following CDC guidelines
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  We survey attendees to improve the learning process, teaching methodology, buy
  better equipment, offer new recipes, & design new offerings. Our attendees
  often share the process via social media & email, & work to make plant-based
  food & movement a regular part of life. We often hear verbal feedback from the
  community expressing impacts like cholesterol lowering or personal
  relationships improving. In Q1 2020, Todo Verde saw over 1500 attendees, with
  a huge momentum with the cookbook & people cooking at home for family. We have
  continued a steady pace of over 200 quarterly attendees. In Q1 2020, People’s
  Yoga members dropped while transitioning to live streaming & have since
  maintained a steady 50 monthly members. In Q4 2020, we launched a new
  on-demand feature in response to community feedback. In one month we gained
  100 subscribers & have now grown to 270 subscribers.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '6000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '12000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  In 2020, Todo Verde published a plant-based Mexican cookbook widely recognized
  in the Eastside community, selling over 20,000 copies. This proves the
  community is ready to create more plant-based culturally relevant staples &
  have been missing the resources for healthier lifestyle shifts. We are working
  to provide knowledge & give our community the confidence to reclaim their
  health through the power of food. Since 2012, People’s Yoga has been on a
  mission to strengthen neighborhoods with access to yoga & other wellness
  practices. Our community centered space introduced yoga to over 10,000
  residents, workers, students, & families throughout LA County. We will
  continue to offer the tools, resources, & practices necessary to make health a
  sustainable reality for the Eastside. In our 1st year, our space will open
  with in-person & virtual wellness programming. Our long term vision is to
  create community impact through skills-training in the culinary & wellness
  fields & job creation.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  People’s Yoga offers classes & programs, in English & Spanish, addressing
  access to mental health services, resilient communities, older adult well
  being, social & emotional support, obesity, & youth sports participation. All
  classes & programs focus on mental, emotional, & physical health & are
  designed for children, youth, adults, & elders. Our educational training
  programs work to provide career paths & certifications to teach yoga; the
  training program not only prepares students to be skilled yoga instructors but
  also supports them on their path of launching their own wellness careers.
  Grant funding will help People’s Yoga continue & expand current programming, &
  build additional features to support programming, such as an outdoor
  meditation garden.
