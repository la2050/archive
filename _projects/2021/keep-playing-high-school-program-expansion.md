title: 'Keep PLAYing: High School Program Expansion'
project_summary: >-
  Harlem Lacrosse seeks to expand its high school programs and staff, and teach
  even more students in South LA, Compton, and Inglewood how to PLAY lacrosse.
  This year 12 seniors, who began Harlem Lacrosse’s transformational lacrosse
  program as middle schoolers, were accepted into four year colleges; of those
  dozen trailblazers, many will be first generation college students, and 7 will
  be college lacrosse players despite most never attending a school with a HS
  program. Imagine the impact Harlem Lacrosse could have with more staff and
  resources!

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
  - 'Other:: Compton'
  - ' Inglewood'
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  HL-LA operates in South LA, Inglewood, and Compton. These communities report
  high poverty levels and low high school and college graduation rates; the
  structural inequities that exist lead to under-resourced schools, creating
  huge opportunity gaps for athletics, academics and extracurricular activities.
  While lacrosse is the fastest growing sport in America, its growth has barely
  penetrated the invisible boundaries between affluent suburbs and low-income,
  urban neighborhoods. HL-LA brings lacrosse to local parks and schools that
  would otherwise never be exposed to the game. HL-LA’s student-athletes are
  asked to overcome obstacles like poverty, housing and food insecurity, and
  trauma with fewer programs and tools at their disposal than their more
  affluent peers. HL-LA levels the playing field by ensuring all participants
  can be part of a team, compete, and have fun. Harlem Lacrosse seeks to be part
  of the solution, by offering free programs to teach students how to Aim High.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  At Harlem Lacrosse, success is a team sport. Program Directors complement the
  work of students and families, school staff, community members, and peer
  programs to create robust high school playing opportunities for youth. HL-LA
  currently serves its high school students through a community program, but
  seeks to expand its staff to develop more locally-based programs to better
  serve students who are alumni of our middle school programs and reach new
  students. The expanded HS Programs will include: dedicated staff members who
  serve as coaches, mentors, tutors, and counselors, regular lacrosse and
  fitness training and playing opportunities, access to academic support,
  college counseling, and career exploration. Our unique model is particularly
  well-suited to meet our players' specific needs. Program Directors are
  professional coaches with years of experience in trauma-informed practices,
  education, and youth development. HL-LA’s programs foster meaningful
  relationships between PD’s and players, leading to higher engagement and
  trust. HL-LA programs combine SEL activities with customized study skills,
  leadership training, and character-building lacrosse activities. Since
  reaching your goals never takes a season off, Harlem Lacrosse plays year-round
  and the average participant enjoys over 250 hours of programming annually.
  HL-LA is a transformative program for students and families, and the true
  impact is realized when students stay in the program over a long period of
  time.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  HL-LA uses data to evaluate our organization's effectiveness and to inform
  program design. We collect program feedback annually from staff, students,
  parents, and community partner surveys. Lacrosse competency is measured in
  skill challenges and regular feedback on player performances. The PACER and
  other fitness tests measure fitness; most students report weight loss and
  overall health gains beyond improved times. Academic performance is tracked
  using grades in core classes, and attendance records. We use Hello Insight
  surveys to measure SEL skills and use the results to create customized plans
  for individual participants. To evaluate the depth of participation we look at
  a few key metrics; hours of participation per year per participant, annual
  rates of attendance, year over year retention, and graduation rates. Success
  means HL students stay in the program over a long period of time, attend
  school more regularly, earn better grades, make friends, and improve their
  lacrosse skills.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '300'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  If Harlem Lacrosse’s work is successful here in LA County, hundreds of
  students who attend under-resourced, underfunded high schools will know the
  joy, challenge, and sense of accomplishment and achievement that being part of
  a lacrosse team can bring. Our expansion will mean we can double the number of
  high school aged youth we serve. HL-LA will contribute to LA2050’s goal of
  improving the number of youth participating in sports, since most of our
  players have never played any sport before joining our teams. LA City schools
  will increase the number of HS lacrosse teams as more youth learn the sport
  through Harlem Lacrosse and other community-based lacrosse organizations.
  Graduates of Harlem Lacrosse’s programs will be impact players on college
  rosters, will improve the college acceptance and persistence rates of their
  neighborhoods and schools, and will go on to become socially-conscious,
  engaged citizens and community leaders.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
