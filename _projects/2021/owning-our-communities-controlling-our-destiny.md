title: 'Owning our Communities, Controlling our Destiny'
project_summary: >-
  The Los Angeles Community Land Trust Coalition intends to use the grant to
  develop a campaign strategy to organize tenants and supporters to advocate the
  passing of a LA County Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act (TOPA). TOPA is a
  proposed policy that will empower tenants to have the first right to purchase
  their building and multi-generational wealth in their neighborhood.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - East LA
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South LA
  - South Bay
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Over 50% of housing units in Los Angeles are owned by large landlords
  employing speculative investment vehicles that contribute to mass evictions
  and displacement. This speculative, corporate housing system has been
  capitalizing on low-income and immigrant communities of color even before the
  COVID-19 pandemic. Housing prices have jumped 34% in California since the
  pandemic began, benefiting the wealthiest landowners who are taking advantage
  of cheap mortgage rates to purchase larger properties. Millions of homeowners
  are expected to fall into serious delinquencies in early 2022 — particularly
  among small business owners and employees of sectors hit hard by COVID-19.
  Low-income renters that have lost their in-person service sector jobs live in
  precarious risk of eviction. It is clear that the renters in LA County have
  the odds stacked against them, and current systems make it nearly impossible
  to be able to save enough to purchase a home.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  The LA CLT Coalition has strategically decided to advance a policy framework
  that expands community ownership of housing across the County of LA: The
  Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act (TOPA). Our initiative has multiple
  pathways to engage Angelenos: The LA-CLT Coalition has created an Instagram
  account, twitter account, and a website for our policy campaign to provide
  extensive and vibrant information about CLTs, the proposed policy, and how to
  get involved. We plan to use our existing platforms to advocate for the TOPA
  policy as well. All five CLTs will use their organizational websites and
  social media handles to ensure there is a wider reach. Popular education
  materials will be posted on social media to increase knowledge of community
  ownership models and the TOPA policy. Have multiple learning spaces for people
  across LA County to get involved in learning about CLTs and TOPA. In these
  learning spaces, we plan to recruit other community-based organizations
  (CBOs), small businesses, and a diverse group of Angelenos from neighborhoods
  throughout all five supervisor districts. We will encourage people to engage
  their supervisor district representatives. All learning spaces will be
  accessible via zoom and will be recorded. The LA-CLT Coalition will mobilize
  hundreds of people to attend the Los Angeles Board of Supervisors’ meetings to
  give public comments on how TOPA will better their neighborhood. Angelenos
  will support TOPA policy efforts by using #TOPA4LA hashtag.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  In 2020, the LA-CLT Coalition was successful in passing two precedent-setting
  LA County CLT policies. The first is a pilot program for the LA CLT Coalition
  to acquire Chapter 8 tax foreclosure properties, in order to prevent their
  acquisition at auction by speculators, and instead to stabilize current
  residents and convert the housing into affordable housing. The second
  established a $14 million demonstration program for the LA CLT Coalition to
  acquire and rehabilitate multifamily buildings across the County of LA with
  the intention to convert them into permanently affordable housing, stabilize
  tenants in their homes, and to work toward tenant ownership of their own
  housing. With the support of LA 2050, we will launch the County of LA TOPA
  campaign. Our social media campaign, community engagement, and political
  action are necessary to create the first right to purchase policy in
  unincorporated LA County. We will measure our success by passing TOPA on a
  county level by the end of 2021.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '575'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '22000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  TOPA legislation would benefit Los Angeles County by preventing the
  displacement caused by gentrification, serve as reparations for communities of
  color, provide wealth building through housing that communities of color from
  now-gentrifying neighborhoods have been denied, promote multigenerational
  wealth building opportunities, and serve as a homelessness prevention
  mechanism. But what does all of this look like? Imagine walking down Atlantic
  Blvd in Compton, instead of seeing dilapidated buildings where low-income
  families are overcrowding because of the increased displacement and rising
  costs of rent, those buildings are owned by the residents that live there.
  They don’t fear being displaced and feel an ownership of their neighborhood
  and its conditions because they have a stake in it. Imagine an LA County that
  allows for intergenerational wealth creation among low-income POC communities
  and that leads to an increase in businesses owned and run by those same
  people.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  The Los Angeles Community Land Trust (LA-CLT) coalition is submitting this
  proposal collaboratively. We are a group of five (5) community land trusts in
  Los Angeles. Each community land trust is directed by the residents that live
  there and the surrounding neighborhood. Each community land trust brings
  different specialties, such as tenant and social justice organizing,
  developing properties and mixed-use buildings, cooperative development, and
  environmental sustainability. The LA-CLT coalition fundraises together, has a
  separate financial account for shared funds, developed the Tenant Opportunity
  to Purchase Act (TOPA) campaign and plans policy actions together, is in the
  process of creating a coalition strategic plan, and long-term structure of the
  coalition.
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?: 'Access to the LA2050 community,Capacity-building and training'
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.: >-
