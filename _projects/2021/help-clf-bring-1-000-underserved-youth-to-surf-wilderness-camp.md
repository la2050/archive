title: 'Help CLF Bring 1,000 Underserved Youth to Surf & Wilderness Camp!'
project_summary: >-
  Help us send underserved youth to Summer Camp! Since 1993, more than 75,000
  children have attended Camp for All, a program which provides crucial outdoor
  educational and positive social experiences to transitioning homeless and
  underserved youth from urban and shelter environments. Camp for All is
  designed to provide positive, educational, enriching, life-affirming outdoor
  experiences, which highlight care for our natural environment and marine
  eco-system, and aim to renew the child's sense of play and sense of hope-all
  in LA's own backyard!

What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  According to LAHSA’s recent Homelessness Count Report, there has been a 16%
  increase in the homeless population in the City of LA. Youth homelessness,
  most tragically, increased by 24%. There is also a staggering number of LA
  residents who were identified as “rent-burdened.” The stress and emotional
  toll felt by these children and teens is very profound. Academic work suffers,
  access to the streets and crime is much more significant, and they are left
  with very few outside activities that are physically, educationally, or
  emotionally enriching, inspiring or fun. Couple this with the inequities
  experienced during the pandemic-food scarcity, limited access to nature and
  decreased socialization, overall instability- and the child can fall prey to
  feelings of great anxiety and depression. We provide access to LA's
  under-utilized parks and beaches, offer our wonderful, free outdoor programs,
  and help instill that sense of hope in the future again.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Remember the joy of being able to attend a summer camp experience with your
  friends, or gather with your family each year at a vacation spot, for a
  relaxing week of fun, swimming, boating, fishing? These experiences positively
  impact and form us, bond us with our natural environment, and teach us how to
  find peace and respite in our very own backyards. LA is filled with such
  magical, natural places, that many Angelenos have access to without spending
  much. Sadly, underserved populations often do not have the time or funds for
  transportation to provide these experiences for their families. Our Camp for
  All summer camps run in July through August each year. Over 1,000 at-risk and
  homeless youth will get to enjoy this inspiring program. Our Wilderness Day
  Camps provide classic camp activities, plus something more:Native Chumash
  lessons, Wilderness Intensives, swimming, ropes courses, special arts classes
  and writing workshops. Our Surf Camps are held at LA's classic Zuma Beach,
  taught by local surf legends who instill a love and respect of the ocean and
  provide ocean safety and marine lessons. Our Wilderness Camps are set in a
  beautiful location in the Santa Monica Mountains. We partner with different
  agencies that serve homeless and underserved youth- including Homeboy
  Industries, My Friend's Place, Covenant House, LA's BEST-to name a few. Our
  staff is skilled at both mentorship and knowledge of the natural environment.
  Our program allows these youth to be "kids" -again.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Camp for All will continue to be specifically evaluated in a very in-depth,
  transparent way each summer, by actually surveying each participant, before
  and after each day camp they attend, and on the day of arrival, and the day
  they depart from the overnight camp. In addition in the early Fall, after the
  program is completed for the season, our staff requests that each individual
  program director from each participating organization and/or shelter to fill
  out a Google Form Evaluation, so that we may also target and analyze more
  specific program needs and concerns. As we have been running this program for
  twenty-six years and counting, we rely also on anecdotal stories-both positive
  and negative, to shape, adjust and tweak future program endeavors, with our
  goal of always enriching and improving the camper’s overall experience, at
  every level.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '6500'

  The desired, measurable outcomes of Camp for All Program are: Goal 1.) To
  provide our youth with memorable, life-affirming, confidence-building outdoor
  experiences, which increases their ability to relax, de-stress, and enjoy
  being a child again. Outcome #1: To successfully serve over 1,000 underserved
  youth. Goal 2.): Highlight how easy and accessible are beaches and parks are
  for this population. Outcome #2: Participants will leave camp with an
  understanding of how they can bring their families back on their own to enjoy
  LA's natural backyard-on their own.Goal 3.) Provide a positive and cohesive
  bonding experience for the participating family-a true outing that can
  genuinely bring the family closer together. Outcome #3: Allow camp days for
  families living in downtown shelters the opportunity to participate, so they
  leave feeling refreshed, restored, ready to face their future with renewed
  hope.
