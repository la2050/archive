title: Cycle Community Change
project_summary: >-
  East Side Riders Bike Club gives children in Watts an alternative to gangs and
  drugs by hosting COVID-safe group bike rides, purchasing helmets and used
  bikes for children living in poverty, teaching bicycle safety and repair, and
  working with government and community leaders to create safe bike travel
  lanes. We practice community service, which helps children build their
  confidence and self esteem while building a sense of community. During
  COVID-19 we've been feeding hungry families and community cleanups in addition
  to our group rides.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Children and teens who live in Watts and surrounding communities face
  unrelenting peer pressure to take drugs and join gangs. There are few
  alternatives to gang life, due to a lack of safe recreational areas and
  activities. Due to the COVID-19 school closures, children lost almost all of
  their access to recreation and socialization opportunities. Over 70% of
  families in Los Angeles do not have safe access to a park or live within a
  quarter mile of one. Families in Watts are food-insecure and need safe,
  inexpensive recreational opportunities and a sense of community. Children need
  bikes, helmets, training and supervision to be safe biking in a dense urban
  environment. They need to be supervised to ensure that safety guidelines are
  followed, including social distancing and the use of PPE. They need to meet
  other children who are not in gangs and they need community support to help
  them stay away from drugs. Children who are in gangs need to make connections
  outside of gangs.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  East Side Riders Bike Club (ESRBC) is more than a bike club because that's
  what the community needs. It is not enough to teach a family in Watts how to
  ride bikes. They need a safe place to ride and community support to keep
  riding. Children and teens need to experience alternatives to a life of drugs
  and gangs. We work with the community to provide safe access for bike rides in
  Watts and surrounding areas. We organize group rides for children and their
  families, teach proper use of masks and other COVID-19 safety protocols, bike
  safety, and bicycle maintenance. We provide helmets, lights, and, whenever
  possible, bikes, if the parents can’t afford them. We incorporate community
  service into our rides to reinforce the concept of “giving back.” Giving back
  increases self-esteem and self-reliance, and strengthens the sense of
  community in an area that is often overlooked. Our Bike Education and Safety
  Training (B.E.A.S.T.) classes are open for the whole family to make biking
  easy and fun for everyone. It also saves families money on bike repair, which
  helps keep them riding. Our volunteer supervisors ensure that everyone rides
  safely, obeys traffic laws, and that everyone maintain a safe distance from
  each other. Due to COVID-19, people are using bikes to commute to and from
  school and work more than ever. They do not want to risk using public
  transportation. In the event of another COVID surge, bike rides will cease but
  we will continue to feed children and families.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  East Side Riders Bike Club tracks the number of people who participate in our
  group rides by the number of riders, the number of repeat riders, and, by
  observation, the level of enjoyment. We want to ensure that everyone feels
  safe and has a good time. We partner with other bike clubs and plan rides to
  different locations, so we monitor participation in those areas. By providing
  a variety of destinations and partnering with other clubs, we can provide a
  safe, enjoyable experience for the whole family. Participants can meet other
  families in the neighborhood and have a good time without spending a lot of
  money, which strengthens the community. We track the number of people we
  teach, the number of people who receive bikes, helmets, and bike parts. We
  track the number of people who volunteer in pancake breakfasts, community
  cleanups, and the number of community leaders and agencies that work with us
  to make Watts and the surrounding areas a better place to live, bike, and
  play.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '800'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '6000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Children will have more opportunities to make friends with other children who
  are not in gangs and not doing drugs. They will receive community support to
  stay in school and seek alternatives to gang life. Families will have
  COVID-safe way to get outside, exercise, and have fun. Watts and surrounding
  communities will continue to develop a sense of community through our
  activities. More people from around L.A. County will be introduced to the
  Watts community, strengthening outside participation in the Watts community
  and increasing opportunities to ride bikes safely here. More people will learn
  bike maintenance and safety, which increases family participation and
  ridership. Biking is a good alternative public transportation, especially with
  COVID-19, and more people will be able to commute to and from work because
  they will learn how to maintain their bikes, bike safely, and keep their bikes
  safe from theft.
