  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  For centuries, Black women and their struggles have been overlooked. Black
  women have been put last in every movement and scholars say Black girls are
  still seen as a footnote. In 2014, President Barack Obama announced a national
  initiative called My Brother’s Keeper to improve the lives of young Black men.
  A few months later, Kimberle Crenshaw, a professor and scholar of race theory,
  wrote an opinion article titled “The Girls Obama Forgot.” Black women need
  workplaces and experiential learning opportunities where they are a priority,
  their challenges are acknowledged, and their authenticity is celebrated. These
  women need career paths, professional experiences, and life skills to break
  the poverty cycle and achieve a prosperous life. Black women earn $0.63 for
  every dollar earned by white men, highlighting the income inequality in our
  country. Black women not only need supportive workplaces, they need
  opportunities to earn fair wages and tangible skills to advocate for equal
  pay.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  LIVE & FAITH Consulting is a firm led by Black women for Black women, offering
  above market rate salaries to its employees. With the rapid growth of project
  management (PM), the firm is focused on a skill that is transferable to all
  industries. The Project Management Professional (PMP) is the most in demand
  certification. Individuals with PMP certifications work across various
  industries including consulting, healthcare, engineering, banking,
  construction, and IT. By 2023, 80% of organizations will utilize a project,
  program, or product management office to deliver outputs. On average, these
  individuals earn a 22% higher salary compared to those without a PMP. The
  Summer Internship is a 10-week program introducing students to PM and the
  world of business. The students will complete the course work to earn their
  Certified Associate in Project Management Certification and gain applied
  learning experience through supporting firm projects. Students will be offered
  the opportunity to join the firm’s Associate Program. The Associate Program is
  offered year around for graduates of the Summer Internship Program or
  postgraduate students. This program is designed to support firm projects and
  provide students with work experience on the pathway towards earning their PMP
  Certification and/or to gain professional experience and transferable skills.
  The task-based on-demand model allows students to earn income while attending
  college and promotes self-management.

Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  To launch our Internship Program, the first group of students entering the
  LIVE & FAITH Consulting ecosystem will come from community colleges in
  underserved communities in South Los Angeles. For the second cohort of
  students in 2022, the firm is targeting students throughout Los Angeles
  County. As the program begins to scale, the firm will then work with high
  school students to introduce the career of project management and encourage
  students to start to dream at an earlier stage. As our firm reaches more young
  Black women in Los Angeles, we believe that through each woman a career is
  started, a family is impacted and eventually a whole community. Our vision is
  to increase awareness of the project management career path, provide training,
  mentorship, and applied learning experience to Black women, and support these
  women along their educational and career journey.
