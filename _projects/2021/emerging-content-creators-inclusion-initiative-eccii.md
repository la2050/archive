project_summary: >-
  NALIP’s Emerging Content Creators Inclusion Initiative (ECCII) aims to provide
  support to young creators through forums, networking, mentorships, summer
  programs, workshops, and funding for projects that will be used for entrance

  in the beginning stages or wish to enter the entertainment sphere but lack the
  knowledge, resources, and mentorship.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  The ECCII program seeks to address the lack of diversity in the entertainment
  ecosystem by providing the necessary resources and tools to succeed, thus
  increasing the number of opportunities for emerging artists. ECCII strives to
  solve the gaps in representation and positions of power and creativity within
  the media world because only “2% of television show writers are Latino,”
  (NALIP Latino Media Gap Report, 2015). In addition to the lack of Latinx
  writers in the industry, “only 1 out of 1,335 directors was Latina” (USC
  Annenberg Latinos in Film, 2019). In the county of Los Angeles, the Latinx
  community makes up 48.6% of the population (Census.gov). Angelenos grow up and
  live around the hub of entertainment, however it is extremely difficult for
  them to break into the industry. The diversity of Angelenos and creatives
  behind the screen need to reflect one another so characters on the screen
  exhibit the genuine intricacies of an intersectional experience.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  NALIP’s Emerging Content Creators Inclusion Initiative (ECCII) aims to support
  emerging creatives through forums, networking, mentorships, summer programs,
  and workshops. This initiative targets diverse creators who wish to enter the
  entertainment and media sphere, but do not have the appropriate resources at
  their disposal. ECCII provides recipients not only receive a scholarship pass
  to one of our three core events, but the recipient attends an Emerging Content
  Creators Workshop, a round table mentorship session, and the opportunity to
  connect with peers. These unique elements of ECCII ensure that recipients are
  given the key tools to succeed by asking, learning, and networking. The
  Emerging Content Creators Workshop allows the emerging creators to listen to
  established industry professionals from their perspective of strategically
  breaking into media and entertainment. The mentorship roundtables provide the
  ECCII recipients the space to connect with vetted mentors and like-minded
  colleagues. Most importantly, emerging creators are given opportunities to
  build community and create connections through their cohort. The 3 key
  elements, mentioned above, empower recipients to gather information, follow
  up, and put it into action with their colleagues. While bandwidth is limited
  to only facilitating ECCII during our events, we hope to expand into a
  year-long initiative and reach young creatives nationwide.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Through the Emerging Content Creators Inclusion Initiative, NALIP aims to
  provide more programs for emerging creators outside of the event cycle. NALIP
  keeps track of recipients, their development, inspires them to pursue creative
  endeavors within graduate school, specific programs (directing, writing), or
  start their career at a studio/network. NALIP measures success through the
  number of participants in the program, number of industry partner mentorship
  opportunities offered, percent of recipients who report gaining knowledge
  about issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion in the media and
  entertainment sphere. Further, NALIP tracks the number of recipients who go on
  to attain internships and jobs in the industry as well as; projects funded,
  execution and engagement. ECCII surveys participants, partners, employers, and
  mentors before and after the program, and plans conduct a follow-up survey 6
  months after and 2 years after the program ends.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '600'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '15000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Many creators rely on gigs and events to promote their projects and network,
  however the pandemic suppressed many creator’s potential opportunities. The
  Emerging Content Creators Initiative will make measurable progress towards
  making Los Angeles the best place to create and grow by increasing the
  resources and guidance available to emerging creatives. In order for emerging
  creators to succeed, they must know how and where to start in this industry.
  ECCII breaks the barrier and allows emerging creators to understand and
  demystify the entertainment ecosystem by offering the resources and
  connections to establish themselves in the entertainment industry. This
  program will be offered throughout Los Angeles and its extremities to create
  an accessible point of entry for emerging creators. The Emerging Content
  Creators Inclusion Initiative will become a focal point within NALIP’s annual
  events, social media, newsletter, and beyond to enhance, engage, and advance
  the initiative’s mission.
