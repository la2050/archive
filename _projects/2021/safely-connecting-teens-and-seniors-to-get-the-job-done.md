title: Safely connecting teens and seniors to get the job done!
project_summary: >-
  Generation Connect mutually benefits two generations by fostering safe,
  neighborhood connections by bringing vetted teens and vetted seniors together
  virtually. Teens learn valuable communication skills and are provided with a
  sense of purpose as a mentor/mentee relationship with the senior is built, as
  well as earn community service hours through our virtual programs and
  eventually, an hourly wage for in-person services (suspended at this time).
  The seniors learn new skills, increase generativity, and receive assistance
  with everyday tasks.

'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Living with extended family is common for seniors around the world. But in the
  U.S., seniors are more likely to age in place. About 28% of seniors live
  alone, and the percentage increases with age (44% of women 75 or older live
  alone). Seniors face problems like depression and isolation. Even in homecare
  facilities, seniors are not able to fully benefit from social and emotional
  support; this has been exacerbated by the pandemic. Additionally, teens are
  struggling to learn soft skills needed to be successful outside a school
  setting. They also struggle to earn the required community service hours
  needed to graduate. Since 2005 LA County has required students earn a minimum
  number of service hours to graduate. Building soft skills and community
  service go hand in hand as they promote leadership, self-awareness, confidence
  and compassion. If this problem is not addressed, the number of seniors facing
  isolation and depression could increase, and high school graduation rates
  could suffer.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Our virtual programs are designed to take place in 8 weeks - 2 weeks of
  onboarding and 6 weeks of sessions pairing teens with seniors. Onboarding for
  teens focuses on soft skills and communication. We learn about the power of
  empathy and active listening, and practice by role playing. With seniors,
  we’ve found that technology training is important. We practice how to use
  different platforms, like Zoom and test accessories, like headphones. We
  require everyone to attend at least one onboarding session and give the option
  for additional 1 on 1 help if needed. Week 1 is a group session used to
  introduce all participants to each other. Week 2 we pick a topic like tech
  support and teens lead the discussion in 1 on 1 breakouts to assist seniors.
  Week 3 we do a group activity like online trivia. Week 4 and 5 the teens and
  seniors trade off leading breakout room discussions to learn more about each
  other and talk about common interests. The final week seniors provide “Golden
  Nuggets,” advice they wish their younger selves would have known. With our
  virtual programs we immediately address the isolation challenges with seniors
  by providing supportive social services. We help establish new relationships
  which are critical to wellbeing, promote Generativity, and provide
  opportunities to learn new skills. Teens gain a sense of purpose and
  appreciation for an older generation, form mentee/mentor relationships, and
  receive community service hours, all while helping build community.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  We constantly ask for feedback from all participants so we can improve in
  every aspect of our work. We send out an initial questionnaire to gauge
  interests and needs, to make sure our sessions benefit the specific people
  attending. We send out surveys after each session and at the conclusion of a
  program, asking for feedback on their overall impression and any additional
  comments. Our ratings rank in 90+ percentile, and since our initial pilot (1
  session/week for 6 weeks), we have expanded to 3 days/week for 6 weeks,
  tripling the number of participants in only 2 rounds of programming. In
  addition, we have received letters of endorsement from cities, school
  representatives and individual participants. From the City of Inglewood,
  Geoffrey Okamoto, Human Services Manager expressed, “These virtual
  interactions are very necessary for our seniors...It is an important and
  crucial time in our history and for you and your organization to provide this
  opportunity, we are more than grateful.”
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '20000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '200000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Our mission is to improve the quality of life for our users through
  participation in our programming. We use our platform to safely connect two
  often overlooked generations on opposite ends of the age spectrum by using
  their differences as opportunities to amplify the value both equally bring to
  the table. Our focus is on the communities we come from and live in, so
  building a presence in Los Angeles is crucial to our success and know we can
  bring positive change to Southern California and eventually, the entire state.
  This grant will help us onboard users to our highly rated virtual program to
  affect the alarming rates of depression and isolation in teens and seniors
  since the implementation of COVID restrictions. Our program aims to help those
  who can best benefit from intergenerational connection. As communities reopen,
  we help our users ease back into in person connections by building trust and
  rapport, having a major impact on our target audience’s emotional and social
  wellbeing.
