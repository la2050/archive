title: Surf Bus at The Shore
project_summary: >-
  We aim to create four high school surf teams of fifteen students each and
  offer sustained coaching support from regions of Los Angeles historically
  blocked from ocean access. Our project begins with an immersive surf camping
  trip to historic surf spot, San Onofre State Beach, for 60 student athletes.
  From there, we will host consistent monthly surf practices and twelve
  overnight weekend trips to The Shore Hotel in Santa Monica to get "contest
  participation ready" for the Ohana Nalu Surf Series, a group of six contests
  during the school year.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - South LA
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
  - 'Other:: Gateway Cities'
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Applying a proven model or solution to a new issue or sector (e.g., using a
  job recruiting software or strategy to match clients to supportive housing
  sites, applying demonstrated strategies from advocating for college
  affordability to advocating for housing affordability and homelessness, etc.)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  We want to diversify the contest line up by creating a more equitable and
  supportive surf environment for young surfers of color. Generations of
  potential surfers are missing from Southern California's ocean wave line-ups
  because of the legacy of segregation in LA between communities of color and
  the coast. The result is a sport known for its homogeneity rather than one
  representative of the variety and diversity of the the ocean. We posit that
  creating and sustaining four inner city high school surf teams, with an
  emphasis on training for contests, will help young Angelenos feel a unique
  sort of freedom, success, and adaptable control over their environment that
  only the ocean can facilitate.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  We are taking a proven model of contest development already available to our
  local Santa Monica high school surfers and applying it to four unique groups
  of teenagers from different areas of Los Angeles: Valley Plaza in North
  Hollywood, Hazard Park in East LA, Algin Sutton in South LA, and Huntington
  Park in the Gateway Cities of Los Angeles. These four regions have strong Teen
  representation at the park and rec departments served by Surf Bus Foundation.
  The initiative kicks off with an immersive camping trip in San Onofre--the
  most special surf spot in all of Southern California and a welcoming place for
  beginners. Out-of-class nature experiences make a lasting difference for youth
  and we want to set the tone with this "peak experience" before the common
  stressors of a new school year commence. The teams of student athletes will
  receive direct support from Surf Academy coaches and Samohi peer-to-peer surf
  team members. Each team of 12 students will have a unique weekly schedule of
  combined fitness requirements, monthly community surf sessions hosted by Surf
  Academy and Surf Bus Foundation, and a monthly weekend stay at The Shore Hotel
  in Santa Monica for immersive surf contest training. Finally, our athletes
  will represent themselves, their team, their school, and community in 6 surf
  contests over the school year. These events are regularly scheduled "peak
  experiences" meant to help a student hone their craft and provide a low-stakes
  way to measure their surf progress.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Success will be measured two ways: personal skills development/attendance (of
  the individual) and the high school surf team performance over all. We use
  beginner, intermediate, and advanced skill cards to measure progress in 4
  areas: ocean safety, swim skills, surf skills, and fitness. The season begins
  with an ocean assessment that tests athletes in these areas so coaching staff
  know how to focus workouts for the individual within a larger practice. Skills
  tests are repeated every six weeks. Surf contest participation and final
  placing is a second metic. Each competitor represents themselves and their
  team in heats. Surfers must strategize together to create the best heat
  outcome for the team, and still work to maximize their own growth/meet their
  goals. Integration of personal and group success is learned by positively
  utilizing potential failure. An individual with stand out performances may not
  be from the team that collectively finishes the best across a surf team
  season.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '104'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '9600'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Success for Surf Bus at The Shore is helping our student-athletes to sustain
  their ocean relationship and become first generation Angeleno surfers in their
  families. Success looks like our teenage surfers helping to transform what
  contest surfing looks like; to transform what the community at large thinks of
  when asked, "what does a surfer look like?" Our Surf Bus high school
  student-athletes could be the start of a surf/ocean love legacy for their
  families and communities that spans generations. Ten years of surf team
  cultivation by Surf Academy has resulted in an across team retention rate that
  burgeoned from 30% in 2010, to 85% in 2020, with half of these students being
  first generation surf Angelenos. We have watched, year after year, as one
  ocean/surf curious child inspires their siblings to start surfing, parents to
  take lessons, grandparents to come watch surf practices, and extended families
  gather at the beach for the excitement of contests (and even participate).
