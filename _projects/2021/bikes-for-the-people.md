title: Bikes for the People
project_summary: >-
  What has two wheels and can simultaneously address social, environmental, and
  economic injustice issues? By providing free bikes, accessories, and bike
  maintenance and safety courses to underserved individuals lacking access to
  transportation, the Bicycle Kitchen can increase their mobility and access to
  fundamental resources. This also provides them with the empowerment,
  enjoyment, and health benefits of owning and riding a bike that they know how
  to repair themselves if needed.

project_video: ''
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  While Los Angeles is widely considered a "city built around cars", there are
  many underprivileged groups that have limited access to vehicles or other
  modes of transportation. For these groups, the bicycle may be their only
  feasible means of accessing essential resources, including employment,
  education, health care, and social services. While the bicycle can be a fun,
  safe, healthy, and accessible form of transportation, many individuals who
  could benefit from owning a bike cannot afford to buy one and do not know how
  to maintain or ride one safely on the streets of Los Angeles. If these
  individuals could have access to bikes and develop maintenance and safe riding
  skills, it would not only increase their mobility and access to fundamental
  resources, but also provide them with the empowerment, enjoyment, and health
  benefits of owning and riding a bike that they know how to repair themselves
  if needed.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  With this grant, we would like to partner with Cahuenga Branch Library, Los
  Angeles LGBT Center, and other organizations providing services to underserved
  individuals, to identify those who lack access to transportation. We will
  partner with Bikerowave to provide participants with bicycles and accessories,
  and we will teach them how to properly maintain their bikes. We will then
  provide maintenance and safe-riding classes using Bicycle Kitchen staff,
  volunteers, and licensed instructors to help participants gain confidence and
  knowledge while successfully riding on the streets of Los Angeles. Each month
  of the program, we will serve three separate cohorts of 5 participants each.
  Each cohort will attend three bicycle maintenance classes held on-site at our
  shop. Staff from the Bicycle Kitchen will teach participants how to build
  their bike and perform crucial maintenance tasks, including changing wheels,
  replacing tubes, and installing handlebars and a drivetrain. Each cohort will
  then attend two bike safety classes led by licensed instructors at the Bicycle
  Kitchen and on nearby streets. The Bicycle Kitchen will organize optional
  group rides through surrounding neighborhoods and parks, including many
  experienced riders and a support vehicle. The group rides will serve as an
  opportunity for participants to solidify their riding skills while integrating
  into the Los Angeles cycling community. All classes and group rides will be
  socially-distanced following CDC guidelines.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Each participant that completes this program will have gained access to
  reliable transportation that can be used year-round with minimal expense. We
  would like to gauge their perceptions before and after the program through
  surveys and testimonials. A partial sample of our survey is shown here: 1. Do
  you feel that you have reliable access to transportation? 2. Do you feel that
  you have adequate access to essential resources, including employment,
  education, health care, and social services? 3. How confident are you on a
  bike? 4. Do you know how to do basic repairs on a bike (fix a flat, adjust
  your brakes, etc.)? 5. How often do you use a bicycle to... (go to
  school/work, exercise, etc.) 6. How likely are you to attend bicycle-related
  events throughout Los Angeles? We hope to see improvements across all of these
  metrics, showcasing the ability of this program to create impacts in terms of
  economic opportunity, physical health, and community building.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '165'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1650'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Cycling may lead to better, healthier lives and help participants engage more
  actively with their community. Access to a working bicycle will help expand
  participants’ mobility and create economic and other opportunities. Bicycling
  also has a number of health benefits. For instance, cycling commuters have
  lower rates of cancer and heart disease compared to other types of commuters.
  Furthermore, cycling has a lower environmental impact than driving, and more
  cyclists on the road will help mitigate the growing problems related to
  motorized vehicle traffic throughout Los Angeles. These benefits would have
  substantial social, economic, and environmental impacts, and pave the way
  towards a better version of the county we all love and call home.
