title: STEAM Guide to the Galaxy
project_summary: >-
  STEAM Guide to the Galaxy is 2BCF's online learning/play library, designed to
  address distance learning and offer in-classroom resources for preK-12
  students. Project Playbooks contain project-based science, technology,
  engineering, art, and math (STEAM). The Two Bit Remote Gameshow uses our
  team's live stream gameshow platform to present STEAM-related quizzes,
  classes, clown calisthenics, a fully immersive online STEAM learning carnival.
  Each of these, with this grant, will be adapted for special needs students
  in/out of the classroom.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  2BCF's STEAM programming is being used locally in over 180 preK-12 schools,
  over half of them Title I schools. When COVID-19 halted our in-school
  programming, we immediately pivoted to converting our Project Playbooks to
  virtual platforms. This experience showed us how few resources there are where
  teachers, students and parents can access remotely innovative
  curriculum-related project-based learning. When we looked into distance
  learning for special needs kids, we discovered even less. With distance
  learning, beyond adapting to learning from home, the special needs child has
  to learn from a voice on a computer. What we are hearing from many parents is
  that kids are simply opting out. Our children are falling dangerously behind
  in their STEAM skills. The marketplace needs resources for playful learning
  where these skills are developed through play both in the classroom and from
  home.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  2BCF is committed to providing high-quality, innovative educational resources
  to all students regardless of race, gender, income, ability status or delivery
  format. As such, we are continuing to build our growing online library, which
  we call "STEAM Guide to the Galaxy." The library already contains five Project
  Playbooks that contain hundreds of standards-aligned project-based-learning
  activities that can be done alone, as a class, online, or by families. In
  response to a troubling lack of online resources for students with different
  learning abilities, we will be adapting each Playbook for students with
  special needs, and all future Playbooks will come with a special needs
  companion. And, since we don't believe in all work and no fun, we are adapting
  our 2020 Two Bit Circus Remote quiz show program to offer a playful collection
  of STEAM games and challenges for the whole family. Using the live streaming
  gameshow platform, we have developed a virtual STEAM Carnival that includes
  our gameshow, quizzes, classes, clown calisthenics, and more - a fully
  immersive online Carnival designed to replace the Science Fair. Our premise is
  that you get the science enthusiasts to attend a Science Fair, while everyone
  wants to go to a Carnival! In person or online, we will educate while
  entertaining and engaging students.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  When delivering curriculum to preK-12 classrooms in Los Angeles Counties, 2BCF
  has used pre-then-post surveys to gauge the receptivity and effectiveness of
  the curriculum. 2BCF will continue using that technique as we continue to
  develop options for the Project Playbook library. Once adapted, we will test
  run the special needs curriculum in one LA County school district. Our special
  needs consultant is working with us to design the survey which will be
  administered by special education teachers. We will complete that evaluation
  before making our special needs materials available to all. For the STEAM
  Carnival, we will provide a voluntary evaluation survey about the content and
  ease of use. We will also keep track of the Library's popularity and use by
  monitoring unique visits, lengths of stay and returns.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '260000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1500000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  With this grant, 2BCF will complete our STEAM projects adding to the 5 current
  Playbooks. Los Angeles teachers, students and families will have a rich
  resource of project-based and playful educational assets, including for
  students with special needs. As dedicated and innovative as our local teachers
  are, no one can deny that we were all caught short with the conversion to
  distance-learning. For special needs teachers, it was even more challenging.
  2BCF believes that even when schools re-open distance learning will remain a
  valuable asset. With our intellectual heart grounded in standards-aligned
  playful learning, 2BCF is uniquely qualified to fill this need through our
  STEAM Guide to the Galaxy that will support all teachers, students and
  families, regardless of geography. Our kids can enjoy developing their STEAM
  skills, teachers can breathe easier, and Los Angeles will become the center of
  the creative in class and distance learning universe.
