title: 'Strong, Smart & Bold Girls Change the World'
project_summary: >-
  When girls are given the tools and opportunities to succeed, they not only
  change their own circumstances, they change the circumstances of those around
  them. Girls Inc. of Greater Los Angeles empowers girls in low-income,
  under-resourced communities to navigate and overcome gender and socio-economic
  barriers to their success. Our combination of long-lasting mentoring
  relationships, pro-girl environment and research-based curriculum sets girls
  on the track for life-long success and develops them into the strong, smart
  and bold leaders LA needs.

'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  While all girls face gender-based and other inequities that may lead to
  marginalization, our target population faces multiple, intersectional
  challenges. The students we serve are mostly (93%+) from low-income or very
  low-income households in South/Central Los Angeles, Watts, Lennox and
  surrounding areas. Approximately 75% of students attending these schools
  identify as Hispanic/Latina and 21% identify as Black/African American. Youth
  in these areas must overcome a myriad of systemic barriers to success,
  including poverty, food insecurity, racism and homelessness. They contend with
  higher crime rates, more gang activity and fewer amenities than peers in
  higher-income communities. One GIGLA participant said: “Growing up in South
  Central you are expected not to succeed, to be another statistic and remain in
  the slumps.” We work to ensure girls attain the skills, knowledge and support
  needed to write their own futures, guided by their aspirations, not determined
  by their circumstances.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Our combination of long-lasting mentoring relationships, pro-girl environment
  and research-based curriculum equips girls in low-income, underserved
  communities to navigate and overcome gender and socio-economic barriers to
  their success. Girls Inc. delivers programs to girls in grades K-12 that make
  a significant impact on numerous areas of their lives, from social skills to
  college prep. Skilled program leaders, many of whom come from the communities
  in which they teach, deliver educational enrichment curriculum during the
  school day, lunch and/or after-school organized around 3 themes: STRONG: Girls
  learn to enjoy physical activity, embrace positive body image and develop
  healthy, nourishing nutrition habits, while delaying substance abuse and risky
  sexual activity. SMART: Girls increase their love of learning, improve
  academic performance, explore careers in STEM and non-traditional careers and
  plan for high school graduation and post-secondary education. BOLD: Girls
  build invaluable life skills from financial savvy to healthy relationship
  practices. They set and achieve goals and develop resilience in the face of
  obstacles. Due to COVID-19, we moved to virtual classrooms to reach girls at
  home. In addition to our regular programming, we provide much-needed emotional
  support to our girls as they process the impact of the pandemic on their lives
  and adapt to the new normal. When our girls eventually return to regular
  classrooms, we will continue to be there for them.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  We use three primary modes to track the impact and success of our programming.
  We collect quantitative and qualitative data through pre- and post-program
  assessments. We track member attendance and program outputs, and we
  participate in the annual Girls Inc. national Strong, Smart, Bold Outcomes
  Survey (SSBOS), measuring attitudes, dietary habits, activity levels, academic
  interest, diligence and investment. Girls also self-report their grades each
  year, which gives us another data point. Our most recent SSBOS results
  provided these data points: 60% of Girls Inc. L.A. girls report they finish
  all their homework all the time, while another 28% finish all of it most of
  the time; 70% said they will definitely or probably go to graduate school to
  get a Masters, Medical Degree, Law Degree, or Doctorate when asked how far
  they think they’ll go in school; 76% of girls said even when they get bad
  grades, they don’t ever give up; and 94% agreed that they think science is fun
  and interesting.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1800'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '325'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  A 2-year study by The American Institutes for Research (AIR) shows that Girls
  Inc. girls stand out as leaders across multiple indicators, exhibiting the
  skills, attitudes and capabilities to influence and improve their communities.
  According to the AIR study, Girls Inc. girls showed significant advantage over
  their peers in 20 impact areas, including: • Performance on standardized math
  tests • Postsecondary readiness and confidence • Belief in ability to do
  challenging math, reading and science • Interest in a STEM job • Strong
  leadership skills • Belief in ability to contribute to their community •
  Willingness to stand up for fairness and their own beliefs The study provides
  evidence that Girls Inc. changes the trajectory of girls’ lives and sets them
  up for lifelong success. Girls are innately powerful. They are the strong,
  smart and bold leaders LA needs. When girls are given the tools and
  opportunities to succeed, they not only change their own circumstances, they
  change the world.
