title: 100% Financial Aid for PUSD
project_summary: >-
  90% of students who complete financial aid applications enroll in a
  postsecondary institution upon high school graduation versus 50% of their
  non-completing peers. Our community collaborative aims to creatively achieve
  100% FAFSA/California Dream Act application completion for all eligible
  Pasadena Unified 12th graders to increase college matriculation among
  underrepresented groups in our diverse community.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - San Gabriel Valley
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  A 2017 NCAN-commissioned study found that students in “higher-poverty school
  districts are less likely to complete the FAFSA than students in wealthier
  districts” and that billions in funding for eligible students is left on the
  table annually. These data ring true in Pasadena, where 74% of high school
  students are “socioeconomically disadvantaged” according to the CDE, and 86%
  come from racial/ethnic groups that are underrepresented in our nation’s
  colleges; however, only 44% of students completed one of these forms in
  2019-2020. This collaborative effort will draw from proven best practices and
  local community initiatives to increase financial aid access and, therefore,
  increase college matriculation and graduation rates. In this historically
  Black and Latinx community, the effort to reach 100% FAFSA/Dream Act
  completion aims to maintain our rich, local diversity while ensuring the
  people who live, work, and learn here can thrive.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  This community-wide effort to achieve 100% FAFSA/CADAA completion will:
  -Create an engaged and energized committee of site, district, and community
  leaders that meets regularly and involves partners from a variety of sectors
  -Rely on student-level data to identify 12th graders who may need additional
  support completing forms and to track those who have started, submitted, and
  completed -Use these data to identify students who are A-G eligible and must
  submit by the state’s March 2nd Cal Grant deadline for four-year colleges
  -Build capacity of staff across the district and in community partnerships to
  share the skills and knowledge to implement and continue financial aid
  application completion assistance -Provide in-person and Zoom presentations
  across schools and the community in Spanish and English -Coordinate across the
  district to inspire healthy competition between schools through prizes and
  kudos focused on those with the greatest percent of students meeting key
  benchmarks -Use positive messaging to build excitement around financial aid
  goal, including a completion thermometer at the district and school sites,
  community-focused marketing and celebrations, etc. -Through workshops, town
  halls, and marketing, leverage resources provided by a grant from the federal
  Office of Minority Health to Day One and Young & Healthy in order to provide
  free tax preparation support and key information about available tax credits
  and financial aid forms to low-income community members
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  While PUSD and related partners each have their own internal FAFSA/CADAA
  goals, the key members of this collaborative (CAP, PUSD, and PEF) have never
  shared a plan for financial aid attainment for all students. Measurement of
  this goal is straightforward as financial aid form completion data are updated
  regularly by the California Student Aid Commission (CSAC). We will measure
  success via two key outcome measures: 1- % of A-G eligible students who
  complete one of these forms by the March 2nd deadline 2- Percent of A-G
  non-eligible students who complete one of these forms by the end of the school
  year Secondary measures include: 1- Number of students who are identified and
  receive additional support through student-level data 2- Success of marketing
  and social media campaigns based on traffic, shares, likes, etc. 3-
  Qualitative impact of collaboration as measured by surveys of steering
  committee members, counselors, teachers, and stakeholders
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1300'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '5000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  The community served by PUSD covers Pasadena, Altadena, and Sierra Madre -- a
  geographical area that is wildly economically, ethnically, and culturally
  diverse and home to one of the largest historically Black populations in the
  county. Our area serves as a manageably-sized microcosm of Los Angeles County
  itself. Financial aid completion is a key indicator of college enrollment and
  success, and, in the current year and pandemic crisis, our FAFSA/CADAA
  completion rates lag behind those of LAUSD and the county, at 59% and 52%
  respectively to our 40%, according to the California Student Aid Commission.
  If successful, our community-wide and multi-sector effort can serve as a
  blueprint for others in our county. If our financial aid form completion rates
  can increase dramatically next year, closing the gap from 40% to nearly 100%,
  the practices we test can be adapted and adopted by partnering districts and
  improved upon by our own community efforts in the coming years.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  CAP will liaison between key collaborators and CBO partnerships that support
  tax form completion and spread the word to our community’s most vulnerable
  families. CAP will serve as content experts alongside PUSD counselors and
  provide the bulk of dedicated staffing and curriculum development. PUSD is
  where the action happens. They will lead the effort on the ground, provide key
  data, and drive the district-wide vision for financial aid form completion.
  PEF will support key school site partners to spread the word about FAFSA/CADAA
  completion to students and families. They will ensure messaging is included in
  all communication about graduation, require FAFSA/CADAA completion for
  scholarship awards, and solicit new donors to increase the size and number of
  scholarships.
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?: >-
  Access to the LA2050 community,Communications support,Strategy assistance and
  implementation
