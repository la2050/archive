title: Community Microgrids with Extreme fast EV charging
project_summary: >-
  We want to install 3 of our 350kWh power storages- in an islanded electrical
  network in the LA region: like a stadium, or a hospital. We will demonstrate
  powering the facility for 3 hours during a blackout, and also serve EVs with
  extremely fast charging during normal seasons: making LA a better place to
  live!

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - East LA
  - San Gabriel Valley
  - South Bay
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  To drive decarbonization in the transportation space, cities want to go 100%
  electric. However, ElectricVehicles or EV's are power-hungry devices- drawing
  power worth hundreds of homes at a public charging port. But, with a mere 2%
  market penetration of EVs, we have started seeing the inability of electrical
  Grids to power our new needs. This load will grow at 15GW per year, and the
  fact that renewable energy is only produced at certain times of the day, we
  would need 30 new fossil-fuel power plants, every year to power this load.
  This approach is a Grid-a-geddon in making, the failure will shut off power to
  our most vulnerable communities, putting lives and businesses at risk- all
  while causing a horrible charging experience for a prospective EV owner.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Our product is a 350kW battery, that fits at one parking spot at a gas
  station, serving extreme fast charging, and backup power to the Grid. We
  eliminate perceived range anxiety for EV drivers who live in multi-unit
  dwellings by placing ourselves at conveniently located gas stations and
  serving extreme-fast charging sessions to eliminate queuing (up to 100 miles
  in 5 mins). Using data-based decisions: and local and global optimization of
  available energy: we also deliver power back up for utilities, or communities-
  helping them with the ongoing congestion of energy. The project is to align
  our values with the city of Los Angeles, helping retrofit the electricity Grid
  for the upcoming demand of sustainable transportation- while making it more
  resilient from the power failures being triggered by Climate disasters. The
  grant will support us build a demonstration inside the city- showing the
  suitability of our solutions for dense urban environments.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  a. We can improve local reliability metrics with improved visibility into
  vulnerable areas powered by CoReScore, and serving up to 3 hours of supply per
  failure event. b. Deep, zero marginal-cost renewables penetration facilitated
  by our ESS capacity will lower IOU service costs in areas where ElectricFish
  networks deploy, lowering energy costs. c. By 2025, we will have up to 1GW of
  distributed capacity that can be committed to peak relief and load-flattening
  at designated feeder locations. d. Finally, storing clean energy, our pack
  contributes 60-320 kgCO2eq/MWh emissions reduction (19%-92%), depending on
  service location, while reducing CO2 footprint of EVs by 40%.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '400'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '2000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  At scale, we would have pioneered a fundamentally new architecture of
  electricity grid- where the power for urban communities, lives inside the
  community walls- rather than being stored miles away from the city and being
  delivered real-time through long transmission lines. We would make the city s
  capable of storing the power locally, enable local generation- and make it
  robust from the growing failures of electricity distribution.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: ''
