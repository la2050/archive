  Veterans Street Academy – A Community-centered Solution to Meeting Homeless
  Vets Where They’re At
project_summary: >-
  Village for Vets will pilot the Veterans Street Academy (VSA), a grassroots
  program that addresses the critical problem of homelessness in Los Angeles by
  utilizing social workers and mobilizing community volunteers to support
  existing case management systems. In partnership with experts from the Veteran
  Peer Access Network and local community-based mental health services, Village
  for Vets will train a team of changemakers to assist chronically homeless
  Veterans through mentorship and skill-sharing, and by connecting them to vital
  resources.

What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Cal Vets attributes high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic
  brain injury to the challenges Veterans face in finding and maintaining
  gainful employment and accessing housing. The VA reports that 55% of homeless
  Veterans suffer from mental health issues, 70% are affected by substance use,
  and 40% of female homeless Vets report severe mental illness, often resulting
  from military sexual trauma. The National Coalition for Homeless Veterans
  cites other barriers including a shortage of affordable housing and lack of
  access to health care and social support networks. Further, military
  occupations and training are not always transferable to the civilian
  workforce, making some Veterans less competitive in the job market. There are
  3,902 homeless Veterans living in LA County (LAHSA 2020). While assistance is
  available, case workers are overloaded and existing programs fall short of
  providing adequate support for chronically homeless Vets and even meeting
  their basic needs.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Village for Vets will pilot the Veterans Street Academy, an innovative new
  program that provides services and community-based solutions to support case
  managers who engage the most intransigent homeless Veterans. With direct
  program oversight provided by a seasoned social worker and in partnership with
  experts from the Veteran Peer Access Network (VPAN) and local community-based
  mental health services, Village for Vets will engage social work interns and
  train a team of volunteers to support chronically homeless Veterans in their
  journey to self-sufficiency. Tapping into the successful VPAN model, Village
  for Vets will bring mentors to the streets to build a grassroots social
  support system and reinforce daily living skills for homeless Veterans with
  acute mental health challenges and other barriers to care. Social workers will
  connect homeless Vets to vital mental health, substance use, housing,
  employment, healthcare, education, and legal services. We will pilot
  accessible “street classes” in arts and recreation to support wellness. The
  Veterans Street Academy will utilize already-tested practices known as
  Contingency Management (rewards) and Community Reinforcement (mentoring) that
  have yielded positive outcomes for the treatment-resistant. Veterans who sign
  up for VSA will receive rewards including sleeping bag coats and other
  necessities. By packaging existing services like EZ ID, Village for Vets takes
  a holistic approach to meeting Veterans where they’re at.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Village for Vets will be successful when meeting the following measurable
  objectives in our pilot Veterans Street Academy year: --Hire a seasoned social
  worker to provide direct program oversight. --Contract with a social media and
  marketing expert who will educate and engage community stakeholders, including
  volunteers and referral sources digitally. --Engage and train up to 20
  volunteers to provide mentorship and offer two street classes. --Develop a
  volunteer training manual and provide specialized training for volunteers
  quarterly. --Contract with a street outreach expert to train staff in direct
  outreach to the unhoused. --Contract with a web designer to develop a
  microsite to capture volunteers, case worker referrals, and other
  stakeholders, and manage engagement online. By meeting these objectives,
  Village for Vets and LA2050 will be partners in change in launching a
  sustainable program and powering our vision of an LA2050 without Veteran
  homelessness.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '20'
