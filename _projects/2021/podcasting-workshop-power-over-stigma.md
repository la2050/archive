'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Combating an imbalance in educational opportunities at alternative education
  high schools, artworxLA works to engage students in their education and put
  them on a track towards high school graduation with a plan to gear them
  towards a creative career pathway through arts education. The goal is to use
  creative learning to re-engage severely underserved students who are
  struggling with failing grades, behavioral issues, a history of incarceration
  or expulsion. We succeed by providing meaningful collaborations and creative
  networks to advance shared community goals. We expect our students to
  contribute their own voice to the city given full and equal access to its
  resources. Our programming, like the podcasting project, provides a way for
  students to share their stories and create their own journalism while also
  addressing the lack of accessibility to technology and resources these schools
  have.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  The Podcasting Workshop: Power over Stigma empowers L.A. youth with
  foundational storytelling skills, designed to give high-risk students a
  platform on which to share their experiences. The workshop promotes access and
  develops pathways for diverse emerging talent, and underrepresented youth to
  explore careers in arts and entertainment as the only LAUSD continuation high
  school offering a Media Arts Career Technical Education certificate at
  graduation. Linked to artworxLA’s Level 1 classroom workshops—in which
  students create original artwork that addresses socio-political themes—our
  Design and Media Arts Academy (DMAA) students created a podcast series
  entitled Power Over Stigma, which explores life in the alternative HS system
  from their perspective. Students anticipate working on each episode which
  features a student “guest” interview in-studio and field recordings
  documenting aspects of their life—as affected by negative stereotypes.
  Inspired by the exhibition “Banish Stigma: The Power of Personal Voice and
  Representation,” at the Fowler Museum in UCLA, participants related to the
  concept of “stigma” in multiple cultural and historical contexts, informed by
  the photography exhibition Through Positive Eyes about people living with HIV.
  Applying the concept in their own lives, Power Over Stigma, emerged from a
  classroom discussion Ms. Gaberman had with a disengaged teen who said that he
  and his peers have been labeled the “bad kids” who would never meet
  expectations.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  In addition to tracking the number of schools and students benefiting from
  programming in 2020/21, artworxLA utilizes a two-tiered evaluation method
  designed to measure success and capture student feedback. A SPEAKUP!
  self-assessment survey asks participants to reflect on their art project with
  the 4Cs in mind: Communication, Creativity and Innovation, Critical Thinking
  and Problem Solving, and Collaboration. artworxLA has also developed a
  14-point questionnaire as a means to refine program offerings to answer
  individual challenges. Beyond skill acquisition and quality of artwork,
  artworxLA will evidence positive results on percentage staying in school and
  on track to graduate. Student Zion said, “I learned that as a team we can do
  anything. Especially with the school environment I’m in right now. It’s really
  cool be in a team again and make something happen.” We have also worked with
  the USC School of Social Work to update methodology to better equip students
  with workforce skills.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '150'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  artworxLA leverages partnerships with artists/creative professionals, cultural
  centers, and higher education to realize a career “ladder,” currently
  administered Virtually. Level 1 classroom workshops, students create artwork
  that addresses socio-political themes. Level 2 after-school residencies offer
  students real-world experience. Level 3 secures scholarships in art programs
  at CalArts, Otis, and ArtCenter. In Level 4 focuses on creative pathways to
  employment and career preparation. artworxLA bridges the graduation gap for
  students who historically have significantly lower rates by using the arts to
  improve individual skills, and attitudes in preparation for success in the
  workforce. artworxLA's DMAA is the only LAUSD continuation high school that
  offers a CTE certificate for Media Arts thanks to our work. We believe our
  model is in line with your goals related to the Arts Education, Enrollment in
  afterschool programs and High school graduation rates metric goals.
