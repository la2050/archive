title: Home Preservation Program
project_summary: >-
  Across Los Angeles County, thousands of families live in homes that need
  critical repairs and modifications that are vital to their health, safety, and
  comfort. Without the financial means or support to complete these repairs,
  many families may be forced to move or continue living in unsafe housing. Each
  year, Habitat for Humanity of Greater Los Angeles (HabitatLA) partners with
  low-income families to complete critical health and safety related repairs,
  ensuring that families can continue living in safe, decent homes for years to
  come.

What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Habitat LA envisions a world where every person has a decent place to live. To
  make this vision a reality, we build and repair homes in partnership with
  limited-income families across Los Angeles County. Our Home Preservation
  Program provides low-income houseowners with crucial health, safety, and
  accessibility-related repairs. We are aware of the growing need amongst
  low-income homeowners, especially older adults, that cannot afford to complete
  necessary repairs to their homes. Many households with mortgages often defer
  vital maintenance on their homes due to high housing costs and costs of
  living. This increases the potential for health and safety threats for these
  homeowners and leads to neglected neighborhoods, and sometimes homelessness.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Habitat LA’s Home Preservation Program (HPP) provides low-income households
  throughout Los Angeles County with interior and exterior repairs to their
  homes. Examples of repairs include but are not limited to the following: roof
  repair, mechanical, electrical and plumbing, accessibility modifications,
  weatherization upgrades, and flooring repair, all of which increase health and
  safety and help families continue to thrive in their homes. One of the
  fastest-growing age groups nationwide is 65 and older. The troubling reality
  is that many older adults are living in homes that are in disrepair or
  inadequate for their needs and are unable to access resources to make their
  homes livable. Our HPP provides older adults the opportunity to age in place
  with comfort and dignity in their home by providing repairs such as widening
  hallways and installing access ramps and grab bars. Because of these
  additions, older adults can move around safely, avoid accidents and injuries
  that can be exacerbated by age, illness, and impaired mobility. Habitat LA has
  served more than 500 households with repairs and modifications. Our field
  staff is all too familiar with the dangers created by leaking roofs, loose or
  non-existent handrails, exposed wires, and malfunctioning electrical panels,
  yet this is exactly what we see in many of the homes. To ensure that
  households can continue living in safe and stable homes for years to come, we
  continue to provide critical home repairs and modifications.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Between August 2021 and August 2022, Habitat LA’s Home Preservation Program
  will provide necessary health and safety-related repair services to at least
  100 households across Los Angeles County. Through surveys, households will
  report satisfaction with the repairs and services received and will report
  feeling more comfortable and secure in their home. Staff use these surveys to
  modify services and program rules, when necessary. Additionally, Habitat LA’s
  staff uses Homekeeper, a platform designed for affordable homeownership and
  that allows for easy tracking and maintaining interest lists, applications,
  services provided, surveys, and other important information. Habitat LA’s
  staff will continue to use Homekeeper, which will allow us to more effectively
  collect and share information within the affiliate and with funders.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '30'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1000000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Repairs and modifications provided by Habitat LA will enhance safety, increase
  security, and provide greater self-sufficiency for homeowners throughout Los
  Angeles County. Not only will homeowners be provided with vital home repairs
  but their home values and those of their neighbors will increase, affordable
  housing inventory will be preserved, community connections will be made, and
  neighborhoods will be revitalized. Additionally, Habitat LA would provide more
  solar energy improvements, energy efficiency upgrades, and weatherization to
  communities. More households with solar energy systems would demand less
  energy from offsite generators, many using fossil fuels, and instead generate
  onsite renewable power thus reducing local sources of air pollution. Also,
  homes that receive energy efficiency upgrades and weatherization improvements
  will consume less energy from non-renewable energy sources, therefore
  generating less greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change.
