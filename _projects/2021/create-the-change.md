title: Create the Change
project_summary: >-
  We envision a more compassionate world and believe that encouraging and making
  it easier for kids, teens, and families to engage in volunteer service builds
  empathy, compassion, communication, and teamwork. PGK’s annual Create the
  Change® program is a successful model for engaging local youth in meaningful
  hands-on service, providing multiple ways to make a difference and expose
  youth to a wide range of community needs. We partner with over 50 nonprofits
  in Los Angeles, connecting youth volunteers to support their diverse missions.

What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  While some schools and community groups will plan occasional community service
  events, Project Giving Kids offers added support including a curated nonprofit
  partner network to engage with on an ongoing basis. Through the use of our
  website and Give Back App, children, teens, and families can build ongoing
  service relationships with nonprofits in their community connected to causes
  they care passionately about. PGK has established a distinct position in the
  youth volunteer engagement space by leveraging technology to create a platform
  where nonprofits looking to promote and expand their opportunities for youth
  and families can connect with those seeking such service experiences. Create
  the Change® brings the PGK platform to life, providing numerous hands-on
  opportunities to volunteer through PGK's network of nonprofit partners. Create
  the Change® ultimately benefits thousands of local area residents through the
  activities conducted by hundreds of volunteers.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  To date, PGK has hosted 9 Create the Change Day events involving over 3,200
  individuals and benefiting over 70 different nonprofit organizations. In 2020
  alone, our Create the Change program generated over 1,200 hours of service and
  more than 3,750 points of impact. On our platform, 2020 website visits
  increased 172% over 2019 with an estimated 64,593 visits last year. PGK’s
  annual Create the Change® Day is a successful model for engaging local youth
  in a meaningful afternoon of hands-on service, providing multiple ways to make
  a difference and expose youth to a variety of nonprofits and community needs.
  Over the past 5 years, we have brought together dozens of nonprofit partners
  with hundreds of children, families, and youth organizations for a day of
  direct service. In 2020, we pivoted Create the Change® Day to a virtual week
  of service, offering 24 unique opportunities for youth to participate in a
  safe and productive way, featuring 3 service modules for each of our 8 cause
  areas. In 2021, we will be expanding and combining what we have done
  historically with our virtual offerings added during the COVID pandemic, to
  allow for more access to volunteerism and our vetted service opportunities. We
  aim to support our 50 Los Angeles nonprofit partners by bringing together
  hundreds of volunteers in-person and virtually to provide thousands of points
  of impact.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  We track: - Number of participants - Number of service hours contributed (by
  those participants) - Number of nonprofits benefiting from the service
  sessions - Number of points of impact resulting from the volunteers’ efforts
  (items and/or donations produced in conjunction with the activities) -
  demographics (age, geography, ethnicity, etc.) of participants to ensure
  access Further, PGK captures qualitative data through survey instruments
  administered to our nonprofit partners, program participants, and users of our
  platform including: - relevance, usefulness, and benefit of activity to
  participants (reflection questions, what they learned, how likely they are to
  attend again, likelihood of referral to others) - quotes, pictures, anecdotes
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '500'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '3000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  We have over 50 nonprofit partners in the Los Angeles area, and hundreds of
  youth volunteers - our goal is to connect these together so that youth can
  learn about what cause areas are most meaningful to them and to build a
  community of support for our nonprofit partners. With so many nonprofit
  organizations struggling to maintain operations at this time, we strongly
  believe that cross-sector collaboration and engaging new volunteers and donors
  in the work of our nonprofit partners is essential to getting through this
  period of uncertainty and to ushering in a more sustainable future for the
  nonprofit sector. Through service connections facilitated by PGK, kids become
  meaningfully engaged at a critical time during their development in ways that
  match their interests and abilities. Studies show that community service
  during the early years increases overall levels of civic engagement throughout
  life, which will ultimately benefit the greater Los Angeles community.
