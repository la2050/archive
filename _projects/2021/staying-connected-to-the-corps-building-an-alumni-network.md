title: 'Staying Connected to the Corps: Building an Alumni Network'
project_summary: >-
  For 35 years, the LA Conservation Corps has been providing opportunity youth
  with unique educational and job training experiences. We want to build an
  active, creative, connected and empowered Alumni Network to harness the power
  of those generations of former Corpsmembers to strengthen the Corps experience
  and also provide ongoing to services to newly graduated Corpsmembers who are
  beginning the next phase of their journey.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South LA
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  For 35 years, the Corps has offered young adults who were out of work and/or
  out of school a unique program that offers paid work experience on diverse
  community benefit and environmental projects throughout the greater LA area,
  comprehensive case management, life and professional skills training, high
  school completion if needed, and advanced vocational training. Hundreds of
  young people go through the Corps experience every year. Some flourish when
  they leave and others are still looking for a network and support system. Our
  newly developed model of building partnerships with bridge employers has
  resulted in wonderful job placements for Corpsmembers, but some would benefit
  from a dedicated connection to Corps support and services. Others are looking
  for a way to give back and build up the next generation of Corpsmembers coming
  up.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  The Corps is a two phase program. Phase 1 is general work experience, case
  management, personal and professional development for all participants. It's a
  time to explore options, break down some barriers to future success, and make
  plans. Phase 2 offers more focused work experience, vocational training,
  educational opportunities, and professional development for those interested
  specifically in the types of conservation and community enhancement work
  projects we typically do. Now, we would like to launch a Phase 3 alumni
  services and networking program for any and all former Corpsmembers who would
  like to take advantage. The baseline service would be support and access to
  resources for all recently graduated Corpsmembers. This could include
  continued counseling and case management, job search support, networking, and
  possibly access to ongoing trainings. Often times, when Corpsmembers leave the
  familiarity of the Corps and the family they have grown to trust they stumble
  at a new job or in a new school. Alumni program staff would be available as a
  point of contact with bridge employers to check on progress or work out
  challenges the alumni is facing in being successful. From there the program
  can grow to provide peer-to-peer support between former Corpsmembers, ongoing
  professional development opportunities, and a network of camaraderie and
  encouragement.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  We would begin by setting a goal for the percentage of newly graduated
  Corpsmembers who maintain contact with the Corps and take advantage of the
  services offered. We have recently been tracking rates of post-Corps
  employment persistence, college enrollment, and increased earning. We would
  hope to see both numbers grow with dedicated staff time and effort directed at
  the program. We would set a target for the number of alumni networking events,
  trainings, or informational sessions we would like to hold, and for the number
  of alumni - newly graduated and farther out for the program - we would like to
  engage in these sessions. Early years successes would defined through
  primarily quantitative measures as we get the mechanics of the program
  offerings going. Anecdotal reports of successes will add to our understanding
  of strengths and weaknesses. Eventually, annual qualitative surveys of
  participants will help in the design of program offerings and refine
  successful efforts.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '50'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '500'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  First and foremost, we intend that this continued early support will increase
  employment persistence rates for newly graduated Corpsmember 3 months, 6
  months, and a year after leaving the Corps and growth in salary and benefits.
  Long-term we would like to see this network have an impact on former
  Corpsmembers career paths and personal and professional success. Just as those
  who go through a traditional college or university setting are able to access
  an alumni network, Corpsmembers should have that resource and benefit as well.
  We know anecdotally that former Corpsmembers are working and thriving in a
  variety of industries - higher education, city government, public utilities,
  public safety to name a few. With a formal alumni program we hope to create an
  active community of partnership, collaboration, ideation, and continued
  success.
