'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Girls' Voices Now (GVN) addresses the lack of gender and racial diversity in
  the local film industry. In 2019, out of the top US 200 films, women of color
  made up only 4% of directors and 4% of writers. GVN was built to empower the
  next generation of female filmmakers and changemakers, and in the long-term,
  to contribute to a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive film and media
  industry and society. GVN provides participants with great technical
  filmmaking skills and critical thinking tools. Our program has inspired many
  to become filmmakers and activists. But after hearing from them, it became
  clear that more long-term support was needed to set them on the path to
  successful careers in the film industry, as many racial, gender and
  socioeconomic roadblocks remain powerful barriers to entry. We launched our
  year-round alumnae program last year to further support their personal,
  academic and professional development, and are now looking to expand it.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Girls’ Voices Now (GVN) empowers girls and femme-identifying youth (14-18)
  from under-resourced and underrepresented communities of Los Angeles County to
  find, develop and use their voice for positive social change through
  filmmaking. GVN is entirely free and participants receive a stipend. It is
  composed of several phases: - a five-week long intensive summer training 20
  participants work in teams to create their first short
  documentary/social-change film. They benefit from a comprehensive curriculum
  delivering high quality filmmaking training with leadership and critical
  thinking skills through lessons, hands-on workshops, presentations from guest
  speakers, and activities. - a premiere public screening in the fall
  Participants take part in a Q&A and share their calls to actions with audience
  members (about 250-300). - a year-round alumnae program open to all past
  participants (serving about 70 youth currently, and growing every year with
  new cohorts). To amplify the program’s impact, and recognizing that the
  communities we serve are particularly affected by the pandemic and economic
  crisis, we built a year-round alumnae program last year to further support our
  participants’ personal, academic and professional development. Topics are
  chosen by past cohorts and include: support for college application,
  internships and job search; financial literacy workshops; hands-on filmmaking
  workshops and panels with women of color from the film industry.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  We gather participants' input and demographic information through online
  surveys when apply, before the program starts, right after it ends, and then
  yearly. Using before/after evaluation, we measure progress made in filmmaking
  skills, confidence and plans for the future. It also allows us to keep track
  of their individual achievements overtime. The participants’ confidence in
  themselves, in their ability to make a film and in their ability to create
  positive social change is a testimonial of the deep impact created (in 2020,
  the share of participants reporting feeling self confident in these areas
  increased respectively from 31% to 76%, 19% to 79% and 57% to 95%!). Recent
  program alumni have been admitted to prestigious universities and
  organizations (Columbia NY, UC Berkeley, ACLU, Fresh Films). We also track the
  number of attendees (about 300 in 2020), online viewers (522,000+), number
  selections to film festivals (48) and first prizes (7).
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '70'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '120000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  GVN’s goals are to: - Empower the next generation of changemakers and
  filmmakers - Build pathways for underrepresented voices to access the film
  industry - Create content with strong educational values for all ages For
  girls growing up in under-resourced communities, exposure to arts education is
  often very limited, and awareness of creative jobs as a sustainable and
  fulfilling career path may not exist. Our absolute vision for success is to
  see a significant number of alumnae entering fulfilling, lucrative creative
  careers, bridging the gender and racial representation gap and contributing to
  increasing the diversity shown in locally produced film, TV shows and other
  content to better reflect LA's diversity. In addition, our main goal is to
  ensure that all of our alumnae know the value of their unique perspective
  after taking part in GVN, and that they have the tools and confidence to use
  their voice for positive social change in Los Angeles, no matter what field
  they work in.
