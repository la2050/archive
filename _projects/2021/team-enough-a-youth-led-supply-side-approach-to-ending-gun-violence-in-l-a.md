  Team ENOUGH: A Youth-Led, ‘Supply-Side’ Approach to Ending Gun Violence in
  L.A.
project_summary: >-
  90% of guns recovered from crimes come from just 5% of gun dealers who put
  profit over public safety, flooding Black and Brown communities with guns.
  Direct service organizations work to decrease the demand for guns--but to make
  sustainable change and end LA’s epidemic of community gun violence, we must
  target the sources of guns instead of just the trigger-pullers. Brady is the
  only organization taking this ‘supply-side’ approach. With your support, we
  will mobilize young Los Angelenos around our supply-side solutions to gun
  violence in LA.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Where you live should not determine if you live, and that the color of your
  skin should not dictate your life expectancy. Yet, more than 25% of the
  country’s homicides occur in neighborhoods containing just 1.5% of the
  population--largely Black and Brown communities suffering the effects of
  systemic inequality and oppression. 90% of guns recovered in crime are traced
  back to sales by just 5% of gun dealers. These crime gun dealers engage in
  illegal and negligent behaviors that divert guns to the criminal market,
  prioritizing profit over public safety. These actions flood impacted
  communities with guns, and the ubiquity creates the problem—it’s akin to
  attempting to stop opioid addiction with opioids available on every corner. To
  combat the epidemic of urban gun violence, we must reduce the supply of
  illegal guns driving urban homicide and gun crime. Brady is the only national
  gun violence prevention organization leading this supply-side approach.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Gun dealer oversight dramatically decreases the flow of guns into the criminal
  market. Despite its proven impact, the federal government inspects only 7% of
  gun dealers per year, and some who are violating the law can go over a decade
  without an inspection. These dealers are predominantly white individuals from
  suburban neighborhoods. That these largely white gun dealers can evade
  punishment for their negligent and illegal behavior--while Black and Brown
  communities suffer from downstream gun violence and mass
  incarceration--highlights the racial imbalance of the criminal justice system.
  Targeting the industry that is profiting from flooding communities with guns,
  Brady’s supply-side work fights this inequity. Brady has been preventing gun
  violence in Los Angeles for over two decades. We have two major programmatic
  priorities in LA. Team ENOUGH, our youth-led program, provides organizing
  resources and a platform for diverse young Los Angelenos to speak up on gun
  violence issues that matter to their communities. Our Combating Crime Guns
  Initiative (CCGI) takes an innovative supply-side approach to gun violence in
  LA, holding the gun industry accountable for its role in facilitating gun
  violence. Alone, each of these programs is critical and impactful—but
  together, they can create a citywide movement. We seek to bring together Team
  ENOUGH and CCGI, piloting a model for youth organizing around our supply-side
  approach to gun violence that deeply engages impacted LA communities.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Project objectives and corresponding measures of success: --Build a
  sustainable supply-side grassroots movement that lifts up young voices from
  impacted communities: The number of youth engaged in Team ENOUGH LA
  initiatives will be tracked via growth in chapter membership, social media
  following, and the number of local/online events held and estimated number of
  attendees. Demographics of chapter members will also be tracked; we hope to
  see increases in socioeconomic and racial/ethnic diversity of the LA chapter
  throughout the grant period. --Drive community awareness of supply-side
  solutions: We will hire a program evaluator to assess overall project impact.
  Exact data collected will depend on initial assessments of the evaluator, but
  changes in community awareness of the supply-side approach will be evaluated.
  --Implement supply-side solutions that will make the city of Los Angeles
  safer: We will track supply-side solutions implemented in Los Angeles and the
  surrounding area.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1770'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '3967000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  In many communities, it can be easier to find a gun than fresh produce. But
  easy access to guns is not inevitable--if we stem the flow of guns into
  communities, we can make it much more difficult for individuals to obtain and
  use firearms. In fact, research shows that shutting down a major source of
  crime guns can significantly reduce crime in a city for up to 18 months. Brady
  has identified and created an online map of the most high-risk gun dealers in
  the LA area. We have strategized local supply-side actions that can be taken
  to combat gun violence. But to disrupt the supply of guns, we must engage
  impacted communities in our fight. We envision an LA where diverse young
  people are provided with the tools needed to hold the gun dealers that feed
  the persistent gun violence they experience accountable, and empowered to
  advocate for local supply-side solutions. In the long term, we see a city with
  decreased gun crime and incarceration and healthier, stronger communities.
