In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Diverse farmers deserve to be at the heart of feeding the millions of food
  insecure Californians during the current pandemic and beyond. These farmers
  understand many of the dynamics embedded in racial, gender, and economic
  inequality that drive hunger and reduce market access in the first place. Food
  Insecurity is at an all time high. This initiative helps solve equity
  challenges on both sides of the food insecurity equation.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Growing the Table envisions a world where underrepresented farms and ranches
  owned by BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color), women, and LGBTQ+, as
  well as regenerative and organic farms thrive, have access to a wide array of
  customers, and are economically resilient. These farms and ranches will have
  prolific distribution of their crops hosted at food banks, school districts,
  community-based organizations, reactivated restaurants, and other trusted
  institutions that serve their communities. These growers will be compensated
  fairly for their available crops and will be a bridge to the new food economy
  during and after the pandemic. Food insecure families and communities will
  have access regularly to consistent, healthy food options.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
