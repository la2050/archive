title: COOP Careers LA Expansion
project_summary: >-
  COOP’s (“ko-op”) mission is to overcome underemployment for underrepresented
  college graduates through digital skills and peer connections. Across our
  sites in New York and California, we’ve launched 100+ cohorts since 2014,
  welcoming 1,750+ alumni. 80% of alumni overcome underemployment within one
  year, earning an average of almost $60,000 after three years. Through this
  project, we look to scale our program to serve hundreds of first-generation
  Los Angeles college graduates, and prepare them for well-paying careers in the
  digital economy.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Nationwide, nearly half of recent college grads (ages 21-27) are unemployed or
  underemployed, and the rates are even higher for black college grads (Vox).
  With almost 400,000 Black and Latinx college graduates (NCES) entering the
  workforce every year, this underemployment crisis only stands to grow. This is
  a recipe to deepen national trends of downward mobility and wealth inequality
  for people of color (WaPo). Furthermore, informal relationships dominate our
  labor market. Referred candidates are nine times as likely to get hired
  (LinkedIn), and currently only 30% of employee referrals go to people of color
  (Payscale). We have learned that a Bachelor’s degree is necessary, but not
  sufficient. We need connections and referrals as much as skills. Ultimately, a
  labor market powered by relationships will reinforce the status quo. We
  believe that by cultivating social networks and closing the referral gap, we
  can make a significant impact on the underemployment epidemic.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  COOP’s flagship program is a unique digital apprenticeship: peer cohorts of 16
  motivated, underemployed grads meet nightly for 16 weeks (200 hours) to learn
  technical skills, build community, and jumpstart careers in digital marketing
  and data analytics. COOP serves as connective tissue between universities and
  employers looking for diverse and qualified candidates. More importantly, COOP
  connects underrepresented college grads to each other. Below are descriptions
  of the flagship program’s key components: Community: Many underemployed recent
  grads feel a sense of isolation and COOP addresses this by recruiting cohorts
  of 16 recent college grads with common backgrounds and goals. We facilitate
  cohort bonding throughout the program. Captains: Each cohort is led by a team
  of four captains, returning COOP alumni who serve as coaches (in addition to
  busy day jobs). Captain teams teach 100% of COOP’s 200-hour curriculum, and
  they are the hallmark of COOP’s model. Curriculum: We design our curriculum
  with input from leaders and practitioners at our industry partners. The
  curriculum is divided into three parts: Head, Heart, and Hustle—digital “hard
  skills,” professional “soft skills,” and the grind of the job search.
  Connections: Finally, we work with employers to interview and hire COOP
  candidates. While we don’t guarantee positions, we are committed to making as
  many connections as possible. 200+ employers have hired COOP alumni since
  2014.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Starting with our pilot, COOP’s program outcomes have been consistent. Over
  90% of participants complete the program and 80% of all alumni are fully
  employed—earning $45,000 in year one and $75,000 by year four. A few insights
  have positioned us to solve underemployment: Overcoming underemployment in
  real time: COOP’s intervention is most effective for college graduates—right
  when they’re most isolated from each other and institutions, ready and
  motivated to seize full-time opportunities. Alumni leadership in our DNA:
  Since the end of our first year, every COOP cohort has been led by alumni
  captains that serve as near peer coaches. And equally important, most of the
  jobs our cohorts secure come through alumni referrals. Relationships over
  skills: We believe credentials matter less than relationships to achieve
  economic mobility. We have scaled access to skills training and education for
  low-income individuals, but not the social capital necessary to enter living
  wage industries.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '160'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '400'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  In the U.S., we’ve rapidly scaled higher education access (3x since 1970) and
  skills training (1M+ credentials), but have had lower upward mobility rates
  each decade since the 40’s. Across the LA-area CSU campuses, almost 20,000 new
  LA-area Cal State graduates will earn less than $20,000 annually 2 years after
  graduation. We know social capital plays an enormous role in the labor market
  with employee referrals being the largest source of hiring for employers and
  the most transformational (4-14x more likely to be hired with a referral) for
  candidates. If we want to revitalize higher education, we have to find ways to
  incorporate social capital building into the college-to-career experience,
  particularly for underrepresented populations. Through the successful scaling
  of our flagship program in Los Angeles, we can demonstrate the effectiveness
  of an inexpensive, social capital solution to underemployment that ensures
  generation LA college graduate launching upwardly mobile careers.
