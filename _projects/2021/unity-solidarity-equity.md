title: Unity. Solidarity. Equity.
project_summary: >-
  Contemporary Art League is a cooperatively owned and operated trade
  organization with a mission to build unity, solidarity, and equity in our
  field. CAL is an ambitious, long-term effort to unify and support the
  unprotected, under-resourced, and largely underpaid labor force of art workers
  within the broader creative economy in Los Angeles County. We offer community
  services, professional support, and advocacy opportunities to our members
  online and at our community center, responding directly to the needs of our
  community.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Art workers are unprotected and under-resourced. Without proper infrastructure
  to support us, art workers are a vulnerable labor force. We are also a
  valuable work force. “[Before Covid-19], CA's creative industries contributed
  $230.3B to the economy, representing 8.2% of the state's GDP—a larger share of
  the state's economy than Construction ($102B), or Transportation ($72B).” (1)
  In 2020, economic losses due to Covid-19 in the arts communities were
  disastrous, leading to what Californians for the Arts is calling a “pending
  cultural depression.” According to the 2021 Otis Report on the Creative
  Economy, the arts in Los Angeles lost 276,100 jobs, $26.5B in labor income,
  and $78.9B in output in 2020. Meanwhile, 30% of Fine Arts jobs in Los Angeles
  are contract labor, leaving too many art workers with precarious employment in
  a city with one of the highest costs of living in the country. 1. California

'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  CAL is a cooperatively owned trade organization with a mission to build unity,
  solidarity, and equity in our field. We are a community-powered resource for
  art workers, a labor force including artists, art museum and gallery staff,
  art educators, and more. CAL is an ambitious, long-term effort to unify the
  unprotected, under-resourced, and largely underpaid labor force of art workers
  within the broader creative economy in LA County. This is an essential step to
  ensure art workers are supported in their work and to achieve equity in our
  field. We will focus on three areas: community services, professional support,
  and advocacy. We will reach our members via a website and community center.
  The LA2050 grant will fund development of our cooperative business model,
  member governance, community center visioning, and website. We plan to launch
  the website on May Day 2022. The community input we’ve received indicates that
  art workers are urgently seeking assistance with accessing healthcare,
  childcare, and capital. The website will offer these services, laying the
  groundwork for what we will offer at our community center in years to come. We
  also envision the website including elements such as: + How to: establish an
  artist studio, set up a business, form a nonprofit or cooperative +
  Skill-building workshops + Listings: hiring/for hire; grant, residency, and
  exhibition deadlines; volunteer and advocacy opportunities + Member pages
  encouraging sharing, exchange, and mentorship
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  CAL was founded in September 2020 and is in its early stage. During the LA2050
  grant period, we will move into the first phase of our business model. Our
  primary definition of success is to reach our goal of launching our website on
  May Day 2022 with 500 members. Parallel to this primary goal are community
  input, potential member recruitment, and member engagement. Leading up to and
  inclusive of the grant period, we have the following aims: + 50 individual
  informational calls + 50 informational meetings with informal and formal art
  groups, organizations, and businesses + 10 open community meetings + 2500
  newsletter subscribers; 75% open rate + 4000 Instagram followers; 20% actively
  engaging with posts + 500 members in good standing + 250 members registered
  for potential cooperative ownership + 3500 respondents to June 2022 community
  survey + Establish and implement cooperative governance model
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '500'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '5000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  CAL is a new framework for the art economy in LA, favoring solidarity and
  equity over competition and scarcity. When CAL takes root, art workers will
  connect via cooperative membership, accessing services and engaging in
  collective advocacy. LA’s tens of thousands of art workers will be a more
  visible, more valued workforce. When CAL is growing, we will reflect the
  diverse population of LA, and our online resources will be used by hundreds of
  members weekly. When CAL is flourishing, our community center will offer
  professional services; assistance accessing healthcare, childcare, and
  capital; and temporary work space, allowing previously unstable art workers to
  thrive in LA. When CAL nourishes LA, we will have reorganized art world
  hierarchies that inhibit access and deny equity to BIPOC, differently abled,
  and LGBTQIA+ folks and perpetuate pay inequality, proving that cooperative
  ownership is a viable path to social and economic equity in our field, in LA,
  and in society at large.
