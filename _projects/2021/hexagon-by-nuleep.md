'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-

  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  As of 2018, there are 153,457 residents in LA that qualify as opportunity
  youth. By 2030, almost 40% of jobs that exist today will no longer exist, and
  1 billion individuals globally will be professionally displaced. Nonprofits,
  bootcamps, and workforce centers exist but opportunity youth don’t have a
  clear pathway to these opportunities. Nuleep’s team will provide a platform
  for youths to access and utilize the resources and opportunities in LA.
  Nuleep’s HEXAGON program builds community with peer to peer experiential
  learning based on building transferable work readiness skills such as
  leadership, project management, and communication skills across STEAM sectors.
  HEXAGON Youths will be part of a 10 week program focused on experiential
  learning in STEAM to learn the fundamentals of project management and work
  readiness, followed by hands on work experience at companies and nonprofits.
  Youths will help businesses scale impact in their communities while building
  work experience.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Nuleep addresses the lack of support for opportunity youth in LA and provides
  STEAM afterschool programs with our HEXAGON program. HEXAGON is a
  community-based, peer to peer plus mentorship opportunity that provides
  experiential learning bootcamps, resources, and mentorship. Coupled with
  hands-on projects in partnership with local companies and nonprofits, HEXAGON
  will feature diverse 10-week focused programs by providing transferable
  skills, from leadership, communications, and public speaking to technical job
  skills such as marketing, data science, UX design, software development,
  business operations, and project management. The culminating annual HEXAGON
  Conference will double as a pitch competition for students to be able to share
  what they have learned and accomplished in their partnership with the local
  companies. Students will be evaluated based on a 100 point system with 1. 25
  points for their communication skills, 2. 25 points to storytell their
  personal growth and project community impact, 3. 25 points for their project &
  presentation, and 4.25 points for technical skills. The HEXAGON Conference
  will be an opportunity for students to apply the skills they learned in a
  real-life context. We will partner and deliver these programs to local high
  schools, community schools, colleges, and nonprofits in LA County. Hexagon’s
  mission is to empower students on their career journeys through hands-on, real
  work experience and experiential learning.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  HEXAGON prioritizes opportunity youth in STEAM to build peer to peer
  communities that enable youths to stay on track and continue learning. Working
  with over 1000 youth in LA County during the pandemic with a 95% success rate,
  Nuleep created scalable professional and personal development opportunities
  for opportunity youth by providing after school programs; we’ll track our data
  by using our in-house database system built using MongoDB. We hope to increase
  the number of 16-24 youth placed into afterschool, work, and internship
  programs at 5 HEXAGON programs, through the following: 95% of HEXAGON youths
  will have a career journey map 95% of HEXAGON youths will be enrolled in an
  afterschool program 95% of HEXAGON youths will be able to successfully apply,
  interview, and project manage their work 90% of HEXAGON youths will be ready
  to be placed and perform at work or internship 85% of HEXAGON youths will
  build direct transferable skills 75% of HEXAGON youths will increase STEAM
  skills
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '250'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Every youth in San Francisco receives $1901 of funding compared to opportunity
  youth in LA at $75. The lack of funding and resources is prevalent throughout
  their professional careers, and many of these disparities have been
  exacerbated with COVID. By offering experiential learning and real-life
  company partnerships, HEXAGON fosters sustainable and scalable personal and
  professional growth for these opportunity youth. With our student group
  partnerships, we have youths that will actively engage and be committed to
  completion since their peers, friends, and community will be part of the
  journey. Not only will youths be activated for HEXAGON across the chain of
  student clubs, we will have businesses growing and thriving in Los Angeles by
  leveraging local LA youths and their potential. Opportunity youth in LA County
  will be able to successfully enter the job market as prepared employees with
  transferable skills and be able to start growing their career journeys.
