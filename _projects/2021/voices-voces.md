title: Voices/Voces
project_summary: >-
  Voices is a story-sharing project which will encourage youth to engage with
  elders. The project, with both audio and visual elements, will help raise
  awareness around issues in the community, while building and strengthening
  intergenerational social networks. At the most basic level, storytelling is a
  way of keeping a community's stories alive. In this second installation of our
  Voices project, we will be expanding to focus on specific hard to reach
  elderly groups and communities within the neighborhood.

What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Boyle Heights is a neighborhood in East Los Angeles with nearly 100,000
  residents. Sixty-two percent of residents are low-income, with 62% also having
  limited English proficiency. Over the past decade, Boyle Heights Beat has
  catered to much of the community's need for information in Spanish by
  producing a bilingual print newspaper, website and podcast. This need has
  become even more apparent during the COVID-19 Pandemic, where limited
  information has been readily available to the Spanish speaking population.
  WIth disproportionately high numbers of COVID cases and deaths, the pandemic
  has also resulted in increased isolation of senior citizen residents, and
  increased rates of depression and anxiety among young people. With many youth
  no longer communicating in Spanish, the young and older populations are
  becoming further estranged from each other. This project is aimed at
  connecting these two groups, to create mutually beneficial relationships for
  both individuals and the community.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Through its "Voices" project, Boyle Heights Beat will work to build and
  strengthen relationships between youth and elderly; creating dialogues, giving
  voice to both populations and allowing both groups to learn about each other's
  differences and similarities. These types of intergenerational relationships
  help strengthen individuals and the community. Studies have shown these
  relationships offer benefits to youth such as improved academic performance,
  enhanced social skills and increased stability. Over the last decade BHB has a
  proven track record in the neighborhood and is a source the community relies
  on for information and engagement. A healthy community requires opportunities
  for residents to engage with each other and their leaders. Through its
  storytelling projects, BHB provides residents with these opportunities. By
  training youth as storytellers and conveners, BHB empowers youth as leaders
  and agents of change. BHB can partner with other local nonprofits to publish
  and exhibit these oral histories and create an even greater reach, deepening
  community connections. In this second installation of the project, we will go
  further to deepen our impact and reach and expand our work in some of Boyle
  Heights' most underserved areas, the neighborhood around the Ramona Gardens
  housing project. We will also work with local organizations and nonprofits who
  work with further marginalized groups within the community like undocumented
  and LGBTQ residents.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  From our program's beginnings researchers at UCSF created a survey to measure
  our project's success and impact. We conduct these surveys with students, who
  are asked about what they've learned about reporting, their confidence levels,
  the academic impact, and community engagement. Overwhelmingly students self
  report that the program, and working with journalist mentors has improved
  their self confidence and heightened their career ambitions and sparked an
  interest in journalism. They also report a new understanding and appreciation
  for their community. In the first "Voices" series, youth report at senior at
  Roosevelt High School Anayram Corona interviewed Carlos Montes, an activist in
  the Chicano movement. "It's very important to connect with older community
  members to not only learn lessons from the many stories they have to tell, but
  also to be able to share those stories with a larger group. Sharing those
  stories is what makes the difference in the community," she says.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '10000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '100000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Research shows that aging adults play a critical role in the lives of young
  people, especially the most vulnerable in society. Intergenerational
  relationships are also crucial to happiness and well-being in our later years.
  The goal is to change social norms to encourage relationship building between
  generations. This storytelling project is one way to bring older adults and
  youth together, creating an opportunity for both to learn new skills and help
  create long-lasting relationships. These relationships can help cultivate a
  sense of purpose for both young and old, and help reduce isolation and the
  likelihood of depression. Through our storytelling project Voices, we hope
  that residents are able to better connect, to find new understanding and
  appreciation of each other, and a way to uplift each other and the issues
  facing the community- making Los Angeles a better place.
