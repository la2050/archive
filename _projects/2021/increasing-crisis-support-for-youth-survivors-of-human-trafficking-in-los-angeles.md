  Increasing crisis support for youth survivors of human trafficking in Los
  Angeles
project_summary: >-
  Youth survivors of human trafficking in Los Angeles have experienced
  unimaginable trauma but many service organizations are not able to meet their
  unique needs. Cast's Emergency Response team responds to victims of all ages
  in crisis, ensuring their safety and stability with food, clothing and
  connection to housing and medical care. To better serve youth survivors, Cast
  wants to hire a Youth Emergency Response Case Manager who will support youth
  survivors at a very vulnerable stage of their recovery from their experience:
  the start.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Youth survivors of human trafficking are often not ready for comprehensive
  case management and need quick, specialized services from youth experts. Cast
  currently has two Emergency Response Case Managers (ERCMs) who meet with
  survivors after escaping their traffickers and provide immediate services e.g.
  housing, food, medical care. They serve clients of all ages and are not
  experts in the needs of youth survivors. As their caseloads are full, Cast has
  identified the need to increase the number of ERCMs, especially as the number
  of emergency responses made by Cast staff increased by 185% in 2020. In
  addition, Cast is due to commence a three-year contract with the LA County
  DCFS to be the agency’s trainer on Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children
  and Human Trafficking. Due to the vastly increased exposure across Los
  Angeles, Cast anticipates an increase in hotline calls and referrals for
  trafficked youth and needs to ensure sufficient capacity to respond.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Cast is proposing to use a LA2050 grant to cover the cost of a full time Youth
  Emergency Response Case Manager who will be dedicated to attending at least
  100 youth survivors in crisis over one year. They will also be responsible for
  outreach activities specific to youth survivors, for example by working as
  Cast’s direct services liaison with DCFS. The Youth ERCM is a new role for
  Cast and would work across the Youth and Emergency Response programs. They
  will focus on responding to hotline calls from youth in crisis (until it safe
  to do so, this will place remotely. Under normal circumstances, staff
  physically meet survivors wherever it is safe to). They will then provide them
  with immediate services that meet their urgent needs such as food, clothing,
  shelter (Cast has an emergency shelter for over 18s) and access to medical
  care. The focus is on stability and safety. If youth clients wish, they can
  then receive longer-term case management services and legal services.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Ultimately, survivors’ healing and growth is what Cast uses to evaluate our
  impact. Our Survivor Outcomes Assessment tool looks at 13 categories in a
  survivor’s life and tracks their progress from ‘in crisis’ to ‘thriving’ while
  they are receiving Cast’s services. Survivors’ progress scores help to show
  where and how their service plans needs to be adjusted; it is only when they
  are 'stable', 'growing' or ‘thriving’ that Cast case managers talk to clients
  about graduating from our programs - no matter how long that takes.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '100'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '0'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  A 2018 study reported that almost 10% of homeless individuals on any given
  night in LA County reported that they had been victims of human trafficking. A
  2017 survey found that 19% of the homeless youth population in LA had
  experienced trafficking. Cast believes that the COVID-19 pandemic has
  increased the incidence of human trafficking and that, as the pandemic near a
  hopeful end, we will start to receive an increasing number of hotline calls
  and referrals, including from youth (aged under 24). It is absolutely vital
  that we have the capacity to meet this need with staff who are experienced in
  working with very vulnerable youth. Supporting survivors who have recently
  escaped their trafficking situation in a timely manner has a huge impact on
  their wellness and safety in the short term and directly prevents them from
  becoming homeless. Therefore the proposed project will directly affect youth
  at risk of homelessness and exploitation in LA County.
