  SoLa Technology & Entrepreneurship Center: Bridging the digital divide in
  South LA by opening new access points to cutting edge digital skills training
  and entrepreneurship education with the goal of inspiring the next generation
  of Black / Latinx tech and business leaders.
project_summary: >-
  South LA’s Black and Latinx youth live in a technology desert and lack equal
  access to tech education and opportunity. The SoLa Technology and
  Entrepreneurship Center (the first in South LA) will close this digital
  divide, provide access to high quality, cutting edge technology and
  entrepreneurship education and open new pathways for Black and Latinx youth to
  become the next generation of tech leaders and entrepreneurs. We aspire to
  systemically address these game-changing outcomes with support and input from
  the LA2050 community.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  The lack of access to tech at home combined with underinvestment in public
  schools have created an urgent need to bridge the digital divide, invest in
  STEAM programming and provide new access points for Black and Latinx youth in
  South Los Angeles. 30% of students don’t graduate high school. 64% of
  residents have no access to technology at home. In 2018, SoLa I CAN found that
  9 of the 10 largest South LA high schools lacked access to tech related
  electives. Furthermore, 47% of South LA households have no broadband internet
  connection making it the least internet connected region in LA County. It is
  well understood that technology access for K-12 students directly impacts
  academic performance, which in turn affects higher education achievement,
  earning potential, and life-long financial stability. These systemic access
  gaps in South LA place Black and Latinx youth at a structural disadvantage in
  accessing economic opportunity. The Center aims to help close this gap.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  We are expanding youth programming and bridging the digital divide by building
  South LA’s first Technology and Entrepreneurship Center, a state-of-the-art
  10,000 sq ft safe space based in the heart of South LA to spark our
  community’s next generation of diverse tech workers and entrepreneurs. At the
  Center, Black and Latinx youth will be able to learn skills in coding, video
  game development, e-sports, graphic design, robotics, video and music
  production, and entrepreneurship. The Center launched virtually in July 2020
  with a grand opening of our physical location scheduled for Fall 2021. At the
  Center, youth will gain access to sophisticated, high powered tech equipment,
  an esports gaming arena and full video / music production studios that
  students would not otherwise have access to. There, they will be able to
  explore their full creative potential while learning tech and entrepreneurship
  skills from experts in the business sector. We have developed partnerships
  with schools, women and minority-owned program partners, and corporations to
  provide hands-on experiences, mentors and internships. The Center is
  positioned to be a leader in tech education and workforce development,
  bringing new opportunities for 21st Century skills-building to South L.A. We
  are currently seeking funding to expand our STEAM programming free of charge
  to more than 1000 students annually as we believe the Center will be a game
  changer that sparks creativity and innovation in our students.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  SoLa I CAN is a data driven operation and the Center’s impact will continue to
  be recorded in pre- and post-participation surveys tracking technical and
  psychological impacts. Additionally, impact data from partners (including
  several higher education institutions) are shared. Since our virtual launch,
  115 students have entered the program. Impact data shows 75 students were
  exposed to subjects for the first time with 80% expressing interest in
  additional course study. Also, 72% expressed interest in pursuing careers in
  fields they discovered at the Center. 83% reported positive psychological
  effects (such as, new self esteem trust and stress management skills).,
  Jennifer, 17, told staff, “I will use this curriculum later in college to
  major in a STEM course that includes coding. I plan to use the analytical and
  problem solving abilities in the real world.” Another student Jehu, 12, loved
  his coding class because “it is a new experience for all and a new world to
  explore.”
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '500'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1500'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Our vision for Los Angeles County is built upon inclusive and sustainable
  economic development where everyone - no matter their race, socio-economic
  position or geography - has access to the region’s leading STEAM industries
  and high wage careers. The Center will build new educational pathways towards
  enacting this vision by helping LA County residents access new and inclusive
  opportunities via the Center’s expansive after-school and weekend
  entrepreneurship and technology focused education programs and partnerships,
  directly contributing to higher educational achievement, high school
  graduation and college attendance. We see South LA, Watts, Compton, and
  similar neighborhoods fully integrated into the broader economy, producing
  small businesses and startups integrated with large corporations and emerging
  industries in the region. Through educational achievement we will see new
  wealth-creation employment opportunities, business ownership and creation.
