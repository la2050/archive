title: 'Cafeteria to Compost: Fighting Food Waste and Food Insecurity'
project_summary: >-
  Cafeteria to Compost teaches students how to combat both food insecurity and
  climate change through the simple, daily practice of sharing, redistributing,
  and composting leftover items from their lunches. Our program shows how school
  composting can increase fresh food access, reduce food waste, drive climate
  action, and provide jobs for parents. A grant from LA2050 would help us expand
  to a second school site with a new team of parents and demonstrate the model
  for LAUSD more broadly.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
  - Westside
  - LAUSD (select only if you have a district-wide partnership or project)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  We address both food waste and food insecurity. Angelinos throw away 1M tons
  of food a year, making up 45% of every landfill. At 24th St. Elem., our
  flagship garden, nearly 100 lbs. of compostable food a day was being
  discarded, which is 18,000 lbs. a year! Yet over 1.1M L.A. residents are also
  food insecure, with 410,000 children at risk of hunger. Understanding the
  connection between food waste and food insecurity, our program models how
  public schools can be sites of action. At 24th St. Elem., 93% of students
  qualify for Federal free/reduced lunch. The surrounding neighborhoods of West
  Adams/Jefferson Park are part of the County’s Service Planning Area 6, where
  31% of residents live in poverty and 30% are food insecure. As one of the
  densest populated areas (pop. 1,030,078), South L.A. has only 46 grocery
  stores, far less than more affluent areas. While food access is improving in
  the area, new food outlets can be unaffordable or inaccessible for low-income
  residents.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  To act on these twin issues, Cafeteria to Compost operates within the most
  logical places to reach the greatest number of highest needs children: public
  schools. We start the school year by visiting every classroom with lessons on
  composting and what they can expect in the cafeteria. Then, every day at the
  lunch tables (pre-COVID), a paid team of parents and interns help students
  return and share unwanted food items during lunch, and again with families at
  pick-up time. From Sept. 2019-Feb. 2020, we composted or redistributed over
  9,000 lbs. of cafeteria food, diverting food waste from the landfill to our
  school compost piles and significantly increasing local food access. Unique to
  our program is the paid team of school parents - jobs that also help foster
  parent engagement at school - and our Training Modules, Classroom Curriculum,
  and a detailed Operations Manual. In Fall 2021 we’ll continue building the
  operation at 24th St. and expand to a second GSF sister school, Grand View
  Blvd. in Mar Vista, where 65% of students qualify for Federal free or reduced
  lunch. While the food share component may still be temporarily curtained per
  Covid restrictions, collection and diversion to the compost will proceed. The
  program builds on years of GSF programming and deep engagement with both
  schools, cultivating school leaders, teachers, plant managers, parents, and
  cafeteria staff. Recognizing our decades of work with schools, LAUSD is
  crafting a permanent Service Agreement for GSF.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  We measure the impact of our program by the: 1) amount of food waste diverted
  from the cafeteria to the compost piles; 2) amount of unused food that we
  recover from the cafeteria and redistribute to the school community, both at
  lunch and after school; 3) number of other GSF schools that have adopted the
  program; and 4) number of opportunities we have to share our results via
  presentations, tours, and meetings with District officials. From Sept.
  2019-March 2020 (when schools closed), we had composted 5,325 lbs. of
  cafeteria food. Students dropped off 21,528 items at the Share Table, and
  picked up 10,898 items. We redistributed edible food and milk to school
  families after school at pick-up time (2,602 recipients), for a total of 3,753
  lbs. of food, plus an additional 5,429 items of food/milk that were counted
  individually but not weighed. Our total diversion of food waste from the
  landfill was over 9,000 lbs. See the full 2019-20 24th St. stats archive:

Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  From a City-funded pilot in 2018, we’ve built our program slowly over three
  years, fine tuning and collecting data. During the grant year, we’ll prove
  that Cafeteria to Compost is replicable and scalable. As we expand to Grand
  View, we’ll debut our Training Modules and Operations Manual that detail
  everything from how to collaborate with school staff, to how to build compost
  piles and test finished soil. We’ll share collection metrics with cafeteria
  managers to help determine the amount and type of food they order for their
  schools (source reduction). Our long-term goals are: 1) have the program at
  all 7 GSF schools and then; 2) have the District create permanent Food
  Services Division staff positions to run Cafeteria to Compost programs on
  their own. With the average school throwing away 150-200 lbs. of food every
  day, imagine what food access and reduced landfills in LA County could look
  like if even 10% of LAUSD began a Cafeteria to Compost program!
