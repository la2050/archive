  Imagine having an intimate YouTube like space within a walking distance in
  Hollywood. Create LA project brings life to written works, such as plays,
  poetries, prose by recording them and publish them onto streaming media. Adler
  will connect writers, actors and film makers to create to collaborate. We will
  provide the space, studio and guidance. This is an expansion of the Decameron
  Project Kaz Matamura created in 2020, so artists could connect and create
  during the pandemic, while protecting our communities.

'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  The Pandemic has isolated people and many have become anti-social. Antisocial
  behavior in society has led to negative and violent outbursts. We would like
  to encourage people to join in the various acting and creative activities we
  have developed during the pandemic in order to dispel the habits of
  anti-social behavior. While many actors were experiencing lonely quarantine,
  the Stella Adler Theater, in spite of being forced to close, still continued
  training online. We'd like to gradually reopen our space with a Covid safe
  studio using the grant for additional equipment and editors to handle the
  influx of the public into our public outreach exercises. Although we believe
  it will be another year until we would be able to fully function as a theatre,
  we would like to use this as an opportunity to reach out to local residents
  who have NO access to studios - giving them means to create, record, edit and
  stream their work.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  1. Conversion of rehearsal studios into a film studio (Sound proof - lighting
  grids). 2. Purchasing lighting, camera, microphones and additional equipment
  3. Editing software and computers 4. Covid safety supplies (wipes, shields,
  air flow equipment) 5. Paying a small stipend to several out-of-work people
  involved with the technical side of the film industry
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Due to the isolated nature of the pandemic, many in the acting community as
  well the people in our extended network found themselves out of work. But
  determined not to become rusty, members of the Stella Adler Theater developed
  an online community called The Decameron Project. Within the small group, we
  have encouraged many to become as creative as possible within the scope of
  what can be done collaborating online. But we feel we can reach more members
  of the community, especially the elderly and young people who are lonely and
  isolated, and draw them out of their isolation with fun acting activities and
  the chance to develop creative skills that they do not have an opportunity to
  develop. Our success will be measured thru the kind of reception we will see
  from these works being shown to the rest of the community as well as seeing
  those isolated become drawn out of their shells.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '300'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '100000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  We are always striving to create an inclusive theatre communities - however we
  cannot help but feel the theatre community has been not attracting younger
  generations, and we are feeling generation gaps. This projects will allow
  writers, directors and even actors to work remotely. If creators are not
  capable of being in the studio, they can work and collaborate remotely - in
  real time. With our studio in Hollywood used more actively to connect
  playwrights and train young actors with film makers from local film schools -
  we are able to produce high quality, short pieces independently, while
  introducing theatre arts to the next generation. Also, playwrights and theatre
  artists would be able to record and archive their work, which usually only
  live in the moment of live theatre. We believe this projects will transcend
  and fill the gap of Theatre-Movie, Broadway generation - YouTube generations
  and playwriting - screen writing.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  No collaborating organizations. However we will be reaching out to local films
  schools, such as LA Films School, Columbia, ArtCenter, AFI via social media.
Which of LA2050â€™s resources will be of the most value to you?: >-

  gatherings,Communications support,Capacity-building and training,Strategy
  assistance and implementation,Other:: "How You Did it" sharing seminarrs
