In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - South LA
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  With nearly 500 museums and art galleries and more than 700 music venues and
  theaters, Los Angeles boasts a plethora of arts and cultural experiences.
  There are, however, significant financial and geographic barriers which often
  prohibit individuals from historically marginalized communities to benefit
  from these experiences. Additionally, due to the pandemic, we have seen more
  than 20,000 lives lost and a 12% unemployment rate in Los Angeles in the past
  year. Historically marginalized communities have been hit the hardest by these
  traumatic effects of the pandemic. What these numbers don’t illustrate are the
  stories of indescribable loss, stress, and resilience that individuals have
  faced. Harmony Project intends to provide program opportunities to community
  members of all ages in order to increase access to public arts experiences
  while also providing a platform to share stories through music, ultimately
  promoting social-emotional wellbeing and strengthening community
  connectedness.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Harmony Project has offered music production courses to students since 2018.
  We quickly realized that this form of music-making is immediately engaging and
  accessible when participants are provided the equipment and software. Inspired
  by our success with young people, this program will provide monthly music
  production labs to community members. We will have a static location once per
  month at the EXPO Center in South LA as well as a traveling music lab once per
  month in partnership with outdoor public events and our network of partners.
  All activities will take place outdoors and will abide by COVID-19 guidelines
  established by the LA County Department of Public Health. If these guidelines
  restrict us from gathering in person for some or all of the sessions, we will
  increase our allocation of funds to marketing and outreach and will carry out
  the programs through an online platform, as we have all of our activities over
  the past year. This initiative is multi-faceted and will address the following
  priorities: -Increase access to free and accessible public arts experiences in
  Los Angeles communities; -Provide community space to individually and
  collectively process our personal stories and our place in our communities
  through music; -Connect community members to free socio-emotional resources;
  -Engage middle and high school students in community-based volunteer
  activities; -Support the vitality of the arts industry by providing job
  opportunities for community-based artists.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  While this particular initiative is new and has not yet been evaluated, our
  organization has a 20-year history of earnestly evaluating our program
  activities yearly to inform our work and best serve our communities. Through a
  combination of individualized progress check-ins, surveys to all stakeholders,
  and focus groups, each year we record and analyze data to inform continued
  growth. Due to these efforts, we have the infrastructure in place needed to
  effectively evaluate new programs like this one. Every music lab participant
  will be asked to take an exit survey. We will also record repeat participants,
  particularly at our static South LA space and will provide a specific survey
  at the end of the year to measure growth and impact over a prolonged period of
  time. Qualitatively, we will assess the success of the project through the
  music created during music labs and the enthusiasm with which community
  members participate.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '2600'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '15000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  In the short-term, our goal is to increase access to public arts experiences
  in historically marginalized communities that often have less access to the
  arts than affluent communities. We see these music labs and the music created
  through them as a way to increase intergenerational and community dialogue,
  especially as communities and individuals begin to heal from the effects of
  the pandemic. In the long term, our goal is that these music labs will serve
  as a launching point for communities to feel empowerment in community dialogue
  and mobilization.
