title: Rebuilding the Bridge to College
project_summary: >-
  The pandemic has widened the educational achievement gap, particularly among
  low-income students of color. After a year of significant disengagement, we
  need to help students rebuild connections—to their sense of purpose, their
  peers, their educational community. Fulfillment Fund will add social-emotional
  interventions to our college access program for 9th-12th graders in our
  partner schools. Now more than ever, students need help finding hope and
  getting back on a path to college, which is key to economic mobility and
  uplifting diverse voices.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - LAUSD (select only if you have a district-wide partnership or project)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Our students have been disproportionately affected by distance learning (64%
  of LAUSD middle and high school students did not “actively participate''
  online last spring) and the stress of the pandemic (US teens had a 31%
  increase in mental health-related ER visits). Moreover, college applications
  are declining dramatically (immediate college enrollment fell by 21.7% in
  2020, nearly 8 times the pre-pandemic loss rate) especially among low-income
  and first-generation youth and at campuses that primarily serve disadvantaged
  students (e.g., CSU Dominguez Hills saw a 17% plunge in applications). This is
  the greatest educational crisis of our generation. Without significant
  intervention, previous gains to close the opportunity gap for underserved
  students will slide precipitously. After a year of record disengagement, as
  our school partners work to get students back on track academically, we know
  they will need more help than ever with college counseling and
  social-emotional supports.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Fulfillment Fund will help 9th-12th grade students in our partner schools
  rebuild social-emotional connections to their peers, their educational
  community, and their sense of purpose through on-site and/or virtual
  workshops. Delivered with a college access and trauma-informed care lens,
  these workshops will engage and re-connect students through team-building
  exercises, identity development/empowerment activities, wellness checks, guest
  speakers, and community service/civic engagement opportunities. Offered in
  tandem with our existing programming, workshops will focus on fostering
  social-emotional development, improving mental health and well-being in a fun
  and interactive learning environment. Our high school programs will continue
  to include personalized college counseling, college access lessons, college
  tours, financial aid workshops, programming for parents in English and
  Spanish, a summer bridge program, scholarships, and financial aid counseling
  (all offered in-person, hybrid, or virtual as allowed by LAUSD). By creating
  safe spaces where students are encouraged to rebuild relationships, we will
  instill hope that their futures are still bright and their college dreams are
  attainable and more important than ever. (Note: Apart from this grant,
  Fulfillment Fund continues to serve our students at both 2- and 4-year
  colleges and universities through our College Success program, where we are
  also ramping up social-emotional support services and career readiness
  activities.)
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Fulfillment Fund has a long track record of providing deep and meaningful
  College Access and Success programs in L.A. Last year we served 2,794
  students: 99% BIPOC, 90% low-income, and 83% first in their family to earn a
  college degree. In 2020 our high school seniors achieved a 92% graduation rate
  (vs. 80% for LAUSD overall). In 2019 (the most recent year for which data is
  available) only 70% of LAUSD seniors enrolled in college after graduation,
  while among Fulfillment Fund’s graduated seniors that year, college enrollment
  was nearly 100% (in 2020 it was 94%). In addition, only about 25% of LAUSD
  high school graduates overall finish a college degree within six years, while
  in 2020 our most recent cohort achieved an 84% six-year graduation rate. The
  success of our new social-emotional components will be measured by specific
  pre-and post-intervention surveys, along with measurement of high school
  graduation and college matriculation rates despite the challenges caused by
  the pandemic.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1900'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '5700'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  We believe that education is key to breaking the cycle of poverty and forging
  a path to meaningful economic mobility while uplifting the diverse voices we
  are privileged to serve. In the short term, our students will overcome their
  pandemic-related learning loss, will be hopeful about their futures and
  prepared for the expectations of college, will graduate high school with the
  courses needed for college admission, will have the funding required to
  matriculate in the Fall, and will be accepted to the school that makes the
  most sense for them. In the long-term, our students will graduate college and
  embark on meaningful career paths, the opportunity gap will decrease, our
  target communities will be healthier and live longer, and median household
  incomes will rise, for this generation of students as well as for future
  generations. Like so many others we have served, these students will give back
  to their communities, thus creating a growing cycle of support in Los Angeles
  and beyond.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  Since we began partnering with LAUSD high schools to offer our college access
  services we have served thousands of students across dozens of schools. Today,
  we have contractual full-service partnerships with five Title I LAUSD public
  schools, plus two additional partner schools receiving opt-in services, a
  formal vendor partnership with all LAUSD, and active efforts to increase our
  number of partner schools. We specifically target Title I schools due to the
  high incidence of students that require additional resources beyond that which
  can be provided by school staff. For this project, our full-service partner
  schools will provide access to students and will collaborate on service
  delivery based on needs assessments unique to each partner school.
