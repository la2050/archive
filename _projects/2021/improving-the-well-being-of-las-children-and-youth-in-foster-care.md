title: Improving the Well-Being of LA’s Children and Youth in Foster Care
project_summary: >-
  The Family Urgent Response System (FURS) will change the course for Los
  Angeles (LA) County’s children and youth currently and formerly in foster care
  by helping them experience stability in nurturing family homes, strengthening
  trust and relationships between children and their caregivers, and preventing
  the inappropriate criminalization of traumatized children and youth.

project_video: ''
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  When children and youth enter foster care, they have already experienced abuse
  and neglect, loss, and disrupted relationships. To heal from this trauma, they
  need stable placements in family homes where they can develop supportive,
  consistent, and loving relationships with caregivers. However, efforts by
  caregivers and youth to build strong relationships can quickly derail when
  they cannot access community-based, trauma-informed supports at the critical
  moments they need them. Without immediate supports and services, even minor
  miscommunications and frustrations can intensify and have detrimental results,
  leaving youth feeling further traumatized and possibly facing another
  placement change, hospitalization, or institutionalization. Even worse, in
  many circumstances, caregivers call the police because they lack other, more
  appropriate options for immediate help, leading to the inappropriate
  criminalization of traumatized children.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  On March 1, 2021, the Family Urgent Response System (FURS) launched, an
  innovative new program developed to provide immediate trauma-informed support
  to children and youth currently or formerly in foster care and their
  caregivers in California. This cross-sector state and local response system,
  consisting of a 24/7 statewide hotline and county mobile response systems, is
  designed to provide early in-home support to children, youth, and families to
  prevent and address instability. While FURS is now operational, much work
  remains to be done to ensure its effective implementation in Los Angeles
  County – where there are 22,000 children and youth currently in foster care
  (which is more than a third of all children and youth in care in California) –
  to meet the needs of children and youth currently or formerly in foster care
  and their caregivers. For instance, barriers and challenges often become
  apparent after the launch of large-scale programs such as FURS. Therefore,
  real-time feedback between the field, the county, and the state will be
  critical to identifying and resolving FURS implementation issues before they
  take hold. Meaningful engagement of and input from youth and caregivers
  throughout the implementation process will also be integral to ensuring FURS’
  overall effectiveness.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  In this early-stage program, Children Now will define success by the extent of
  the outreach to children and youth currently and formerly in foster care,
  caregivers, and other child welfare stakeholders to make them aware of this
  new program and their engagement in providing feedback on FURS, including
  needed improvements. We will measure our success by the following metrics: •
  The number of children and youth formerly and currently in foster care and
  caregivers in LA County that are informed about this new program. • The number
  of children and youth currently and formerly in foster care and caregivers in
  LA County that provide feedback on FURS, including needed improvements. • The
  number of child welfare stakeholders, such as providers, made aware of FURS
  and provided with technical assistance to address FURS implementation issues
  and share best practices to support children, youth, and caregivers. • The
  number of improvements elevated to the county and state for action.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '50'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '21000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Placement stability is critical to the well-being of children and youth in
  foster care, yet it remains elusive for far too many. Close to a quarter of
  Los Angeles County’s children still in foster care at 24 months have
  experienced three or more moves
  (https://ccwip.berkeley.edu/childwelfare/reports/PlacementStability/MTMG/r/fcp/s).
  Placement changes cause children in foster care additional trauma and make it
  more difficult for them to develop healing relationships and establish trust
  in subsequent caregivers. FURS will help improve outcomes for LA County’s
  children and youth currently or formerly in foster care by promoting healing;
  preventing moves, psychiatric hospitalizations, and re-entries into foster
  care; and reducing the inappropriate criminalization of traumatized children,
  especially children and youth of color who are disproportionately negatively
  impacted by the child welfare and juvenile justice systems.
