title: Home-y Made Meals
project_summary: >-
  Home-y Made Meals is a 100% people-powered initiative adapted to the safety
  measures required during Covid-19. Within the safety and comfort of their
  homes, volunteers from all around Southern California prepare, deliver, and
  serve homemade meals every day. We've re-imagined the soup kitchen
  volunteering experience to ensure our unhoused neighbors are well-fed and
  well-loved.

What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  When Covid-19 crept in and disrupted our personal and communal lives, we
  received stay-at-home orders. Our unhoused neighbors stayed at home, outside,
  directly facing multitudes of insecurities. While we started fighting for
  toilet paper, they continued struggling for survival. Homelessness endured
  with greater visibility. As the impact of homelessness magnified, Eayikes, a
  collective manifesting social connection beyond physical touch, and Polo’s
  Pantry, a respectfully prominent mobile food pantry, joined hands. Together,
  we sought to address, replenish, and reallocate the displacement of resources—
  specifically food. Our intentions to proximate ourselves to homelessness and
  close gaps between them and us resulted in Home-y Made Meals.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Home-y Made Meals fills the gap of food insecurity faced by our growing
  unhoused population. As traditional access to informal food sources &
  volunteering opportunities are disrupted, we re-imagined the power of homemade
  food and volunteerism. The design of Home-y Made Meals enables everyday housed
  people to make meals, transport meals, and engage in service in a time when
  both food and civic engagement are desperately needed. The accessibility of
  this project, which includes a free pantry for volunteers to source
  ingredients & supplies, has activated on average 42 chefs and 15 drivers to
  deliver 908 homemade meals every week across LA and Orange County since March
  2020. The operations team of Home-y Made Meals coordinates volunteer schedules
  based on availability and location. Volunteers make meals in the safety of
  their homes and drive them to our outreach partner organizations who handle
  distribution to our unhoused neighbors.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  We measure impact quantitatively by meals served, volunteers activated, and
  recurring volunteer rate. We've served 47,376 meals, activated 877 volunteers,
  and have a 75% recurring volunteer rate. Qualitatively we gather feedback from
  volunteers after each shift through a survey, as well as insight from outreach
  partner organizations in order to improve operations and the impact of each
  meal.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '800'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1300'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Since Safer At Home Emergency Order began in March 2020, we've served 47,376
  meals by engaging 877 volunteers in a time when the homelessness crisis was
  compounded by the Covid-19 pandemic. This downstream solution is providing
  hope everyday to both unhoused and housed Angelenos. Additionally, partner
  organizations like Covenant House California share how these meals have been
  integral in building trust among outreach workers and unhoused people. The
  power of a consistent homemade meal cannot be understated. An LA2050 grant
  will amplify this power, fostering deeper trust and relationship-building
  between outreach worker and unhoused person, while growing the hearts of
  housed Angelenos by transforming biases and inspiring proximity to our most
  vulnerable & marginalized neighbors. We work to make civic engagement joyful.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  Polo's Pantry is the development arm of Home-y Made Meals, securing outreach
  partner organizations, building relationships with unhoused communities, and
  directing where to channel this people power network. Over the holidays,
  Polo's Pantry led us to Lideres Campesinas and farmworkers in Oxnard who were
  in desperate need of basic necessities. In addition to our daily meal
  operation, we activated our community to create over 700 supply bags full of
  groceries and hygiene items.
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?: >-
