project_summary: >-
  Parents, grandparents and extended family depend on their children to guide
  them through the newest technologies and forms of digital communication. The
  LA/OCRBC Global Connect program equips young people with the necessary digital
  literacy skillset, while also preparing them to train those at home. The
  program will also connect families with resources to close the digital divide

'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  The Digital Divide is a real and serious gap that translates to lack of human
  and social services necessary for survival. Over the last year, the digital
  divide has become more apparent with the stay at home orders and the need for
  telehealth, telelearning and telework. These necessary connectivity points at
  home and in the workplace will not go away and equitable access is needed for
  all. A large part of the divide in digital access and adoption is the lack of
  knowledge around affordable broadband programs offered by internet service
  providers. These programs need to be highlighted and utilized.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  The LA/OC Regional Broadband Consortia (LA/OCRBC) Global Connect program will
  train teachers and volunteers on how to discuss connectivity with students and
  provide them the necessary tools to reach success in school along with health
  at home. This digital literacy toolkit will include information on how to use
  devices, how to navigate applications and software and most importantly how to
  engage the family in these practices. Part of the training that the teachers
  and volunteers will receive is a comprehensive outline of all available
  programs that students can take home to discuss with their parents. This
  includes programs offered by nonprofits, the government and the internet
  service providers (private industry). By engaging the family, this program
  will comprehensively reach the community including older generations and those
  from low socioeconomic backgrounds. Teachers and volunteers will have the
  opportunity to share information through the students to parents,
  grandparents, siblings and extended family.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  We will measure success based off the number of teachers and volunteers
  trained, the number of students reached, the number of communities
  participating and family engagement.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '300'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '10000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  In a fully connected Los Angeles County, equity would finally be met and the
  opportunity for residents of all ages and socioeconomic backgrounds will
  finally be given equal access to the most basic needs in the digital age: the
  chance to have success in a job (telework), access to top level medicine
  (telehealth) and the ability to learn (telelearning). No longer will some have
  a privilege over others and no longer will barriers exist for some to not be
  able to participate fully in their community. The opportunity for a Global
  Connection is endless and the ability to engage at home seamless. The closure
  of the digital divide also allows for greater civic participation in the
  local, state and national community. Family members of all ages and
  backgrounds can finally have a say in the larger conversation on social and
  fiscal policy issues. Empowerment through voice is the strongest tool a person
  can have.
