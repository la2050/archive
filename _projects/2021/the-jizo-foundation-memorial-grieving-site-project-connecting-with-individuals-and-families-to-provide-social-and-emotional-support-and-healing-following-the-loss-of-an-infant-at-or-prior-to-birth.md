  The Jizo Foundation Memorial Grieving Site Project - Connecting with
  individuals and families to provide social and emotional support and healing
  following the loss of an infant at or prior to birth.
project_summary: >-
  The Jizo Foundation was established to heal and support those who are grieving
  the loss of a baby at birth or before, through the creation of grieving spaces
  in public parks or gardens, where individuals and families can visit to mourn
  their loss. Modeled on an ancient and very popular Japanese tradition, our
  goal is to bring together community, foster understanding about this neglected
  population, and provide social, emotional and mental health support to
  thousands of women through connection, volunteerism, and community events.

project_video: ''
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  According to UNICEF, a stillbirth occurs somewhere every 16 seconds, meaning
  every year, about 2 mill. babies are stillborn,a loss that reaches far beyond
  the loss of life.According to national estimates,15 to 20% of all pregnancies
  in the US end in miscarriage.These figures do not include the unknown number
  of failed IVF attempts. The inability to carry a child to term often has a
  traumatic long-lasting impact, resulting in profound psychological suffering
  and stigma on women and their families. Some women have repeated failed
  pregnancies, causing extraordinary grief, often leading to years of mental
  health issues. In Western civilization, there is no place or process for this
  kind of mourning. However, in Japanese culture, there are public grieving
  grounds, presided over by the loving bodhisattva (saint) Jizo, who, according
  to mythology, rescues babies who died early from the underworld, and brings
  them to heaven, hidden in his robe. His comfort however knows no cultural
  boundaries
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  This project will connect with families to provide emotional support and
  healing through ritual and community. We plan to purchase or lease a small
  piece of public land or existing garden, to establish the first site in the
  US, where we will install Jizo sculptures created by local artists, also
  seating and permanent signage explaining the site. There will be onsite
  ceremonies and rituals when allowed. The high number of miscarriages, failed
  IVF and stillbirths around the world is a sad and alarming fact. Based on
  research and medical evidence involving IVF along with pregnancies that end in
  miscarriage or stillbirth, around 70-75% of all conceptions end in pregnancy
  loss. These women suffer depression and other mental health issues, causing
  stress, job loss/loss of wages, family issues, even divorce. As a licensed
  grief counselor, and having been through the unfortunate situation herself,
  Patricia understands this trauma. The idea you did something to cause it, or
  the desperation that drives trying , despite repeated miscarriages can be
  devastating.There is a world-wide need for healing and solace for these
  victims, and our memorial sites are one way to address that anguish.Through
  social media we are communicating with women who are suffering, and the
  support within the group is very beneficial. But having a physical space to go
  can be even more valuable. For that reason, we plan to establish the first
  such site in LA County, and thereafter in locations around the country
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Our success will be measured by the establishment of the first site and the
  number of people who we are able to help through ritual, community, and
  counseling. Our social media groups will provide a platform for spreading
  information about the sites, urging all who visit to join and follow for
  updates and community gatherings. As we are able to expand the program to
  locations beyond SoCal, we will be able to offer more comfort and healing to
  women across the country. This will hopefully lead to independent support
  groups with women supporting other women, thereby improving the lives and
  mental health of all participants. The success of such outreach as it pertains
  to improved quality of life will be hard to measure, but we expect it will be
  substantial and impactful for thousands of women.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '8000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '15000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  With proper funding, we will be able to establish one or more healing sites in
  Los Angeles County, and commission public art with permanent stone or marble
  Jizo sculptures from various local artists, perhaps even hold a public art
  contest, with the winner getting the paid commission and public recognition.
  Once established, we will foster community amongst those who visit the site,
  offer volunteer opportunities, sponsor remembrance rituals, connecting
  Angelenos who have shared experiences, and create a healing environment that
  provides social, emotional, and mental health support. Los Angeles will become
  known for recognizing the need for those thousands of women who largely suffer
  in silence. It is our long-term plan to spread awareness and support for this
  unseen community through the establishment of grieving sites with public art
  installations in multiple locations across the country.
