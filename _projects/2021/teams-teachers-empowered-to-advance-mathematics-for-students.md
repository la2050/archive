title: 'TEAMS: Teachers Empowered to Advance Mathematics for Students'
project_summary: >-
  TEAMS will enable LA students to achieve excellence in math education and
  pursue STEM-related degrees and careers. The most critical factor that impacts
  success in math is the quality and effectiveness of teachers. This initiative
  will train 8th and 9th grade math teachers on an innovative approach to
  instruction developed by CSUN professor Dr. Ivan Cheng and extensively tested
  for effectiveness. Moreover, this initiative will enable participating
  teachers to be mentors to their colleagues at their respective schools.

project_video: ''
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  In 2019, only 2 in 5 public school students in LA County tested grade level
  proficient in math on the Common Core aligned state assessment. While 51% of
  3rd graders tested proficient, proficiency dropped dramatically to 31% by
  grade 11. Studies demonstrate learning loss has been most acute in K-8 math
  during pandemic distance learning. The NWEA’s comparison of fall 2019 to fall
  2020 assessment results across 4.4 million students found math skills dropped
  between 5-10%. Math is increasingly becoming a barrier, rather than a gateway,
  for accessing the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in the global
  economy. The key reason: most teachers focus on formal procedures to solve
  textbook problems, rather than help students develop a conceptual
  understanding of what those procedures mean and how they apply to other
  situations. Students in lower-income schools and students of color are more
  likely to be taught procedures rather than conceptual understanding.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Highly capable, effective, and engaging teachers are the most critical factor
  for students to succeed in math and feel empowered to pursue STEM oriented
  careers. Strengthening the bench of teachers will make a profound difference.
  Thus, the TEAMS initiative will train a cohort of teachers in shifting from a
  procedural textbook approach to helping their students develop a deep
  conceptual understanding of math. This pedagogical approach is based on
  research that shows students learn through a process of “progressive
  formalization” where they develop increasingly abstract and deeper
  understandings of a concept by first making sense of their informal knowledge
  before moving on to formalized rules and procedures. This approach, along with
  the related tools and training, has already demonstrated its effectiveness in
  a randomized controlled study. Thus, in this initiative, teachers will be
  trained on using this approach, and then engage in job-embedded coaching for
  the academic year, using the Responsive Teaching Cycle (RTC), a model that has
  also demonstrated effectiveness in previous studies. With RTC, teams of
  teachers and coaches work together to create Progressive Formalization Tasks
  (PFTs). PFTs are pre-designed lesson templates for Common Core math standards,
  all available online and customizable by the user. As more teachers develop
  the ability to adopt this approach, they can then become champions of PFTs to
  their colleagues, which can sustain this effort beyond the grant.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  The effectiveness of teaching with PFTs was studied extensively in a
  randomized controlled experiment that met the criteria for the highest rating
  in the What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) Standards (Version 4.1). Based on scores
  from over 7,300 8th grade students across 10 school districts in California,
  the impact of using PFTs was remarkably positive and statistically significant
  (with large effect sizes of 0.7 and 1.139). Most notably, the intervention
  eliminated the achievement gap between English learners (EL) and their non-EL
  counterparts. Similar to the i3 study, TEAMS will be evaluated with a mix of
  quantitative and qualitative data. Using a quasi-experimental design, TEAMS
  will compare program teachers’ student learning outcomes with that of
  non-participating teachers. TEAMS will also collect ongoing, formative data to
  inform continuous program improvement, including fidelity of implementation
  measures and feedback from teachers and students on their perceptions of PFTs.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '40'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '6000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  In the short-term, mathematics education at the schools represented in our
  training cohort will be more engaging and effective. In turn, students will be
  more confident and motivated to learn math, raising proficiency scores and
  notably reducing or eliminating equity gaps entirely. Most importantly, in the
  long-term, LA County will have a stronger pipeline of talent prepared and
  motivated to complete rigorous STEM oriented degrees in higher education and
  in technical schools, lifting our degree completion rates and time to
  completion. LA County will become more attractive to high wage industries such
  as Biopharmaceuticals and Information Technology, which require a highly
  skilled workforce. Moreover, as the pace of automation increases and low skill
  jobs disappear, job candidates will need to master core subjects such as math,
  as well as the logical thinking and problem solving skills they inherently
  develop. Raising educational outcomes will future proof the city from this
  trend.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  Our partner is the Los Angeles Coalition for the Economy & Jobs, a bipartisan
  membership organization that brings together leaders from business, labor,
  academic and nonprofit communities to advance policy initiatives that grow the
  economy and create quality jobs throughout the LA region. As the Coalition has
  prioritized the urgent need to strengthen the pipeline of STEM talent, it is
  committed to underwriting subsequent grants to scale the reach of this
  initiative. The Coalition’s role is closely modeled after its partnership with
  CSUDH to rollout teacher training on Next Generation Science Standards, which
  won the $200k LA2050 Learn Category Grant in 2018. That partnership has
  resulted in multiple grant awards with over 200 teachers trained, with
  outstanding feedback from participants.
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?: 'Access to the LA2050 community,Hosting virtual events or gatherings'
