title: Increasing Food Access in Los Angeles through Sustainable Urban Agriculture
project_summary: >-
  With an aim to transform healthy food access and wellness through people,
  social enterprise and environmental justice, CultivaLA uses green spaces to
  empower immigrant and low-income communities across Los Angeles to grow and
  obtain fresh foods in their neighborhood. Using a community-centered and
  intergenerational approach, CultivaLA engages, educates and empowers community
  members from low-income communities to use urban agriculture practices and
  understand the importance of green spaces in providing fresh and healthy food
  to the community.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  According to the U.S. Economic Census, low-income neighborhoods have two to
  three times less access to healthy food in their neighborhood. Lack of healthy
  food options leads to food insecurity, which Feeding America indicates as
  having serious negative effects on the physical and mental development,
  academic achievement, and economic futures of youth. Seeing food deserts and
  food insecurity as social justice issues that disproportionately affect the
  poorest communities, CultivaLA advocates for the transformation of green
  spaces across Los Angeles, so they may be used for urban agriculture. Studies
  find over 25% of California’s population in 2019 identifies as an immigrant,
  which also makes for an incredible need to support immigrant integration as
  they are often subjected to racism and relegated to bad, low-wage jobs. As a
  result, CultivaLA sees urban agriculture as an expression of immigrant agency,
  with immigrants using homeland seeds and plants to anchor in a new place.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  CultivaLA is a community-driven organization, working directly with
  cultiva-dores, who use their previous experience in farming from home
  countries to grow food resources in an urban setting. CultivaLA honors the
  experiences of immigrant communities and provides opportunities for them to
  use their skills to bring healthy food to underserved communities. CultivaLA
  also educates the overall community through urban agriculture workshops and
  training to promote workforce development, mentorship, and entrepreneurship
  for youth and adults. These programs are developing, and are aimed at building
  intergenerational connections, increasing self-efficacy and resilience of
  low-income communities, and promoting older adult well-being through urban
  agriculture. In 2020, CultivaLA adjusted its programming to provide an
  Emergency COVID-19 Grab and Go Produce Distribution, which provided over
  90,000 pounds (lbs) of fresh herbs, fruits and vegetables to families in the
  Westlake community, who were disproportionately affected by COVID-19.
  CultivaLA aims to continue providing free, grab and go food and produce
  through distributions to combat food insecurity and ensure local communities
  have access to healthy food during the grant period. CultivaLA currently
  oversees urban farming at various locations within LA County: Westlake
  Community Garden, Cesar Chavez Community Garden, St. Teresa of Avila Community
  Garden, Earthworks Farm, and City of Rosemead Community Wellness Garden.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  As we aim to empower local cultiva-dores and community members to grow fresh
  herbs and vegetables at our urban garden sites, we will define and measure
  success via the following objectives: 1) Number of meals or units of fresh
  food provided to the community through harvesting and distribution activities;
  2) Number of participants attending environmental programs/events at urban
  agriculture sites; 3) Number of individuals reporting a positive experience at
  urban agriculture sites; and 4) Number of individuals reporting an overall
  improvement in well-being due to involvement at urban agriculture sites. We
  will accomplish the aforementioned measurement and evaluation outcomes through
  registration forms, program surveys (pre/post), and food resource tracking and
  documentation from vendors and partners. We look forward to providing LA2050
  with the outcomes of these metrics at the end of the grant period.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '600'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '2400'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  We hope our work will provide a place of respite for undocumented, immigrant,
  and low-income communities, who are often excluded or disregarded in other
  spaces in Los Angeles. As these groups tend to the garden, they also tend to
  themselves, as they practice self-care, share their experiences, and recreate
  intergenerational bonds with others in the community. Through the collective
  transformation of discarded urban patches of ground into oases of freedom,
  belonging, and homeland connection, we hope these urban agriculture sites also
  serve as inspiration and hope, while providing for the food needs of the
  community through harvesting of herbs and vegetables. Urban agriculture can
  offer a portal to understanding our social and existential conditions,
  especially as global migration is fundamental to this region and to the era in
  which we live. As a result, CultivaLA hopes its mission and programming will
  best support communities in a variety of ways, today, and in the future.
