title: The world's first "Say Do Be" Good Social Networking App
project_summary: >-
  This project aims to build communities that focus on saying, doing, and being
  good. We hope to accomplish this by engaging residents through challenges,
  starting with giving students a challenge (such as #putasmile, #volunteer,
  etc), giving children a challenge to connect with the elderly (such as #chat
  #journal, etc). Residents can choose a challenge, complete it, and then take a
  photo or video and post it on the app.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
  - LAUSD (select only if you have a district-wide partnership or project)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': Research (initial work to identify and understand the problem)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  The problem that we are seeking to address is loneliness and mental health
  issues. New research reveals how social media platforms like Facebook can
  greatly affect our mental health. Excessive use of social media can fuel
  anxiety, depression, FOMO, and other mental health issues. Research shows that
  loneliness, living alone, and poor social connections are as unhealthy as
  smoking 15 cigarettes a day and worse than being obese. Lonely people are more
  likely to suffer from heart disease, dementia, depression, and increase the
  risk of death at any given time by a whopping 29%.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  This project will address loneliness and mental health issues by building
  social networking platform that focuses on real social connections and
  emotional supports. We want to enable people to discover new routines and
  change their habits for the better through simple challenges, such as laughing
  with another person, getting hugs, share a meal, take walks together, holding
  hands, join groups with a common interest, volunteer, work on a hobby, take a
  class, practice small talks with a stranger, meditate, read, etc.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  In its first year, success will be measured based on: 1. Website and app
  development completion 2. Secure partnerships with senior care providers,
  LAUSD and other organizations 3. 100,000 challenges completed by the end of
  the grant period in August 2021.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '100000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '200000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  The initial project will focus on local and only a few specific challenges.
  During the grant period, the project aims to have 100,000 challenges completed
  by residents. Given that in 2018, just over 64 percent of LA County adults
  reported receiving sufficient social and emotional support and this figure has
  remained consistent over the past decade. If we can only connect 100,000 out
  of over 600,000 LAUSD students with at least 100,000 seniors out of over 1.3
  million seniors in LA County, this would at minimum increase the metric target
  by one percent. This would be a one-on-one direct impact since it will involve
  formal connections or partnerships between organizations. The vision of this
  project is to be a global challenges app that enables all citizens of the
  world to challenge one another to say, do and be good to themselves, their
  family and friends, strangers, and the environment.
