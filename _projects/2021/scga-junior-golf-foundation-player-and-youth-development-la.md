title: SCGA Junior Golf Foundation - Player and Youth Development LA
project_summary: >-
  The SCGA Junior Golf Foundation’s Player and Youth Development program uses
  golf as a vehicle to develop successful kids by creating a safe, engaged
  community that inspires our youth through mentorship and empowerment. We
  create equity in the game by bringing an affordable, all-inclusive golf
  program to communities of need. Through intentional golf and positive youth
  development curriculums, we promote healthy lifestyles, high-impact character
  attributes and connections to local role models.

  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  The Foundation is committed to equity, diversity and inclusion in golf. We see
  that girls, minorities and low-income households have limited participation in
  and access to the game. We believe that every kid in Southern California, no
  matter their circumstances, should have the opportunity to pursue the game and
  experience the positive impact it can have. We do this by making the game
  affordable and accessible for youth in underreached communities. Children in
  underserved neighborhoods have limited access to play spaces, including parks.
  With registration fees, equipment and uniform costs, youth sports leagues can
  be expensive and those who need youth sports the most have the least access.
  We are intentional in these communities where golf is not the primary sport,
  and many are unaware that a local golf facility is close by. Additionally, in
  underserved communities the cost to play golf is a barrier to entry and we
  ensure that no child is turned away due to finances.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  The Player & Youth Development (PYD) program creates equity in the game by
  bringing an affordable, all-inclusive golf program into underserved
  communities. Through intentional golf and positive youth development
  curriculums, we promote healthy lifestyles, high-impact character attributes
  and connections to local role models. Our PYD communities (Southeast LA and
  San Fernando Valley) are underserved based on their ethnic makeup, economic
  status and other risk factors. Our program serves youth in Norwalk, Pico
  Rivera, Downey, Whittier and Van Nuys; and exists to lift the economic burden
  for families and encourage equity in golf. We host four, 8-week instruction
  sessions annually, serving youth ages 5-18 and accommodating all skill levels.
  Each session includes free on-course play days, club fittings, golf skill
  assessments and affordable access to practice and play outside of class.
  Program fees align with our communities to ensure that programming is
  affordable and comparable to other extracurricular activities. We provide
  financial assistance to anyone in need, so no one is turned away. Our coaches
  are the most integral part of our success. It is critical to hire coaches who
  are from the community and not only look like our participants but have
  experiences that our youth can relate to. 100% of our coaches hired from the
  communities we work in, 35% are past program participants. Golf experience is
  not required; all are trained in golf skill and positive youth development.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  In 2020, 39% of our program participants were Latino and 37% were female,
  compared to the national average of 24% in golf. We keep the game affordable
  by offering financial assistance to all who have need, ensuring that no one is
  ever turned away. In 2020, 21% of our families were on financial assistance
  and we supplemented more than $40,000 in financial aid. Additionally, we
  continue to research the measurable outcomes of our programming through
  research with Claremont Graduate University PhD candidates. Our outcomes are
  tracked using surveys and interviews with parents and participants. The
  initial study showed that participants see increased positive outcomes in five
  major areas: cognitive-behavioral, social, emotional, relationship and
  golf-specific skills. The positive attributes youth see and receive from our
  coaches will show in the number of youth served and the growth of the program.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1500'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1800'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Golf has historically limited access to groups of individuals based on
  ethnicity, gender and socioeconomic status. Our work creates community,
  belonging, and increased capacity and skills for success. Los Angeles County
  will be more inclusive, equitable and diverse as our kids become connected
  with each other, coaches, volunteers and supporters. Lessons youth learn from
  golf are instilled for life. We are committed and invested in research to
  study our program outcomes, we are engaging in analysis of our outcomes to
  understand how our positive youth development translates to the participant’s
  success beyond the course, by decreasing risky behaviors and increasing
  graduation rates. We are developing youth through our golf and positive youth
  development curriculum, and training many of them to become the next program
  leaders. We continue to provide opportunities to coaches for professional
  growth, community development and economic security, as many work while
  pursuing higher education.
