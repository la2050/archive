  Putting Public Lands in Public Hands: United Neighbors in Defense Against
  Displacement (UNIDAD)
project_summary: >-
  The UNIDAD (United Neighbors in Defense Against Displacement) Coalition
  supports development without displacement. As we emerge from a devastating
  pandemic that hit neighborhoods like South LA the hardest, it is more
  important than ever that we leverage public land for the public good. UNIDAD
  will educate and mobilize South LA residents to support community led
  development on public land that creates affordable housing, good jobs, green
  space, clean air, small business opportunities, and better, healthier
  neighborhoods for the same neighbors.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
  - City of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a citywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Low income people have been excluded from housing and land ownership through
  redlining, racial covenants, and most recently through predatory lending and
  foreclosure practices, leading to increased poverty, displacement, and
  homelessness in communities of color. The pandemic and resulting economic
  situation have also created ideal conditions for even more rapid displacement
  as investors search for real estate "bargains" in gentrifying areas. Corrupt
  landlords harass hard-working families and neglect buildings while charging
  exorbitant rents; activists hear stories about cockroaches in children's ears
  and teenagers with rat bites. The residents who created these vibrant
  neighborhoods are now being forced out of them. A great opportunity exists to
  address these inequities by leveraging public land for community-serving
  development, but all too often local residents are outmaneuvered by canny
  outsiders who know the system and can gain control of valuable public assets
  for their own gain.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  In the wake of the pandemic and economic downturn, some LA elected officials
  have voiced an interest in directing “public land for the public good” by
  using government owned land to build affordable housing and drive community
  serving economic development. This is a huge opportunity to create safe,
  healthy neighborhoods for downtrodden communities; thousands of lots in LA,
  including under-used parcels like parking lots, are owned by public entities.
  This use of public land could provide much needed jobs, small business
  opportunities, and affordable housing. To realize these opportunities,
  community members must show their support and fight for truly community
  serving development while forestalling the efforts of outside investors to
  seize these resources first. The UNIDAD coalition will spread awareness of
  this opportunity through outreach, organizing, education, and leadership
  development. We will focus on: 1) supporting motions by City and County
  elected officials to identify public land suitable for community-serving
  development; 2) fighting to ensure all publicly owned land in South LA is used
  for parks or green space or has an affordable housing requirement and 3)
  educating community members about a government-owned lot, formerly a beloved
  public library, slated to be sold to a hotel developer. The UNIDAD Coalition
  will develop community leaders who can engage in civic decision making about
  land use and successfully work to ensure public land is used for the public
  good.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  We will measure success first by our ability to educate community members
  about the importance of public land for the public good in the following ways:
  1) we will alert at least 8,000 South LA residents about public land and its
  importance to the community through social media, flyering, community
  meetings, and door-knocking; 2) 100 residents will participate in specific
  activities, such as our "Peoples Planning School," that educate tenants about
  land use law and civic participation; and 3) 200 residents will engage with
  elected officials to urge them to use public land for the public good,
  including an historic library site slated for hotel development. We will
  measure our success at securing public land for the public good by the passage
  of motions at the City and County of Los Angeles identifying parcels suitable
  for development, and by ensuring that NO public land is developed in South LA
  without a green space or affordable housing requirement attached to it.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '8000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '300000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  We will address historic and systemic inequity by supporting residents in
  efforts to allocate public land for the public good, building a model for how
  development can be equitable. Los Angeles is one of the most productive cities
  in the world. Our growth and energy come from the people who live here, and
  the time has come to honor their contributions by prioritizing the needs of
  the communities that, knit together, compose the greater community of LA. In
  the past, the allocation of land and development practices have — much to our
  sorrow — been shaped by greed and corruption, in part because the opacity of
  decision making around land use favors the rich and powerful. Through the
  involvement of community members, we will change the way that public resources
  are used, and development happens in this city, by successfully advocating for
  community-serving uses of public land that not only provide real material
  benefits for residents but are an example of how development can work in LA.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  SAJE will educate residents on land use and the planning process at both the
  City and County of Los Angeles, and research current legislative efforts to
  identify public land to be used for the public good. TRUST South LA will
  educate residents on alternative forms of land ownership, especially land
  trusts. Esperanza will train community health educators who focus on the built
  environment. CD Tech will provide technical expertise on local, small
  businesses and economic development. Staff from all agencies will contribute
  to education and outreach materials for community residents, participate in
  social media work and community meetings, train residents as spokespeople, and
  facilitate resident engagement with elected officials through petitions and
  participation in public hearings.
