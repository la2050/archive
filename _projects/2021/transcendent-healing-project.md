project_summary: >-
  The Transcendent Healing Project, a collaboration of 3 Lines Collective and
  Wholistic Health Collaborative, aims to support youth of color in healing
  racial trauma through various forms of self expression. Youth aged 14-18 will
  attend afterschool programming that provides a safe space for discussing
  issues related to race and racism with the support of a licensed therapist.
  Healing will take place through discussion, creation of art and media, and
  participation in improv and creative writing classes.

'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  The death of George Floyd in May 2020 served as an awakening for many people,
  catapulting the Black Lives Matter movement into a global spotlight. But
  tragically, for many people of color, George Floyd’s death was just another
  event in a long line of racial trauma they experience throughout their lives.
  Witnessing or being the direct target of racism is a well-researched
  determinant of physical and emotional health among people of color. According
  to the American Academy of Pediatrics, racism has a particularly significant
  impact on youth, including increased rates of infant mortality, depression,
  anxiety, ADHD, and other mental health issues. The door has been opened for
  dialogue among youth about race and racism in America, and many have taken to
  social media to express their experiences and opinions. But this is not
  enough; safe places must be intentionally created to allow youth of color to
  express themselves and heal from the racial trauma they experience on a daily
  basis.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  The Transcendent Healing Project (THP) combines positive youth development
  programming with therapeutic elements, providing youth with a safe space to
  discuss and process issues related to race and racism. Youth will attend
  weekly 1 hour virtual afterschool sessions (moving to in-person as
  restrictions allow), where they will discuss past experiences with race, with
  the guidance of licenced therapists before participating in creative arts
  activities as a tool for expression and healing. Youth will have the
  opportunity to create pieces of art and writing throughout their sessions,
  leading to the production of a zine which will be distributed to the
  community. Creative writing and improv lessons will be led by experienced
  instructors that have seen success in related programming. When 3 Lines has
  led virtual creative arts classes in the past, many youth wanted to discuss
  issues related to personal trauma, which the instructors felt unprepared to
  address. Incorporating licensed therapists into the program will provide youth
  the support they need to move out of their negative feelings into growth and
  action. THP will also bring their work to the community through contact-free
  monthly drive-through resource events, where books and groceries will be
  distributed to those in need. The resource bags will include reading materials
  that focus on topics of equity and inclusion, including books written by
  people of color, in addition to youth-produced writing.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  While similar programming has been piloted on a small scale, THP is still an
  early-stage project. Qualitative data indicating success was collected through
  therapist notes and discussions about how the sessions were progressing.
  Self-esteem among participants was observed to increase significantly
  throughout the course of the programming, with therapists indicating that
  youth became more open and confident in trying new things. All participants in
  THP will complete an evidence-based teen risk and protective factors checklist
  before and after their 8 week session. Teens will indicate which statements
  are true for them, such as “I feel good about myself” and “I feel positive
  about my future”. Improvement will be shown in at least two areas by the end
  of their sessions, either through adding a protective factor or eliminating a
  risk factor. In addition, formal research will be conducted by a Psychologist,
  which will be published to address the impact of THP on youth mental health.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '400'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '2000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  According to the Afterschool Alliance, nearly 362,000 additional children in
  LA would attend afterschool programs if one were available, and 79% of parents
  indicate that these programs reduce the likelihood that youth will engage in
  risky behaviors. With key protective factors associated with participation in
  afterschool programs such as academic support and connection with positive
  adult role models, THP’s afterschool program will contribute to the positive
  development of LA County’s young residents. Feelings of alienation and low
  self-esteem, often experienced by youth of color, are known risk factors for
  youth. THP’s therapeutic component will allow youth to develop positive coping
  skills, which they can then share with peers, increasing the mental health of
  the community as a whole. THP's food and resource distribution will also
  impact community health outcomes; with nearly 2 million residents affected by
  food insecurity (LA Food Bank), THP aims to provide assistance in this area.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  Wholistic Health Collaborative (WHC), founded by licensed Psychologist
  Dr.Emily Shum, provides individual, family, and group therapy and
  psychological assessment services. Dr.Shum, along with a small team of
  licensed therapists, will provide staffing for THP sessions, guiding
  therapeutic conversations with the participants. Therapists will also take
  notes during sessions, to be used to assess the impact of the programming
  through a formal research paper to be submitted to a peer-reviewed
  professional journal.
