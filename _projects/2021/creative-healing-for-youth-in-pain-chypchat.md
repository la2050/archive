title: 'Creative Healing for Youth in Pain: CHYPchat'
project_summary: >-
  To meet the demands exacerbated by COVID-19, Creative Healing for Youth in
  Pain (CHYP) is looking to expand its current online social groups for teens.
  Isolation has always been an issue for teens dealing with pain, anxiety,
  stress, and depression, but this pandemic has shrunken available supports -
  especially in the context of peer interactions! The CHYPchat program provides
  a virtual space for teens to socialize in a safe and monitored space, with the
  added benefit of guided psychoeducational resources and collaborative creative
  spaces.

  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  The isolation that the world has experienced during the pandemic is something
  that teens with chronic pain have felt for years and will continue to feel.
  Chronic pain is a seemingly invisible ailment, caused by an overactive nervous
  system, which affects 35% of teens in the Los Angeles area. Pain can be
  disabling whether from cancer, sickle cell, Crohn’s, headaches, abdominal
  pain, or musculoskeletal pain. Modern science has shown that pain circuits in
  the brain can get “turned on” by pain and then intensify the pain because the
  pain circuits don’t “turn off.” Families spend considerable time going to
  multiple doctors for exams and tests -- paying high out-of-pocket costs -- but
  the child remains in pain. Pain causes isolation from peers, along with stress
  and sleep issues, and COVID-19 has only increased these problems. Anxiety,
  depression, and suicide rates in teens have escalated. Studies show that 70%
  of teens with significant pain will continue having that pain into adulthood.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Creative Healing for Youth in Pain’s (CHYP) program utilizes evidence-based,
  creative healing techniques -- dancing, art expression, songwriting,
  filmmaking, journaling -- to harness a teen’s creative spirit to help
  alleviate chronic pain and improve daily functioning. Using the brain in
  creative ways has been shown to alter the brain’s pain signals in a more
  lasting way than most medications. Providing online programs helps teens
  re-engage socially, while finding passion in creative arts. CHYP created an
  online platform in order to reach as many teens with chronic pain as possible
  -- teens whose families can’t access practitioners or afford treatments. CHYP
  features a unique online community -- called “CHYPchat” -- where teens with
  chronic pain meet through Zoom for an eight-week program. The first four
  sessions are structured as a psychoeducational group, guided by a lead
  facilitator and a peer mentor. The program covers important topics such as the
  mind/body connection, mental health, and stress management -- with an approach
  specifically built for teens -- while instilling new ways to think about their
  own strengths, self-care, self-expression, and strategies for finding hope.
  The following four sessions focus on social connectedness, teen discussions of
  their issues, and support for each other’s path to wellness. This provides an
  open forum for teens to interact and enjoy time with others virtually, from
  the comfort of their own homes.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  CHYPchat has been offered in a variety of forms: weekly socialization groups,
  Creative Healing Workshops, and Summer Camp. Participant feedback through
  online surveys has been the main form of measurement for success and has
  guided the evolution of such services. 100% of respondents state they would
  like to continue participating in CHYP programs, and the weekly attendance
  illustrates the group members’ enthusiasm. When asked to describe in one word
  how CHYP teens feel about CHYPchats, most identified, “community, friendship,
  inclusive, inspirational, and helpful.” With this CHYPchat expansion, focusing
  on a specific cohort that completes a program cycle together, the definition
  and measurements for success will be adjusted. The program will be considered
  successful if at least 60% of participants complete their designated cycle.
  Furthermore, the program will be deemed effective if at least 50% of
  participants report improved feelings of connectedness during a pre- and
  post-survey.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '48'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '480'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Chronic pain in teens affects quality of life: school, friendships, physical
  activities, family life, sleep, mood, anxiety, eating behaviors, substance
  misuse for some. It is estimated that as many as 35% of U.S. teens have
  chronic pain. The annual economic cost of adolescent chronic pain is $19.5
  billion. Los Angeles is a diverse community filled with a wide variety of
  families. Recruitment for this project will target low-income families - and
  even offer free tablets for 15 teens who may not otherwise have had the
  opportunity to join an online community due to inadequate resources. Chronic
  pain not only robs a teen of their childhood, it stifles their development
  into a fully functioning, productive adult. With CHYP, teens suffering from
  chronic pain have an online place to gain support and strength, and be
  inspired to conquer their chronic pain. CHYP will be able to spread a message
  of hope to Los Angeles residents that there is an accessible option to help
  teens with chronic pain.
