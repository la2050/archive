What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  We created a more inclusive community of filmmakers committed to empowering
  girls and non-binary youth behind the camera with the goal of eradicating
  gender disparity in the industry. Annenberg Institute confirms the problem:
  “Hollywood movies perpetuate a lack of inclusive representation of those from
  underrepresented racial/ethnic groups, girls and women, the LGBTQ community,
  and individuals with disabilities.” In Variety, Dave McNary wrote, “Men
  comprised 68% and women 32% of all directors, writers, producers, executive
  producers, editors, and cinematographers working on films in festivals in
  2018-19.” He added that on films directed by women 72% of writers and 45% of
  editors were women as opposed to 11% & 21% on male directed films. To end the
  gross underrepresentation, youth need support and training early in order to
  penetrate the odds that are stacked against them. As future content leaders
  they will inspire more girls, shape the stories told and help define our
  culture.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  We increase the power of women in the film industry by creating a pipeline
  connecting, educating and preparing them to win jobs that typically go to men
  in technical positions and leadership roles such as directing, writing,
  producing and cinematography. To attain equity, our programs include diverse
  groups of girls and non-binary youth ages 12-18 and provide financial hardship
  scholarships. Our 3-week summer film intensive is taught by top professionals,
  some Emmy-winning, who volunteer in all areas of production providing crucial
  training. Students form groups in a safe, virtual, collaborative environment
  creating festival-ready films using smart phones and cutting-edge tools. These
  films help students gain entry into top film schools and are screened at our
  virtual global festival providing exposure for this underserved demographic.
  “The Sound of Justice,” a feature produced in our pilot program premiered at
  OC’s Multicultural Film Fiesta and was accepted at Denver’s XicanIndie Film
  Fest. Our monthly workshops allow students to further hone their skills and we
  are creating an after-school film enrichment program to widen our reach all
  over LA across all socio-economic backgrounds. All alumni may join our Youth
  Board and serve as mentors along with our Board of Directors to create
  networking opportunities at an early age. This unparalleled pipeline is aimed
  at getting more girls paid jobs behind the camera so they can be better
  represented in front of the camera.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  “The Sound of Justice,” a feature produced in our pilot program premiered at
  OC’s Multicultural Film Fiesta and was accepted at Denver’s XicanIndie Film
  Fest. That, and a poignant short from our first 3-week intensive screened at
  our virtual film festival and received critical acclaim from industry
  professionals and the audience proving their high caliber. Our programs which
  include racially diverse girls and members of the LGBTQ community help
  students gain acceptance into top film schools and are accessible to those
  with disabilities. Festival invites and screenings help measure progress,
  provide filmmakers with invaluable experiences and show our impact. Alumni may
  join our Youth Board, train to become producers on our films and pay their
  knowledge forward as LA community leaders to end gender disparity in the film
  industry. Surveys and a new program app serve as macro indicators, tracking
  progress from LA middle schools to jobs and create a unique pipeline and
  networking database.

Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  In the short term our scholarship film intensive impacts girls and non-binary
  youth from all economic strata giving them training early to become fearless
  filmmakers in a safe space receiving professional mentorship, while creating
  their own festival-ready films. Training girls as industry leaders prepares
  them for prestigious universities, allows discovery of their specific niche
  area of interest and supplies contacts to the kind of jobs they want. Our
  monthly workshops and potential LA schools curriculum offer exceptional
  year-round film education and hands-on training. In the long term, we are
  impacting the film industry by training the next generation of minority
  filmmakers. By building our own pipeline of professional film projects we
  advance careers of our participants and alumni helping to close the Hollywood
  gender gap. The LA community is revitalized annually with our festival films
  that celebrate new and marginalized voices impacting our culture at large.
