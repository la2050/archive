title: 'The Source: Economic Stability for All'
project_summary: >-
  The Source is an online platform where prospective entrepreneurs and career
  builders are connected to coaches, business and career development videos,
  career building events, and more. Launched in Orange County, The Source is in
  the early launch phase, targeting low-income people and providing virtual
  opportunities to advance careers and/or launch a small business. We are
  seeking funding to pilot The Source in LA County and build out additional
  content so more people can find the support they need to pursue their economic
  goals.

project_video: ''
In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  The Source was already in development when the pandemic hit, and COVID-19 only
  further intensified the need for easily accessible, virtual career and
  business development opportunities. Many people do not have access to these
  resources, especially during this time of social distancing. Many have been
  forced to put their dreams of owning a small business or starting a new career
  on hold as they have struggled financially during the pandemic. Small business
  owners have been particularly hard hit; nearly 317,000 small businesses closed
  between February and September 2020 (UC Santa Cruz). And the US unemployment
  rate rose to almost 15% last year, worsening income inequality throughout the
  country. Low-income people are particularly in need of training and support to
  launch successful business ventures or careers, as they often have difficulty
  obtaining loans or accessing financial assistance due to low credit scores and
  poor financial history.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  The Source provides people in any community access to an experienced
  business/workforce coach and supplemental training services, helping to launch
  successful small businesses and new careers. Users are matched with advisors
  and other resources by topic, region, industry, spoken language, and other
  demographics. The Source also includes an in-app video library with webinars
  such as “Succeeding as an Entrepreneur;” “Mastering the Case Interview;” and
  “Optimizing Your LinkedIn Profile.” The Source can serve anyone anywhere. This
  allows us to address income inequality by reaching disadvantaged communities
  that do not have access to other job training programs to help level the
  playing field in the workforce. The Source is also particularly beneficial for
  women and minority entrepreneurs who face discrimination, disparities, and
  other challenges to their success. CIELO has developed strong partnerships
  with many banks, including Pacific Western Bank, Union Bank, and US Bank. We
  plan to leverage these partnerships by asking bank employees to serve as
  coaches on our platform, giving banks easy volunteer opportunities for their
  employees. This will also provide direct access to banks for users. The Source
  has launched in Orange County with community partners that connect their
  clients to the platform, and also recruit volunteers to serve as mentors. Our
  goal for 2021 is to pilot The Source in LA County to help more people succeed
  in entrepreneurship and their careers.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  The idea for The Source came from over five years of serving our local
  low-income community and learning from our clients what would benefit them
  most in their pursuit of economic self-sufficiency. Based on our evaluation,
  our clients were most successful when they received mentorship from an expert
  in their field. A pilot version of The Source was launched in July 2020 and in
  its early launch phase, The Source has 30 mentors, four partners using the
  system, and two classes live for clients. We are gathering data from the OC
  pilot and plan to survey all participants so we can incorporate their feedback
  into the operational phase, which will launch later in 2021 with at least
  three more partners. Moving forward, we will evaluate The Source’s success
  based on its ability to help clients achieve their personal goals, such as
  obtaining a new job, launching a new business, increasing income, and other
  hard measures of success related to goals set by clients during coaching
  sessions.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '500'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  By piloting The Source in LA County, LA will be home to more thriving small
  business start-ups and successful career builders. Our goal is to increase
  each user’s knowledge base and comfort level with managing their own career
  trajectory or launching their own business by accessing The Source’s video
  library and/or by connecting directly with key advisors relevant to their
  personal goals. These accessible online services are particularly beneficial
  to our target populations during the pandemic when many clients have lost
  their jobs or are struggling to keep their businesses profitable. We also hope
  to reduce income inequality across the county by empowering low-income people
  to stabilize their lives. By the end of the grant period, we hope to have 500
  total active users and coaches, at least five local partners, and fifteen
  classes live and available for users.
