title: BUILDING A TOOL LIBRARY IN COMPTON
project_summary: >-
  Buying tools you may only use once can be frustrating. If we could only borrow
  them, but from who? There are 200+ Tool Libraries across the nation, but none
  in Los Angeles! Tool Libraries aren’t just places to borrow tools for home and
  garden projects but to start a small business, to teach repair classes, to
  disperse emergency supplies when climate change events happen and to empower
  the community. So, let’s build some, starting in Compton!

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Applying a proven model or solution to a new issue or sector (e.g., using a
  job recruiting software or strategy to match clients to supportive housing
  sites, applying demonstrated strategies from advocating for college
  affordability to advocating for housing affordability and homelessness, etc.)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  The underserved community of Compton has a 20+% poverty level and 50+%
  homeownership. It suffers more severely from climate change events such as
  storms, flooding, and heat, due to homes being uninsulated, lack of
  air-conditioning, old roofing, and little to no energy efficiencies. The
  residents and nearby neighborhoods need an affordable way to update and repair
  their homes and be empowered to respond to disasters quickly by having access
  to emergency tools and supplies. Compton is also a community that is
  interested in re-branding itself for its notorious reputation. The city and
  its residents need resources to re-built itself, one home/one business at a
  time.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  We will build a 1,200 square foot Tool Library in the City of Compton as a
  template for others to be built in the LA region. The model will copy the
  longstanding Berkley Tool Library as they have been the prototype for
  Oakland’s, Portland’s, and Seattle’s Tool Library. We will offer 3,500+
  hardware, landscaping and crafting tools to accommodate home and garden
  projects, small business development, and emergency supplies. We will partner
  with EntreNous Youth Empowerment Services, to provide staffing, as a paid
  internship program to their YouthBuild students. Once built, we will offer DIY
  classes, and hold quarterly repair café events with volunteer support from
  local experts. Rediscover Center, a kid’s makerspace in Venice has offered to
  support us in the development of the library, as they have 10 years of
  experience in a similar operation and an Executive Director with a Degree in
  Library Science. Additionally, they will participate in regular Repair Café
  events to support local kids’ tool learning and making. Operations will be
  supported through late fees, sliding scale membership for users outside the
  City of Compton, tool manufactures sponsorships, and grants from the Community
  for Career Development for the internship program. LA2050 funding, will
  finalize a lease agreement, begin the renovation of the space, and purchase
  the shelving, equipment, software, initial tools and a giant sign - 2021

'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  We have surveyed and will implement the best strategies from seven very
  successful tool library operations for their membership, cost to operate, and
  volunteer services. Our unique part is our collaboration with Compton
  YouthBuild to support staffing. We have based our initial tool inventory and
  protocols from the 40-year-old Berkeley Tool Library. Once built, we will
  track and analyze data on the frequency of tools borrowed, types of projects,
  and demographics of the members (Skill level, gender, and age). This will help
  hone tool replacement frequency, and quantity needs. Tracking the projects and
  demographics will help refine tool training, types of DIY classes, and
  outreach mode and messaging. This data will support development for other Tool
  Libraries in the region. A common Tool Library App – myturn.com, will be used
  to gather data, manage tool inventory and memberships. We will also gather
  data at the service counter for training needs and project types.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '5000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '15000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Once the Compton Library is operational, other cities will begin opening their
  own Tool Library and possibly copy our model. We will support this effort
  through social media outreach and direct calls to city Libraries and home
  improvement nonprofits. This in turn will create a network of tool libraries
  to expand climate change resiliency for the entire region. Furthermore, tools
  will be available throughout Los Angeles, not only for resiliency and home
  improvements but also to sustain family career pathways. The Library will have
  tools for people wanting to start a small business such as; handyman,
  landscaping, or carpet installation to name a few. To further support small
  business development, our Tool Library will also have some tools for craft
  Makers to borrow; various types of sewing machines, vinyl cutters, sublimation
  presses, and so on. Tool Libraries will become as common in Los Angeles as
  they are in Northern California.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  EntreNous Youth Empowerment Services, Inc. operates the Compton YouthBuild.
  They will fund and create a paid on-the-job internship program, for students
  to work at the Tool Library. The interns will be trained to manage the tool
  inventory and database, provide customer support, help customers learn to use
  the tools safely, and participate in the repair café events. YouthBuild
  students will gain confidence, expand their network, and may begin to create
  their own side businesses. Rediscover Center is a kid’s makerspace in Venice,
  CA. They want to expand their reach into underserved communities and will
  bring child-centered tools and makerspace programs to the library. The
  Executive Director has a degree in Library Science and will support the
  development of the operations and inventory.
Which of LA2050’s resources will be of the most value to you?: >-
  Access to the LA2050 community,Communications support,Capacity-building and
  training,Volunteer recruitment
Please list the organizations collaborating on this proposal.:
  - EntreNous Youth Empowerment Services
