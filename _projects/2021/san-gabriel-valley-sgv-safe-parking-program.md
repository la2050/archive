title: San Gabriel Valley (SGV) Safe Parking Program
project_summary: >-
  Currently there are no safe parking programs in the San Gabriel Valley, yet
  housing providers acknowledge a need for more creative efforts to ease the
  homeless crisis and help unhoused people rebuild their lives and reengage with
  their communities. We envision a model small-scale, cost effective
  collaborative program between a service provider and a faith-based
  organization that would allot spaces for overnight safe parking, creating a
  pathway to stable housing and reengagement for people sleeping in their
  vehicles.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - San Gabriel Valley
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Pilot or new project, program, or initiative (testing or implementing a new
  idea)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  In the San Gabriel Valley, 1,241 people live in 675 vehicles. Despite the
  urgent need, there have been no safe parking programs in SGV prior to this
  pilot program. Safe parking not only offers stability such as a place to park,
  safety through paid security, reengagement with community members from the
  faith-based and/or host site organizations, good night's rest without worry of
  being harassed, ticketed, or towed, but safe parking also helps create a path
  to becoming housed. While the ultimate goal of the safe parking program is to
  ensure affordable and sustainable housing through its connection and network
  of case management and housing provider services, the COVID-19 pandemic has
  created another layer and acute need for solutions like safe parking to be
  implemented because congregate shelters offer less protection from the virus.
  In fact, sleeping in a vehicle may be a healthier option than sleeping in a
  congregate shelter or on the street.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  With the collaboration of Foothill Unity Center, Trinity Lutheran Church and
  MHCH's SGV Safe Parking Committee, a pilot program is being launched in
  Pasadena to become a model, showing how working together with faith-based
  organizations can help solve homelessness on a small scale, one parking space
  at a time. Through this pilot program, the following services will be
  provided: designated overnight parking spaces, case management, food, housing
  navigation, problem solving interventions, paid security, partnerships that
  help to re-weave the relational network, charging stations, a place to receive
  mail, and possibly showers and laundry services. The overall goal of this
  program is to develop a model to be replicated in order to help with the
  homeless crisis. Through current resources and leveraging we are able to
  provide the pilot program for four months. This grant will support a team that
  will assure the continuation and growth of this program and will support the
  assessments and development of a sustainable plan and a plan for replication
  anywhere. The collaborative will be supported in outreach efforts and
  identifying future sites and funding sources. Our commitment is build a strong
  cost effective collaboration with tools needed for a well-run, high-quality
  program that looks at the whole person in order to transform lives.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Foothill Unity utilizes its client services management system (CSMS) to track
  case management, services, and outcomes for participants enrolled in its
  programs. Foothill will query and pull demographic data, program enrollments,
  completed surveys/evaluations, etc. and present reports. Foothill Unity Center
  operates in a network with other providers to help unhoused participants
  secure housing such as rapid rehousing or permanent supportive housing.
  Participants consent to their information being entered into the Homeless
  Maintenance Information System (HMIS) and to the network discussions and
  coordination of services through the coordinated entry system (CES) process.
  Foothill Unity Center staff will pull reports, complete the vulnerable index
  service prioritization decision assistance tool (VI SPDAT) assessment, enter
  notes, build relationships, and evaluate the success of the program through
  use of the evaluation tool created through the safe parking partnership.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '30'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '150'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  The first major impact of this program will be the reduction of people
  experiencing homelessness. Those in the program will live more stable and
  productive lives, contributing to the community in a a myriad of ways
  including positive contributions into the health of the community. Fewer
  people experiencing homelessness will mean less stress on our healthcare and
  social services systems and more resources freed up for recreational, arts,
  and education programs that will contribute to the vibrancy of the San Gabriel
  Valley area. In addition, volunteers and churches will benefit by growing in
  their capacity to reach out to some of our most vulnerable neighbors of our
  community; through safe parking, the vision that meets that need to give
  becomes viable. A whole new group of people will have an experience of knowing
  people in different circumstances, creating a more diverse and, therefore,
  stronger community in the SGV that has an experience of pulling together and
  leaving no one behind.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  Foothill Unity Center will provide staff, administrative oversight, as well
  will coordinate with the many community partner service providers, provider
  networks and consortiums, college/university intern programs, and governmental
  entities. Foothill Unity Center staff will have the full support of all
  services provided at the agency. The Safe Parking Committee of MHCH will reach
  out to city governments, identify future sites and funding sources, and
  conduct public outreach to help establish sustainability and expansion of the
  program.
