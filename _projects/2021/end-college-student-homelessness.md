title: End College Student Homelessness
project_summary: >-
  LA Room & Board is on a mission to end housing insecurity among community
  college students. In 2020, we achieved our ambitious goal to open Opportunity
  House, an affordable live-learn community in Westwood that helps students
  overcome barriers and graduate with stability. We formed a strong network of
  nonprofit partners and quickly filled our space to capacity. Now, in response
  to ongoing demand, we are scaling our unique model – not just to house more
  students, but to formalize, with our network, a replicable solution to student
  homelessness.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  The need for safe, affordable housing among LA County’s community college
  student population is significant: 1 in 5 report facing housing insecurity and
  homelessness. When we opened the doors to Opportunity House in September 2020,
  we received 350 applications for our 50-bed facility. Pandemic restrictions
  required us to limit our initial intake to 20 students, but we have an
  80-person waitlist ready to fill our capacity as soon as regulations allow.
  Housing stability is essential not only for immediate wellbeing, but for
  setting students up for long-term success. When survival and safety needs
  aren't met, individuals have difficulty learning, planning, and thinking about
  the future. We believe this is a key factor contributing to the fact that
  upwards of 70% of community college students statewide fail to graduate or
  transfer. This puts them at risk for long-term negative outcomes, while our
  communities miss out on the talent, energy, and potential these young people
  have to offer.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Funding will help us meet rapidly growing demand following the launch of our
  first location. The Los Angeles Community College District is interested in
  having us open a second location at Marymount California University to house
  30 additional students. We believe our unique model can help establish a
  replicable solution for ending college student homelessness regionally,
  statewide, and even nationally. We leverage existing resources through
  agreements with community colleges and four-year universities that reimagine
  the use of vacant dorm rooms or nearby campus housing. Opportunity House, our
  first location, is a converted, formerly vacant sorority house near UCLA. More
  than provide an affordable option, we create a thriving community. Recognizing
  that our students often lack financial, family, or social resources, we
  maximize their time in the shared space with support that promotes degree
  completion and builds life skills and a foundation for self-sufficiency. Our
  network of local nonprofits provide healthy meals, tutoring, mental health
  support, career development, mentorship, and financial literacy. Thanks to our
  partners' belief in our vision, over the last year they provided services on a
  volunteer basis to help us develop proof of concept. Now, with strong initial
  data and growing demand, we can begin to honor these partnerships with formal,
  paid agreements as we scale.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  We utilize a robust evaluation system designed by our founder Sam Prater, who
  has 13 years of experience in higher education, plus a doctorate in
  educational leadership and policy. Upon joining our community, students
  complete an intake assessment, demonstrating current housing status, readiness
  for self-sufficiency, GPA, mental health, financial wellbeing, etc. These
  assessments guide our delivery of individualized supportive services. Our
  primary goal is to improve the trajectory of degree completion among community
  college students. Initial results from our first semester shows we are on the
  right track: • 77% of students ended the fall semester with a GPA of 3.0 or
  higher • 58% increased their GPA • 85% of attempted credits were earned In
  addition, 73% of students improved financial wellbeing, and we also observed
  initial decreases in PTSD and depression. We will continue to track student
  progress in each area of support provided by our nonprofit partners.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '80'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '40'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  While our short-term goal is to open a second site housing 30 students, we
  ultimately envision an end to student homelessness in LA County. Over the next
  year, we will build additional proof of concept needed to continue expanding
  our model throughout the county, particularly as students face continuing
  economic hardship due to the pandemic. By providing a thriving transitional
  housing solution, we set them up for success and prevent longer-term
  homelessness. By utilizing existing, vacant spaces, we create win-win
  partnerships that meet student needs, while helping colleges maximize
  facilities to meet revenue goals and making efficient use of philanthropic
  donations. After expanding locally, we eventually aim to be a center for
  excellence that advises leaders outside LA on building similar models in their
  communities. We also seek to raise awareness with elected officials,
  institutes of higher education, and nonprofits to influence public policy
  aimed at homelessness prevention.
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  We currently partner with the following nonprofit organizations to provide a
  full spectrum of support to our students: – Tutor Me LA provides academic

  provides workshops and 1-1 and group mentoring to help students build social
  capital and positive relationships with caring adult – Ready to Succeed LA
  helps students explore career pathways and connect with industry
  professionals, many of whom are former foster youth themselves We will
  continue building essential service partnerships throughout Los Angeles County
  as we scale to new locations.
