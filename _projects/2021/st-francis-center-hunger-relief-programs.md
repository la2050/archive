title: St. Francis Center Hunger Relief Programs
project_summary: >-
  One in four Angelenos suffers from food insecurity, which is now exacerbated
  by the pandemic. St. Francis Center provides hunger relief services through
  our breakfast and pantry programs to our surrounding community. But we don't
  only serve food, we also provide comprehensive services such as showers,
  rental and utility assistance, phone access, and longer-term case management
  interventions. Our services help individuals and families improve their lives,
  and the overall health and stability of the surrounding community.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - South LA
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Before the COVID-19 pandemic, L.A. already had the largest food-insecure
  population in the nation, with one in five people living with food insecurity.
  Now in the current COVID-19 climate, this has jumped to one in four
  households. One hundred percent of the guests that St. Francis Center (SFC)
  serves are homeless or extremely low-income. Anecdotally, we are aware that a
  large percentage of our guests are undocumented, and as they are not eligible
  for government assistance, pantry programs like ours are the last resort. As
  SFC continues to navigate through the pandemic, our mission to be a reliable
  source of hunger relief and comprehensive support services for our community
  is more important than ever. A quote from a guest illustrates the need, "My
  husband has been in the hospital. He has been there for a few weeks, and we
  had no money. We didn't know what to do. We didn't think we would be able to
  afford food. This service is a really big deal for us."
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Our breakfast program provides the homeless with warm, nutritious meals and
  sack lunches six days a week. Last year we served 75,000 meals to guests in a
  modified to-go format to ensure social distancing. Our mobile shower partner,
  the CARE team through the City of LA, provides on-site showers every Tuesday.
  Our resource team distributes hygiene kits during breakfast hours, and hosts a
  resource table located outside the center to offer supportive services to our
  guests. SFC provides hunger relief services through our weekly on-site pantry
  services, bimonthly satellite pantries at four partner locations, and pop-up
  pantries on an “as-needed” basis in food deserts throughout L.A. Pantry
  program recipients receive an average of 60 pounds of fresh, nutritious
  groceries once a week. In 2020, we experienced a staggering 70% increase in
  the number of visits to our pantry programs, accommodating 39,583 visits
  compared to 22,415 visits in 2019. All of SFC’s hunger relief programs provide
  an opportunity to introduce individuals and families to SFC’s supportive
  services, giving them access to tools to improve their lives. Resources
  include hygiene kits, DMV ID vouchers, emergency clothing, phone access,
  transportation, information and resources, as well as rental and utility
  assistance. Use of these services increased 60% last year, from 1,335 visits
  in 2019 to 2,140 in 2020, illustrating in stark numbers the economic impact of
  the pandemic.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Program staff counts the number of meals and pantry boxes distributed and
  records them daily. All Pantry Service guests are registered within our
  program and we record the number and frequency of program visits. Pantry
  Service guests are required to complete an internal census recording household
  size, monthly income, rent, number of children, ethnicity, etc. All resource
  services that are provided are recorded in Los Angeles Homeless Services
  Authority’s Homeless Management System. SFC program staff conduct surveys with
  all recipients of pantry services through an annual internal census and
  provide evaluations as part of our rental and utility assistance program. We
  have consistent open conversations to find out about the needs of families and
  individuals and ways to incorporate this feedback into more client-centered
  services. For example, within the last year, with feedback from our community,
  we developed our pantry delivery program and Tuesday diaper distribution.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '50000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '0'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Our vision is to reduce food insecurity in our community while providing our
  guests with tools to facilitate healthy living and tools to enable stable
  living. This year, we aim to host at least 40,000 total visits to our pantry
  programs and encourage consistent weekly use of our program. Each pantry
  program recipient will receive at least 60 pounds of groceries (primarily
  focusing on fresh produce, meat, and dairy) each visit. We will provide
  resource and utility assistance to 130 families. Through our homeless
  breakfast program, we will provide 64,000 warm, wholesome breakfasts and
  lunches to our guests. We will distribute at least 2,500 hygiene kits to our
  homeless guests during the program. We will provide resource services to 1,475
  guests and case management to 25 guests. These resources assist with health
  and human service needs, reducing stress and increasing awareness of
  opportunities. This leads to less homelessness and a greater chance for guests
  to improve their situation.
