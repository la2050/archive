title: Expanding Job Opportunities to Include the Developmentally Disabled Population
project_summary: >-
  With 85% of people who have developmental disabilities unable to find
  employment, Mychal’s Learning Place has taken a leadership role in creating
  job training opportunities for this population in LA. We have two successful
  ventures – a café/bakery and a print shop – that are providing essential work
  skills to increase the employability and independence of our participants.
  Beyond simply getting our ventures back in business after the pandemic,
  Mychal’s has critical expansion plans underway for both operations for the
  coming year.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South Bay
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Independence is one of the most valued goals for any life and for most young
  adults independence means employment that offers opportunities to make a
  productive contribution to society. But for many developmentally disabled
  people their education and training simply do not prepare them for employment
  in the community. A Cornell University survey shows only 15.7% of people with
  independent living disabilities have employment and a separate online survey
  of 5,000 people showed a similar result – only 15% of those with developmental
  disabilities find employment, despite the fact that more than half seek it.
  That obstacle has a wide-ranging effect. Those with developmental disabilities
  face a lifetime of dependence and the burden is on society to support them. It
  doesn’t have to be that way. Mychal’s Learning Place successfully promotes
  independent living for all our participants, including job training,
  experience and placement for young people transitioning into adulthood.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  In recent years, Mychal’s Learning Place has taken a leadership role in
  training young adults with developmental disabilities for employment in the
  community. Through targeted ventures, including partnerships with local
  businesses, we have placed well-trained young people in internships and jobs
  that would have once been assumed to be beyond their reach. Mychal’s knows
  that the key to success for this population’s desire for meaningful work is
  often not ability or ambition but time and effort in training. Therefore, our
  most successful job ventures are those that Mychal’s develops and runs,
  allowing for one-on-one training to master job skills. Mychal’s Bakery &
  Coffee trains baristas and bakers to run and supply a mobile café that makes
  stops throughout the South Bay. Our baristas serve the public, handle money
  and credit cards, and operate a cash register. Bakers learn bulk production in
  a commercial kitchen, food packaging, and food storage and handling. The
  bakery also has a catering service and sells baked goods in local stores. All
  trainees must pass the exams for a California Food Handler card. Mychal’s
  Prints is a digital printing operation that produces custom stamped items like
  t-shirts, masks and mugs for companies, groups and events. Trainees learn to
  operate a direct-to-garment printer, t-shirt pre-treat machine, heat press and
  an embroidery machine. We plan to expand product placement for the bakery and
  develop a new partnership to increase our print operation.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  Mychal’s job training focus has been a part of our mission for a decade. Each
  year 100% of the participants in our programs make progress in their level of
  independent living skills. Of the 50 people in our young adult programs all
  have participated in employment-related services and increased their job
  readiness skills, and 39 passed their California Food Handler’s exam. We now
  have 28 young adults with developmental disabilities training either as bakers
  or baristas and another 9 trained to work with the equipment at Mychal’s
  Prints. Seven students have risen from trainee to employee in our own
  ventures, nine were employed by partner businesses in the community, and two
  attained paid internships at ESMoA. The success of the café, bakery, catering
  service, print operation, and overall program is assessed by business metrics
  (# served, revenue, etc.) and the number of trainees. Individual success is
  measured by skills mastered, tests passed, etc. as tracked by the program
  coordinator.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '55'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': ''
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Briefly, Mychal’s job training programs will create a larger, more diversified
  and equitable work force for Los Angeles. LA is lauded as the land of dreams
  but not everyone in LA has an equal opportunity to fulfill their dreams.
  Recent studies show that 1 in 6 children in this country have a developmental
  disability yet this population faces enormous obstacles in pursuing their
  ambitions. The job training programs at Mychal’s Learning Place help these
  young people compete for employment in their community. By creating
  opportunities for young people with developmental disabilities to participate
  in and contribute to society in meaningful ways, Mychal’s is improving
  prospects, self-esteem and lives among the developmentally disabled
  population, improving LA’s economy by changing dependents into wage-earners,
  and improving society’s perception of an often disregarded population in our
  world. Win-win-win!
Describe the role of collaborating organizations on this project.: >-
  Thought this is important to share: While Mychal’s job training ventures are
  wholly run by Mychal’s Learning Place, we partner with a variety of
  organizations to provide work opportunities for our trainees. A number of
  companies in LA have partnered with us in providing jobs, providing pop-up
  sites for our café, placing catering orders with our bakery, and buying
  t-shirts, hats, etc. from the print shop. A new partnership is under
  development through the Collaboration Center in Nevada. The Center is a
  disability network that partners with providers, agencies and non-profits
  serving those with different abilities. We recently laid the groundwork for a
  collaborative relationship with a larger print operation in Nevada which will
  outsource smaller print jobs to Mychal’s for fulfillment.
