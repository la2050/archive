title: 'Today’s volunteers, tomorrow’s leaders'
project_summary: >-
  UCLA UniCamp provides a leadership and training program for hundreds of UCLA
  student volunteers who form a close-knit community as they train to be a camp
  counselor, craft programs, and socialize over the course of the academic year.
  The program culminates in a week-long summer resident camping program with
  volunteers serving as counselors for over 1,000 underserved youth. Volunteers
  gain a sense of service and build lifelong friendships; many continue on to
  become public servants, teachers, and nonprofit staff.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Volunteerism in Los Angeles (19.7%) lags behind both the state (23.9%) and
  national (24.9%) levels. This places Los Angeles in the 46th out of 51 of the
  largest metropolitan areas in the United States. More significantly, there has
  been a steady decline in volunteerism in Los Angeles between 2012 (21.7%) and
  2015. (Corporation for National Community Service) Low rates of volunteerism
  affects everyone in the community, from those receiving services, to the
  organizations providing services, and even the volunteers committing time,
  energy, and resources. A continued decline in volunteerism may mean decreased
  capacity to provide services to those in need, to keep our communities clean,
  or to give a sense of purpose and fulfillment by being in the service of
  others. Los Angeles should be a city where its residents give back to each
  other. We can encourage this by building community among volunteers and make
  the act of volunteering fun!
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  At a glance, UniCamp appears to be a camp for kids. However, we are as focused
  on the volunteers as we are on the campers. UniCamp encourages volunteerism
  through shared experiences and community building. UniCamp recruits, trains,
  and creates a close-knit group of volunteers from the UCLA student population.
  These volunteers will serve as counselors to underserved youth, instilling in
  them the same spirit of philanthropy. UniCamp recruits a leadership team of 40
  students who, in turn, recruits an additional 350-400 students. Volunteers
  train based on the American Camp Association standards and create innovative
  programs in preparation for summer camp. The volunteers also attend a series
  of team- and community-building events that include retreats, workshops, and
  on-site orientation. This year, we have created a comprehensive operational
  guide adhering to CDC guidance and requirements set forth by state and local
  health authorities to open camp for volunteers and campers. We expect most, if
  not all, volunteers will be vaccinated. With an 87-year track record, our
  approach is highly effective because UniCamp is more than a one-off
  volunteering event. Volunteers work together closely for months toward the
  same goals. UniCamp creates a long-lasting effect by enabling them to have
  ownership of their service. These shared experiences build lifelong
  friendships and deepen the connections made through volunteering.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  UniCamp’s volunteers return year-after-year. Those who graduated and found
  gainful employment take a week off in the summer. Excluding those who
  graduated, we have an incredible 60% volunteer retention rate. Our volunteers
  are diverse and come from all walks of life. Over 60% of our volunteers are
  Students of Color. Some are foster youth, undocumented, LGBTQ+, from
  low-income families, or were former campers themselves. This diversity helps
  volunteers become more relatable to each other and the campers they serve. We
  keep in touch with our volunteers. With over 15,000 volunteers since 1934, we
  are able to collect a treasure trove of stories, photos, and videos. We hold
  reunions for alumni at family camp weekends. The magic of UniCamp is that it
  is not a one-time volunteering event; volunteers become part of a family and a
  legacy that spans generations.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '400'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  As the buses depart UniCamp, there is a lot of hugging and tears. Even so,
  many volunteers and campers return next year. Volunteers go home with a sense
  of accomplishment that they successfully ran a week of camp. Campers and
  volunteers without many connections before now leave camp with dozens of new
  friendships. Volunteers keep in touch with campers, often helping them with
  college applications and going to their high school graduations. For
  graduating volunteers, many are inspired to enter public service or nonprofit
  work as social workers and teachers. UniCamp’s goal is to foster future
  generations to give back to others, build lifelong friendships and community,
  and have a deep appreciation for the great outdoors. As we keep in touch with
  alumni, we noticed that these values continue to live on as they volunteer
  together, go to their children's birthday parties, and take trips to national
  parks. The magic of UniCamp extends far beyond one week.
