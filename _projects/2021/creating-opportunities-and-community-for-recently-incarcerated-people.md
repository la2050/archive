title: Creating opportunities and community for recently incarcerated people.
project_summary: >-
  The Actors’ Gang Prison Project recognized the rehabilitation process must
  continue beyond one’s release date and launched the Reentry Program in 2015
  and provides participants with tools for emotional management, verbal
  communication, collaboration, conflict resolution, and leadership. The Alumni
  Advocacy Project launched in 2017 to create community for returning citizens.
  The alumni help each other succeed in attaining parole, work in the community
  and build healthy relationships with others. Alumni grow as individuals and
  artists.

'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Justice involved people need support as they return to our communities
  throughout Los Angeles County. The Actors’ Gang Prison Project (TAGPP)
  recognized the need to continue rehabilitation and support beyond a sentence
  end date. As people return home, many face challenges during their
  transitions, including navigating modern systems (e.g., bank accounts,
  technology, DMV and other government agencies), managing relationships,
  securing employment and housing and dealing with emotional issues resulting
  from, and the stigma associated with, incarceration. Those who receive support
  are less likely to fall into destructive old habits and behaviors like
  substance abuse, gang affiliation and criminal activities. The recidivism rate
  in California is approximately 62%; it is 10% among TAGPP alumni. The
  employment rate for those who complete the reentry program is 77% - the
  recidivism rates for formerly incarcerated people who found employment shortly
  after their release are less than 9%.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  TAGPP provides support for returning citizens through its Reentry Program and
  Alumni Advocacy Project with training in emotional expression and control,
  verbal communication, collaboration, conflict resolution, leadership skills
  and other essential "soft/core" skills that significantly improve
  opportunities to obtain employment. The goal of these programs is to provide
  formerly justice-involved participants an opportunity to change the way they
  see themselves and others so that they can become actively engaged community
  members. Several studies have found that employment is associated with reduced
  recidivism. Becoming employable after incarceration requires many layers of
  support which TAGPP programs provide. TAG’s Alumni Advocacy Project helps
  alumni succeed in finding work in the community and achieve early release from
  Parole. The alumni provide each other with emotional support as they acclimate
  to the overwhelming pace of modern society. They help each other manage
  relationships with significant others, family members, and in public. TAGPP
  has hired two of its alumni in full time positions and another 15 as part time
  Teaching Artists (TAs). This employment history will help lay the foundation
  for them in pursuing other career opportunities in the future.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  TAGPP has been working with Leap and Associates at UCLA for three years
  developing a longitudinal study. The third-year evaluation sought to
  understand long‐term outcomes of participation in TAGPP and examine the newly
  developed The Actors’ Gang Alumni Advocacy Project (TAGAAP). The results have
  been informative. The study ties the success of TAGAAP to continued success in
  the community. The study advises what we are doing well and what we can do
  better and helps shape the program creating a successful path for the Alumni.
  We have also seen incredibly positive numbers regarding recidivism rates among
  TAGPP participants and alumni. TAGPP is in development of a quantitative
  survey to understand the impact of the program on alumni and active members of
  TAGAAP and their families and ultimately communities in Los Angeles County.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '60'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '540'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  TAGPP programs have already demonstrated success in prisons for 15 years and
  reentry programs for four years. The challenge now is securing resources to
  expand the programs to serve more returning citizens. Ideally, every returning
  citizen in the Greater Los Angeles Area will have an opportunity to
  participate in TAGPP programs. This will increase opportunities for
  employment, reduce recidivism, support successful reentry of formerly
  incarcerated people, and add to the economy and communities of Los Angeles.
