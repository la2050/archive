In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Around the world, millions suffer from treatable health conditions due to a
  lack of access to basic medical supplies. Meanwhile, the U.S. healthcare
  system annually disposes of twelve billion pounds of unused, usable medical
  supplies and equipment valued on the order of billions of dollars. In fact,
  the medical sector is the second-largest contributor to landfills, accounting
  for 8% of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. The current paradigm
  propagates economic inefficiency, environmental burden, and avoidable human
  suffering. With this in mind, Blueprints For Pangaea is an international,
  student-run 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to addressing global health care
  inequalities. In order to bridge the gap between surplus and need, we use our
  national network of university chapters to redirect life-saving medical
  supplies away from landfills and into the hands of medical professionals that
  make a difference where it is most needed: on a global scale.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Blueprints For Pangaea is a medical surplus recovery organization (MSRO) that
  provides sustainable solutions to inefficient health care resource
  distribution. As a social enterprise, Blueprints For Pangaea is a network of
  university chapters united in addressing global health care inequalities by
  reallocating excess, unused medical supplies—that would otherwise be
  discarded—from U.S. hospitals and suppliers to oversea countries who are in
  need. With fewer medical resources to process, our partner hospitals are able
  to cut expenses and reduce their environmental footprints while gaining
  community goodwill. Since we obtain medical resources via donation, we can in
  turn offer them to foreign hospitals at massively subsidized prices, thereby
  enabling affordable, higher-quality patient care in areas of need. If
  provided, this grant will support Blueprints For Pangaea’s newly founded
  University of Southern California chapter, whose primary beneficiary in all of
  the aforementioned is the greater Los Angeles community and its salient urban
  health needs.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  The Blueprints for Pangaea, University of Southern California chapter will
  measure success through a few methods. Primarily, we will measure pounds of
  medical supplies shipped and calculate the worth of the medical supplies by
  maintaining a comprehensive inventory of our supplies and shipments. We
  continually seek to amplify our impact by partnering with socially-conscious
  hospitals and clinics that do not have systems in place to address surplus
  medical supplies. We will measure the number of nonprofits and hospitals that
  we partner with. In doing so, we will be able to utilize data on the
  demographics and number of people within the communities that these partners
  impact. This will allow us to calculate the number of people and types of
  people who are gaining access to our donated medical supplies in L.A. county.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '50'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '10000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  The Blueprints for Pangaea University of Southern California chapter is a
  newly registered student organization with 15 general members that spread
  through different branches including development, finance, and operations. As
  of now, our team is working to establish the Blueprints for Pangaea initiative
  in Los Angeles. We are in communication with local partners to assess medical
  resource needs and potential partnerships. Some of the organizations that we
  are in contact with include: USC Family Caregiver Support Center, Keck Street
  Medicine, USC Homelessness Initiative, and CureCervicalCancer. These local
  organizations work closely with Los Angeles County in providing healthcare
  services. Our project, will enable up to 10,000 people living in Los Angeles
  County to have access to vital medical supplies that would otherwise end up in
  landfills; hence, the organization is effectively making LA a greener, more
  economically sustainable and, ultimately, healthier place to live in.
