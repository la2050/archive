title: 'Working to Provide Dignity, Basic Needs, and Care for All Through the Law'
project_summary: >-
  Western Center on Law & Poverty fights to undo the impact of California’s
  massive income and wealth inequality, the unsustainable and racist housing
  market, lack of access to health care, and unfair systems of justice. Our team
  works tirelessly to make sure Los Angeles residents experiencing poverty are
  protected in California law, both during the pandemic and after.

In which areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles (select only if your project has a countywide benefit)
'In what stage of innovation is this project, program, or initiative?': >-
  Expand existing project, program, or initiative (expanding and continuing
  ongoing, successful work)
What is the problem that you are seeking to address?: >-
  Although California has one of the strongest economies in the world, it stands
  in stark contrast with the conditions of millions of residents who struggle to
  pay for food, shelter, and other necessities. Poverty is fueled by inequity
  and racial inequality, which is more consequential during the COVID health and
  financial crises. Decisions made by our courts and public officials now will
  have long-term impacts on the social safety net for hundreds of thousands of
  Los Angeles residents—for better or for worse. Western Center focuses on the
  more than six million Californians with low or no income—nearly two million in
  Los Angeles County alone—living at or below 125% of the federal poverty level.
  That is a number that, unfortunately, is growing due to the unprecedented
  health and financial impacts of the pandemic. These vulnerable individuals and
  families are disproportionally people of color, struggling to meet their basic
  needs, and at risk of falling into homelessness.
'Describe the project, program, or initiative that this grant will support to address the problem identified.': >-
  Western Center works to make sure people experiencing poverty are protected in
  California law and our approach includes the following: FIGHTING IN COURT We
  partner with local legal aid programs and pro bono co-counsel in class action
  and other high-impact cases to protect basic rights for all Angelenos with low
  incomes. Our 2021 docket addresses issues of eviction defense as we move into
  recovery from the pandemic, discrimination against tenants, barriers to
  getting and keeping General Relief for people with mental disabilities, and
  medically fragile children being denied the Medi-Cal skilled nursing care they
  are entitled to. ADVOCATING FOR ANTI-POVERTY LEGISLATION We fight for
  legislation related to health care, hunger, affordable housing, economic
  empowerment, and public benefits. We also oppose harmful legislation and
  educate lawmakers and other stakeholders on behalf of those living in poverty,
  and help establish new laws, improve existing laws, and challenge the
  development of laws that diminish resources and opportunities for vulnerable
  Los Angeles residents. EMPOWERING LEGAL AID ATTORNEYS Defending the rights of
  every Los Angeles resident living in poverty within courts, public programs,
  and government agencies is complex and technical. A coordinated effort at the
  community level must include equipping frontline staff members at direct legal
  service organizations with the information, skills, and training they need to
  improve the lives of their clients.
'What evidence do you have that this project, program, or initiative is or will be successful, and how will you define and measure success?': >-
  By leveraging our existing model that focuses on litigation, legislation, and
  support for legal aid partners, we successfully fight for broad legal
  victories that impact the nearly two million Los Angeles residents living in
  poverty. We measure our success by tracking the following outcomes: § The
  number of impact cases we win and how many individuals may benefit, § The
  amount of anti-poverty legislation we lead in enacting and how many
  individuals may benefit, and § The number of legal aid attorneys whose legal
  knowledge and skills are increased through our technical assistance and
  training program. For example, in 2020 we helped pass eviction moratorium
  legislation to protect an estimated one to three million tenants in California
  who are behind in their rent due to COVID. We also won the case Jane H. v.
  Kent and we estimate that thousands of Medi-Cal recipients will be able to
  keep their doctors, not to mention hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical
  care saved.
'Approximately how many people will be directly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '100000'
'Approximately how many people will be indirectly impacted by this project, program, or initiative?': '1000000'
Describe how Los Angeles County will be different if your work is successful.: >-
  Western Center envisions a Los Angeles County in 2050 where: All of our
  neighbors have access to healthy, sustainable, and affordable housing in
  neighborhoods of their choosing, with strong, clear, and enforceable
  anti-displacement and anti-discrimination protections. The housing emergency
  in Southern California, and its disproportionate effects on the most
  vulnerable Angelenos, comes to an end. Everyone believes access to health care
  is a human right that translates into full, inalienable coverage. Government
  agencies provide equitable access to health care for all Californians,
  regardless of status and no one would ever be removed from coverage.
  Californians who need it most have enough income to afford basic necessities
  and save for long-term financial security. Safety net programs will be fully
  funded so no family falls into poverty or goes hungry, and individuals are no
  longer further entrenched in poverty because of unjust public fees, fines, or
  consumer debt.
