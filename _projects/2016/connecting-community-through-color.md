project_measure: >-
  One of our goals is to introduce children to the impact that color and imagery
  has on their environment and their life. Also, how important murals and civic
  engagement are in our society. We see our measure of success gauged daily by
  the pride the students, faculty and community develop after their school is
  transformed through color. When cool and warm colors replace drab tones and
  imagery that has a social or environmental message becomes a part of the
  students surroundings they become engaged and excited to be in a place where
  creativity is encouraged. We see this as an integral part of their education. 


  Success will also be measured by: 1) increase in the arts at school, 2) other
  civic engagement projects at the school, whether art-related or other, 3)
  increased engagement among parents, 4) increased engagement among faculty, 4)
  increased engagement among neighbors, 5) increase in attendance of children,
  6) harder to measure, but still important, anecdotal evidence that children
  are happy to be at school.

  We want to change the face of schools by bringing a massive burst of color.
  We'll bring students, faculty, parents and neighbors together to transform
  blank structures to ones filled with vibrancy and lively characters while
  learning the fundamentals of color therapy. We believe that by enhancing their
  environment, kids of any age will be more engaged and committed to their
  educational journey, schools will be more welcoming, and every community can
  enjoy and appreciate beautiful art.

  Big Sunday has been bringing people of all ages and backgrounds together for
  nearly twenty years. Our mission statement embodies the spirit of
  'connecting.' As our mission statement says, 'We connect people through
  helping.'


  We started as a single day of service. Today, we offer more than 2000 ways
  every year for absolutely anyone to pitch in, help out, and give back. Even
  better, we bring all kinds of diverse people together in the name of helping. 


  At Big Sunday, we believe that absolutely everyone has some way that they can
  help somebody else. We do not see the world as haves-and-have-nots but rather
  as haves-and-have-mores. Our participants include everyone from homeless
  people to movie stars and everyoje is treated and valued the same. In fact, at
  many of our events, it is difficult to tell to who is helping and who is being
  helped. In fact, we are proud of the fact that we often blue those lines.


  Over the years, we have worked with hundreds of schools, from preschools
  through grad schools. We've worked with public, private, religious and secular
  schools. We've also worked with schools that serve all kinds of communities.
  One thing we've discovered is that schools don't only serve children, but they
  involve faculty, parents, neighbors, and other stakeholders, too. Not only
  that, schools increasingly meet other needs as well, whether they operate as
  camps in the summer, polling places, sites for community meetings, a site for
  a show or concert, the home of a sustainable garden, the site of an exciting
  game, or drop-in sites for locals.


  Of course, many schools that once were a site to simply teach children now
  also serve the function of de facto social service agencies, providing
  everything from food to clothing not only for their students, but the kids'
  families as well.


  We think every school should be welcoming to all. And without question a
  pretty and cheerful environment goes a long way to making a place
  ingratiating. We've discovered that too many schools can be run-down or drab
  -- with others can be new but too sterile. We think that colorful murals can
  provide a school not only with warmth, but a great sense of place. This adds
  to the community's sense of belonging (always important at Big Sunday) and
  pride. (Come to think of it, also very important to us!). 


  More importantly, when a community comes together in the name of creating that
  mural it has resonance both in the moment and for years to come. We will be
  teaming with professional artists who will work with schools communities to
  not only paint professional-level murals, but to work with the community to
  discern their interests and passions. Better still, the artists will be
  trained in color therapy and teach the participants about the value of color
  in creating environments that are not just pretty and festive, but also
  encouraging feelings of well-being, security and confidence.


  Creating these murals will connect people in a classic Big Sunday way:
  impactful and fun.
