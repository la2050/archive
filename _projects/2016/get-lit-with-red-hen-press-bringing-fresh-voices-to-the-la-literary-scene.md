project_measure: >-
  The success of Red Hen Press’s publishing projects can be quantified by volume
  of sales and scope of distribution, both of which are monitored directly by
  the press’s Marketing Associate.

  However, it is important also to measure the success of Red Hen’s endeavors by
  assessing not just the number of books sold but also the quality of
  conversation generated by each new work

  and the notoriety of the press as a whole. Though these qualitative benchmarks
  are difficult to measure directly, success in these criteria is indicated by
  the volume of submissions to the press and by audience turnout at book fairs
  and literature conferences such as the AWP Conference, the LA Times Festival
  of Books, and others. 


  Success for Red Hen’s outreach and publicity efforts is defined by attendance
  numbers at literary events and percentage of capacity at each event. In 2017,
  Red Hen Press aims to host 30 literary reading events filled to 90% capacity
  each, and anticipates 1,300 attendees over the course of the year. This data
  will be collected from event reports written by press staff and survey
  questionnaires filled out by event attendees. Surveys also provide the press
  qualitative feedback about attendees’ perceptions of an event’s success. These
  measures allow us to continue to create and improve upon spaces where ideas
  can be shared among members of the literary community.

  Red Hen Press will establish Los Angeles as a creative hub by cultivating a
  community of readers and writers who are actively engaged in the essential
  human practice known as literature. Dr. Kate Gale and Mark E. Cull co-founded
  the press in 1994 with a mission to discover and publish works of literary
  excellence, support diversity through publications and public events, and
  promote literacy in our local schools. In the twenty-two years since, the
  press has published more than 400 books of poetry, fiction, and creative
  nonfiction by acclaimed and emerging writers. Red Hen has also established
  itself as a significant cultural presence in Southern California and beyond
  through its diverse programs: WITS, which provides free books to low-income
  students and places authors into underserved third through twelfth grade
  classrooms to conduct writing workshops; an annual series of over thirty
  reading events on the east and west coasts and internationally; the conferral
  of three literary awards to emerging writers; and publication of The Los
  Angeles Review, a nationally distributed literary journal that also confers
  four awards biannually.


  With support from the LA2050 grant, Red Hen Press will enhance and expand the
  press’s engagement with the community through its successfully established
  programs. In 2017, Red Hen Press will publish 26 books of poetry, fiction, and
  creative nonfiction by a diverse array of both established and emerging
  authors. Specifically, Red Hen Press will use LA2050 grant funding to:

  * Copyedit each manuscript to check for compliance with the Chicago Manual of
  Style and proofread each book after layout to eliminate formatting errors.

  * Design and lay out original covers and interiors for each book through the
  press’s in-house design team.

  * Fulfill larger print runs for books while decreasing prices to increase
  literary accessibility. 

  * Publicize individual books via print and online channels by sending press
  releases, soliciting book reviews, and bringing Red Hen authors to conferences
  and bookfairs to interact directly with their readers.

  * Plan, publicize, and market our unique literary events to cultivate a
  dialogue between writers and readers, and to reach more diverse audiences in
  local schools, families, and senior centers.

  * Maintain our literary awards program that recognizes emerging writers and
  expands the field of contemporary literature. 

  * Maximize the talent and commitment of our dedicated staff by compensating
  them at a rate competitive to that of positions in similar business sectors,
  thus keeping publishing jobs in Los Angeles.


  With publications that are both culturally and stylistically unique, and
  events that are thought-provoking and affordable, Red Hen Press contributes to
  the diverse literary landscape of Southern California.
