project_measure: "Effectiveness is measured in an ongoing evaluation. In May 2016, NCJW|LA published the first evaluation of The Talk Project which found it to be effective and engaging.\n\n NCJW|LA believes that in order to change behavior students need knowledge and a feeling of empowerment. Therefore, The Talk Project strives to educate students on the causes of sexual violence and the laws of consent, and empower them to speak out against sexual violence, engage in healthy sexual relationships, and make informed decisions about seeking legal justice if necessary.\n \nThe students at each school or group we visit participate in a survey before and after the presentation. Students who see the workshop take a pre- and post-survey, which are then compared. In addition, NCJW|LA conducts interviews with students who have seen the workshop for their feedback.\n  \t\nNCJW|LA's first evaluation found that students from the first three schools who saw The Talk Project reported being significantly less likely to adhere to rape myths, and significantly more likely to practice consent behaviors and intervene as a bystander. Students reported that they found The Talk Project to be understandable and engaging, and said they would recommend The Talk Project to a friend.\n\nThe evaluation can be read in full here:  http://ncjwla.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Evaluation_TheTalkProject.pdf and in summary here: http://ncjwla.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/OneSheet_TheTalkProject.pdf."

  To be the best place to learn, Los Angeles must be a city where all students
  are safe, respected, and empowered. We need to give students equal access to
  education. Right now students across the country are reporting that they are
  being sexually assaulted at epidemic proportions.  One in four girls and one
  in six boys will be sexually assaulted before they turn 18. Students who
  experience sexual assault drop out of school at high rates while their
  perpetrators face no consequence. If the program can grow, NCJW|LA’s The Talk
  Project has the ability to be a major vehicle for improvement to fight this
  gender-related violence epidemic, keep more students in school, and create a
  supportive, progressive culture in Los Angeles. 


  The Talk Project is a bold student-driven movement that was created by NCJW|LA
  teen volunteers who felt their schools lacked education on sexual violence.
  They noticed harmful ideas perpetuated by their peers stemming from rape
  culture, ideas like “she was asking for it by getting so drunk” and “boys will
  be boys.” These high school students were inspired by recent activism on
  college campuses to start organizing to create positive change through
  education, by taking it upon themselves to change “The Talk” surrounding the
  issue of sexual violence. 


  With the support of NCJW|LA staff, the teens researched and wrote a script for
  a workshop they call The Talk Project.


  Now, teen volunteers in The Talk Project are trained by other teen leaders to
  run interactive and engaging workshops for LA high schools and youth groups on
  understanding the issue, supporting survivors, bystander intervention, how to
  have healthy, consensual relationships, ways to get help if violence occurs,
  and advocating for cultural change. 


  Since its launch February 2016, The Talk Project workshop has been presented
  for six Los Angeles high schools and one youth group for 1100 students so far.
  The workshop includes clips from The Hunting Ground documentary on the campus
  sexual assault movement, and NCJW|LA gives schools the option to screen the
  film in full at a discount. 


  The issue of sexual violence is heavy and can be taxing to take on. NCJW|LA
  staff works very closely with the volunteers to make sure they are comfortable
  talking and thinking about the subject matter, and never feel they are alone
  in this.


  The Talk Project has its own website so that students everywhere can educate
  themselves and take part in the conversation.  The site features blog posts,
  videos, art and more from our student leaders and students from all over are
  invited to submit. It’s amazing to see student passion fuel a movement of
  their own creation. Check out changethetalk.org! 


  With resources and strong support this program can truly take off, and LA
  teens can continue to use their voices to make Los Angeles a safer, more
  inclusive, more empowering place to learn.
