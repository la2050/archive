organization_name_2: El Porto Shark
organization_activity: >-
  Aggregate shark sighting data to make smarter fisheries, researchers,
  environmentalists, and policymakers by forecasting future populations.

project_description: >-
  Wholly women-owned business that gathers shark sighting data from citizen
  scientists, fisheries, media, and more in order to create a machine learning
  forecast of future populations.  Not only do we inform fisheries and
  policymakers, but we educate the public on the importance of sharks in our
  local water and how to become citizen scientists.  Sharks populations are
  correlated to other ocean species and not only sequester carbon in their
  bodies, but are apex predators vital to the ocean.

  Success as a high growth start up will be defined by a measurable increase in
  our public education newsletter database (goal: 1200% increase); validation of
  our forecast model as proven by acceptance in the local scientific community
  (goal: model to be used as beta test by 3 local universities - targeting USC,
  UCLA, and CSULB); and federal government grant funding (goal: National
  Oceanographic & Atmospheric Committee and National Marine Fisheries Service
  grants for 2017/18).


  There are few women-owned tech startups - especially where a woman is the
  technical cofounder.  By reaching our milestones we will epitomize the CREATE
  goals that the program has defined..

project_proposal_best_place: >-
  Our proposal will show the world that LA is the best place for a women-owned
  big data startup to succeed and contribute to our unmatched city.  We are
  pioneers in the way oceanography/fisheries data is collected and used.


  We tirelessly campaign to protect sharks before they are all extinct.  About
  80% of the world's shark population has been wiped out and whether or not you
  live on the coast you need to care, especially in a metropolitan area like Los
  Angeles County.  Without sharks, the entire ocean ecosystem is thrown off
  balance and weather patterns around the world will be impacted.  How?  The
  ocean is a carbon sink and without sharks to sequester carbon in their bodies
  and, more importantly, control herbivore populations the plant life will be
  severely limited and unavailable to remove as much carbon from the atmosphere
  since there will be less photosynthesis.  Have you noticed more humidity in
  our area over the summer the past few years?  Notice more superstorms around
  the globe?  Want to keep your family safe from extreme weather patterns? 
  Replace the fear of sharks with facts and join the fight for their
  conservation.


  We are utilizing data aggregation in order to bring together discrete data
  sources from public and private data sets and applying a machine learning
  model in order to forecast future shark populations.  We utilize a data
  scientist's toolbox of technologies such as Python, MySQL, 

  Amazon Web Services, and more.


  The Santa Monica Bay is thought to be a white shark nursery and in 2013 the
  local television news sensationalized every juvenile shark sighting.  Since we
  are daily surfers at the beach break where most of the sightings occurred, El
  Porto, we knew we had to do something. El Porto Shark was started as a pet
  project with a social media presence that tried to replace fear with facts. In
  the summer of 2015 we were motivated by a local General Assembly instructor to
  take it further and do something about shark conservation.


  Our events we have planned will educate the local public about not only why
  sharks are important to fisheries, but to the climate. weather, and the
  lifestyle here in Los Angeles.  Angelinos will also learn to appreciate how
  our work informs local fisheries to keep their seafood sustainable.  They will
  learn how to be citizen scientists and contribute to our database.  County
  policymakers will use our data to inform climate and recreational fishing
  limits as it is more robust than current sources.  Fisheries will be able to
  utilize our data and our model not only for sharks, but other species in order
  to create smarter catch limits.


  We’re Los Angeles natives that are proving our model in our own backyard
  before taking our project national and then global.  We’ve already identified
  worldwide partners and started showing the world that Los Angeles is indeed
  the best city to CREATE!
