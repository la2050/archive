Are any other organizations collaborating on this proposal?: >-
  Formally, Space in the Raw, , Semi-formally, the Department of Cultural
  Affairs' Director of Performing Arts Ben Johnson, , Informally we will engage
  our ongoing relationships with Council District 14/Councilman Jose Huizar's
  office, Alcoholic Beverage Control, LA Fire Department, LAPD, LA Department of
  Building and Safety, our architectural consultant, Commissions Investigation
  Department, and more.
Please describe your project proposal.: >-
  Tapping above-mentioned agencies like the BID, CD14, LAPD & LAFD, ABC, LADBS,
  & more, we’ll map out the permitting process for creators. Via live workshops
  & online resources, we will connect arts event producers with city agents, we
  eventually craft an online system connecting owners of vacant or inhabited
  buildings to artists that can create vibrant events in underutilized spaces
  and neighborhoods. This will result in more art establishments and jobs per
  capita, each of them collaborative.
Which metrics will your proposal impact?​:
  - Arts establishments
  - Manufacturing activity
  - Employment in the creative industries
  - Jobs per capita
In what areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - City of Los Angeles
Describe in greater detail how your proposal will make LA the best place.: >-
  For 6 years, Think Tank Productions has ridden a wave of massive
  revitalization in Downtown LA. Succeeding the Arts District & Gallery Row, the
  epicenter of LA is in the midst of its own cultural renaissance. Councilman
  Jose Huizar’s Bringing Back Broadway initiative has succeeded in activating
  many of DTLA’s empty spaces, and the Think Tank sits as co-pilot on that
  initiative’s landmark event as creative directors on Huizar and CD14’s 65,000+
  attendee Night on Broadway festival. The opportunity to activate the dormant
  theaters and streets with superstars like Reggie Watts and Cirque du Soleil
  has taught us how malleable the City of LA can be. 


  We haven’t always been so privileged to work parallel with the City to produce
  such exciting programming in our neighborhood; the first few years running our
  venue required we dig for information to get our events compliant enough to
  expand. As we grew, we began accruing the info and network needed to execute
  big ideas in the city of Los Angeles, and we see a lot of exceedingly creative
  talents here who could benefit from such knowledge. We’ve also run across
  hundreds of inspiring but inactivated spaces itching for those artists. 


  Because most creatives buckle at bureaucracy, starting with an idea rather
  than the legal feasibility, the red tape that ties up cultural opportunity can
  be hard-to-see and act as a landmine that takes a big idea’s legs out from
  under it before they see the light of day. If more creatives could produce
  work within City guidelines, they could empower their own practice and employ
  their collaborators more often; we believe this collaboration is fuel for
  creation. 


  Fitting ideas into the laws of various government agencies is hard enough, but
  in LA it seems that finding those laws is the hardest part. Dialog with LAPD
  shows that they aren’t trained on the Fire Department’s restrictions, and even
  the Department of Cultural Affairs has no resource on which permits to get for
  an artistic venture, nor where to get them. If even the DCA can’t find this
  info, imagine the plight of low-income creators in and around DTLA trying to
  figure it out. Our project does this step for them – taking an idea and
  applying it to the correct procedure, in a concise package that law
  enforcement, building owners, and artists can easily buy into.


  LA is critiqued for its sprawl, but that has ultimately become our greatest
  artistic resource. Across the city are empty buildings with such character
  that creators worldwide are chomping at the bit to engage them in a
  site-responsive manner. Democratization benefitting building owners by
  bringing positive attention to their property while empowering artists to
  create in a government-approved manner takes one of LA’s greatest slights –
  vacant sprawl – and turns it into our biggest strength. Demystifying the
  permitting process will add more usable and informal spaces for PLAY while
  increasing the cultural economy for stakeholders.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.​: >-
  Success will be measured by the amount of creators reached through our online
  program, and also by the tangible number of events produced after finishing
  our in-person program. While our focus is on site-specific art installations
  (and public art), not live performance, we tend to incorporate performance
  into every production that we create. These performances are often the most
  difficult to permit, but most attractive to branded collaborations with
  corporate sponsors: an important tool in the innovator's production realm
  toolbelt. 


  Our program will prep local directors from A-Z, including media deck creation
  to pitch to sponsors, press kits, networking with city officials, permitting,
  location identification, and many more areas. Ultimately, a successful program
  will generate one or more candidates for a sort of 'grant' that functions as
  the start up capital for one or more productions in collaboration with their
  creative entity and Think Tank Gallery. This collaboration may also loop in a
  branded sponsor. 


  The success of that production, and producing more thereafter, as well as
  independently produced activations from those who have benefited from our
  program will dictate our success.
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
  - 'Money '
  - Volunteers
  - Publicity/awareness
  - Infrastructure (building/space/vehicles etc.)
  - Community outreach
