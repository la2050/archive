  By the end of this grant year SoLA will have a site selected and have begun
  external financing. This grant will make the next necessary steps in our
  development possible by funding the hire of a Project Manager, retention of
  our Outreach Manager, and professional co-op consultants. These experts will
  guide us as we build member/ownership, conduct market studies, select the
  site, and initiate a capital campaign.

  SoLA Food Co-op will empower the South LA community by bringing organic foods
  within reach . In an area anticipating much in the form of new
  development,including a new Metro line coming in, there is still insufficient
  access to healthy foods. SoLA offers an opportunity for community stakeholders
  to retain influence in and preserve the history and culture of the community
  through shared ownership of an organic co-op grocery. Simultaneously, SoLA
  will also be an attractive resource for new families moving to the area.
