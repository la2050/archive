Please describe your project proposal.: >-
  We are opening LaunchCode Los Angeles to help Los Angelenos create a new level
  of self-sufficiency through empowering jobs in technology and computer
  science.  Millions of Americans are unemployed and are stuck in low-wage job
  cycles which leave them struggling to find jobs that offer livable salaries,
  employable skills, and a chance for advancement.  Businesses also have a
  problem —there just isn’t enough tech talent to match the growing demand.
  LaunchCode programs address both problems.
Which metrics will your proposal impact?​:
  - Self-sufficiency
  - Resilient communities
In what areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles
  - City of Los Angeles
Describe in greater detail how your proposal will make LA the best place.: >-
  Over the long term, we know that high paying jobs increase self sufficiency.
  Using the models that we have learned in St. Louis, Miami, Kansas City, Rhode
  Island, Seattle and Portland, we know that LaunchCode participants can get
  placed in real high paying jobs that make a major different in how Los Angeles
  grows as a city.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.​: |-
  We measure success as follows:

  Apprentices
  Hires
  Candidates
  Employers

  So far: 

  90% of apprentices were converted to permanent employment
  96% of hires remain in their job after six months
  30% of candidates were promoted within 18 months
  500+ employers partnering with LaunchCode nationally
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
