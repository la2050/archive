  Through a combination of participant surveys (pre, post, and 6-months out),
  focus groups, and observations, we are looking at the following to determine
  success:


  •Quality of Program Implementation
   -To what extent are the phases of the program being implemented as intended?
   -To what extent is implementation high quality?
   -Are Big Citizens and Team Leaders reaching their intended objectives?

  •Program Experience
   -What did Big Citizen participants experience in this program?
   -What did Team Leaders experience in this program?
   -What did that experience mean to them?

  •Big Citizen HUB Outcomes
   -How do Big Citizens and Team Leaders think they are different because of their participation?
   -Does participation in Big Citizen HUB increase social capital, character development, civic awareness and leadership skills? 
   -Are changes in these outcomes sustained after the program?
   -Does number of hours served make a difference in these outcomes?

  Nine key constructs are being assessed: Gratitude, Social Capital, Civic
  Motivation, Curiosity & Exploration, Civic Awareness, Civic Advocacy,
  Diversity Attitudes, Civic Leadership, Civic Identity.


  In addition, we track:

  * Participant demographics 

  * Participant attendance

  school, high school, and college-aged cohorts. In total 236 youth people will
  come together to learn about the diversity of each other, the city, and it’s
  issues. Through partnerships with over 50 local nonprofits, we’ll give Big

  Big Citizen HUB will help make LA the best place to connect by providing
  meaningful civic engagement opportunities for diverse youth all across the
  city.


  Los Angeles, like many cities, is divided– racially, socially, economically.
  Our nation is in a state of civil unrest, as demonstrated by protests and
  arguments surrounding critical issues such as police relations and LGBTQ+
  rights. We need more opportunities for people to connect to better understand
  each other and the complexities of these issues. Our most precious resource –
  youth – have the potential to come together to confront these issues but are
  disconnected and not being activated. 


  Why youth? The National Institutes of Health found that between the ages of 12
  and 25, people are literally wired for excitement, novelty, risk, and peer
  authority. These traits make young people uniquely suited to solve problems,
  if given the opportunity. Excitement and novelty leads to learning new things
  and creating new solutions. Risk leads to trying things adults might not. Peer
  authority leads to changing behaviors. 


  Big Citizen HUB harnesses these youth assets and positive peer networks
  through dialogue, community immersion, diversity, and teamwork, while
  activating youth to address the critical issues dividing our cities –
  ultimately contributing to a more just, open, and connected society.


  Over the course of 22 Saturdays between January and July, we focus on
  increasing Big Citizens’ civic knowledge and personal agency. We:

  * Place youth on diverse teams, utilizing a near-peer mentor structure 

  * Address concerns of cultural competency by exposing youth to different
  groups, perspectives, cultures, and ideas that they may not otherwise have
  access to

  * Give Big Citizens the space to learn and practice civic leadership skills,
  such as public speaking, mobilization, information literacy, social media
  usage, conflict resolution, and team leadership

  * Provide the resources to explore, serve, and reflect on social justice
  issues

  * Provide a place to implement local solutions to local problems, so that Big
  Citizens can immediately see how their actions can have a positive impact on
  the community, setting the stage for future action

  * Complete youth-led service projects (middle school) and six-week externships
  (high school)

  * Utilize public transit to learn from and volunteer with agencies across the
  city, witnessing issues first-hand


  Partnering with over 50 community-based organizations, Big Citizens will
  address the following social issues in 2017: Animal Rights, Environmental
  Sustainability, Food Justice, Homelessness, Immigration, and LGBTQ+ Equality. 


  Big Citizen HUB is building a pipeline of social change makers. By engaging
  young leaders with each other, with LA’s critical issues, and with local
  agencies working toward solutions, we will help make LA the best place to
  connect.
