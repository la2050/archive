  We’re building a new data platform that will make LA the most accessible and
  inclusive place to run for office anywhere in the nation. With support and
  guidance from local election officials, our team at USC will work to
  transition LA’s elected office data into a streamlined and open platform. This
  new database will allow users to see all available elected offices based on
  their address and provide crucial details such as filing windows, salaries,
  requirements, and competitors.

  RunForOffice.org. Going forward we expect to draw on strong working
  relationships with a range of contributors and potential users across
  government, nonprofits, tech, and academia.

  Our primary measure of success will be designing an open and accessible
  platform that is adopted by election officials in Los Angeles and widely used
  by citizens and nonprofits that advocate for more voices and choices in
  politics. Our long-term goal is to produce more inclusive, diverse and
  competitive elections, beginning with this LA pilot and then expanding across
  the state. Our long-term measure of success will be increasing the diversity
  and quantity of people running for elected offices at all levels. In the
  short-to-medium term, our focus is on encouraging greater local participation
  and more representative local democracy. Initial success will be measured in
  three ways:

  - First, we need support from city and county officials for a new and open
  platform for tracking elected office data like filing windows, salaries,
  application requirements, and who else is running.

  - Second, we will collect data to measure whether and how the new platform is
  used by individuals, nonprofits and other groups that encourage diverse and
  underrepresented populations to run for office. 

  - Third and most importantly, we will measure whether there is an increase in
  the quantity and diversity of people running for elected offices in Los
  Angeles.

  Over the last decade, 28 cities in Los Angeles County have cancelled elections
  for mayor or city council “because no one bothered making a challenge.” A
  recent Pew survey shows that those who do run for office remain
  disproportionately male, white, and well-educated. Only 20% of elected offices
  nationally are held by women, and there is only one woman on the 15-person Los
  Angeles City Council. Young people especially are running *away* from office
  at record rates, with 90 percent saying they would never want to serve in any
  of the nation’s more than 500,000 elected offices. In short, our democracy is
  facing a crisis of leadership that can only be solved when a larger and more
  diverse group of Americans runs for office. 


  At a time when most of the world’s information is only a click away, it is
  nearly impossible to find a clear and complete list of offices one is eligible
  to run for. This lack of basic information about how to run for office
  prevents the people of LA, and especially young people and other politically
  underrepresented groups, from being equally informed about leadership
  opportunities in their communities. The good news is that unlike the major
  structural and cultural barriers to running for office, the problem of data
  access is one we are equipped to solve today. 


  With support and guidance from LA election officials and the CA Secretary of
  State, our team at the University of Southern California will work within
  Greater Los Angeles - and ultimately in all 58 California counties - to
  transition our elected office data into a streamlined and open platform. The
  database would not only allow users to see all available elected offices based
  on their address, but also provide crucial details like filing windows,
  salaries, application requirements, and who else is running.


  Primary users of this public database and API will include nonprofits like She
  Should Run and Veterans Campaign, which encourage and support first-time
  candidates. The database will also be used by technology companies like
  Facebook and Nationbuilder, which is already designing solutions that make it
  easier for their users to run for office.
