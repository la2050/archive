  The Bowtie Project has long-term and short-term goals. The short-term goal is
  to bring diverse Angelenos to have a positive, memorable experience on a piece
  of land they would not otherwise visit. Clockshop gauges the immediate success
  of this goal through audience tabulations, anecdotal feedback, social media
  activity, and online engagement. The data is used to inform future event
  curation. By constantly working to tap new audiences, Clockshop maximizes the
  number of first-time Bowtie visitors. 


  The long-term goal of the Bowtie project is to support CSP’s efforts to create
  a dynamic public park. New parks tend to spur development and displace local
  residents; Clockshop and CSP aim to create a park that serves the existing
  community. The Bowtie Project cultivates stakeholders in the future park,
  ensuring that the local community will feel ownership in park development.
  Success will be gauged by various measures: the creating of a “Friends of the
  Bowtie” group within the next 12 months; organized resistance to property
  development adjacent the Bowtie; community involvement in the park planning
  process; and eventually, use of the park by long-time local residents.

  In collaboration with California State Parks, Clockshop will create programs
  and events that bring Angelenos to experience “the Bowtie,” a plot of
  post-industrial land on the LA River. The Bowtie Project transforms
  post-industrial wasteland into a cultural destination, and lays the groundwork
  for creating LA’s largest riverfront park.

  The Bowtie Project has attracted thousands of people to the LA River and
  transformed urban wasteland into dynamic public space. This innovative
  partnership between Clockshop and California State Parks addresses 4 of the
  metrics outlined in LA2050’s PLAY category: providing access to open space;
  creating opportunities for informal play; offering intergenerational
  opportunities for play; and laying the groundwork for a “vibrant” park that
  will serve urban park-poor communities in East Los Angeles. For LA2050,
  Clockshop proposes continuing the Bowtie Project in 2017, with an ambitious
  schedule of events and a renewed commitment to creating culturally relevant
  programming. 


  The Bowtie is a special place. Visitors remark on the sweeping views, the
  quiet calm, and the flourishing plant and animal life. With an elongated north
  to south shape, the Bowtie runs parallel the river, which is green and
  verdant, and water audibly flows. This portion of the LA River is often called
  the “crown jewel” of river revitalization. The Bowtie was purchased by CSP in
  2003 but was underutilized as CSP lacked funds to develop it into a public
  park.


  Clockshop’s work at the Bowtie, which began in 2014, is designed to cultivate
  appreciation for the land as a nature experience and an oasis of calm in a
  dense urban landscape. Clockshop accomplishes this by organizing events
  (12-15/year) and commissioning site-specific artworks (2-3 performances and
  2-3 sculptural installations). 


  Events fall into several types: Reading by Moonrise, at which local authors
  read around the campfire on the full moon; LA River Campouts, at which
  families and youth groups camp beneath the stars; Bowtie Family Days, a
  drop-in all-day event designed for multigenerational families; and fieldtrips
  with LAUSD students. These events draw large crowds; the LA River Campout
  usually has a waiting list of several hundred people. Clockshop also
  collaborates with architecture students at Woodbury University to add
  amenities to the site, such as seating, viewing platforms, and a fire pit.
  Event audiences are encouraged to come early and stay late—to bring a picnic,
  enjoy the river, and watch the sunset.


  Public art at the site provides another occasion for people to gather and
  enjoy the land. Installations and performances by Rafa Esparza, taisha
  paggett, Rosten Woo, Carolina Caycedo, and others have engaged the site in
  many ways. The first Bowtie artwork, Michael Parker's The Unfinished, is a
  recreation of an ancient Egyptian obelisk in the process of excavation, a
  reminder that the LA River corridor is also a work in progress. Clockshop’s
  most recent artist project was an after-dark performance by vocalist Carmina
  Escobar, in which Escobar’s vocalizations were mixed with recordings of Bowtie
  birdlife.


  Through these programs and others, Clockshop is building a community of
  stakeholders who will ensure that the Bowtie remains in the public trust, as a
  place for all Angelenos to play now and in the future.
