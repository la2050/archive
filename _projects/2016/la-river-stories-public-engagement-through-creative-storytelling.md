  River LA, in partnership with 72andSunny, is creating a human-centered public
  engagement project to generate inspiring, human stories from the people who
  know the LA River the best  - environmentalists, cyclists, equestrians, young
  families, recreational enthusiasts, artists, among others. LA River Stories
  immerses the viewer in the lives of real people, fosters an understanding of
  their needs, and elevates the narrative to inspire transformative ideas to
  shape equitable planning and design.

  Primary outcomes include the following: 

  1. Recruitment of the community, including direct engagement with members of
  5+ LA River communities through workshops with Gehry team. This will be
  measured throughout pre-and production phases by the number of meetings and
  the number of potential content creators, the number of stories created, and
  the number of insights.

  2. A range of content to include in video shorts. This will take place
  throughout the production and post-production process, measured by the
  quantity of content.

  3. Media impressions among the diverse audience. This will take place through
  the content distribution process to influencers and paid media. This will be
  measured by the quantity of impressions, as well as social media engagement
  rates.

  For many Angelenos, the LA River is not just a concrete flood channel, it’s a
  way of life. The LA River is where people meet up to ride bicycles or horses.
  It’s where they create art and music. It’s where they connect with nature and
  their neighbors. It’s where some thrive, while others are burdened. River LA
  and 72andSunny will get to know these communities and learn of the
  relationship they have with the LA River today, and how revitalization will
  serve to strengthen this relationship. LA River Stories engages and immerses
  the viewer in the lives of real people, and fosters deeper understanding of
  their needs. From this collection of video-documented stories made for and by
  the public, River LA will gain amazing insight on a diversity of opportunities
  for effective and lasting infrastructure design solutions. 


  There are more than 64,000 posts on Instagram with #LARiver. River LA and
  72andSunny already used the geolocation feature to organize and understand how
  people are using and documenting their experience on the LA River today.  LA
  River Stories is an opportunity to expand the cultural conversation, engage
  LA’s diverse audience, truly get to know LA River communities and subcultures,
  and ultimately inspire and influence design and public policy. Viewers will
  interact with the needs, dreams, and behaviors of the LA River community
  through people-generated narratives across multimedia platforms. This will be
  groundbreaking as the first LA River initiative that focuses on the human
  experience and potential of the LA River, in addition to the ecology,
  engineering and political aspects. Moving beyond the technical data, LA River
  Stories provides a platform for sharing data insights from the Frank Gehry-led
  study which is compiled into the LA River Index
  (http://riverlareports.riverla.org/). The data compiled by River LA partners
  Gehry Partners, Geosyntec, OLIN and others can now be contextualized through
  human stories that highlight why these opportunities matter. 


  Through social media and promotion, recognition of the LA River as a tangible
  sign of hope for transformation will spread and create a new movement, a new
  relationship. Our shared story will recognize the River as central to our
  health, well-being, and sense of place.
