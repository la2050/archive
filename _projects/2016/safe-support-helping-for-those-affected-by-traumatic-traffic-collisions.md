  There is a traffic collision every ten minutes in Los Angeles; these
  physically, mentally, and emotionally traumatic experiences impact 52,000
  survivors and their loved ones every year. SAFE Support provides a support
  group, practical resources, and important advocacy for these “victims of
  traffic.” Our experts help survivors heal from injuries, navigate the legal
  process, manage their daily lives, repair their mental health, and use their
  experiences to affect meaningful change.

  We define and measure success for SAFE Support based on two statistics. First,
  the number of traffic victims who recover such that they can return to their
  lives, families, and workplaces as productive members of Los Angeles society.
  Second, the number of advocates for safer streets created as a result of SAFE
  Support. These could include victims themselves, as well as their friends and
  family members who support our aims to improve government responsiveness and
  make meaningful changes to policy.

  LA is a sprawling city; roads, sidewalks, crosswalks, and pathways link
  communities together, both literally and figuratively. Unfortunately, these
  routes are often perilous, limiting Angelenos’ transportation options. SAFE
  Support will make LA the best place to connect by aiding those who have become
  victims of traffic, working with hospitals, local law firms, community
  leaders, public servants, and other civic-minded experts to help them recover.
  Since these are typically quite traumatic incidents, a major component of SAFE
  Support will be to provide social and emotional support to those who have been
  involved in a collision. 


  Next, these resilient survivors will be given the opportunity to do the same
  for others, giving their time, effort, and newfound knowledge to help fellow
  survivors as part of the SAFE Support network. Given that thousands of people
  in LA are impacted by collisions every year, this program will create a ripple
  effect, raising rates of volunteerism across communities, affecting
  exponentially more Angelenos by the day. 


  Furthermore, SAFE Support will become a driving force for victim advocacy.
  SAFE has already passed statewide legislation on hit-and-run collisions (with
  two more bills in progress) and actively works with city officials to author
  statutes that will make streets safer. In addition to expanding our network of
  volunteers, SAFE Support will motivate those who were once victims to become
  agents of change, partnering with our organization to improve government
  responsiveness to residents’ needs for safe streets, a basic necessity in this
  county. 


  Overall, SAFE Support will fill the gaps in the available social and emotional
  support for traffic victims while sparking volunteerism to assist even more
  survivors. In addition, our network will collaborate with civic leaders to
  ensure that local and state governments make broad changes that help all
  Angelenos walk, bike, drive, and connect safely.
