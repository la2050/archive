  MDA is a very reputable organization, founded in 1950. Through societal
  changes, research and funding changes, as well as the annual differences made
  in those 66 years, MDA remains a strong organization, helping over 4,000
  families in the Greater Los Angeles area. As for MDA Summer Camp, each year,
  our goal is to increase the number of campers, volunteers and sponsorship
  support. We feel that we have reached our sustainable goals in a few different
  ways. When campers and counselors provide feedback to the camp staff stating
  how much they love camp and how great their experience is, we know we have
  succeeded in setting forth our goal of meeting and exceeding campers and their
  family’s expectations. Additionally, each year we set a goal for our number of
  campers and volunteers. This number consistently increases annually. This
  gives us the quantitative results which correlate with success in our MDA
  Summer Camp goals.

  Kids with muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy and related
  life-threatening diseases face daily challenges that often make “just being a
  kid” difficult. MDA Summer Camp gives kids ages 6-17 the freedom to be kids
  with others who are just like them during a life-changing week of fun and
  friendship. Through the magic of summer camp, MDA offers a world of
  possibilities to campers — from swimming and horseback riding to zip-lining,
  adaptive sports and camp dances.

  MDA summer camp is the only camp of its kind, supporting and giving the
  opportunity to children ages 6-17 to join their peers, also facing similar
  struggles in life. Children living with muscular dystrophy and related
  life-threatening diseases face daily challenges that often make it difficult
  to 'just be a kid.' As their muscles progressively get weaker, children may
  lose basic functions such as walking, dressing, eating, talking or even
  breathing. MDA Summer Camp gives kids with muscular dystrophy and related
  diseases a chance to discover new interests while gaining self-confidence,
  forging lifelong friendships and experiencing the independence of being away
  from home in an environment where barriers don’t exist. 

  Prevalence over adverse childhood experiences - Some children require 24-hour
  care from parents or caregivers. However, at our summer camp, kids of all
  abilities are able to overcome their care needs and takes away the daily
  stress and pressures they face. This is one week of the year where these kids
  can truly live unlimited.  Prior to their diagnosis, our kids lived
  uninhibited and were able to lead active lives. Summer camp is an opportunity
  for them to be active again, with adaptive sports, zip-lining, and swimming. 

  Healthcare access - We are also able to provide these kids with access to
  amazing healthcare breakthroughs. As a result, our kids are living well into
  adulthood. MDA is the leading organization for the advancement of progress
  with muscular dystrophy. In the last 5 years, there have been more research
  breakthroughs than in the last 20 years combined. A perfect example is the
  FDA's approval of Eteplirsen, a drug that is helping children living with
  Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy treat symptoms of the disease and slow the
  progression.  These medical breakthroughs give kids the access to the
  healthcare they need in order to live longer and live stronger. 

  Residents receiving coordinated healthcare services - Additionally, the kids
  who attend summer camp benefit from MDA’s clinics. These clinics are able to
  provide specialized health-care to our families in Los Angeles. These clinics
  are critical to helping our kids live healthier lives. Specialists are able to
  provide one-on-one care to our families, ensuring each family's needs are met.
  Our clinics consist of visits from specialized doctors, social workers,
  occupational and physical therapists, dietitians, along with a member of our
  staff to ensure every aspect of the child's care is being considered. 

  Connect, emotional and social support - Finally, our summer camp provides our
  kids with the opportunity to be supported emotionally and socially. Many of
  these kids are the only one at their school in a wheelchair or with braces for
  their legs. At summer camp, this is the norm. All of our kids are able to feel
  the support of their peers and build friendships that last a lifetime.
