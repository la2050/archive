  Mega-MIMO 2.0 WiFi coordination can take place over multi-medium Mesh networks
  including WiGig, fiber, beam antennas, ethernet, and broadband over
  powerlines. This allows a Mega-Mesh to start with a small number of public
  institutions, with distributed local hosting of teaching tools such as online
  encyclopedias and coursework. Rather than depending on far away cloud
  providers, e-media or courseware owned by any library can be shared directly
  over its local Mega-Mesh.

  Schools, libraries, and museums currently use WiFi access points (AP) that get
  worse as more patrons connect to them, and they don't help at all with
  distributing learning resources in local caches. This means each additional
  patron connection puts more strain on the local network and its E-Rate
  subsidized Internet connection, so that it slows to a crawl or even breaks
  very often. 


  MIMO WiFi technologies use more than one antenna to beam connections to each
  new patron, which means net performance should actually increase as patrons
  are added. Mega-MIMO 2.0, as defined by MIT researchers, coordinates multiple
  AP's to make one big virtual MIMO AP, with more antenna and beam diversity as
  each AP is added. Combined with mesh routing methods, this allows existing
  WiFi antennae resources to connect with patrons much faster and farther out.
  These improvements are from better software, not expensive hardware. Our tests
  of WiFi speed, range, reliability, and costs should all improve accordingly.


  Once any Mega-Mesh extends beyond a host institution's walls, patrons who run
  Mega-Mesh software on their devices can also join in to grow the net even
  wider. As it grows into entire communities, local library and e-media
  resources hosted on the Mega-Mesh can be spread around these communities
  faster at lower costs. Event calendars and other locally sourced data can all
  stay local, including during emergencies. Speed and reliability of tested
  services should all improve as well.

  Too often, the Internet is seen as this big cloud of stuff very far away,
  where the only way to access it all is via the incumbent Big Telco or Big
  Cable gatekeeper, at whatever high prices they want. In reality, 'Internet' is
  just shorthand for 'interconnected networks', and anyone can build and own a
  small network without paying any monthly fees. Once anyone connects their own
  network with any neighbors', they are considered peers on their own inter-net.
  Unfortunately, that first incorrect view has been written into a lot of our
  utility and connection laws, including FCC E-Rate restrictions on the kinds of
  network services our public schools and libraries can afford. 


  The combination of new Mega-MIMO 2.0 WiFi and distributed Mesh technologies
  may allow us to fix these problems with Internet ownership and E-Rate
  restrictions, and allow local community learning resources to thrive over a
  local Mega-Mesh both online and off. With enough hardware funding for an
  experimental Learning Angels' Mega-Mesh (LAMM) network, Los Angeles
  institutions could become the first place where community teaching tools are
  distributed, instead of the last place community members search for vanishing
  scarce free WiFi.


  If enough prototype hardware is funded for at least 2 site installations,
  local Los Angeles learning institutions will all be eligible to apply to be
  one of the first sites with a seed Mega-Mesh. More funding or less expensive
  prototype hardware will allow us to accept more local institutions into the
  prototype test phase. Distributed mesh services can replace centralized or
  cloud library and e-media services on these Mega-Meshes, to directly serve
  community members, and depend less on remote gatekeepers.
