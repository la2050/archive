  City Year Los Angeles works tirelessly to solve our city’s dropout crisis
  through academic intervention, attendance monitoring, and social emotional
  support for LA’s highest need students.

project_summary: >-
  In the next five years, nearly 1 million California STEM jobs will need to be
  filled. City Year will pilot a STEM curriculum in 3 high schools to better
  prepare our students for these opportunities.

  CYLA will implement two assessments in order to evaluate the success of its
  STEM Pilot. The first is the Deveraux Student Strengths Assessment, or DESSA,
  which evaluates students’ growth in several areas of social emotional
  development. The DESSA measures such attributes as Personal Responsibility,
  Optimistic Thinking, and Goal-Oriented Behavior. All students attending the
  CYLA STEM pilot program will take a pre and post DESSA exam. We believe that
  growth in the DESSA metrics will indicate students’ increased confidence and
  sense of efficacy in STEM subjects.


  The second method of evaluation is the Math Inventory. This exam assesses a
  student’s academic knowledge and skill in math at the beginning of the year,
  and generates growth goals that are tailored towards each individual student.
  Implementation of the Math Inventory has been so successful in the past, that
  many LAUSD schools are now using it to assess their students at the
  school-wide level. We believe the work that students will complete in the STEM
  pilot program will significantly impact students’ ability to achieve the
  academic goals set for them through the Math Inventory. The real world
  application of fundamental math skills will help inspire students to continue
  their studies. CYLA will measure its success based on the number of students
  who are able to meet and/or exceed their growth goals by the end of the year.

  City Year’s pilot Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) program
  will empower students to write code, create video games, and pursue their
  technology interests in our after-school programs, deepening their
  understanding of key academic fundamentals that will help them graduate from
  high school, while building relevant skills for some of California’s most
  competitive future careers. This grant will enable City Year to pilot this
  program at three high-needs high schools in Los Angeles.

  Economic projections indicate that by 2018 there could be as many as 2.4
  million unfilled STEM jobs in the United States (Stem Depiction
  Opportunities). California, and specifically the city of Los Angeles,
  represents a huge percentage of these unfilled positions. It is an absolute
  necessity that LA’s children are prepared to meet the technological demands of
  the future. 


  Unfortunately, LA’s most high-need students are being disproportionately
  underprepared for the demands of the future workforce. According to the U.S.
  Department of Education for Civil Rights, 56% of high schools with low
  minority populations offer calculus, compared to only 33% of high schools with
  high minority populations. The same can be said for physics, which is offered
  at 67% of low minority schools but a mere 48% of high minority schools, and
  chemistry, which is offered at 78% of low minority schools but only 65% of
  schools with high black and Latino enrollment. Because of this unequal system,
  minority students are predisposed to be unprepared for future employment
  demands. These conditions perpetuate the cycle of poverty, and contribute to
  the struggle that children living in low-income communities have to change
  their circumstances. This is where City Year Los Angeles steps in to help.


  CYLA places AmeriCorps members, aged 17-25, in Los Angeles’ highest need
  schools in order to intervene directly with students who are at risk for
  dropping out of school. CYLA corps members are responsible for guiding
  students through their coursework in English Language Arts and math,
  supporting students in their social emotional growth, and ensuring students
  attend school consistently. Additionally, CYLA corps members offer students
  “extended learning time” after school so that students understand concepts and
  are on track towards success. 


  This year, CYLA is implementing a STEM pilot in our after school space in
  order to enrich student knowledge of concepts essential to a well-rounded
  education in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math. The program, called
  “Globaloria,” allows students to select which subsection of the STEM field
  interests them, and then complete independent, self-guided learning by using
  actual technology. Globaloria ensures students are learning real-world
  concepts by testing students in real ways. Through Globaloria’s platform
  students will write their own code, create their own video games, and design
  their own independent learning tracks. All along the way, City Year corps
  members will be there to guide students through learning these complicated
  processes. In addition, each pilot school will have a trained professional on
  site, ready to help students as they navigate their way through their
  learning.


  Implementation of this program in CYLA’s partner schools is a huge step
  towards closing the opportunity gap amongst LA’s high school students. Help
  CYLA prepare the students of Los Angeles for the demands and opportunities of
  their future.
