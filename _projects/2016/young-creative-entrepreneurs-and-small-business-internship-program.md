  each participant. Also, confidential feedback surveys will be handed out after
  each entrepreneur training workshop to evaluate workshop material, speaker and

  The project begins with a world-class youth entrepreneur training program
  encompassing activity-based leadership, marketing, financial, career
  development workshops and youth mentoring. The second part of the project
  places these highly trained youth at minority and women-owned small businesses
  applying what they learned by giving creative, innovative and technology-based
  business support: marketing, website, social media, and bookkeeping, etc.

  The training of youth entrepreneurs and exposing them to the city resources
  will be a long term asset to the economic development of Los Angeles. This may
  be particularly true for youth entrepreneurs that come from low and moderate
  income neighborhoods or with a criminal justice background. Research indicates
  that youth entrepreneurship training will help (1) Promote social and cultural
  identity, (2) Build a stronger sense of community, (3) Give youth, especially
  at-risk youth, a sense of meaning and belonging. Supporting research: White
  and Kenyon (2000). “Enterprise-Based Youth Employment Policies, Strategies and
  Programmes.” Draft Report to ILO, Geneva.


  This pilot program will be used to develop an entrepreneurship track for Mayor
  Eric Garcetti’s summer youth jobs program. Hire LA’s Youth is one of the
  City’s most exciting programs to put young adults to work, ensuring they have
  “first time” job experience that will set them on the path of lifetime
  earners. This year (2017), the City of Los Angeles committed to providing
  15,000  Jobs per capita for young people ages 14 to 24 who live in the city of
  Los Angeles. This resource serves youth looking to put their news skills to
  task and it serves the small business owners who are looking to give back and
  hire new talent. 


  By putting these HeArt of LA youth entrepreneurship training program
  participants to work, the business will benefit from having a highly motivated
  young adult in their workplace and the youth will gain by having a crucial
  career hands-on experience. Our program also focuses on developing small
  businesses who are creating jobs at a higher rate than bigger firms. Success
  of local businesses is directly linked to job per capita increase.


  Our youth program will not only support Minority- and women-owned firms who
  have up to date technological and social media knowledge but will also foster
  and create a new generation of minority and women-owned firms and by our
  recruitment efforts to women’s centers, first-generation youth, sororities in
  local higher education institutes, local non-profits, etc. An intended
  consequence from growing minority and women owned businesses is enriching
  culture, political views, and foreign relations increasing Los Angeles’s
  global economic influence(soft power). 


  Recruiting and retention rates for local higher education institutions will
  increase thanks to our program as we will partner with local higher education
  institutes to have representatives come and make presentations and engage our
  youth about their respective institutions and programs. 


  Youth that participate in this program are innovative, creative, community
  oriented, hardworking, dreamers, and possibly entrepreneurs in their own
  respect - full of untapped potential. The HeArt of LA will help unleash this
  potential by connecting youth to resources and programs will create long-term
  Angeleno entrepreneurs in our great city.
