  Fallen Fruit planted the first fruit park in Los Angeles in Jan 2013 at Del
  Aire Park, the first public fruit park in CA. With the youth from HOLA, we
  successfully completed a pilot of The Endless Orchard in the neighborhood
  surrounding MacArthur park in 2014. Since then, the project has gained
  incredible momentum, strong partnerships, and a creative and administrative
  infrastructure. With this in place and with the support of the Goldhirsh
  Foundation, Fallen Fruit anticipates the completion of the next phase of the
  project before the end of Spring 2017.


  This is our anticipated timeline for success: Winter/Spring 2017 (6 weeks) -
  Call for participation to expand The Endless Orchard in LA City by targeting
  existing at risk neighborhoods in food deserts and planting 200 Public Fruit
  Trees in collaboration with the public! Website + app completed by Feb 2016:
  Code Rodeo has been in partnership with Fallen Fruit to design and develop the
  Endless Orchard website (endlessorchard.com) and mobile app. The website + app
  will allow communities to map the public fruit trees and upload family and
  neighborhood histories to the geo-tagged trees. Build and reclaim the
  narrative of their community's history through their own words, photos and
  memories. With community participation, continue to plant fruit trees in the
  margins of public spaces, interstitial municipal spaces and in public
  rights-of-way at community orgs. Fine tune the app with public participation.
  Workshops on tree care.

  The Endless Orchard project collaborates with the citizens of Los Angeles
  planting fruit trees on the margins of public and private space, in front of
  homes and businesses and spaces like parkways, bike paths and alleys. Tree
  tags placed at each fruit tree identify it as part of a network of sharing.
  Anyone can collaborate with the project by planting, mapping, sharing, and
  navigating the fruit trees via the free online website and app.

  During a month long engagement at the new Los Angeles State Historic Park, we
  will host public fruit tree adoptions and planting days. We will provide fruit
  trees to Angeleno’s who want to collaborate on the project and who have an
  existing sunny space to plant in front of their property next to the sidewalk.
  New tree stewards agree to water and care for the trees. We will invite
  everyone to come help us plant the trees. All planted trees will be easily
  accessible from public spaces and they will be mapped on the Endless Orchard
  app and website. The Endless Orchard app and website, already

  under construction, is a simple graphic user interface building upon already
  available Google Maps API as a platform anyone can use via a computer or
  smartphone.


  The fruit tree donations and planting days are public events that create,
  strengthen and foster community. The Endless Orchard will invite neighbors to
  get out of their cars, walk their neighborhood, and meet fellow Angelenos!
  This project will encourage everyone to be friendly and say hi to people they
  don’t know while increasing access to healthy food. Fruit trees are beautiful;
  they clean the air, and add to the tree canopy.


  The online component will illustrate how we are connecting bike paths, public
  transits and metro stops through neighborhoods, as the Endless Orchard becomes
  a new healthy way to navigate our city for years to come.


  Benefits of The Endless orchard:

  The project promotes community health, supports food security and combat high
  rates of nutrition-related diseases by creating a fun, beautiful and drought
  tolerant way for community members to take a walk, and by making free,
  nutritious, fresh fruit available to anyone who walks by. Studies suggest that
  contact with nature beneficially impacts blood pressure, heart rate, mood,
  day- to-day effectiveness, social behavior, cognitive functioning, and work
  performance. This project will stimulate the economy by helping to save tax
  dollars and increase local income. Let’s improve the environment by planting
  fruit trees with spongy root systems that will catch a significant amount of
  rainwater and that will remove both C02 and pollutants from the air. Fruit
  trees actually clean the soil - Hardwood trees remove toxins which do not end
  up in the fruit but are exfoliated through their leaves.The Endless Orchard
  Invites the community to participate in spearheading the transformation of Los
  Angeles into an innovative example of community

  resources and public space. Shared stories about the diversity and richness of
  the community that can be experienced by walking the trail via the strong
  online component of the Endless Orchard where people can upload neighborhood
  and family histories to geo-tagged trees they have planted. In 50 years, the
  community will still be able to walk the Endless Orchard and the trees will
  still be bearing fruit.
