  Because of HHCLA, Los Angeles region’s most vulnerable population has the
  resources and linkages to care to lead healthier, informed lives. And everyone
  in the community benefits when they do.


  HHCLA's plan for defining and measuring success is designed to create and
  sustain a culture of continuous quality improvement, and client involvement in
  the operations of the program and commitment to provide the highest quality
  services. The agency’s comprehensive plan ensures that resources are
  consistently available to conduct Quality Control, Assurance, and Improvement
  processes and activities within the agency. Essential strategies HHCLA uses to
  solicit feedback include: 1) conducting needs assessments to identify gaps in
  services or program needs; 2) administering client satisfaction surveys on a
  quarterly basis; 3) staff surveys/input; 4) conducting program evaluations to
  assess the effectiveness of the services being provided; 5) staff trainings;
  6) productivity standards; and 7) performance evaluations. Examples of
  utilization review activities include: number of overdose prevention trainings
  provided to clients and local agencies, number of naloxone/overdose prevention
  kits distributed, review of access to services; and program participation
  rates.


  While these efforts support the overall goal of the plan to define and measure
  success, true success is every time an overdose is reversed via HHCLA and the
  community’s efforts. Success means saving lives.

  Los Angeles and the rest of the country are experiencing an opioid epidemic,
  and drug overdose deaths are now the leading cause of unintended death in the
  US, over car accidents. Help HHCLA save lives via its naloxone distribution
  program that empowers people to make a real impact in this increasing
  epidemic. HHCLA clients have reported over 1,000 overdose reversals to date
  and this number will only continue to grow with the proper training and
  resources.

  HHCLA is dedicated to responding to the increasingly complicated health care
  issues of the Los Angeles area homeless and vulnerable populations. HHCLA does
  whatever is necessary to help unhoused individuals secure housing and to stay
  housed. All programing is based on the principles of Harm Reduction and
  creating a Trauma-Informed Care environment, where participants are treated
  with respect, no judgement, and recognized as the primary leader in improving
  their quality of life. By providing a full suite of services for participants—
  such as behavioral healthcare, health services, housing, syringe exchange,
  overdose prevention, and an array of supportive services, HHCLA seeks to
  reduce the impact of homelessness in LA County. Since 1985, over 150,000
  homeless men, women, and children have received services from HHCLA leading
  toward an improved quality of life and recovery from health, mental health and
  substance use issues.


  Over 1,000 individuals have been trained with HHCLA’s LA County Certified
  Overdose Prevention Program. In 2015 alone, an estimated 1,700 naloxone kits
  were distributed. An opioid overdose is preventable and reversible with the
  use of this lifesaving drug! Naloxone, an “opioid antagonist” medication is
  used to counter the effects of an opioid overdose, from morphine, heroin, or
  various prescription opiate painkillers.


  HHCLA’s underlying objectives are to positively impact the communities of Los
  Angeles, and:


  * Help individuals reduce the harm they are causing to themselves in a
  nonjudgmental approach

  * Improve each Angelino’s quality of life

  * Contribute in making Los Angeles a safer, healthier, and better place to
  live


  HHCLA utilizes best practices to train individuals and agencies in overdose
  prevention and on how to do this critical lifesaving work. HHCLA is to the
  go-to group and its collective expertise is highly effective. HHCLA is in need
  of new funding streams because in order to do this kind of innovation and
  work, it is still nonetheless hard to find funding. HHCLA has found that
  offering such an array of services and not focusing on a more specific one-way
  approach towards helping others can create a challenge to raise funds to
  operate in this inclusive manner. HHCLA recognizes first and foremost that the
  most vulnerable people will die if they are unable to receive such
  comprehensive aid. Individuals are treated in a “whatever it takes” approach
  towards ensuring they receive the help they need. 


  If fully funded, HHCLA will be able to accomplish the following: 


  * Provide at least 5,000 overdose prevention trainings and kits 

  * Distribute at least 10,000 naloxone doses (provided in the overdose kit)


  According to LA County, 1 death could be prevented for every 227 naloxone kits
  distributed. Be part of curbing this epidemic!
