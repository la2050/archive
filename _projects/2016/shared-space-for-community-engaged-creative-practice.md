  Cornerstone has a culture of rigorous evaluation.


  We are participating in a national study on the intrinsic impact of our
  audiences. We have begun working to develop tools that are an accumulation of
  the metrics of engagement: the number of interactions, length of activities,
  and demographics related to ethnicity and income. 


  To collect data we make paper questionnaires available to our audiences
  immediately after our performances, and follow up with email invitations to
  electronic surveys, which collect our audiences’ experiences, emotional
  impact, demographics, and identification with the play and subject matter of
  the production.


  The pilot phase of the Community Space will include community focus groups and
  engagement activities. For these programmatic activities we will create a
  system for community input. We will measure and track participant responses. 


  The goal of the pilot phase of the project is to brainstorm and collect ideas
  on the potential of what the community space could be; therefore Cornerstone
  will be open to any and all feedback from all community stakeholders and
  leaders. 


  With this phase of the project, Cornerstone looks to identify organizational
  partners. A measurement of success will be 4 to 5 partners in mutual alignment
  for a community-engaged art making space.

project_description: >-
  Building a coalition of practitioners from different fields, Cornerstone
  proposes the development of a Shared Space for Community Engaged Creative
  Practice. This shared space will serve as a public space for practitioners to
  create a cross-disciplinary 'engagement commons;' an open space filled with
  vibrant and diverse community-based approaches and projects that cultivates
  platforms from which communities of LA from all backgrounds can come together
  and engage in civic discourse and art-making.

  We envision a home that provides a shared space embedded in a neighborhood
  community for Angelenos to come together to create, collaborate and engage in
  dialogue bridging communities and acting as a site for civic engagement and
  creative practice. This shared space will not only be functional for
  Cornerstone as a home base, but will also catalyze a public space for the
  study and practice of community-based work. As we take steps towards a new
  physical building anchored in a Los Angeles neighborhood, we will invite in a
  broad coalition of local and regional community-based practitioners to create
  a cross-disciplinary “engagement commons;” an open space filled with vibrant
  and diverse community-based approaches and projects. 


  With LA2050, we will initiate discussion with potential institutional
  partners, and our network of community stakeholders—including community
  activists, community-engaged artists, nonprofit leaders, and city and county
  officials—to identify current needs, partners and challenges. Cornerstone is
  interested in how our community-engagement methodology, honed over thirty
  years of practice, might guide the development of the Community Space. Our
  discussion will lead to the hiring of a consultant to complete a feasibility
  study for a site and physical location. 


  Building a coalition of practitioners from different fields, we will begin
  forging the collective strength by forming discussion groups, mailing lists,
  sharing digital space and engaging in affinity marketing. We can collectively
  approach civic, commercial and political leaders for support and investment in
  realizing the Community Space. Shared resources that the space might provide
  to both Cornerstone and co-founding partners include thought partnership,
  rehearsal space, production or exhibition space, studios, and administrative
  offices. We can also envision joint efforts such as project-based
  collaborations and as a research hub to study and examine community-based art
  making practices. We envision creating opportunities for field leaders,
  especially artists of color, seniors and young people, to engage in dialogue,
  undertake residencies, build their work, experiment, and cooperate with
  similarly engaged colleagues.  


  We envision a shared space that is open to all forms of civic dialogue and
  empowerment even those outside of art making, for example as polling sites or
  as a meeting space for community activists. Regionally and nationally, the
  potential that such a space holds will be illuminating for the field-at-large,
  as more and more organizations seek methods of addressing lack of equity,
  diversity and inclusion in our increasingly multicultural society through
  creative practice and aesthetic outcomes. Empowering Angelenos towards
  ownership of their community leads to collective impact. Catalyzing this
  dialogue connects local leaders; bringing them to the table creates a common
  agenda, while striving towards systemic change.
