project_measure: >-
  We are attempting to create a community of writers, so to the extent we do so
  we will consider it a success. That would mean 15-20 writers producing
  stories, books of several themes published, a speakers series that includes
  talks, book presentations attended by 50-100 people, and a rich social media
  presence.

project_description: >-
  We will expand the Tell Your True Tale writing workshops at the LA County
  Library, which for three years have been helping people with little writing
  experience identify, write and polish their stories, creating nonfiction tales
  that read like fiction. We will create a community of writers turning good
  narratives into great ones - both online and at three workshops we propose at
  libraries in East LA, Compton/South-Central and Rosemead, each aimed at
  producing a volume of stories.

project_proposal_best_place: "We’re already doing it! \n\t\nNew writers are making connections, sharing their work with the community and building a culture of writing in areas where this may not have existed before.  \n\nWe just need help to continue and expand the project.\n\nUp to now, Tell Your True Tale workshops have been supported by the County Library; but that support is not open-ended. We also want to diversify and include different community partners.\n\nSince starting at ELA Library in 2013, the workshops have taken some 50 people with no previous writing experience, helped them imagine and polish their stories, then published books of their pieces – leaving them energized by the creation and eager for more. Many of the participants have taken the workshop two and three times. We are at the beginnings of a new arts organization.\n \nWe’re now up to seven volumes of their stories. These volumes form a magnificent mosaic of life, and lives, in Los Angeles. They also show the deep mine of stories out there just waiting like diamonds to be dug up and polished. Los Angeles is a collection of bubbles of people, from across the country and the world, who know little about each other. Tell Your True Tale volumes bridge that, show the depth and breadth of the people who have settled here, and present a template for how to access their stories.\n\nWe bring the community together in public gatherings – book presentations that feature the authors, let them talk about their stories, sign books, feel the energy that comes with a newly published work.\n\nOur motto is: Write Then Rewrite. No successful communication, no great story, no real creativity, comes without rewriting, editing, and more revising. We aimed to create nonfiction stories from working people’s lives that read like fiction. Our seven books show that we have succeeded."
