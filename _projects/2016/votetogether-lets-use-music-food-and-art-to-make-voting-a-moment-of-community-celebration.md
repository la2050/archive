  We propose using food, music, and art to make voting a community-driven moment
  of celebration, and improve voter participation in Los Angeles.  Building on
  successful research by Columbia Professor Don Green, Civic Nation will expand
  a pilot program we began in 2016. We will engage with community partners in
  Los Angeles to stage events at voting locations and study the results to
  measure the impact on voter participation.

  Following the election, Professor Green will conduct the statistical analysis
  based on the precinct-level turnout data in our control and treatment sites. 
  Through his analysis we will learn the impact of the events on voter
  participation. The report and analysis would also look at down ballot voting
  and the research would be submitted for Institutional Review Board approval.

  Voter participation is the cornerstone of America’s democracy. We believe that
  should be celebrated within communities. So we are proposing an expansion of a
  successful pilot program that uses music, food, and art to make voting a
  community-driven moment of celebration because Los Angeles a hub of art and
  culture, and because LA2050 has a goal for Los Angeles to lead the nation in
  voter participation rates.  In addition, we will test the program through a
  random control trial so that we can accurately measure our impact. 


  In 2005 and 2006, Professor Green, then at Yale University, and Professors
  Elizabeth M. Addonizio and James M. Glaser, of Yale and Tufts University,
  respectively, conducted a study on the quantitative effects of voting as a
  social engagement. They implemented an experiment in the form of fourteen
  Election Day Poll Parties in communities across the nation. Each community was
  engaged to help plan, and then invited to attend, a local, all-ages voting
  event including food and family-friendly entertainment. These Election Day
  events saw a rise of 6.5% voter participation in areas with high levels of
  voter participation, and a rise of 2.6% in areas with low levels of voter
  participation.  


  Civic Nation is in the process of executing a similar experiment in 2016. To
  expand the experiment and post-pilot the successful results in Los Angeles in
  2017, we will take the following steps: 


  1) Engage, and partner with, non-partisan community groups in Los Angeles to
  choose 20 viable experiment sites--early vote or Election Day polling
  locations that do not pose physical barriers such as safety or accessibility
  issues, inadequate space or parking, etc. 


  2) In coordination with those local groups we will seek all the proper
  permissions to hold the event from elections boards, municipal entities and
  the proprietors of the locations themselves (such as libraries, fire houses
  etc.)


  3) Once we have permissions for 20 viable sites, Professor Green will randomly
  select 10 to be the treatment sites (where events will be held) and 10 to be
  the control sites (where no events will be held). 


  4) Then we will engage with each of the communities to create events that
  match the personality and preferences of those neighborhoods through food,
  music, art and other elements. And we will work with our local partners to
  ensure robust communication about the events.


  Our project will adhere to all legal guidelines and restrictions: The events
  will be open to all, regardless of whether individuals vote or have voted.
  Also, nothing in the events will advocate on behalf of any candidate or party.
  This includes within speakers’ remarks, materials, etc.


  Through this pilot project expansion we will offer Angelenos a way to vote
  that is community-driven, celebratory, creative, and collaborative. By
  conducting the effort as a random control trial, we will learn more about
  effective strategies to improve voter participation in Los Angeles.
