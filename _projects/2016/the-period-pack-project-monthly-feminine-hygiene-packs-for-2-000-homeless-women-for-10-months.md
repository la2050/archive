  Our Period Pack Project will provide sustainably-produced toxic-free tampons
  and pads to 2,000 of L.A.'s most critically-underserved homeless women, every
  month, for 10 months. That's 20,000 packs. Can you imagine getting you period
  while living on the streets? Our Period Packs include biodegradable waste bags
  and feminine wipes, as well as tampons and pads, providing essential items to
  women, focusing on access, environment, and human dignity.

  The distributing to and subsequent regular use of Period Packs by homeless
  women on the streets and in homeless shelters across LA, will enable us to
  quantifiably measure the use and success of the product and service itself.

  Further investigation of feminine hygiene and plastic trash levels in our
  waterways in cooperation with LA Waterkeeper, Santa Monica Bay org., and Heal
  the Bay, will reveal disposal and compostable/biodegradable efficacy. 

  Moreover, the ability for homeless women to go about their lives without being
  halted by their period is a key metric, so too the comparable health results
  and hygiene levels of homeless women visiting health centers in the county.

  Homelessness is one of the most pressing issues facing Los Angeles today, and
  while on the increase, has been identified as a key focus of improvement both
  for the lives of those affected by being homeless, and the communities and
  resources in which homeless people live.

  Homeless women are particularly at risk in this critically underserved
  segment.

  Homeless women are often without pads or tampons when they get their period
  and have been reported as using dirty rags to deal with the monthly
  occurrence. Not only is this unsanitary, it is degrading, humiliating and
  debilitating. 

  Being without feminine hygiene can put a literal halt on a homeless woman's
  journey to housing, both physically and mentally, as she is forced into a very
  vulnerable situation.

  Quite simply, our Period Pack Project would enable the distribution of 2,000
  organic feminine hygiene packs each month to homeless women for a timespan of
  10 months.

  All products in the Period Packs are biodegradable, limiting environmental
  impact, waste, and trash - benefiting waterways, local water recycling, and
  the community as a whole.

  Period Packs also come with biodegradable waste bags, and organic wipes,
  enabling homeless women the opportunity to feel somewhat 'clean' during her
  period, boosting confidence, control, and possibility.

  In the short-term, the immediate supply of natural and organic feminine
  hygiene products to homeless women is obvious - in the long-term, such access
  to essential items is aimed at returning a sense of self and empowerment to
  homeless women, on a road to reducing homelessness in LA altogether.
