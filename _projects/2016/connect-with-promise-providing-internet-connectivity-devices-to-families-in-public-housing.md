  EveryoneOn on will track the number of low-income people in public housing who
  receive devices and get connected to the Internet at home, tracking outcomes
  in education post connectivity. In short, not only will we track the actual
  number of Internet adoptions, but the benefits of which these adoptions yield
  long term results in regards to educational progress and economic mobility.
  Through local data collection, on the ground surveys, standardized questions,
  and real time evaluations, we will be able to analyze the effectiveness of our
  outputs versus outcomes, measuring our findings against comparable data.
  Rigorous monitoring and evaluation for EveryoneOn thus far has yielded useful
  insights which have guided our overall operations. In addition, we plan to
  highlight success stories to help show the real life impact that digital
  inclusion provides.

  Since 2012, EveryoneOn has been connecting people in the U.S. to low-cost
  Internet, devices, and digital literacy training. Internet connectivity is
  critical to learning and educational advancement today, especially when 80% of
  children need the Internet to do their homework and 90% of college
  applications are filled out online. In collaboration with AT&T, we will
  facilitate Internet connectivity and devices for families living in public
  housing within Los Angeles’ designated Promise Zones.

  Technology has changed the way we do business, pursue education, find jobs,
  and communicate. Yet in the country that invented the Internet, nearly one in
  five Americans (64 million), disproportionately from low-income and minority
  communities, are not connected to the Internet at home, forcing them to use
  inconvenient public sources to access basic services. The global impact of the
  digital divide lies in how it compounds and deepens other social inequalities.
  For example, 80% of K-12 students need Internet to do homework, 90% of college
  applications are filled out online, and 90% of job applications are hosted
  online.  An unemployed person who has Internet at home will be employed over
  seven weeks faster, due to availability of online job search platforms and
  advice, which translates into over $5,000 in additional income over a year. 
  Across the realms of education, employment, and beyond, the means of
  advancement are digital in this day and age. This is especially true for
  families living in public housing who, on average, live at 50% of the poverty
  line.


  EveryoneOn is committed to eliminating the digital divide by making
  high-speed, low-cost Internet, computers/tablets, and free digital literacy
  training accessible to all unconnected people in the U.S. By employing a
  dynamic strategy through Connect with Promise, we plan to connect households
  living in public housing, a population that is dramatically underserved and
  the least likely to be connected. If we can eliminate the digital divide
  within public housing, we can transfer this strategy to end the divide in
  other low-income populations, and use connectivity to create social mobility
  for all. 


  Connecting people to the Internet creates opportunities for lifelong learning.
  Internet connectivity is imperative in providing all Los Angeles students with
  access to early education programs, the capability to graduate from high
  school and be college and career ready, and acts as a key tool in parents
  ability to be engaged and empowered to direct their children’s learning.
  Today, the ultimate vehicle for opportunity is through the Internet.
