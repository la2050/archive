  Gaggle uses a fun wearable beacon combined with a mobile app to create a
  revolutionary new child safety service to help monitor large groups of
  students on school field trips.

  Surveys, assessments, and interviews with school staff, parents, chaperones,
  and community members will help grade effectiveness and impact on LA2050 play
  metrics. We will monitor numerous factors during trips.  Feedback will be
  correlated with measured performance of the Gaggle service.  Monitored factors
  include:


  * Frequency and duration of separation alerts.

  * Frequency and duration of temporary disconnections between a child and the
  group.

  * Mobile device battery use due to the application during the activity.

  * Chaperone use of the application features.

  * Errors or problems encountered by the application.


  Adjustments will be made after each activity to address any issues.  


  Success will be measured by the following:


  * Increased number of children who participate in field trips.

  * Increase of time spent on activities (reduction of active monitoring time).

  * Percent chaperone satisfaction with the service.

project_description: >-
  We will expand on our pilot program in a number of Los Angeles schools: the
  service will be tested on dozens of field trips across a wide variety of
  locations with elementary school children. Performance will be monitored and
  improvements made to the hardware and software.  We will develop new wearable
  beacons for use with young children, improve the mobile app, and ensure the
  service is robust enough to handle substantial simultaneous usage.

  A large number of kids cannot participate in school field trips due to
  parental concerns over their safety. We consulted with public school
  administrators and teachers and discovered that this was a growing issue,
  often preventing children from experiencing parks, museums, cultural and
  educational programs, and more.


  After being one of many chaperones on a field trip with a class of 125
  elementary school kids we had the opportunity to see the challenges of
  monitoring both large and small groups. Not only is a chaperone tasked with
  the important duty of protecting a group of children, but the chaperone must
  spend a significant amount of time gathering and monitoring the group, even
  when there is nothing wrong.  This experience has inspired us to develop a
  solution to this problem using smart phones that most chaperones already
  carry.


  Gaggle is a unique, new child safety service that helps families and groups
  keep track of each other.  Children on field trips wear a Gaggle Beacon, which
  allows a chaperone to know that a child is near. Chaperones use an iOS or
  Android application that is linked to the bracelets, allowing them to know
  when a child has moved out of range. This real time, continuous, automated
  attendance monitoring allows a trip to run much more smoothly, and more
  importantly, safely.


  If a child separates from the group, or the group moves on without the child,
  their primary chaperone(s) will be alerted before they have a chance to wander
  too far away:  instead of many minutes passing before a chaperone realizes a
  child is missing, they are alerted in seconds. If the child is not readily
  found, the alert can be escalated to the entire trip or even to every person
  who has the Gaggle application installed on their phone.


  What makes our service unique is that all the chaperones are linked to one
  another via the Gaggle cloud service. If a child moves between groups, their
  chaperone will know that the child is not actually lost. Information is shared
  among every chaperone of a trip, and if escalated, every local Gaggle user.
