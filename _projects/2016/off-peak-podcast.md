  Our project is about building and reinforcing the Angeleno story. From a
  quantitative perspective, we will measure our success by the number of times
  the podcast is downloaded, the number of times it is listened to, direct or
  media related responses to the podcast, and community engagement with the
  development of future episodes. However, our true success is intangible. As
  such, we will define our success as helping to remind our fellow Angelenos of
  our urban story, and helping them to explore the variety of ways we move
  around our great region.

  LA has reputation for being a region of missed connections and traffic jams.
  We are challenging that assertion & telling the story of LA County through a
  podcast series that is intended to spark conversations and generate enthusiasm
  for the experiences of how we get around and live in our urban region. Off
  Peak uses storytelling to bring the past, present, and future of transit to
  the people of LA County.


  Both inside and outside LA, there is an outdated stereotype that the only way
  to get around is through a sea of traffic congestion. But, there is so much
  more to getting around our region. LA has an iconic past of cycleways,
  electric rail service, funiculars, and a veritable encyclopedia of transit
  dreams that didn’t quite make it (Just Google: Aerial Swallow Burbank!). We
  also have a vibrant bus, rail, pedestrian, and cycling community, with
  entrepreneurs trying to disrupt the single-occupancy-vehicle at every turn. 


  These are the stories we want to bring to our community, shifting our
  perspective and our connection to our city and one another. Off Peak
  challenges the traditional car-centric narrative of Southern California
  through a story-driven series of podcasts. The series celebrates the
  intriguing stories that occur between Point A and Point B, as we roll and
  stroll. 


  Each episode features real people with real experiences in LA, and we
  encourage story ideas and participation with all segments of the community. We
  document important events within transit and serve as a trusted voice for
  people who may not otherwise be heard. The long-term vision for Off Peak will
  feature community events, live performances, and regular segments connecting
  citizens to Metro in a personal and human way.


  Metro is producing a four-podcast mini-series to kick off this concept. Two
  podcasts have already launched with a third coming on October 7. In “True
  Tales from Bus Drivers” listeners get a front-row seat to the twists and turns
  of maneuvering a 40-foot bus through LA. From nerve wracking 1st days, getting
  lost en route, sexism, homelessness, and the passengers that make it all
  worthwhile, Metro bus operators are the modern Zen masters of the streets.

  “Roads Were Not Made for Cars” tells the story of the evolution of American
  roads from their origins as ancient paths for mastodons to the rutted muck
  tracks traveled by horse drawn carriages, through their virtual abandonment
  during the height of the train era and on to their resurrection as smoothly
  paved roads designed for bicyclists. How we got to the car-covered roads of
  today is a tangle of coincidences and conspiracies that no one would have
  predicted. 


  We’re asking for your support to take the 4 episode pilot that we have begun,
  and expand this project with an additional 12 episodes to continue to grow and
  expand our communal story, reminding our community how Los Angeles is truly
  the best place in the world to connect with our fellow citizens.
