  PIECES has been empowering young people through the arts since 2012. It is a
  successful program that allows for young adults, ages 18 - 25 to explore their
  potential, reach for higher goals in a safe, and highly creative environment.
  As an establishment in the West Los Angeles area, it has members from areas
  such as Hollywood and the Valley. 


  Our organization prides itself on helping young creatives reach small and
  larger career goals, and personal goals. With the guidance and assistance of
  PIECES, visual artists have actively sold artwork and painted their first
  murals. Singers and songwriters have recorded full albums and shared their
  music live on stages around LA County. Some have moved on to pursue owning
  their own creative businesses, re-enrolling in school, and enrolling in
  college courses for the first time.


  With more funding, PIECES can make more of this happen. Ensuring that more
  young people stay hungry and encouraged to reach for their goals.
