  Monitoring and Evaluation will be important components of the program
  throughout every phase of implementation. This will ensure a continuous
  improvement to ensure its success. 

  Following the implementation of the shower program, we will define and measure
  its success by the following metrics:

  1. The number of homeless that come in to take showers daily.

  2. How often the same number of homeless comes in per week.

  3. A reduction in the number of unkempt homeless seen on the streets of
  Downtown Los Angeles. 

  4. The number of homeless who obtained jobs, housing, and healthcare through
  improved appearance.

project_description: >-
  Statistics have shown that the number of homeless in Downtown Los Angeles is
  quite overwhelming, being homeless is indicative of little or no access to
  shower facilities. Based on this fact, Living Spring Foundation in
  collaboration with Bency Medical Services seeks to provide free shower
  opportunities for the homeless within that region. This will involve providing
  a trailer shower, strategically located where the homeless can take showers
  daily and improve their personal hygiene and dignity.
project_impact: '["Self-sufficiency","Homelessness"]'
project_proposal_best_place: "Los Angeles (L.A.) is the second largest city in the United States, it a great tourist destination, however, it is known for its high population of homeless. This is due to various factors, which has left people on the streets, homeless, without access to adequate services, showers inclusive. Recent studies have shown a marked increase in the number of homeless in L.A., with over 10,000 in the Downtown area of Los Angeles, and over 6,000 veterans. These homeless are seen on the streets, night and day, most times looking unkempt. In spite of their possession of clean clothing, without a proper shower, the effect is all but negated. \n\nWhile the city of Los Angeles strives to be the best place to live, through the humanitarian services of the city and other organizations, providing food, shelter, healthcare, and more, to this group, there is a gap in the attention to their personal hygiene. In view of this, Living Spring Foundation, which is aimed at bringing hope to the less-privileged seeks to embark upon this program, which is providing free showers starting in Downtown L.A. This activity will buttress the other humanitarian services and further contribute towards making L.A. the best place to live. \n\nIf Living Spring Foundation is granted this award for the implementation of the shower program, we will offer warm and cool baths, encouraging the homeless to come at least twice a week to daily. Thus, making L.A. a better place to play, a better place to connect, and a better place to live. \nSome of the benefits to the homeless include:\n-\tImproved hygiene. \n-\tImproved self-esteem and dignity.\n-       The homeless will be happy with themselves.\n-\tBetter positioning for access to job, healthcare, housing, and food.\n-\tImproved relationship with city officials, police inclusive.\nThe benefits of this project cannot be over-emphasized; as it not only affects the homeless, but also the city of L.A., thus making L.A. the best place to live, play and connect."
