  SCV Adventure Play aims to measure our success by;


  1) Bi-weekly meetings:  The Playworker team will meet to discuss observations
  and community feedback on how to solve problems and make changes to the site
  and events.  Discussion, observation, and reflection are essential to connect
  with the kids in a proper assessment of their play needs.
   
  2) Twice annual community review (Eureka Villa): To build a strong
  relationship with the community, we will hold open meetings twice a year to
  address ideas about how goals and community needs are being met.
   
  3) Monitoring data and methods: Playworkers will use photographs, observations
  of play, journals of their experience, and informal recorded interviews for
  evaluation as well as documentary purposes.
   
  4) Attendance Sheets (Eureka Villa): Attendance at the park and or “how you
  heard about Eureka Villa” data will be tracked via attendance sheets collected
  at each open day and compiled, analyzed and evaluated every month.
   
  5) Surveys and Follow-ups:  To make sure we are engaging communities at the
  park and pop-ups we will perform online surveys once or twice a year to
  continue a dialogue about how to improve our practice.  This will include
  follow-ups after our pop-up or park events with organizers to specify areas we
  need to improve while events are still fresh.

  Santa Clarita Valley Adventure Play (SCVAP) will help make LA the best place
  to play through two initiatives: 1) launching a year long series of free
  pop-up adventure playgrounds in the LA region and 2) establishing Eureka Villa
  Adventure Playground (EVAP), the first in LA County.


  Since its inception in 2014, SCVAP, with a basic staff of two and a handful of
  volunteers, has held over 70 pop-up adventure events in the LA area and has
  been actively developing Eureka Villa, a 2-acre nature park where kids build
  with hard materials, use tools, and develop the space long term. Through our
  existing efforts we estimate that we’ve served over 1,000 families, and are
  eager to expand our reach.   


  Adventure playgrounds (AP’s) and playwork, although relatively new to the US,
  have a long and vibrant history of protecting the rights of children to claim
  space in their communities as their own.  Although many older generations
  played freely in abandoned lots or empty spaces, LA kids’ activities are
  structured more than ever and available play options, if they exist, largely
  consist of manufactured playgrounds focusing only on locomotor play.  AP’s are
  staffed with Playworkers who are trained to keep the kids safe while
  interfering with the play as little as possible.  This allows kids to play
  under self direction, enhancing problem solving, social and emotional skills,
  and confidence in one’s own life interests and choices.  


  Our first initiative, expanding our pop-up AP events, increases no-cost
  options and extends our reach into more communities in LA especially those
  with little play opportunities. Using supplies such as boxes, containers,
  fabric, etc., the kids create their own play space.  They are unrestricted by
  income, age, location, learning style or disability.  Neighbors both young and
  old come together at our AP’s creating fun community building opportunities.
  This play can also continue beyond the event!  Our playworkers role model
  various AP practices for parents, educators and caregivers to implement in the
  home or anywhere using materials we may otherwise throw away or recycle.  


  Our second initiative, opening Eureka Villa Adventure Playground (EVAP),
  offers L.A. County its first  permanent adventure play experience.  EVAP will
  be staffed by playworkers to encourage kids to explore their environment, use
  tools to build, take down, re-build and manipulate the space however they
  want.   At EVAP kids connect with nature by using its natural elements to
  facilitate their needs, hang out with friends, or find quiet repose from their
  busy lives.  In order to open EVAP to the public, we need to replace fencing,
  add storage, and prepare accommodations for more visitors to maintain regular
  hours.


  SCVAP’s initiatives fit the needs of any LA community, are any size, for any
  age and cultivate quality space for kids to play on their terms.  By providing
  radically different permanent and mobile play spaces we will make LA the best
  place to Play!
