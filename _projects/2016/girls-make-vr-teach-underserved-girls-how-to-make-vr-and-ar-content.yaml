Please describe your project proposal.: >-
  We are creating an educational platform to give underserved girls resources to
  empower them as valuable creators in this new tech and media landscape. 
  Recently, VRLA School, Arts Bridging the Gap, SH//FT and other organizations
  collaborated to put on the first Girls Make VR hands-on workshop for young
  girls interested in learning how to make interactive Virtual Reality (VR)
  content.  It proved to be a hugely valuable experience for the girls -
  immersing them in a new world and potential future.
Which metrics will your proposal impact?​:
  - College completion
  - College matriculation rates
  - District-wide graduation rates
  - Youth unemployment and underemployment
In what areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles
  - City of Los Angeles
Describe in greater detail how your proposal will make LA the best place.: >-
  Los Angeles is one of the great technology centers of the world -  with the
  confluence of its renowned entertainment industry and bustling tech scene, LA
  is a natural setting for the VR/AR industry to flourish and VRLA School,
  SH//FT, and Arts Bridging the Gap have been at the center of it. VRLA put on
  its 2016 Summer Expo at the LA Convention Center, hosting 6000 attendees eager
  to dive into the new world of mixed reality. At their expo, VRLA School had
  the first Girls Make VR workshop with Arts Bridging the Gap, SH//FT, Radeon
  Technologies Group, CyberPowerPC, Unity, Oculus, Girls Who Code, Big Brothers
  Big Sisters, and a number of other organizations.  We were inspired by the
  enthusiasm and engagement of the girls who attended this hands-on workshop, so
  we decided to take it further with an educational platform that facilitates
  more frequent events with a similar focus and goal. 


  It is clear VR and AR these new mediums will greatly impact our near future –
  where all disciplines like architecture, storytelling, gaming, health, art,
  music, and more are affected. Now is the time to pilot a program that enables
  equal opportunity in this quickly developing field. This industry thrives on
  empathizing with different perspectives – a strong balance of genders,
  ethnicities, ages, and backgrounds will lead to a richer blend of content that
  will drive innovation of the tech. This means all kinds of VR/AR developers,
  designers, engineers, story creators, artists, entrepreneurs, and more are
  needed – we want to make sure girls have a strong part in that mix. By
  starting these classes today we are ensuring jobs for these girls in the
  future.


  VRLA School has shown the importance and need for education in the VR/AR
  industry through their frequent educational events. They’ve worked to gather
  and democratize the practices and findings of this tech and media space.


  Even still it can be nearly impossible for younger girls to be given the
  encouragement and skills to create VR/AR content themselves. The tech is
  expensive, schools and other programs aren’t yet equipped themselves to teach
  VR/AR creation methodologies, and societal barriers still exist that dissuade
  girls from embracing what’s possible. We want to make it possible for young
  girls to jump those hurdles reverse those hurdles by making the VR/AR tech,
  skills, and creative practices exciting and accessible.


  Arts Bridging the Gap and SH//FT understand and navigate the hurdles that
  girls from these communities experience in their endeavor to thrive. We feel
  that the art of technology is a bright spark of possibility for these girls
  and their future success.

  Our classes will open girls' hearts and minds to the importance of learning by
  igniting their abilities in this forward thinking industry, making LA the
  leading city for change.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.​: >-
  We will base our success of three areas with specific metrics

  1. Adoption of skills and learning

  With the assistance of the class teachers we will set specific metrics that
  the girls will work towards - with a focus on mastery not grades.

  - Our goal is to have 90% of girls enrolled in the class advance three levels
  each year that they are in the program.

  2. Academic results and graduation rate

  We believe this class will positively affect the academic success of the girls
  enrolled. -- - Our goal is to have 90% of girls enrolled increase their
  academic results by 1 letter grade in each year they are enrolled. Further
  more we see success as 100% of our girls graduating high school and continuing
  on to further education.

  3. Sense of purpose for their education and excitement for their future

  We will be using the Hollywood Hope Index to measure girls sense of excitement
  and purpose for their future. 

  - Our goal is that 100% of girls see a bright future and wish to succeed in
  their future after 6 months attending classes.
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
  - 'Money '
  - Volunteers
