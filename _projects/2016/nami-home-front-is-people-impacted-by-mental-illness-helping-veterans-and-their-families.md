  Success will be determine by the number of people that take classes, graduate
  from classes, get trained to teach classes, and subsequently teach their own
  class.


  We would like to have 5 classes per year in each of the 5 service areas of LA
  County. With each class having at least one person go on to become a trainer
  for a total of 25 trainers within one year.

  Based on the nationally recognized NAMI Family-to-Family program, NAMI
  Homefront is designed to address the unique needs of family, caregivers and
  friends of those who have served or are currently serving our country. The
  program is taught by trained family members of service members/veterans living
  with mental health conditions.  The program will also recruit, train, & place
  trained individuals in their communities to further expand outreach and
  education efforts.

  Nearly 1 in 4 active duty members showed signs of a mental health condition,
  according to a 2014 study in JAMA Psychiatry. For many PTSD, physical trauma,
  domestic violence, substance abuse and misuse, homelessness, and suicide are
  the struggles that our arm forces members face  when they come home. We
  believe every Veteran suicide is a tragic outcome. Regardless of the numbers
  or rates, one Veteran suicide is one too many-especially for groups at
  elevated risk for suicide, including older and female Veterans. 


  NAMI Homefront teaches how to:


  Manage crises, solve problems and communicate effectively

  Learn to care for yourself, including managing your stress

  Develop the confidence and stamina to support your family member with
  compassion

  Identify and access federal, state and local services

  Stay informed on the latest research and information on mental health,
  including post traumatic stress disorder and substance abuse

  Understand current treatments, including evidence-based therapies, medications
  and side effects

  Navigate the challenges and impact of mental health conditions on the entire
  family.



  Recovery is a journey and there is hope for all people affected by mental
  illness. This in-person group experience provides the opportunity for mutual
  support and shared positive impact. People will experience compassion and
  reinforcement from people who relate to their experiences. Through their
  participation, they have the opportunity to help others grow and make LA a
  great place to LIVE!
