  Jenesse Center’s strategic plan to end domestic violence begins with the next
  generation. Jeneration J seeks to equip young people with the knowledge,
  skills, and awareness to become morally conscious leaders. Jeneration J’s
  goals are to minimize the severity of the domestic violence and intimate
  partner violence epidemics by sponsoring culturally relevant programming,
  activities, workshops and events central to education, advocacy, and service.
  Our youth leadership and education programs intend to transcend across social
  and cultural differences, to instill in younger demographics a will to act. 


  Jeneration J's signature program Jenesse University Youth Conversations is
  integral to ensuring that children, teens, and young adults are educated and
  empowered through our intervention, prevention, and outreach efforts. Jenesse
  University Youth Conversations is an intergroup dialogue that challenges
  student to share ideas, questions, and debate about domestic violence and
  intimate partner violence. Youth Conversations defy educational traditions by
  creating a safe space for students to engage in facilitated discussions
  focused on controversial issues of interest to the campus community. They are
  uniquely structured to empower student-directed learning among participants
  and effectively communicate with a diverse population.  This culturally
  relevant framework contributes the development domestic violence awareness and
  prevention that is more responsive to the needs of a young demographic.
  Jeneration J reflects an intervention and advocacy model that educates youth
  and young adults on healthy relationships and trains them to be the next
  generation of anti-violence advocates.
