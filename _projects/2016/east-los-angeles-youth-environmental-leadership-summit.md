  ITEP will present a one-day community Environmental Leadership Summit in Fall
  2017 to include student presentations, an environmental fair, keynote speaker,
  and breakout sessions. The Summit will engage students, parents, faculty and
  staff, and industry leaders in an effort to not only raise awareness of a
  variety of environmental impacts, but to showcase the Generation Z perspective
  in an effort to inspire out-of-the-box sustainability ideas.


  Industry leaders in environmental impact and mitigation-related industries
  will be engaged as guest speakers and mentors to help students as well as
  introduce students to potential careers so they can make their mark on future.
  ITEP will engage volunteers in several East Los Angeles areas including
  clean/green technology, marine life, safety and health risks,
  aesthetics/construction/engineering, and noise/water/air quality and impacts. 



  Students in East Los Angeles where ITEP is present are already keenly aware of
  negative environmental impacts in their communities. These young people can be
  found planting trees, initiating recycling efforts, and finding alternative
  means to transportation like skateboarding, bicycling, or walking. Through the
  Summit, ITEP intends to inspire the next alternative fuel engineers, wetland
  preservation activists, and environment compliance managers, leading
  sustainability efforts throughout the East Los Angeles community.


  ITEP will expand knowledge of environmental impacts among East Los Angeles
  students and spark the next generation of environmental leadership. Students
  will increase their understanding of air and water quality, environmental
  compliance, safe and sustainable transportation, and other critical
  environmental hazards and present their findings.


  Giving young people a voice now provides them the platform to become leaders
  in air and water quality, accessibility, and environmental change, creating a
  more resilient community. 


  Together, ITEP and the East Los Angeles community residents will make LA the
  best place to LIVE by supporting efforts to ensure a healthy and sustainable
  environment for all its citizens.
