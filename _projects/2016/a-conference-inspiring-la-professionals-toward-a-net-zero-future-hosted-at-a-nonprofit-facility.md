  A conference inspiring LA professionals toward a net zero future; hosted at a
  nonprofit  facility
project_summary: >-
  We will bring the nation's largest net zero building conference to IBEW Local
  11's Net Zero Plus building to connect LA building industry professionals and
  inspire them ahead of 2020/2030 code changes

  The success of the Net Zero Conference held at IBEW Local 11's Net Zero Plus
  building will be measured by attendee numbers, participants that are engaged
  and inspired to work on net zero buildings, and feedback given from IBEW Local
  11.


  Specifically, success will be measured based on the following:


  - Number of participants who attended (totals will be tallied from sign-in
  sheets at event)

  - Responses from attendees who filled out survey questions (see below)

  - People who contacted IBEW Local 11 post-event that were interested in
  training or wanted additional information

  - Newsletter outreach metrics tracking number of recipients of targeted email
  marketing blasts


  We will have physical sign-in sheets for all attendees at the event to
  calculate total number of participants. Additionally, there will be an
  easy-to-use real-time survey given to attendees during the last hour of the
  conference, with survey questions that can be answered via live texting. These
  questions will ask attendees to rank on a scale of 1-5 how much they learned
  at the event, whether it impacted their motivation to work on net zero
  projects, and other related questions.

  Verdical Group has been hosting L.A.'s annual Net Zero Conference for three
  years with the help of gratuitous venue sponsors. While this has been great,
  and has helped to garner interest, we would like to host the conference with
  IBEW Local 11, L.A.'s electrical construction union. IBEW's Net Zero Plus
  Electrical Training Institute is the perfect venue for this conference to
  inspire L.A.'s building professionals into action and prepare for California's
  net zero code changes together.

  The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and the California Energy
  Commission (CEC) launched a Zero Net Energy Action Plan that states all new
  homes must be net-zero energy by 2020 and commercial buildings by 2030.  A
  zero net energy (ZNE) building must provide on-site renewable energy sources
  equal to the amount of energy used by the building annually. In order to
  achieve the ZNE target, a building must be designed with super-insulation,
  daylighting, natural ventilation, and many other energy-efficient passive
  strategies. Only after a building first reduces energy demand should it be
  fitted with solar, wind, or even geothermal on-site energy sources to take
  care of its remaining cooling, heating, and lighting needs. California's
  future ZNE homes, and commercial buildings will produce energy savings that
  the CEC estimates will also reduce about 160,000 metric tons of carbon
  emissions per year. By reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, and increasing
  our use of renewable on-site energy sources, we will stop polluting our
  climate with dirty fuels and will create more resilient, self-sufficient
  communities that will help to reduce strain on the grid and prevent future
  blackouts.


  California's current goal for reaching their 2020 and 2030 ZNE targets is to
  educate builders and engineers and to have some of the energy efficiency
  techniques that have been in development, such as high performance windows and
  better insulation, become part of the building code in 2019. In order to
  prepare our local builders, engineers, electrical workers, and architects for
  net zero building code changes, a net zero conference held at a local union's
  training facility is most pertinentâ€“specifically IBEW Local 11's Net Zero Plus
  building, which is a 'living laboratory' dedicated to advancing energy
  efficiency technologies.


  Verdical Group has already built the nation's largest net zero building
  conference, with attendees nearly doubling each year since its inception in
  2014. If this momentum can be brought into the Net Zero Plus facility, L.A.'s
  local union dedicated to advancing high-performance energy efficiency, then
  building industry workers will be able to connect and collaborate together all
  in one location. This collaboration will inspire and jump-start the much
  needed push towards a net zero future, one in which L.A.'s communities will be
  run by clean, renewable energy.
