  The foster care system needs to change. Families need support to care for
  their children, and children need to know that they are safe and loved no
  matter where they live. The people who know what needs to change are the ones
  who know the system best. NFYI/LA will recruit and train 100 foster youth and
  50 family members to advocate with policy makers for new approaches to
  transform the child welfare system.

  Success will be measured by meeting our goals for Leadership Corps recruitment
  and engagement. In addition, success will be measured by the extent to which
  the Leadership Corps is able to contribute toward the implementation of policy
  reforms. For example, the LA County Blue Ribbon Commission on Child Protection
  recommended many areas of reform, but currently there is no sustained outside
  pressure to push for implementation of those reforms. Homelessness is a big
  issue for foster youth, and NFYI is bringing their voices to the Los Angeles
  City Council to make sure they include foster youth in their plans to address
  homelessness in LA. On the State level, several positive policies have been
  signed by Governor Brown, but have not been implemented. NFYI organizers and
  activists will organize campaigns in Los Angeles County to push for
  implementation of a variety of positive policies that are already on the
  books. Additional funds will also enable NFYI to establish a consulting
  contract to track project progress and assess overall program effectiveness.

  One of the youth in our LA Leadership Corps told us what a difference it would
  have made to her life if she had known that there were places where she could
  connect with other foster youth and organizations that were working to make
  things better for young people like her. 

  There are 30,000 foster youth in this extended “village” we call LA County,
  and thousands more relatives and foster parents who want to see these
  vulnerable children fulfill their promise. By bringing them together and
  showing them how their experiences can inspire reform, NFYI helps connect the
  voices of the foster care community with those who need to hear them.  

  We CONNECT youth, families, policy makers and the general public in a variety
  of ways:

  The LA Leadership Corps: Foster youth and alumni, ages 18 and beyond, and
  their relatives, foster families and community allies learn how to organize
  for change by doing the hands-on work of becoming recruiters, trainers and
  organizers themselves. 

  Shadow Days: Foster youth spend the day with local, State or federal officials
  to share their experiences and make policy recommendations.

  Listening Tours and Dinners for Elected Officials: Foster youth and families,
  policy experts and elected officials gather to learn about a particular issue
  together, getting a first-hand look at the problem and possible solutions.

  Other Organizations Who Share Our Goals: NFYI is part of a network of
  organizations that work together for change. By collaborating with others such
  as the Community Coalition who work with the grandparents and other relatives
  of foster youth, we can reach out to more people and avoid duplication of
  effort.

  Building relationships and identifying shared values and goals is the
  foundation of our work. By building on this foundation to create a massive
  grassroots movement for change, we can make LA County a model of how to
  transform our country’s child welfare system.
