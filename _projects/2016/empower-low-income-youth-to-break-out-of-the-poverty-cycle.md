  The Youth Business Alliance (YBA) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that
  focuses on bringing critical 21st century business skills and perspectives
  into the classroom by leveraging business partnerships and resources from the
  community. The YBA was formed in 2012, servicing one disadvantaged school. We
  are now in 16 schools serving roughly 400 disadvantaged high school students
  each year. The YBA provides a year-long school course ('Introduction to
  Business & Careers') to these students, who will receive high school course
  credit upon successful completion.  The course description/breakdown is as
  follows: 


  1. Curriculum – Our program covers both the fundamental soft and hard skills a
  young professional will need to know to succeed in their future job or
  business. Students go through four modules (soft skills, career readiness,
  financial literacy, and business 101) and learn critical elements such as
  professional communication, resume writing, business plan development, and
  even participate in experiential exercises like a stock market trading game or
  a Shark Tank style pitch workshop.


  2. Guest Speakers – Every week, each YBA class has a different guest speaker
  from the professional community come to their class and share their
  personal/professional story. This program is our version of “reverse job
  shadowing”, where students get to learn about the speakers’ life
  story/journey, their career/business, and ask questions. Our students meet
  approximately 30 professionals in a school year.


  3. Field Trips – YBA students get to observe the behind the scenes of
  successful companies, many times meeting each department, learning about
  different job roles, participating in interactive workshops, and getting a VIP
  tour. What an impact it makes for our students to get out of the classroom and
  see a thriving company up close and personal. We've had teachers who have told
  us that after these field trips, some of their students are so inspired they
  pick up their grades almost immediately. Last year our students were able to
  check out companies like Google, SpaceX, Riot, etc.


  Don’t you wish you had the YBA program when you were in high school? Would you
  credit at least part of your success today to a teacher or mentor who believed
  in you and shared some important principles with you? This is what YBA is all
  about - preparing future leaders, giving exposure, and creating opportunities
  for those with limited resources. 


  YBA caters to disadvantaged youth in underserved communities, most of whom are
  minorities, at risk, and considered low income (free/reduced lunch). Yet, the
  majority of our students are at the top of their class, with some of the best
  GPA’s, and they volunteer to stay after school to be part of the YBA. They are
  not looking for a handout, but simply a hand up to be the success story in
  their family. 


  We invite you to join us as we continue in our mission to support and inspire
  the future leaders of tomorrow!
