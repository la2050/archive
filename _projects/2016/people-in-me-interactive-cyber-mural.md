project_measure: >-
  1) Tabulate the number of visitors that view the mural.


  2) Tabulate the number of visitors who interactively participate with the
  mural.


  3) Tabulate the number of interactive participants who enter their own
  information.


  4) Exit surveys that collect visitors takeaways from their visit/interaction:
  enjoyment level; educational value; wanting to

  know more about their own family history/culture; raised awareness of downtown
  L.A.'s diversity.


  5) Improved METRO student academic performance in core subject areas connected
  to the project's learning activities.


  We look for projects that, through building students' foundational group-work
  skills and collaborative problem solving modeled by teachers, parents, other
  students and community volunteers, our students learn that there's a diversity
  of valid perspectives, build comfort around using their own voices, and
  understand the value of accepting and building on the contributions of
  others. 


  Within that group structure is delivered personalized learning that allow our
  students to figure out how they learn best. They also get to see how their
  peers learn best, showing them that there are many ways to problem solve and
  reach the same solution.

  PEOPLE IN ME is a student-created, interactive, cyber-video mural that maps
  the cultural diversity of community living and/or working in downtown L.A.,
  representing 180 countries. A team of students working alongside parents,
  artists and school partners will interview locals about their culture, arts,
  cuisine, childhood, beliefs and how they arrived here. Students/viewers will
  put themselves on the map by inputting data about themselves to determine how
  their family is connected.

  PEOPLE IN ME is aligned with METRO's emphasis on providing innovative
  opportunities for Place-Based Education (PBE): learning through rigorous, real
  world learning projects that help our students understand and appreciate
  diversity; make global connections; and become involved in, and a contributing
  member of, the downtown Los Angeles community.


  While other schools use downtown places for field trip destinations, METRO's
  belief is that the real value of those sites, and all of downtown, is the
  unmatched diverse experiences, backgrounds, beliefs, knowledge, creativity and
  cultural norms of the people who live in, work at, and breathe life into our
  downtown destinations.


  We look for projects that, through building students' foundational group-work
  skills and collaborative problem solving modeled by teachers, parents, other
  students and community volunteers, our students learn that there's a diversity
  of valid perspectives, build comfort around using their own voices, and

  others. 


  Within that group structure is delivered personalized learning that allow our
  students to figure out how they learn best. They also get to see how their
  peers learn best, showing them that there are many ways to problem solve and
  reach the same solution.


  Beyond the classroom PEOPLE IN ME is a community showcase project that
  cultivates civic pride and educates students and residents about the positive
  traits and commonalities of our diverse downtown populations.


  Another purpose of 'PEOPLE IN ME' is to initiate, build and strengthen
  intergenerational relationships that connect, capitalize on, embrace, and
  showcase, the cultural diversity of elderly community members who represent
  180 countries and 140 languages; utilizing the vast experiences, backgrounds,
  cultures, beliefs of the wiser generation as a Common Core learning tool for
  our new generation of learners.


  Seniors will benefit from: meaningful experiences with children and educators;
  learning new technologies; and, passing down of cultural traditions.  


  Students will benefit from: mentors, communication and problem-solving skills,
  positive attitudes about aging, and community service.
