  CARPE LA: collaborative augmented reality play experience for families of Los
  Angeles
project_summary: >-
  CARPE LA blends digital and physical play as teams work together to discover,
  collect and unlock the secrets of a fantasy world overlaid on their local
  neighborhood park.

  We will measure success of the project based on: 1) participation rates at
  events and 2) quality of play experiences reported by participants. We will
  collect the following data to determine success: 

  Attendance information

  Number of attendees and teams

  Configuration of teams (i.e. children, parents, grandparents, other community
  members) 

  Participant demographics

  Zip code (to determine if they are residents of the neighborhood)

  Age

  Sex

  Ethnicity

  Income level

  Education level

  Park usage (how often do they visit their park, what activities do they do)

  Technology access / usage


  We will consider the pilot of CARPE LA a success if we bring together at least
  10 intergenerational teams of 5 to 8 players to play at each of the four
  Saturday events. This relatively small number of participants is appropriate
  for a pilot program. From the experiences of these players, we will discover
  necessary adjustments and collect important information to guide us in scaling
  the game beyond the pilot sites to include additional parks, larger numbers of
  teams, and new content. 
   
  As a research lab, we are prepared to collect both quantitative and
  qualitative data on the experience. In addition to the attendance and
  demographics, researchers will observe the gameplay and conduct brief verbal
  surveys with participants to collect data on their experiences. Through the
  research, we will be able to learn more about intergenerational play and how
  to design and facilitate community-based experiences.

project_description: >-
  CARPE LA is mobile experience designed to get teams of kids and adults outside
  to play a story-driven, location-based game in parks throughout LA. Through a
  series of summer events at which CARPE LA will be played, teams will
  collaborate to unlock the open spaces in their neighborhoods.

  Research shows that intergenerational play supports language development,
  critical thinking, and emotional connections among families and communities.
  However, opportunities for people to come together for intergenerational
  play—experiences that are equally playful no matter your age—are often
  difficult to find and access. 


  CARPE LA: Collaborative Augmented Reality Play Experience for Families in LA’s
  parks has two key features that will make LA the best place to play. First, it
  will bring an exciting new intergenerational play experience to parks around
  LA, which will offer the added benefit of bringing communities together.
  Second, CARPE LA blends digital and physical play through augmented reality
  technology similar to what powered this summer’s hit game Pokemon Go! 
   
  CARPE LA will increase access to open space and park activities through
  gameplay events designed for participants of all ages and abilities. As a team
  game, play is enhanced by including players with differing abilities and
  ideas. And, although the game has a technological component, it is not
  necessary for all team members to have a mobile device to participate.
   
  The pilot will improve the number and quality of informal spaces for play in
  participating neighborhoods in two ways: 1) the events - held on what we’ll
  call Summer Saturdays - will provide a guided model for intergenerational play
  offered through a story that encourages families to slow down and discover
  together. Our team members are experts in both design and instruction related
  to intergenerational play. As families and communities participate, they will
  learn skills for designing their own intergenerational play experiences in the
  park. 2) We will install beacon technology within the park to facilitate the
  digital aspects of the game and offer ways for the families to use their
  mobile devices to collect, share and unlock more opportunities within the park
  and beyond. The hardware does not have to be permanently installed allowing us
  to expand the game beyond the initial pilot sites. 
   
  The key metric we expect to impact is the number of parks with
  intergenerational play experiences. We see that technology has, in some ways,
  decreased the opportunities for true intergenerational play in parks—play in
  which the adults are as engaged as the children—due to the fact that adults
  can be always connected to work or home, even when outside playing. CARPE LA
  uses that same mobile technology to create a compelling, immersive play
  experience that blends digital technology with the types of physical and
  reflective play that parks encourage: running, jumping, climbing, all the way
  to observing, imagining and discovering. It is the best of both worlds,
  brought together through a compelling story and social connections.
