  IGNITE22: A tech expo and collaborative experience celebrating innovations
  shaping the 22nd century
project_summary: >-
  IGNITE22 is a technology showcase and collaborative experience that will bring
  together creators, adopters and facilitators – visionaries that will shape the
  next century.

  Through a collaboration with California State University Program for Education
  and Research in Biotechnology (CSUPERB), IGNITE22 will support CSUPERB's
  strategy to expand experiential biotechnology learning opportunities, innovate
  biotechnology education and partner with industry. By engaging area high
  school students involved in ITEP (International Trade Education Programs),
  IGNITE22 will inspire the next generation of STEM leaders.
project_measure: >-
  IGNITE22 aims to bring together a diverse group of entrepreneurs, investors
  and industry leaders to foster the commercialization of transformative
  technologies. By engaging creators, adopters and facilitators, we are
  connecting all parts of the ecosystem critical to bringing new technology to
  market. Our goal is to initiate meaningful partnerships between academic
  institutions, technology startups and corporate partners that will lead to
  accelerated commercialization of technology and employment opportunities for
  the region’s graduates.


  We will measure success based on the following:

  - Number of tech startups exhibiting by industry

  - Number of CSUPERB researchers presenting

  - Number of corporate/industry influencers and investors attending


  Through pre- and post-event surveys, we will measure the following:

  - % of attendees interested in participating in collaborative opportunities

  - % of students who express an interest in pursuing STEM-related careers or
  entrepreneurial endeavors


  While one event alone cannot impact the CREATE metrics such as federal
  research grant funding or high-growth startups, we believe that offering a
  platform for collaboration across the entrepreneurial ecosystem will, over the
  long-term, result in more manufacturing activity, more STEM-related job
  opportunities, more patents per capita, increased venture capital investment,
  and an increase of minority- and women-owned tech startups reflecting the
  diversity of Southern California’s residents.

  IGNITE22 is a catalyst for collaboration. We chose an event over a program to
  generate the broadest reach of stakeholders across industries and across a
  wide variety of audience groups. The interaction between these stakeholders
  will make LA the best place to CREATE.
   
  Entrepreneurs will benefit from the connections with industry collaborators
  and investors, as well as access to academic researchers and deep science.
  Investors benefit from making connections with a vast array of tech
  entrepreneurs. Corporate executives and industry leaders get an opportunity to
  experience new technology that may impact their businesses while they explore
  how early adoption will lead to competitive advantage. University students and
  faculty will connect with industry to move projects beyond the lab toward the
  goal of commercialization. The event will engage high school students
  interested in STEM careers inspiring them to become tech entrepreneurs.
  Elected officials and policymakers will learn about technology trends and
  therefore, better understand impacts and opportunities within their
  communities.


  Collectively, IGNITE22 is the spark that will attract visionaries that will
  help make LA be the best place to CREATE. As a result of connections being
  made and collaborations being formed, IGNITE22 will positively impact the
  metrics we’ve identified. We believe these partnerships will result in more
  patents per capita, increased venture capital investment and increased federal
  research grant funding. Through strategic partnerships, startups have a better
  chance of gaining market traction and realizing exponential growth. This
  results in more and better jobs, increased manufacturing in the region and an
  improved Gini coefficient. By engaging high school and college students from
  the LA Harbor area we will inspire the next generation of entrepreneurs and
  STEM leaders, offering role models that will lead to more minority and
  women-owned businesses. These students are then more likely to attend and then
  graduate from local higher education institutions and more likely to remain in
  the region due to the improved career opportunities.


  In the long-term IGNITE22 will support LA County’s goals to build technology
  hubs, particularly in biotech, aerospace, trade and transportation, and clean
  tech, thereby contributing to LA’s creative and entrepreneurial ecosystem with
  global economic influence.
