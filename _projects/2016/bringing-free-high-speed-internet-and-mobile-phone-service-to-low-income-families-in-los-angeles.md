  Bringing free high-speed internet and mobile phone service to low-income
  families in Los Angeles
project_summary: >-
  We help low-income families get high-speed internet and phone service by
  connecting them to providers who subsidize costs and retailers who pay
  remaining costs via cash-back rebates on everyday items.

  Our primary long-term goal is to increase the percentage of low-income
  households in LA who have mobile phone service and high-speed internet at
  home. In doing so, we aim to improve access to jobs, education, healthcare,
  political activity, and social interaction for low-income families in LA.


  We will measure the success of our platform by the following metrics:

  - the number of internet providers and retailers who partner with us

  - the number of families who receive internet and or phone service on our
  platform

  - our overall area of coverage across LA county (and eventually across CA and
  the U.S.)


  By surveying users on our platform, we will also measure our success by:

  - the number of individuals on our platform who start taking online courses or
  seeking higher education

  - the number of individuals on our platform who apply for jobs online

  - the number of families on our platform who start receiving affordable
  healthcare (e.g. by registering with CoveredCA)

  - the number of individuals on our platform who register online to vote

  - the number of individuals on our platform who join or increase activity on
  social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat)

  Over 650,000 households in LA earning less than $50K/year do not have internet
  at home (based on 2013 estimates). Drizzle will build an online platform to
  deliver free internet and phone service to these lower-income families.
  Qualifying families use our platform to get phone and internet service from
  local providers who subsidize prices (e.g. COX, AT&T, Sprint). Remaining costs
  are paid by retailers on our platform who give cash-back rewards on families'
  everyday purchases (gas, food, clothes).

  Drizzle will make LA the best place to connect by bringing high-speed internet
  (at least 5Mbps download) and phone service to all Angelenos.


  Internet connection and cell phone service have become essential to staying
  involved in one's community and the world. Internet access is now necessary to
  research and complete school assignments, apply to jobs, access affordable
  healthcare and other social services, and participate in politics and social
  media. Cell phone service is important to stay connected with friends and
  family no matter where you go.


  Unfortunately, low-income families do not have equal connection as wealthier
  families. A survey in 2013 by digitalequality.net estimated that while over
  92% of families in LA County earning $100,000 or more per year had internet
  connection at home, only 43% of families earning less than $25,00 per year had
  connection. The survey estimated that over 650,000 households earning less
  than $50,000 per year in LA County lacked internet connection. Furthermore,
  low-income families with internet access typically have poorer service and
  frequently lose connection due to inability to pay.


  Drizzle will help close this digital divide by providing a way for low-income
  families in LA to receive free, high-speed internet and cell phone service.


  This will have a significant impact on education and job opportunities for
  low-income families in LA. Students will be able to research, complete
  assignments, and take classes online from home. Adults will be able to search
  more job opportunities, apply online, or even work from home. In addition,
  families will have greater access to affordable healthcare and social services
  by using online resources. Giving more people the opportunity to learn and
  thrive will diversify and increase talent in LA.


  Drizzle will also engage more people in the greater Los Angeles community.
  With greater internet access, lower-income individuals will be able to
  interact more on social media and discover events and opportunities in LA.
  They will also be able to register to vote online and better voice their
  political opinions. These effects will increase the number of social
  connections between Angelenos and bring a wider variety of experiences and
  viewpoints to LA culture.


  By making internet and phone service more accessible to low-income Angelenos,
  we will develop a more inclusive community and make LA the best place to
  connect both online and in person.
