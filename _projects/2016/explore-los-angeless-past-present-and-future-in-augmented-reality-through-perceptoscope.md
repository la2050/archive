title: >-
  Explore Los Angeles's past, present, and future in augmented reality through
  Perceptoscope
project_summary: >-
  Perceptoscopes are public augmented reality viewers in the form of coin
  operated binoculars. They can expose the hidden past, present points of
  interest, or future potentials of a place.

  Though not an explicit collaborator, I'm part of the upcoming class of Arts
  For LA's Cultural Policy Fellows in their 2016-2017 ACTIVATE program., , We're
  also are in talks with many other organizations and cultural institutions
  around the city that we'll be announcing as the project scales and things
  become more official.
project_measure: >-
  Success for the project is measured more in trajectories than the achievement
  of fixed goals. Our hybrid nature gives us a unique set of tools to help us
  improve and learn.


  As a hardware technology project, we're always looking to better our
  technology to make it more engaging and intuitive to use.  We typically look
  towards design thinking practices as a means to this end, such as cycles of
  prototyping and playtesting. 


  As a creative placemaking project, we hope to use techniques like pedestrian
  counts and foot traffic studies to measure our impact on a location in hard
  data. By understanding how a Perceptoscope is placed in a space, we can not
  only optimize how people come to discover it but also take advantage of the
  way it might draw people to an otherwise empty spot.


  As a media project, we measure our impact in impressions. How many people were
  we able to impact in an given amount of time deployed at that location?. How
  effectively did we convey the story we were trying to tell? Did we represent
  the perspectives of that space broadly?


  Our ultimate goal for the project is to achieve sustainability and feed back
  revenue generated from the project into more units and deployments. The idea
  is to create a feedback loop between communities and the project that deepens
  our roots and broadens our footprint.

project_description: >-
  Perceptoscope, an interactive public arts initiative, will temporarily deploy
  augmented reality pedestal viewers at strategic locations around the city
  taking into account the context, communities and histories of the spaces in
  which they're dropped. We will work with local organizations towards permanent
  deployments, and along the way document our process of design and public
  deployment through online video.

  ["Access to open space and park facilities","Number (and quality) of informal
  spaces for play","Number of parks with intergenerational play
  opportunities","Number of residents with easy access to a “vibrant” park"]

  Perceptoscope is about encouraging the act of discovery around a place. The
  shape of our viewers in particular has an immense magnetism for children and
  the curious. By adding this new surprise to something familiar, people will
  walk away from a place changed and encouraged to explore somewhere new. 


  The interactive content on the viewers themselves opens up a variety of
  exciting opportunities to explore how to make places engaging and fun. It's
  easy to imagine digital scavenger hunts, interactive informational
  visualizations, and being transported to a different point in time at the
  location you're standing. 


  We're just starting to explore the array of interactions possible with
  Perceptoscopes, and our open source platform is designed so that the digital
  creative culture already present in this city can create content quickly and
  easily. 


  Playtesting has played a prominent role in the development of the project.
  Observing the behavior of users at our various deployments has led to the
  development of new features we never would have expected. We noticed kids
  often assumed Perceptoscopes had the potential to also act as cameras, so
  we've been developing photography features like the ability to take 360 degree
  panoramic photos, or act as a 3D photo booth.


  The fact that we're an open platform means collaborators will always be
  pushing the project in new and exciting ways. Having them deployed broadly
  across Los Angeles will give the omnipresent arts and humanities culture here
  a new voice that's separate from the traditional media we're known for. 


  We hope that deployments can be long lasting, and that each deployment's
  experiences will be dynamic and novel to encourage the revisitation of a space
  for years to come.
