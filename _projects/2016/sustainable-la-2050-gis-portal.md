  The Now Institute will be the sole beneficiary of the grant. However, it
  benefits from a network of collaborators and institutional connections
  including:, , ESRI - World’s largest GIS (geographic information systems)
  mapping software, , UCLA Grand Challenge - Including associated faculty,
  researchers, students, partner institutions, , Morphosis Architects - The Now
  Institute is led by Pritzker Prize winner Thom Mayne and Director Eui-Sung Yi
  of Morphosis
project_areas:
  - County of Los Angeles
project_measure: >-
  The success of the project is dependant on creating an intuitive, interactive
  tool that allows for a shared understanding and discovery of what LA could
  look like in 2050. It should be used by multiple organizations, researchers,
  journalists, and policymakers to understand and map out solutions for a
  sustainable LA.

project_description: >-
  Founded on comprehensive UCLA research on LA County’s patterns in energy,
  water, and ecosystem health, our proposal creates an online portal that
  geospatially collects, connects, and conveys planning scenarios, working
  toward a fully built-out implementation strategy for a sustainable LA by 2050.
  This planning tool will 1) collect isolated data from its disparate sources,
  2) connect data into comprehensive, dynamic visual scenarios, and 3) convey
  the impact of various planning solutions.

  within a half-mile of transit)","Voting rates"]

  LEARN: Los Angeles already has some of the world’s most talented researchers
  working on solutions for climate change, rapid urbanization, and social
  inequality. Yet these solutions are frequently conceived of in isolation—there
  is often little dialogue between various disciplines, policy makers and the
  public at-large. This inability to know how to handle the vast amount of data
  severely limits articulating well-informed strategies that will affect
  comprehensive, holistic change. 


  CONNECT: An intelligent direction for LA can only come from harnessing the
  distributed knowledge network of LA’s multiple public utilities, government
  agencies, research institutions, civic organizations, and citizens.


  Our proposal’s main goal is to provide this connection. Our web portal will
  serve not simply as a one-sided communication tool, but as a hub for all the
  multiple inputs and outputs that shape LA. 


  We’ve begun to make progress on connecting data patterns to neighborhoods,
  building typologies, and planning proposals. Our goal for this portal is to
  make an interactive hub where researchers will want to add their data because
  it helps them visualize their data. Civic organizations and nonprofits can
  collect information that will help them better advance and champion their own
  goals.


  LIVE: The complex relationships between disparate datasets and their
  stakeholders can be difficult to understand. Our portal will make these
  relationships clear and visible. Information that’s not readily accessible to
  the public will be made transparent and easy to use.  By helping citizens to
  understand their everyday choices within a larger context, we can measure the
  collective impact of many people acting independently toward a sustainable
  future (e.g. converting a lawn to xeriscaping, installing rooftop solar
  panels, or riding public transit).


  Communities and nonprofits can now visualize, plan, and understand the impacts
  of neighborhood-scale collaborative efforts (e.g. a new park, a streetside
  bioswale, or renewable energy storage).


  Planners, politicians, and researchers can identify and develop real-world
  solutions that are readily implementable and effective on a large-scale. This
  means comparing different strategies and measuring their viability based on
  their infrastructure costs, environmental impact, and lifestyle changes.


  For example, this portal could easily identify existing housing and job
  opportunities within a ½ mile-radius access of current transit nodes, and can
  help citizens and planners map out the best locations for future development.
  This is the kind of service the community can expect us to provide through
  this project.


  The initial pilot project for this proposal (shown in part in the demo video)
  has already been developed and will be presented on October 19th, 2016 as part
  of the EARTH NOW: EARTH 2050 UCLA Luskin Symposium - http://arcg.is/2d7rm5K
