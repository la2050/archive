  Work will be evaluated on a number of levels. These include:


  Participation


  Attendees / artists, performers, vendors, etc.


  Support: Number of behind the scenes individuals (external to RFP) working to
  produce Da FUNction such as city officials working with us (vs for us) in-kind
  donations, volunteers, etc. 


  Notoriety


  Press coverage, engagement metrics on social media channels (i.e. shares,
  views, posts). 


  Ultimately, we would like to export Da FUNction to other places outside of
  South LA. Therefore the trajectory of the program is to scale it up in order
  to scale it out. As such, evaluating the success of Da FUNction in the long
  term will deal with building notoriety at the national level in order to build
  a demand for Da FUNction (i.e. make people want to bring Da FUNction to their
  neighborhood).

  Da FUNction at Vermont Square is an interactive event where attendees are
  completely immersed in art and community from the moment they arrive. Whether
  they are getting their hands dirty in the garden; learning and practicing
  yoga; chilling out in a hammock forest; or spinning a pottery wheel  for the
  first time, attendees get to see, be and create art with some of LA’s most
  well known artists. Da FUNction employs cultural expression and cultural
  sharing as tools for placemaking, creating a space where the diverse flavors
  of Los Angeles integrate, coming together to create together. Da FUNction
  shows people how to see their city differently - how to see the value in
  undervalued and neglected communities, how to reclaim the commons and in so
  doing, it shows them how to care for the commons and care for each other.
  Using gardening as our tool of choice, Da FUNction flips the script on color,
  class and the barriers that segregate Los Angeles residents both physically
  and mentally. 


  Da FUNction program was born from Ron Finley’s future HQ project, which
  intends to transform the grounds of an unused and undervalued public space
  into a garden/community/cultural center designed to grow food, people and
  rebuild the surrounding inner-city ecosystem. Da FUNction is the popup version
  of HQ, offering attendees a number of interactive activities designed to
  immerse the public in a public space built from art, love and community.


  Trading your Apple phone for an apple tree is an excellent way to fight stress
  and attention fatigue that is due to an overdose of electronic technology and
  disconnect from nature. The sights, smells, and sounds of being outside and in
  a garden promote relaxation and reduce stress. In addition to creating more
  green spaces, which are proven to have a positive impact on tackling air
  pollution, Da FUNction can also deliver a wide range of social, economic and
  environmental benefits to make cities more attractive and healthier places to
  be.
