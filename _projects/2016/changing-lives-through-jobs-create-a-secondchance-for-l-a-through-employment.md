  A steady job is a key step to a person’s transition out of poverty and onto a
  pathway to self-sufficiency. For this project, we define success as helping
  our formerly incarcerated clients succeed by becoming ready for a job, getting
  a job and retaining their job for at least 6 months. A 2010 Mathematica Policy
  Research study showed that an adult with barriers to employment who can stay
  employed or in a program for 6 months will have improved employment and social
  outcomes. 


  We will measure our success by collecting impact data about our programs and
  clients, including the number of clients 1) completing our program, 2)
  obtaining outside jobs or transitional jobs through CE, 3) retaining
  employment for 1, 3, 6 and 12 months, and 4) wages earned. Data is collected
  from a variety of sources, including reports generated through our
  sophisticated, organization-wide data-base, case management notes and CE
  timecards. We create a monthly dashboard, which tracks information about the
  services each client has accessed and the time it takes for clients to
  complete our program and find a job. This data is compared against the same
  data recorded in the previous year.  Management uses this data to spot any
  trends, and determine and address any issues that might impair our ability to
  achieve our goals. We will continue to work closely with all of our partners
  in the reentry community to track unemployment among formerly incarcerated
  people, as reducing that is our ultimate goal.

project_description: >-
  Chrysalis is the leading organization in L.A. focused on helping formerly
  incarcerated individuals attain self-sufficiency through work.  Each year,
  through classes, supportive services, and our social enterprise “Chrysalis
  Enterprises” (CE), we provide comprehensive job readiness training and
  employment for over 600 participants in transitional jobs. We offer these
  motivated individuals, 73% of whom have a criminal background, a second chance
  in life when they need it most.

  Over 60% of formerly incarcerated individuals are unemployed one year after
  release. Through this project, Chrysalis will help CREATE opportunities for
  formerly incarcerated people to reenter society, find work and get on the path
  to self-sufficiency. Our approach to reentry is jobs.  We are recognized
  leaders in the reentry community for the work that we do to create jobs, to
  connect people to employment, and to assist formerly incarcerated people to
  increase their incomes.  

  Chrysalis offers job-readiness services, through supportive social programs
  and paid, transitional employment, that strengthen our clients’ employability
  and help them secure and retain work. All clients attend classes providing
  information to empower them to conduct their job search, and learn about
  things like where to look for a job, how to create a resume, interview, and
  address felony convictions in the job search. Clients can access supplemental
  supports such as interview clothes, transportation assistance, food, phones
  and voicemail, fax, and a mailing address.  Scholarships help clients access
  training, certification and tools that will aid them in their job search. When
  necessary, we provide clients with on-site, short-term mental health support
  and legal assistance, free of charge. 


  But clients who have criminal histories and past incarceration face enormous
  challenges finding and maintaining employment due to a lack of job search
  experience, education, vocational skills, and/or work history, as well as
  employers’ reluctance to hire those who have been involved in the justice
  system. For these people, as well as others with major barriers to employment,
  Chrysalis offers paid, transitional jobs with our in-house CE businesses to
  get them started on the road to permanent, outside jobs. 73% percent of CE
  workers have a criminal history, and 59% have prior felony convictions.
  Transitional jobs deliver marketable experience and occupational skills while
  providing a supervised, supportive work setting that allows clients to prove
  themselves as reliable, capable workers.  CE workers earn wages and pay taxes,
  reducing their recidivism rates and dependence on government assistance.  They
  receive on-the-job training, particularly to increase soft skills, from
  supervisors with lived experience in homelessness and incarceration. And they
  are paired with an Employment Specialist, to support their job search
  throughout their transitional employment, helping to move them successfully
  into mainstream employment.


  Our project also makes L.A. a better place to LIVE. We know that the benefits
  of getting and keeping a job are about more than just income and survival; a
  job is a catalyst for setting people on the path to self-sufficiency. 
  Employment improves housing stability, increases self-esteem and sense of
  dignity, and creates better physical and mental health, while also setting in
  motion changes that have positive ripple effects on families, communities, and
  society.
