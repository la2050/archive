  successful reentry programs and businesses, including a brochure for potential
  participants and an in-depth handbook detailing Homeboy’s strategies; 

  * Host 15 technical assistance site visits at Homeboy headquarters in L.A.;

project_description: >-
  The Global Homeboy Network is an extension of Father Greg Boyle’s pioneering
  work with East L.A. gang members. Rooted in the belief that there is no
  “them,” only “us,” the Homeboy model combines therapeutic services and job
  training in an environment of unconditional acceptance. The Global Homeboy
  network helps other organizations tailor the model to fit their own
  communities, and collectively advocate on behalf of those who have been denied
  a voice.

  Since our agency began in 1988, hundreds of organizations have visited Homeboy
  Industries, seeking ways to end gang violence and poverty in their own
  communities. Many people have implored Homeboy founder Fr. Greg Boyle to
  “start a Homeboy Industries in our city”; his gentle response is that Homeboy
  cannot and should not be the “McDonald’s of gang rehabilitation, with billions
  of gang members served.” We believe that Homeboy’s programs work precisely
  because they were developed in and by the community they serve. Approximately
  a quarter of our senior staff is comprised of program graduates, giving
  Homeboy unprecedented cultural competence and many opportunities for formal
  and informal peer mentoring. Skills training and mentoring are proven
  effective reentry models. 


  In 2014 we launched the Global Homeboy Network, a coalition of organizations
  dedicated to serving marginalized populations. Our annual Global Homeboy
  Network Gathering in Los Angeles is an unconventional anti-conference that
  includes stories, workshops, and activities related to the Homeboy model. Our
  goal is to provide a starting map and a strategic set of tools for communities
  around the world, including many in Los Angeles. As a network, we can
  collectively advocate for change, test and improve services for marginalized
  populations, work together on public policy, and invest in making changes to
  the criminal justice system.
