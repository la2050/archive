Are any other organizations collaborating on this proposal?: ''
Please describe your project proposal.: >-
  The Global Homeboy Network is an extension of Father Greg Boyle’s pioneering
  work with East L.A. gang members. Rooted in the belief that there is no
  “them,” only “us,” the Homeboy model combines therapeutic services and job
  training in an environment of unconditional acceptance. The Global Homeboy
  network helps other organizations tailor the model to fit their own
  communities, and collectively advocate on behalf of those who have been denied
  a voice.
Which metrics will your proposal impact?​:
  - Social & emotional support
  - Cultural events
  - Total number of local social media friends and connections Angelenos have
In what areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles
  - Our project has worldwide impact.
Describe in greater detail how your proposal will make LA the best place.: >-
  Since our agency began in 1988, hundreds of organizations have visited Homeboy
  Industries, seeking ways to end gang violence and poverty in their own
  communities. Many people have implored Homeboy founder Fr. Greg Boyle to
  “start a Homeboy Industries in our city”; his gentle response is that Homeboy
  cannot and should not be the “McDonald’s of gang rehabilitation, with billions
  of gang members served.” We believe that Homeboy’s programs work precisely
  because they were developed in and by the community they serve. Approximately
  a quarter of our senior staff is comprised of program graduates, giving
  Homeboy unprecedented cultural competence and many opportunities for formal
  and informal peer mentoring. Skills training and mentoring are proven
  effective reentry models. 


  In 2014 we launched the Global Homeboy Network, a coalition of organizations
  dedicated to serving marginalized populations. Our annual Global Homeboy
  Network Gathering in Los Angeles is an unconventional anti-conference that
  includes stories, workshops, and activities related to the Homeboy model. Our
  goal is to provide a starting map and a strategic set of tools for communities
  around the world, including many in Los Angeles. As a network, we can
  collectively advocate for change, test and improve services for marginalized
  populations, work together on public policy, and invest in making changes to
  the criminal justice system.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.​: >-
  We will consider the Global Homeboy Network a success if we:

  * Convene at least 200 individuals from Los Angeles and around the world at
  the 2017 Global Homeboy Network Gathering; 

  * Create materials and web content that will help member organizations develop
  successful reentry programs and businesses, including a brochure for potential
  participants and an in-depth handbook detailing Homeboy’s strategies; 

  * Host 15 technical assistance site visits at Homeboy headquarters in L.A.;

  * Learn about how other communities are helping marginalized populations, and
  evolve our own approach accordingly.
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
  - 'Money '
  - Volunteers
  - Publicity/awareness
