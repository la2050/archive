  Measuring outcomes is critical to having a real and lasting impact on girls.
  By measuring outcomes for our Strong, Smart, and Bold goals we will see the
  changes in each area.

  On our Survey, we measure seven elements of STRONG with research-based,
  reliable indicators found on two prominent youth surveys, the CDC’s Youth Risk
  Behavior Survey and the CDC’s National Survey of Family Growth. 

  Diet in the past week

  Exercise in the past week

  Substance use

  Sexual activity (teen only)

  Depression in the past week

  Body image

  The outcome area SMART maps to the Academic Enrichment and Support Core
  Essential Service, whose goal is to expand on and support girls' school-based
  learning and engagement to help them connect academics to life experiences, to
  innovative life decisions and opportunities, and to careers.

  School engagement

  English and math grades in the past year

  Skipping school in the past month (teen only)

  School disciplinary actions (suspensions, expulsions) in the past year (teen
  only)

  Educational aspirations

  STEM and college gateway classes taken (teen only)

  College-preparatory tests taken (teen only)

  The BOLD outcome area maps to the Life Skills Core Essential Service, whose
  goal is to build girls' learning, skills and behaviors that enable them to
  function independently and live a productive and fulfilling life.

  Anger control

  Stands up for fairness and beliefs

  Self-regulation

  Ability to bounce back 

  Bullying as a victim and as a perpetrator (at school, at

  Our collaboration between Girls Inc. LA, the Columbia Memorial Space Center,
  DIY Girls, and the Housing Corporation of America will establish a network of
  Girls in STEM Clubs in under-resourced locations to provide mentor
  opportunities, skills and tools to be successful in school and life through
  programs where they live. Each Club will be based in the girls’ own
  communities, giving them a sense of belonging and pride. With women making up
  29% of the STEM workforce, the program will set a founda

  Our collaborative approach capitalizes on the resources of established
  girl-centered organizations and STEM-focused organizations to deliver
  innovative, holistic learning experiences to under-resourced girls in their
  own neighborhoods - where they live. To access the girls, the program enlists
  the partnership of a leading, regional low-income housing provider. The heart
  of the proposed program establishes Girls in STEM Clubs in these locations,
  which will become platforms to deliver programming that provides rich STEM
  experiences combined with mentorship opportunities, support, life-skills and
  empowerment for the girls. The Clubs, which will span many diverse areas of
  Los Angeles County, will create a regional network of girl-focused learning
  opportunities, outside of school, able to leverage the resources of each
  partner organization.


  The complexities of today’s world require all people to be equipped with a new
  set of core knowledge and skills to solve difficult problems, gather and
  evaluate evidence, and make sense of information they receive from varied
  print and, increasingly, digital media. The learning and doing of STEM helps
  develop these skills and prepare students for a workforce where success
  results not just from what one knows, but what one is able to do with that
  knowledge. Thus, a strong STEM education is becoming increasingly recognized
  as a key driver of opportunity, and data show the need for STEM knowledge and
  skills will grow and continue into the future. Those graduates who have
  practical and relevant STEM precepts embedded into their educational
  experiences will be in high demand in all job sectors.
