  Success in broad terms means empowering the city of LA to evolve from using a
  subjective index of using letter grades to measure street maintenance to using
  more robust data and a literal ground truth through imagery for efficient and
  equitable response.


  Establishing a protocol for longitudinal data collection could also unlock a
  new paradigm of preventive street maintenance in the future


  More concretely though, success can be first measured at the data collection
  phase in achieving near complete street-image coverage of LA's entire street
  grid. Beyond this, the prioritization of street maintenance using SQUID data
  could lead to significant cost-savings, over time and can be measured.


  Taken to its logical conclusion, another vector of success is aiming to
  integrate various operational silos around street-level imagery and mobile
  data collection i.e. cleanliness assessments, asset management, pavement
  maintenance and even air quality (* if SQUID is fitted with an air quality
  sensor). We are careful though not to over-promise and under-deliver.

project_description: >-
  SQUID is a low-cost device that uses open hardware to collect images and ride
  quality data across the entire city street grid to enable and empower the city
  or county of LA to offer efficient and equitable response around street
  maintenance.


  SQUID combines the thoughtful deployment of  low-cost sensors and  inexpensive
  cloud data storage and computation to empower street level bureaucrats to
  augment existing street response tactics towards equitable and efficient
  outcomes.

  It is said that street maintenance is the most visible indicator of local
  government performance. LA's street network contains over 6,500 center lane
  miles of streets which makes maintenance a daunting task. LA has already begun
  using digital methods to survey the city for trash and prioritize cleanup
  efforts. SQUID is a logical conclusion of this approach by integrating
  low-cost sensors , the cloud  and computer vision to empower the LA city and
  county to be more proactive and enter an anticipatory paradigm for street
  maintenance. 


  The results, if adopted at scale and over a period of time, we believe will
  bring about significant efficiencies through better allocation of resources
  and more importantly an equitable response to street maintenance which is
  unprecedented.


  The basic concept is to collect a 'complete' data about all, not just a few
  streets. SQUID does this by leveraging low-cost sensors and cloud technology
  to allow an inexpensive method to collect large data. 


  A typical lifecycle of using the SQUID device to collect data and improve
  decision making around LA's street maintenance involves mounting the SQUID to
  city vehicles and passively collecting data about street quality.


  Data is collected by automatically taking a picture of the street every second
  and combining it with a ride quality score. A fleet of 10 vehicles driving 6
  hours a day could theoretically cover LA's entire street grid in about a week.
  We have already prototyped this approach with New York City and Syracuse.


  Once the data is collected, it is cleaned using LA's street grid GIS file and
  uploaded to a user interface, we call SQUID annotator. The purpose of the
  annotator is to allow qualified street inspectors to 'virtually' inspect every
  street in Los Angeles using the image data. Individual street defects like
  cracking, hummocks, potholes or poor lane markings can be annotated on the
  interface. 


  Once all streets images are adequately annotated, a robust response model can
  be developed quickly to determine where street maintenance resources need to
  be deployed.


  We are also testing automated methods of defect detection using computer
  vision


  The most impactful part of this approach is when data collection is done
  repeatedly. Longitudinal  data for ALL of LA's streets unlocks an anticipatory
  response paradigm. Assuming LA commits to perform at least 4 surveys in a year
  - the resulting data would be unprecedented in terms of fidelity and scale.
  The degradation rates of individual streets could be 'seen' through the data
  prompting a more proactive response. Repaving decisions could involve using
  higher grade materials for some highly trafficked streets. The complete nature
  of this dataset could also be used as a powerful proxy for other city
  phenomena such as traffic indicators.


  While focussing on street quality, SQUID can be repurposed to inspect other
  facets of the urban environment and integrate several operational silos around
  street imagery.
