  This project aims to 1) Develop and pilot a citizen journalism curriculum that
  is replicable and 2) Increase student knowledge, technical skills, and
  confidence in communicating using a variety of mediums. We will measure
  success based on the following: 


  Percent of students who gain a thorough understanding of all the steps
  involved in producing a podcast 

  Percent of students who report increased skill and confidence using
  technology 

  Percent of students who improve their writing skills 

  Percent of students who report a deeper understanding of how different
  organizations are working to improve the lives of Angelenos and the importance
  of civic responsibility

  Percent of students who report a deeper understanding of how to find resources
  to meet a variety of needs 

  Production of 20 podcasts 

  Development and implementation of a pilot curriculum that can be replicated in
  classrooms across Los Angeles

  Teacher satisfaction with rigor of lessons 

  Interviewee satisfaction with experience 


  We will administer pre and post surveys to students to assess skills,
  knowledge, and understanding of issues.  We will use progress toward mastery
  data from Mozi to understand the impact on their writing skills. We will
  gather teacher and interviewee feedback through one-on-one discussions.

  Core Innovate and Century Academy for Excellence will make Los Angeles the
  best place to learn by equipping middle school students with the skills and
  knowledge to communicate with confidence. This project has two key components:
  1) developing and piloting a citizen journalism curriculum that fosters civic
  engagement in students and 2) producing a student-led season of a podcast that
  elevates the work of LA2050 grantees. 


  Core Innovate and Century Academy for Excellence will work together to develop
  a Common Core aligned curriculum that allows students to gain key 21st century
  learning and technological skills. The curriculum will be implemented at
  Century Academy for Excellence and will allow students to engage in real
  world, meaningful learning. Students will practice and strengthen their
  written communication with Mozi, Core Innovate’s writing software, that they
  will use to research and write in all subject areas. They will then apply this
  research to their interviews where they will practice and strengthen their
  oral communication as they listen, ask questions, and engage in conversation
  with interviewees. This will increase ELA proficiency as students practice
  reading, writing, listening, and speaking in all subject areas.  As students
  learn how to produce a podcast, they will develop digital media skills and
  have greater facility with technology and software.  


  The development of communication and digital media skills in middle school
  youth will allow them to begin building their resumes that can be used to
  apply for a job in the future.  While the students are gaining and
  strengthening skills in a meaningful way, they will learn how these skills are
  applicable to academic and career pathways. Not only will they learn how to be
  journalists, producers, and writers, they will have the opportunity to imagine
  a variety of possible futures and potential career pathways through their
  interaction with professionals from a variety of sectors. The expansion of
  their skills and social capital will be critical in addressing youth
  unemployment and underemployment rates. 
   
  Research shows that engaging students in real world, meaningful learning leads
  to increased student engagement. When students are engaged, they are more
  likely to attend school and engage in appropriate behavior. The curriculum
  will allow students to learn about organizations that are innovating to move
  LA2050 closer to reaching its goals and the podcast will engage students in
  meaningful storytelling. This project will give underrepresented students the
  opportunity to contribute to the dialogue about what makes Los Angeles the
  best place to learn, connect, play, create, and live. 


  Because we’re developing and piloting this curriculum with the goal of
  replicating across Los Angeles, we believe that this project will make LA the
  best place for youth to learn and become civically-engaged citizen
  journalists.
