  In the same city celebrated as the epicenter for film and music — where a
  gilded entertainment industry churns and draws talent from around the world —
  a vast majority of schools don't have adequate arts programs.' (LA Times) This
  grant will ensure the students at three local elementary schools experience
  the joy of creative movement, photography or visual arts workshops provided
  free of charge by the Hollywood Arts Council. We will also be able to expand
  this program in other schools.

  Project S.O.A.R. (Students Overcoming All Risks) is the Hollywood Arts
  Council’s program providing inclass arts workshops. The Hollywood Arts Council
  provides these workshops at no cost to students in Hollywood’s public
  elementary schools. Project S.O.A.R. offer a variety of performing and visual
  arts programs, led by professional artists who are matched with each school
  based on need and curriculum.

  The Hollywood Arts Council was founded in 1978 as a grassroots membership
  organization open to all who believed that the arts and culture of Hollywood
  must play a role in the lives of residents and visitors. With more than 500
  community-based members (individuals, businesses and organizations) and many
  successful projects, the Council has an impressive track record of service. As
  the only Arts Council in the city of Los Angeles, the Hollywood Arts Council
  offers a strong, independent voice for promoting a vibrant cultural community
  by empowering, facilitating and advocating for the arts. We are guided by the
  belief that the arts revitalize people as well as communities.

  Keeping these kids in arts programs and out of danger gives them a great
  chance to hone their craft as well as expand their mind. With little to no
  arts programs funding in LAUSD, the Hollywood Arts Council is one of few
  charities that expands each child's creativity with these programs. These
  programs pinpoint the future of LA's creators and collaborators and help them
  flourish in their craft.
