  Success will be defined by our ability to positively impact Los Angeles' green
  spaces, wildlife and avenues for citizens to engage with nature.  Success will
  measured by: 

  Increased sustainable green space for wildlife and people living in Los
  Angeles;

  The number of Schoolyard Habitats installed;

  The number students, teachers and schools engaged in the Schoolyard Habitat
  installation process; 

  The number of students, teachers and citizens each completed Schoolyard
  Habitat has the potential to engage annually;

  The number and types of urban wildlife species that benefit from increased
  habitat.

  Working in partnership with LAUSD and Mia Lehrer + Associates, the National
  Wildlife Federation's California team will provide seed funding, expertise and
  curriculum to 1 school in each of the 6 LAUSD districts to transform their
  current grounds into a urban wildlife habitat.  This space will support a
  healthy ecosystem for the community by increasing habitat for native animals
  like butterflies, bees, birds and also provide a living laboratory that
  enhances STEM learning for students in the city

  Schoolyard Habitats projects will help make LA the best place to live because
  the Federation and our partners will provide direct, on the ground support to
  participating schools who are interested in expanding wildlife habitats,
  improving the community ecosystem and enhancing access to high quality STEM
  education experiences for public school teachers and students. 


  The National Wildlife Federation is already engaged with 200 schools in the
  greater Los Angeles area working to expand green spaces for the both wildlife
  and the community as well as help provide enhanced STEM education
  opportunities.   In June, we hired a new staff member to complement our local
  team already working with the broader community as well as with educators and
  students in the region. As part of our planned Schoolyard Habitat program
  expansion for the 2016/2017 school year, we are focused on engaging 40 new
  schools and connecting directly with an additional 30,000 students and
  approximately 1,600 additional educators in the region.


  The Los Angeles Unified School District is very interested in expanding their
  partnership with us around our goals for the Schoolyard Habitat Program in the
  region.  We believe that awareness gained through the LA2050 campaign has the
  power to catalyze this effort and potential funding received will be directed
  to one Schoolyard Habitat project in each of the six LA Unified School
  Districts to ensure each districtâ€™s community reaps the benefits of enhanced
  ecosystem resilience and that district schools are provided with access to a
  demonstration habitat and accompanying curriculum customized to suit their
  similar needs.


  All Federation Schoolyard Habitat projects are a part of the organization's
  larger EcoSchools USA program. Now with over 5,000 participating schools, it
  is the single largest school garden program in America.  This means, that in
  addition to the benefits provided to the community through the installation of
  the Schoolyard Habitat each participating school in each of the six LA Unified
  Districts will be provided with free access to the full Eco-Schools program. 
  This program, in brief, provides a holistic green school approach that
  addresses the school buildings, the school grounds, the curriculum, and the
  student experience for the benefit of the entire community. 


  We have found that schools that participate in EcoSchools USA programming are
  engaged, active, and motivated, and that the students become more
  environmentally literate citizen contributors through hands-on, experiential,
  and project based learning that turns the school buildings and grounds into
  true learning laboratories.
