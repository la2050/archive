  We are an organization of over 18,000 doctors and medical students in all 50
  states who are dedicated to improving the health of our communities. Our
  campaigns rely on individual members leveraging the health care organizations
  where they work and deliver care in collaboration to provide the greatest
  impact possible. In Los Angeles, we have active members who work within Kaiser
  Permanente, UCLA, the LA County DHS hospitals and clinics as well as numerous
  other organizations who will collaborate.

  Our campaign provides a unique approach to improving reliable access to
  healthy food. We firmly believe that physician-patient interactions provide a
  unique opportunity to identify though who do no have reliable access to
  healthy food, educate these patients and our community, and connect them with
  the numerous excellent resources already available in Los Angeles. 


  Many Los Angelenos suffer from food insecurity, but are unaware of the
  resources that are available to help them. Often this is a result of language
  barriers, cultural barriers, and stigma/ostracization of homeless, mentally
  ill, and poor who are in need in our community. Physicians are uniquely
  positioned as trusted community members, who often have access to populations
  in need who otherwise are difficult to engage. For example, in the emergency
  departments of Los Angeles, physicians often have the opportunity interact
  with those suffering from homelessness, drug addiction, and mental illness who
  are otherwise not connected with services organizations and case managers.
  These points of contact create a unique opportunity to identify those
  suffering from food insecurity, provide education, and connect these patients
  with resources to address their needs. These points of contact can be
  multiplied as those screened, educated and connected share their experiences
  with others in inaccessible communities in need. 


  Our approach to this campaign has 2 main components:


  1) Education - This entails the development of resources to educate physicians
  on the importance of screening for food insecurity, how they can incorporate
  this into their practices, and what to do when they determine a patient does
  not have reliable access to healthy food. This will involve the creation of a
  web page, handouts to be given to physicians and patients,  and an educational
  seminar/webinar, which can be attended in real time, or viewed as a recording
  posted to our website.


  2) Community engagement - We will create a campaign for health care providers
  in LA to screen their patients for food insecurity, educate them, and connect
  them with resources. This will increase health care provider awareness of the
  importance of this issue and encourage providers to incorporate innovative
  methods of addressing these issues in the future. We will provide physicians
  with 'prescription for food' handouts for use in their practice, including the
  locations of nearby food banks as well as instructions on how to apply for
  WIC, SNAP, and other resources. The campaign would include a social media
  component where physicians report back their experience and raise awareness of
  this issue in our community and among other others. We will additionally have
  a media outreach component, encouraging physicians to submit op eds to local
  newspapers, blogs and other media sources to raise awareness of this issue.
  This will create community interest in investing further in food resource
  development in the future.
