  Common Threads will collaborate with The Kitchen Community (TKC) to train
  teachers in Los Angeles to lead experiential, school-based nutrition and
  garden education curricula for their students. TKC aims to improve the health
  of students and communities by creating experiential learning and garden-based
  education opportunities in low-income schools. TKC’s Learning Gardens are
  engaging outdoor classrooms that connect kids to real food, and increase
  academic achievement.
project_areas:
  - County of Los Angeles
  - LAUSD

  CTs’ and TKC’s combined goals are to: 1) provide at least 1,886 students,
  grades preK-8, with 8-16 hours each of interactive nutrition and/or garden
  education; 2) increase student nutrition knowledge, vegetable liking, and
  communication to the family about healthy eating; and 3) increase use of
  school gardens by providing a STEM-aligned curriculum, training, and support
  to teachers. CT also seeks to roll out our Common Bytes platform in at least
  six schools with 80 teachers and 480 youth.


  Evaluations consistently prove CTs’ Small Bites nutrition education improves
  student nutrition knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. During the 2016-17 and
  2017-18 school years, we will measure the impact of Small Bites through our
  internal pre- and post-survey of a national random sample of student
  participants. We specifically expect to achieve the following outcomes:

  - 92% of students will have medium or high scores for vegetable liking;

  - 76% of students will agree or strongly agree that they tell their families
  about healthy eating; and

  - Students will be almost twice as likely to answer nutrition knowledge
  questions correctly.


  We will also work with TKC during SY16-17 on a process evaluation of the pilot
  implementation of Garden Bites and during SY17-18 to evaluate student
  knowledge and behavior. We expect Garden Bites to achieve at least similar
  outcomes to those we achieved in the past through Small Bites, but hypothesize
  that impacts on student would be compounded.

  Common Threads (CT) and The Kitchen Community will train teachers at 15 LA
  schools to deliver experiential, classroom- and garden-based nutrition
  education to 1,886 underserved students, grades preK-8. Each student will
  receive 8-16 hours of hands-on education that empowers them to make healthier
  food choices and connects them to fresh food. CT will also train teachers at
  six schools to utilize our new digital nutrition education platform Common
  Bytes, reaching an additional 480 kids.
project_impact: '["Access to healthy food","Obesity"]'
project_proposal_best_place: >-
  Common Threads (CT), in partnership with The Kitchen Community (TKC), will
  deliver hands-on nutrition and garden education programs to 2,366 underserved
  children (grades preK-8) throughout Los Angeles, providing these students with
  additional access to healthy, fresh food and empowering them to make healthier
  food choices that contribute to their reduced risk of obesity. 


  CT will train an estimated 240 teachers at up to six LA schools to implement
  our evaluation-supported Small Bites nutrition education curricula in their
  classrooms. A subset of these teachers will receive training to pilot our new
  Garden Bites curriculum, which pairs our Small Bites lessons with garden
  extension lessons collaboratively developed with TKC.  At the same time, TKC
  will train an estimated 43 teachers at nine LA schools to pilot Garden Bites.
  We expect approximately 750 students to receive 8-12 hours of in-classroom
  nutrition education through Small Bites, and additionally that 1,136 students
  receive up to 16 hours through Garden Bites, for a total of at least 1,886
  students reached through these teacher-delivered, school-based programs. 
  Continuous program support and technical assistance will be provided to these
  schools by a trained CT staff member or TKC educator, setting the precedent
  within schools and their communities for long-term teacher support of school
  wellness that incorporates both the built environment and healthy lifestyles
  education.


  Small Bites curriculum (versions available for preK-8 grades) consists of 8-12
  hours of education for each student (eight 60- to 90-minute lessons) and
  includes lessons on choosing and preparing healthy snacks, reading nutrition
  labels, and understanding the importance of whole grains, lean proteins, and
  varied fruits and vegetables to long-term personal health. Lessons are aligned
  to Common Core and Next Generation Science Standards by grade level (K-8) and
  National Health Education Standards.

  Garden Bites includes the eight Small Bites lessons as well as eight garden
  extension lessons, during which teachers utilize plants and other gardening
  tools and concepts to reinforce the concepts learned in the nutrition lessons
  and to educate children on the lifecycle of different foods. Students will
  receive ample exposure to fruits and vegetables, so that the next time they
  see them in the cafeteria or at home, they’ll be more likely to try and enjoy
  them.


  Alongside our proven curriculum, CT schools will receive access to our new
  Common Bytes digital nutrition education platform, and we expect to train 80
  teachers to utilize Common Bytes in their classrooms, reaching an additional
  480 youth. Common Bytes was developed in response to teacher feedback and
  teaches children nutrition and cooking skills and knowledge through recipes
  and interactive games. We will provide Common Bytes demo lessons in these
  teachers’ classrooms as well as ongoing technical assistance.
