  #CodingisCool will be expanding to host workshops at actual tech companies in
  and around West Los Angeles-what lately has become known as 'Silicone Beach.'
  We'll be hosting coding and programming workshops with actual programmers
  employed at places such as TrueCar and other huge tech workplaces. The
  students we serve will be able to tour the space, learn about jobs available
  to them in the future, and understand how exciting and accessible a job in
  computer programming can truly be for them!

  Program Evaluation will be conducted by both our instructors, and in-house,
  and also using a two-fold approach: By anonymously surveying the students,
  and, in addition, asking their parents different questions, also anonymously.
  We intend to get an in-depth, honest portrayal of how well the #CodingisCool
  workshops will have resonated within the students’ lives and day-to-day
  activities. We will also be carefully assessing their math and science grades
  during this period, in particular, to note any upswing or surge in interest. 

  Internally, our staff will sit in on all Coding is Cool Workshops, and survey
  the students monthly as to overall participation and engagement. We will also
  be rating their specific skill levels with monthly exams, which will be built
  into the workshop curriculum. We will also be getting intensive feedback from
  the Guest Hosts at the tech companies we will be collaborating with, as well.
  Also, anecdotal research and how often the students express interest in
  reaching out and interning/keeping in touch with employees at these companies
  will be applied.

  By creating an amazing opportunity for very underserved, low-income and
  at-risk youth in LA to have actual access to a tech companies day-to-day,
  while receiving a two hour coding and programming overview on the company's
  specific products, the Children's Lifesaving Foundation is creating a further
  avenue for the youth we serve to transform their lives. Computer Science
  careers are the fastest growing in the entire country, and African-American
  and Latino youth are still woefully behind in CS degree college graduation
  rates.According to Forbes, Computer Science is the high-paid college degree.
  And according to NSF.gov. less than 2.4% of college students graduate with a
  degree in it! 9 out of 10 K-12 schools don’t even offer computer-programming
  classes, according to Code.org. 


  And then there’s this, from Time.com’s own Keith Wagstaff: “If technology is
  the future, however, we are doing a woeful job of preparing our kids for it.
  Computer science is the only one of the STEM (science, technology, engineering
  and mathematics) fields that has actually seen a decrease in student
  participation over the last 20 years, from 25% of high school students to only
  19%, according to a study by the National Center for Education Statistics.
  Take a look at the curriculum of many classes labeled “computer science”
  today, and you’ll find not much has changed from the days of dial-up modems.
  Most cover the basics: Learning how to type and use Microsoft Word and
  PowerPoint. “ Not encouraging!


  Here is how the CLF’s #CodingIsCool Workshops will continue to advance our
  overall mission of transforming the lives of LA’s at-risk youth, as well as
  these more specific goals of our Care through College Educational Program:

   -Increase in the percentage of community college students completing a certificate, degree, or transfer-related program in six years AND  College matriculation rates: 

  This is already the primary goal of the CLF’s Care through College Program,
  under which CIC will be operating. We are certain that CIC will only further,
  positively impact and greatly increase our students’ college graduation rates.
  ALL of our students in our Care trough College Program who have graduated high
  school are currently attending college (usually starting with SMC.) CIC will
  only maximize these metrics!

   -Youth unemployment and underemployment: Computer Science and programming, being able to build and create a killer app or computer game- this is the future career for young adults, and will impact any job or career in a positive way. (And did you know that skilled high school coders and computer engineer interns have earned over $5,000 per month?) Coding is Cool will not help them get “a” job, but get “the” job of the future in LA, if they want it. CIC will  offer them an unparalled and very competitive edge. 

   -District-wide graduation rates: Coding is Cool will exponentially amp up our students’ creativity, specific CS curiosity and STEM-based, academic skills.
