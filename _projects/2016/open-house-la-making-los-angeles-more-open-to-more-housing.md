  to be built. 



  We will measure awareness of the need for more housing by 

  - distribution, hits and engagement of project posts, visuals, memes and
  report 



  We will measure awareness of the need for housing policy changes by

  - mentions of need for more housing by decision makers and influencers

  - upzones in any new general plans, community plans or specific plans in
  jurisdictions in LA county



  We will measure awareness of the need for innovation in housing production by

  - formation and activities of housing innovation start up companies in LA

  We cannot live better in LA unless there are enough homes so people can afford
  to stay in and move to Los Angeles. 


  One of the main obstacles to adding more housing in LA County is that too few
  decision makers, advocates and voters are willing to support more housing.  


  Our proposal will explain why we need more housing of all types and how
  changing rules & spurring innovation can accelerate the production of more
  housing. 


  We call the project 'Open House LA’ because the goals are to make LA more open
  to housing and to ‘invite people in’ to learn more about the causes of and
  solutions to our housing crisis. 


  We will raise awareness among decision makers and organizations through
  engagement and policy recommendations. We will reach a wider set of residents
  and stakeholders through engaging and plain-language infographics, brief
  stories and factoids on the need to expand housing. 


  The report and materials will focus on 4 key themes:

  - we have a housing crisis in LA county because we don't have enough housing 

  - Almost all existing homes in LA County were built as luxury or mass housing,
  to make a profit, back when it used to be easier to construct housing 

  - in recent decades we changed rules to make it harder to build enough new
  homes, and we reaping the results today with rising costs and homelessness

  - by adopting better rules, we can allow more housing of all types to be
  built, helping people of all backgrounds


  To produce the report, we will convene a technical advisory council of
  experts,builders and innovators; and we will interview diverse stakeholders
  active in housing. Project staff will research housing trends and best
  practices locally and profile four large metropolitan regions that have done
  better at producing housing and maintaining housing choice and keeping costs
  lower. (Tokyo, Houston, Toronto and Berlin). From these varied sources we will
  explain the origins and impacts of LA's housing crisis and recommend policy
  changes that local governments in LA county should adopt. 


  As we create the report, we will draw out key facts and arguments to share as
  blog posts, factoids, stories, maps and infographics. Examples might include:

  - what types of homes exist in LA county?

  - how were lower cost homes built?

  - what changed to slow housing production?

  - do places that add more new housing have more or less displacement?

  - which cities in LA county do a good/bad job adding homes?

  - what are policies to add housing in LA County?


  Because many people are visual thinkers, we will also illustrate good
  strategies & policies for adding more more housing using images and diagrams.
  To reach LA’s diverse population, we will translate all materials into Spanish
  and info graphics into Chinese. 


  We will distribute them via social media and other channels. Once the report
  is complete, we will share it online and via a panel discussion / launch event
  and social media event.
