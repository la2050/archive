  We will measure success through: 


  (1) Reach - Develop a New Good Food for All Agenda that aggregates the policy
  priorities of hundreds of organizations and community members. Our goal is to
  release the Agenda at our annual Food Day event— the city’s largest civic
  engagement event on food. The report will also be available through our
  website. We will document the number of organizations and individuals who
  contributed to the process, and use web analytics to determine the reach of
  the report’s dissemination.


  (2) Capacity Building – We want the process of developing the new Good Food
  For All Agenda to be empowering for everyone involved. We will gather feedback
  and input at 3 public Network meetings, approximately 20 Working Group
  meetings, and 3 community workshops to ensure holistic policy recommendations
  are grounded in the experience of communities. We will also offer 3 public
  trainings on data we are collecting about the health, resiliency and fairness
  of our regional food system. To measure the impact of the process itself, we
  will survey participants at each convening to evaluate changes in knowledge,
  skills and relationships. 


  (3) Diversity – It's important we hear from the most impacted communities in
  LA’s food system – youth, workers, low-income mothers, etc. We will conduct
  robust outreach, collect appropriate demographic information, and ally
  ourselves with community-based organizations representing diverse and
  underrepresented communities.

  The Los Angeles Food Policy Council will catalyze, coordinate and connect over
  300 local organizations and hundreds more stakeholders to create a NEW Good
  Food For All Agenda – a visionary policy platform for health and resiliency in
  our local food system. Combining data and community perspectives, the new Good
  Food For All Agenda will translate community priorities to policy makers so
  that all Angelenos can enjoy healthy, sustainable food.

  Los Angeles sits at the heart of the largest food producing region in the
  nation, yet many low-income communities in Los Angeles County lack access to
  affordable, nutritious food. Small and medium-sized local farmers struggle to
  compete in global market channels, which threatens the resiliency of local and
  sustainable food production for our region. The result is the paradox of
  hunger and obesity disproportionately impacting low-income communities and
  communities of color, environmental degradation, exploitation of food workers,
  and economic loss for small farms and food businesses. 


  The Los Angeles Food Policy Council serves as a space where stakeholders of
  diverse communities, and representing every sector of the food system, come
  together to generate solutions. 


  We unite farmers and gardeners, entrepreneurs and activists, government
  officials and community members who care about health disparities and
  diet-related disease, hunger and access to healthy food, working conditions
  for food workers, and the resiliency of our soil, seed, water and food
  economy. 


  Through our dynamic public events- which we call “the Network”- and eight open
  Working Groups, we have been successful in passing policy related to urban
  agriculture, food stamps, farmers markets, healthy food access, and school and
  government food programs. 


  Now it’s time to generate the next big policy agenda! 


  Our proposal for the next 12 months is to ramp up outreach and engagement to
  generate a visionary and comprehensive policy platform for the NEXT 5 years.
  Utilizing our Food System Dashboard – which aggregates almost 200 metrics that
  depict the health, sustainability and fairness of our local and regional food
  system – we will engage a diverse and expansive network of food advocates,
  practitioners and residents to generate policy recommendations for the City
  and County of Los Angeles. 


  Prioritizing the lived experience of those most impacted by a broken food
  system, we will partner with organizations working with youth, seniors,
  mothers, workers and those living in neighborhoods with limited healthy food
  access to ensure policy recommendations holistically reflect our communities. 


  The campaign for the new Good Food for All Agenda will utilize a three-pronged
  approach: 

  (1) Engage the LAFPC Network for feedback and build new partnerships with
  organizations representing those most impacted in the food system 

  (2) Use data to inform policy ideas and 

  (3) Creatively use social media to get the pulse of needs and opportunities
  throughout our local food system. 


  Using these three strategies- and your help- we will generate a new Good Food
  For All Agenda, which will offer concrete action steps to create a healthy and
  fair food system that makes LA the best place to LIVE.
