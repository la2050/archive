project_summary: >-
  It’s time for L.A. be a global leader and make the transition to 100% clean,
  renewable energy by 2030 - we will build political power in communities across
  L.A. to make this transition a reality.

  We will immediately produce a blueprint report, written by renewable energy
  experts, for how Los Angeles can make this transition and use it as a tool to
  educate the community, the Mayor, and the City Council. Through our advocacy
  and community organizing we will work towards getting Mayor Garcetti and the
  City Council to order DWP to invest our ratepayer dollars to renewable energy
  and decommission the coastal gas power plants in the next few years. Our
  success will be measured primarily by building a diverse, powerful, and
  citywide movement towards achieving this historic goal.

  Building on our work to ban fracking and end our dependence on dirty fossil
  fuels, Food & Water Watch is undertaking a strategic campaign to transition
  Los Angeles from oil, gas, and coal to 100% renewable energy by 2030.

  In Los Angeles, residents struggle to live with some of the worst air quality
  in the nation. The oil we extract, refine and burn and our natural gas
  infrastructure are causing severe health consequences for our communities.
  According to the Los Angeles County Asthma Profile, nearly 1,221,000 adults
  and children have been diagnosed with asthma. Asthma contributes to 332 deaths
  yearly in LA County and 14 of those are children under 18. This is a direct
  result of our continued dependence on fossil fuels and polluting gas
  infrastructure in Los Angeles. To make Los Angeles a healthy and cleaner place
  to live, we must transition away from fossil fuels. 


  We are working to commit Los Angeles to a 100% renewable energy future by 2030
  that mandates phasing out the use of dangerous natural gas, obtained via
  fracking, and the decommissioning of polluting gas power plants and storage
  fields in the Los Angeles basin. Currently, the Los Angeles Department of
  Water and Power (DWP) operates four gas fired generating stations in Los
  Angeles. These gas power plants are located in underserved communities in Sun
  Valley, Wilmington, Long Beach and El Segundo. 


  Currently, DWP is working to transition off coal power by 2025, but this could
  means more reliance on polluting gas infrastructure unless we make sure that
  is replaced by renewable power. According to studies by CalTech and NOAA,
  L.A.'s gas infrastructure and pipelines leak methane at an alarming rate:
  2.5-6% of gas delivered in-basin leaks and contributes to 47% of all methane
  emissions in Los Angeles. Finally, Los Angeles just witnessed the worst gas
  blowout at the Aliso Canyon Gas Field that forced the evacuation of over
  15,000 households in the San Fernando Valley. We are working to keep the
  dangerous and leaky field closed for good. 


  Instead of transitioning from coal to gas, Los Angeles needs to make a
  commitment to 100% renewable energy by 2030 to clean up the air and prevent
  the worsening of the climate crisis. 100% renewable by 2030 is necessary to
  prevent 1.5°C warming of the planet. Already, we have seen a 1°C rise in
  temperatures and have observed effects of violent storms, droughts, floods,
  acidifying and rapidly warming oceans and altered growing seasons. It’s
  imperative for Los Angeles, a coastal city that is vulnerable to droughts,
  fires, sea-level rise and acidifying oceans to make a bold commitment and lead
  on the 100% renewable energy future our city deserves.
