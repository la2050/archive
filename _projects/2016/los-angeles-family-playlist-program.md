  We will be partnering with Dr. Steven B. Sheldon, Director of Research at the
  Johns Hopkins University Center on School, Family, and Community Partnerships,
  for the implementation of this project.
project_measure: >-
  First and foremost, we will evaluate the impact of the Family Playlist Program
  on students’ academic outcomes – from homework completion to demonstrated
  proficiency on state mathematics exams. These positive outcomes have been
  documented in the research base supporting the TIPS program used by Johns
  Hopkins University, which we seek to emulate. Additionally, we will work with
  teachers to set goals around the number of unique points of contact with each
  student’s family, working to significantly increase the frequency of
  communication and feedback between teachers and parents.

project_description: >-
  This innovative project directly connects parents in underserved communities
  with their students’ teachers via a Family Playlists Program that incorporates
  bilingual support in Spanish. The program takes concepts taught during the
  school day and delivers them in an interactive “playlist” that students and
  parents complete together at home and follow up with feedback to the teacher.
  It connects teachers and parents online and via text messaging to share
  information on student learning.

project_proposal_best_place: "We believe students thrive in school when they are self-directed learners who also receive simultaneous support from their teachers and families. However, this can be challenging in the late elementary and middle school years, when family involvement and teacher-family communication can begin to wane. During the years that students often need to make significant academic gains, teachers and families lack effective tools and systems to communicate about their learning and progress. To address this challenge, we are partnering with Johns Hopkins University to build upon the strong success of their research-backed Teachers Involving Parents in Schoolwork (TIPS) program by enhancing it with 21st-century technology to become our Family Playlists Program.\n\t\nIn this innovative program, teachers and students will extend learning into the home environment by completing mathematics-based “Family Playlists” from our free digital learning platform, PowerMyLearning Connect. Students will have the opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge by “teaching” parents what they have learned about math concepts, and parents will complete the process by sending feedback about their student’s performance via guided prompts, including full bilingual support for Spanish-speaking families. From a central dashboard, teachers will be able to assign Family Playlists to an entire class, prompting parents via text messaging in their home language. Following completion of the playlists at home, teachers can easily access parent feedback in one place, or determine which parents they should follow up with. Once students, teachers and families have become accustomed to using the playlists and text messaging, the program will serve as a low-lift, informal way for teachers to remain in constant communication with parents regarding student learning. This process has been demonstrated to have a positive impact on students’ homework completion, engagement with schoolwork, and overall academic performance."
