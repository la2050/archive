  In 2015, Inner-City Arts announced the results of an evaluation of one of our
  program areas, funded by the U.S. Department of Education. Over the course of
  the four-years of research, we found consistent and significant gains in
  English language arts when compared to matched comparison school sites—a 15%
  average increase among English language learners, and a 10% average increase
  among the whole school population, as well as a 6.5% average gain in
  mathematics and 33% increase in creativity. We continue to refine internal
  evaluations that are reflective of this work. 


  Inner-City Arts will internally measure the success of our programs by
  analyzing enrollment, attendance and retention, as well as data reported by
  students and teachers in pre- and post-program surveys. Some anticipated
  outcomes include:


  • Participating elementary school students will demonstrate increases in
  engagement in learning, language development, and creative capacity that
  includes artistry, curiosity, imagination, innovation and personal expression;


  • Middle and high school students will experience increased acquisition of
  skills, engagement in learning and confidence in their ability to express
  themselves; and 


  • Educators will report knowledge of intentional practices that support
  creative expression within the classroom environment, increased perception of
  the value of the arts in learning, and using practices that encourage
  classroom community.

  By creating a bridge between the studio and the classroom, our unique approach
  to arts education measurably improves academic and personal outcomes for more
  than 6,000 children and teenagers each year, including those students with
  limited English proficiency, who are at risk of academic failure. 


  Inner-City Arts programs are an investment in the youth of Los Angeles,
  engaging them in the creative process to become creative, confident and
  collaborative individuals.

  Inner-City Arts will help make Los Angeles the best place to learn by engaging
  young people in the creative process through learner-centered, research-based
  arts instruction. Here, we build students' awareness, belief and confidence in
  their own unique creative self-expression from which personal and academic
  growth develops.


  Arts-infused curricula are proven to transform learning among economically
  disadvantaged students, particularly those with low levels of English
  proficiency--as illustrated in a National Endowment for the Arts report in
  2012--substantiating a clear correlation between arts learning and academic
  achievement. Additionally, young adults of low socioeconomic status, with a
  history of in-depth arts involvement, experience better grades and higher
  rates of college enrollment and attainment. 


  Inner-City Arts offers: (1) direct arts instruction to economically
  disadvantaged students, (2) professional development for teachers and school
  administrators, and (3) innovative and diverse arts programming for the whole
  community.


  1) Learning and Achieving Through the Arts (Grades K - 8) and Out-of-School
  Arts Workshops (Grades 6 - 12)

  Learning and Achieving Through the Arts (LATA), offered in partnership with
  LAUSD, is a unique model that brings students and their classroom teachers to
  our independent arts campus. LATA includes standards-aligned instruction in
  the arts for more than 5,000 students, extended professional development and
  supportive coaching for classroom teachers, and activities for schools to
  embrace arts strategies.


  Out-of-school arts workshops include our Visual, Media and Performing Arts
  Institutes and Artists in the Middle summer program. Additionally, our Work of
  Art program advances the experience of high school students through pathways
  to college and careers via educational and employment opportunities and
  mentoring–such as work retreats, professional arts experiences at cultural
  institutions, and summer internships and employment.


  2) Inner-City Arts Professional Development Institute (Adults)

  Each year, we offer nearly 1,000 classroom teachers, school administrators,
  teaching artists and community partners meaningful and engaging strategies for
  incorporating creativity in classroom curricula through the visual and
  performing arts. We build bridges between the arts and other disciplines to
  foster literacy, inquiry, critical thinking, collaborative skills and sense of
  community in their students. 


  3) Family and Community Engagement (All Ages)

  We further optimize student learning and engagement by involving their support
  network—especially parents—in the learning process; including original
  productions, family art days, parent workshops and culminating performances at
  the end of each of our sessions. Complementing our arts learning programs, our
  Rosenthal Theater holds innovative and diverse performances, engagements which
  nurture and illuminate the creative spirit of the whole community.
