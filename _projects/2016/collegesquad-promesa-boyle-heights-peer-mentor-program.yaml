Are any other organizations collaborating on this proposal?: 'Mendez High School, Roosevelt High School, Hollenbeck Middle School'
Please describe your project proposal.: >-
  To increase college access among Boyle Heights youth, we will create a peer
  mentoring program, in which local college students would mentor college bound,
  but first generation high students at two key schools, Felicitas and Gonzalo
  Mendez High School and Roosevelt High School, giving them support as they
  prepare to apply to college.  In turn, those high school mentors, will mentor
  at risk middle school students at risk of not graduating, to increase their
  motivation towards school.
Which metrics will your proposal impact?​:
  - College matriculation rates
  - District-wide graduation rates
  - Student education pipeline
  - Youth unemployment and underemployment
In what areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - East LA
Describe in greater detail how your proposal will make LA the best place.: >-
  PBH implementation began in 2012 through a Community-School (C-S) model at
  Mendez HS, including case management for highest-risk juniors and seniors;
  school-wide supports to build a college-going culture; and leadership
  development. PBH expansion includes 1) C-S strategies at Roosevelt HS &
  Hollenbeck MS; and 2) targeted community wellness strategies. 


  Next, PBH will launch a unique peer mentorship program that bridges middle
  school, high school, and college students by providing at-risk and
  high-performing students with opportunities to support and learn from one
  another along the education continuum.  It will be structured as follows:

  A cohort of 20 students at Hollenbeck MS who are at the highest-risk for
  dropping out of school will receive  1:1 mentorship by a higher-performing HS
  student from Mendez  or Roosevelt.  Their HS mentor will provide them with
  peer support and motivation.  

  Those same higher-performing HS students (20 total) – many of whom are good
  candidates for college but lack the resources and social capital to feel
  confident in applying – would gain confidence by providing personal and
  professional development to high-risk middle school students.  

  The 20 High School students in this mentoring cohort would also be mentored by
  10 college students who share a similar journey and background and would
  support them in applying for college.  College students would mentor the high
  school students at a ratio of 1:2. Potential partners for this project are
  USC, Cal State LA, UCLA, Occidental College, and Loyola Marymount University,
  where we have current relationships. 


  Youth first identified peer mentorship as a key PBH strategy in the PBH
  planning in 2010 and the LA2050 project strategy was defined by youth. 
  Concurrently, high-performing students at Mendez High School and Roosevelt
  High School expressed a desire to develop their personal leadership skills and
  also mentor younger students in the community who are facing the same academic
  challenges they once faced.   In April 2016 focus groups students shared:  “I
  like that we would be mentored by high school students, because they can give
  you their perspective, since they were just there.  When you talk to adults,
  they don’t know how it is now.” --HMS 8th grader.  “The program is a win win. 
  You get to help someone, while also helping yourself by building your
  extracurricular activities for college, and you get helped yourself!” --MHS
  12th grader. Additionally, high school and middle school students
  participating in the program will work as a cohort to design school wide
  initiatives they will lead on their campus to raise college awareness,
  offering opportunities for both leadership development and a wider project
  scope.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.​: >-
  Success will be defined by both immediate and long term outcomes.  To gauge
  short term success, we will distribute surveys school wide on our two high
  school and one middle school campus before starting the program to gauge
  college awareness.  Surveys will be distributed after the program has been
  completed and data will be analyzed to note for statistically significant
  increases in awareness.  For our target cohort of the 40 high school and
  middle school students, they will complete pre, mid, and post surveys that
  focus on college awareness, college attainment, self esteem, and hope for
  their future.  Additionally, post program focus groups will be completed for
  all cohorts: college, high school, and middle school.  For long term success,
  we will analyze school wide data obtained from our schools.  We already have
  baseline data from previous school years from the three target schools on
  attendance, behavior, graduation rates, course performance, and college
  enrollment.  We will use this data to gauge the school wide impact on our
  program’s presentations and school wide initiatives.  In addition to the
  school baseline data we have, there is a documented need for this type of
  programming in Boyle Heights. Boyle Heights’ 69% dropout rate underlines this
  predominantly Latino community’s high-need.  And although the C-S model at
  Mendez has helped double the graduation rate in the last four years, local
  youth continue to face many barriers to graduation and college success.
