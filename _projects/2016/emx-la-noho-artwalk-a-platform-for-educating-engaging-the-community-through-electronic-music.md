Describe in greater detail how your proposal will make LA the best place.: >-
  Los Angeles has long served as the epicenter for the creative arts, and as a
  trendsetter for progress in the global music industry.


  EMX is an electronic music community founded in Los Angeles that will make Los
  Angeles the best place to CREATE by providing artists the chance to enhance
  their communities through performance, education, and community engagement.


  Electronic music & DJing have quickly become a global trend and very lucrative
  career.  With this comes the opportunity to positively influence others.  EMX
  provides opportunities for artists to give back to their communities through
  the NoHo ArtWalk, Future DJs, Future Producers, & EMA Play if FWD program. 
  Once the artist contributes to their local community, they are recognized and
  promoted internationally.


  Founded in 2015, EMX has quickly grown from one monthly open-mic showcase to
  developing after-school programs, 10 monthly performance events for upcoming
  electronic music artists (NoHo, Hollywood, & DTLA), and the NoHo ArtWalk as
  the core of the EMX event portfolio.


  EMX has created partnerships with the Art Institute of California (Hollywood),
  the Mid-town Neighborhood Council, the Electronic Music Alliance, The Portable
  Classroom, Big Wangs (NoHo), Theodore Roosevelt Elementary, VegansOfLA, Tokyo
  Beat (DTLA), and many other local businesses in the NoHo Arts District.


  In addition to growing the NoHo Artwalk, EMX has established two educational
  after-school programs in the Burbank Unified School District and soon the Los
  Angeles Unified School District called Future DJs and Future Producers.


  Future DJs is an after-school program partnered with a Los Angeles nonprofit
  called The Portable Classroom.  Pioneer DJ supplies equipment for the kids to
  use, and Future DJs concentrates on teaching students about DJing & audio
  production.


  Future Producers is an after-school program partnered with a Los Angeles
  nonprofit called the Electronic Music Alliance (EMA).  Software and guest
  speakers for the program are provided by Ableton Live, and Future Producers
  provides teen & adults a cost-effective platform for learning to produce
  electronic music.


  The difference in the EMX educational platform is that the classes offered are
  lead by the very DJs and Producers who participate in the EMX community. 
  These DJs and Producers are also the leaders who participate in & encourage
  community engagement through the EMA Play it FWD program.  This EMA program
  affords electronic music artists and fans the opportunity to choose from
  various options for engaging in community service.
