  Measures of success for implementing Swim & Achieve include the following:

  1. Provide homework assistance and tutoring for a minimum of 100 underserved,
  low-income children and youth ages 6-13 from the North Long Beach area.

  2. Provide swim lessons and water-safety courses for a minimum of 100 children
  and youth participating in Swim & Achieve in the after-school hours.

  3. Hire a minimum of five college students to provide tutoring and homework
  assistance for children and youth after-school. 

  4. Disseminate surveys to children and/or their parents or guardians to
  determine program satisfaction, improvements in grades and school attendance,
  changes in self-confidence and self-awareness, and increased swim skills.

  5. Children and youth participants are expected to have improved study habits,
  a greater interest in learning, and increased physical activity for better
  health and well-being.

  6. Program participants will receive supplemental education that increases
  their chances of succeeding in school, graduating, matriculating into college,
  and leading to greater job opportunities in the future. 


  Pools of Hope expects that approximately 85% of the 100 children who
  participate in the program will improve study habits and become more
  proficient in their school subjects, as well as learn to swim and increase
  their water safety skills and abilities. The children's progress will be
  tracked by participants providing a copy of reports cards as well as
  student/parent surveys.

  Recognizing a dearth of after-school services for low-income children in the
  north Long Beach area, Pools of Hope developed the Swim & Achieve Homework
  Assistance Lab to provide professional tutoring for children at risk of grade
  retention and poor academic outcomes. The Swim & Achieve program is two-fold:
  1) provide hands-on tutoring and homework assistance for up to one hour; and
  2) provide swim lessons as an incentive and reward for engaging with the
  tutors each week.

  In 2015, Pools of Hope received a grant from the Goodwin Family Memorial Trust
  to pilot the homework assistance program for 100 children ages 6-13. The
  community response was incredible, with an outpouring of support the pilot
  project ran at full capacity and Pools of Hope maintained a lengthy waiting
  list to get more local children into the program.


  Children in the Pools of Hope service area are often plagued with gang
  violence, high unemployment, and low educational achievement. The lack of
  supplemental educational opportunities in the area puts children further at
  risk of engaging in anti-social behaviors. In addition, according to the U.S.
  Centers for Disease Control, 1) drowning is the second leading cause of
  unintentional deaths among children 1-14; and, 2) the fatal drowning rate of
  African American children ages 5-14 is 3.1 times that of Caucasian
  children--making it vitally important for children in our community to learn
  water safety and solid swimming skills.


  The Swim & Achieve Homework Assistance Lab was developed specifically to meet
  these pressing community needs. Swim & Achieve will reduce risk factors for
  children dropping out of school and increase their chances for graduating high
  school and continuing on to college. The program will promote confidence in
  learning and impart life-saving water safety skills among 100 disadvantaged
  children over a one-year period--giving them the ability and inspiration they
  need to excel in school and in life. 


  Students participating in Swim & Achieve receive 45 minute to one-hour
  tutoring sessions--with swim lessons provided to students afterwards as a
  reward for participation in the tutoring program. The program is expected to
  help children make a body-mind connection, strengthen communication skills in
  the Lab and in the pools, and support healthy relationships with adults who
  are lifeguards, instructors, and tutors. Swim & Achieve will also provide a
  great opportunity for year-round, part-time, paid employment--particularly for
  college and university students who can gain experience working with children.
