  Citizens Of Culture uses engaging events to highlight and create deeper
  context for artist's work. With the LA2050 we will expand our gallery 
  showroom programs beyond the walls of our space to engage with a wider network
  of creators.

project_measure: >-
  Our success will be measure by the number of artists we are able to create
  programs for, the depth and duration of the program run, and the sales revenue
  we help them generate through customer engagement and wholesale distribution.

  The first part of our platform requires that we constantly meet with and
  appraise talented creatives in a variety of fields. Then we must select who to
  collaborate with based on shared vision and goals. After creating programs
  that we have confidence in and executing them we will have to measure our
  investment against real business metrics to determine success resulting not
  only a profit and loss statement but an appraisal of accountability to the
  values and objectives we began with.

project_proposal_best_place: >-
  Citizens Of Culture exists at the intersection of creativity, commerce, and
  community. Because of this we interact with hundreds of artists per year who
  have great work that needs marketing, and development support. This might be
  as little as social media strategy consulting or helping craft narrative in a
  press release, all the way to determining a business model or cost structure
  for their time. Each of these hurdles can be the defining factor in whether a
  talented artist can make a livelihood from their craft. Our LA2050 proposal
  expands our existing program; consulting and representing artists as
  entrepreneurs to develop initial streams of revenue that can be built upon to
  grow their career sustainably. In the business world this is referred to as a
  MVP (minimum viable product).


  Our retail gallery in Chinatown, Los Angeles has been host to rapid
  prototyping of workshops and events that help convert artists audiences into
  patrons. We help them develop a value proposition that is both authentic and
  financially sustainable in order to begin a career as a working artist. In the
  past six months we have held art shows and retail events that have generated
  income for creatives based on helping them create meaningful context for their
  work and clarity of their message. Artists bring us their designs or original
  works and we create art shows and activations in our space that help their
  sales, and then package the imagery and messaging surrounding their work to
  present it to other galleries and shops to broaden their exposure.


  Now, we would like to expand our platform to be able to build longer lasting
  relationships and activations that can work  to drive campaigns and
  opportunities. To do this we need to redesign our site, run longer term
  events, invest in PR and marketing resources, and pay for prints and
  production samples. The LA2050 grant will be put to great use in allowing us
  to focus more directly on concept and execution by removing some of the
  financial barriers to campaign success.
