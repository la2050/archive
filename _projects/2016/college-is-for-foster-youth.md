  UFC measures success for our programs in the ultimate success of the youth we
  serve.  For our education programs, the ultimate impact we seek is attainment
  of a bachelors degree.  Along the way, key metrics include high school
  graduation, college readiness as measured by successful completion of A-G
  classes, application to post-secondary institutions, college admission and
  receipt of all available financial aid.


  Thanks to the generous support of the William & Flora Hewlett Foundation, UFC
  is is working towards an impact evaluation of our programs by an independent
  party. The overarching aim of this evaluation is to assess the effectiveness
  of UFC’s programs in improving outcomes for both current and former foster
  youth. In addition, we plan to study the impact of UFC’s relationship-based
  approach to serving youth.  


  UFC has been utilizing Social Solutions’ Efforts to Outcomes (ETO) database
  since 2009. As of January 2015, we have implemented redesigned “Touchpoints” –
  the interfaces that program staff uses to input data – for all UFC programs,
  and we are currently refining the process of data collection and reporting.
  UFC Counselors are responsible for entering data on all their interactions
  with the youth they serve.  Review of the data is the role of our Outcomes &
  Evaluation Director.

  Believing that college access and success is the best path to
  self-sufficiency, United Friends of the Children has created an 11-year
  educational support continuum that helps foster youth graduate from high
  school, aspire to and attain college acceptance, and earn their Bachelors
  degree.  100% of those in our Readiness program 4 years or more graduate HS,
  with more than 50% matriculating directly to 4-yr. schools;  70% of those in
  our College Sponsorship program earn a Bachelors within 5 years.

  UFC has created an 11-year education support continuum that follows foster
  youth from the seventh grade through the completion of a Bachelor’s degree.
  UFC’s College Readiness (CRP) and College Sponsorship (CSP) programs work
  harmoniously to create this pipeline for success.  


  The goal of the CRP is to help foster youth graduate from high school ready to
  succeed at a 4-year college or university.  The CRP supports students from 7th
  through 12th grades.  College Counselors meet one-on-one with each student in
  their homes and maintain frequent contact with students via telephone and
  email. The content of these meetings is driven by both the student’s needs and
  the counselor’s recommendations.  Counselors serve as the main conduit for
  delivering a range of program content to CRP students. Acknowledging the
  crucial role caregivers have in helping maintain stability for students, UFC
  offers training in communication, conflict resolution, and other subjects
  designed to help them cope during a challenging developmental stage in the
  lives of all youth. 


  UFC also uses monthly Saturday workshops and college tours, facilitated by CRP
  College Counselors, to deliver program content, and encourage social
  interaction and the development of a college-bound culture among participants.
  Through these various activities, participation in the program helps students
  to earn their high-school diploma, graduate four-year-college eligible, apply
  to and attend college. We will serve 500 youth in the CRP in the coming
  year.  


  The College Sponsorship Program is a commitment of personal and financial
  support for up to 5 years to foster youth attending 4-year institutions.  In
  addition to a $15,000/ five-year scholarship, each youth is paired one-on-one
  with a College Counselor.  Counselors serve as the key source of support,
  guidance and as a resource throughout a student’s college experience.  The
  program also includes paid internships, enrichment activities and
  post-graduation planning.  By keeping youth involved, engaged, and interested
  in their education through close, mentoring relationships with UFC counselors,
  the CSP is increasing college graduation rates for foster youth.


  In ever increasing numbers, youth are graduating from high school through the
  CRP and attending universities through the CSP.  In 2016, 18 seniors
  participating in the CRP joined the latest cohort in the CSP.  In total, more
  than 200 students will participate in the CSP.
