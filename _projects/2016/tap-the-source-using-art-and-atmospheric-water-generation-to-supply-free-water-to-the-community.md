  Tap The Source: Using Art and Atmospheric Water Generation to Supply Free
  Water to the Community 
project_summary: >-
  Sky Source's mission is to install atmospheric water generators in communities
  with low access to clean drinking water, incorporating artwork into the
  installation, creating an urban drinking fountain

project_measure: >-
  Our measure of success is simply if the urban well is put to good use. Our
  mission will be complete if the community uses this pure drinking water to
  enrich themselves and also reduce demand on municipal supplies. We also hope
  that this installation inspires people of the community to ask questions, and
  become educated about the drought and the potential technological solutions.
project_proposal_help:
  - 'Money '
  - Publicity/awareness
  - Community outreach
project_description: >-
  Our goal is to use the prize money in order to help facilitate the creation of
  urban wells in communities with limited or compromised water supply. We plan
  to create an art installation surrounding the well in order to inspire the
  community to learn about the issues we are facing in the current drought, and
  how atmospheric water generation could be a possible solution. The art
  installation could range from a billboard attracting people to the well or a
  mural on the side of a building.

project_proposal_best_place: >-
  SkySource will make LA the best place to create by facilitating community
  interaction around a very relevant and pressing issue in Los Angeles: water
  scarcity. Atmospheric water generation is an innovative technology that
  condenses the humidity in the air to form drinking water. The water undergoes
  several stages of filtration and treatment before it is expelled, ensuring the
  highest quality water.


  Not only will the installation create free, clean drinking water, but we will
  also create a mural in order to abstractly display the issues we currently
  face, or a billboard to visually attract the community. We are proposing one
  off-grid system that will run off solar power that can be placed in any public
  space, such as a park, and two off-grid systems that could be placed on the
  side of existing buildings. In the case of the off-grid systems, we will
  create a billboard that will be designed to aid in the collection of
  condensation. For the on-grid systems, we will create a mural on the side of
  the building. 


  Additionally, we are creating an educational opportunity about technology and
  the environment for anyone who visits the urban well. But, above all, we are
  creating a sense of hope in the community. Hope that education, technology,
  and conservation can help bring us out of these dry times. It will inspire
  innovation, and a desire for the community to come together and take action.
