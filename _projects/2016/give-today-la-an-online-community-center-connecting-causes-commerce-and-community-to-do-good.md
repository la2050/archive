project_measure: >-
  We will measure success of connection by using a social share platform on the
  internet where we will asses and track citizen involvement and interactions.
  We will also be able to asses quality by the number of nonprofits that sign up
  to promote on our platform and the number of business and community signups we
  generate. All will be logged and reported. Lastly, we will have a weekly
  podcase, Go Beyond the Mission where we will highlight causes and people
  throughout the development and roll out of Give Today LA.

  Using the unique community goals, GiveToday LA is at the core a connecting
  piece for the entire community to support each other. In a fast paced
  technology era we have been granted access and information to the entire
  world. In this pursuit, the question should be asked, have we become blind to
  the local? Los Angeles is home to a vibrant and well supported non profit
  community. We are also home to a very engaged and dedicated philanthropic
  community and business community. Imagine if we pulled all the technology
  advances together and at the same time pulled the community, commerce and
  causes under one massive social platform? The results could be massive, so
  massive that we need your support. The connection place, a place where LA goes
  to do good, would offer three pillar areas of focus:


  1. Time- a portal that matches individuals and businesses to customized
  volunteer experiences, with a completely local focus- local cause, local
  help. 


  2. Treasure- a crowd funding platform where local causes can promote to a
  local audience and gain lifelong support. This will be in phase two and we
  will partner with an existing platform to power this engine. 


  3. Talent- a marketplace where  people can offer expertise or help to local
  businesses or nonprofits, and conversely organizations can list certain needs
  they have to seek help. 


  To make LA the best place it can be, we must all give something. This web
  based gathering place will be the one stop to inspire and provide people with
  a place to give something- time, treasure or talent. The impact is massive.
