  Success for Maiden LA is defined and measured by the public's engagement and
  participation. We were thrilled to have had 160 participants in the first
  iteration of Maiden LA, and were amazed by the range of events that
  materialized, from artists hosting web-based projects, including a biennial
  that only exists on Instagram and a blog that addressed an artist's permanent
  ban from the US, to a collection of Noah Purifoy works at Tara's Hall, a
  survey of works by 80s L.A. punk rock scene artist Mary Woronov at the Lodge,
  a Post-It installation at an artist-run children’s museum in San Gabriel
  Valley, and a talk with Jackie Winsor at Hauser Wirth and Schimmel. 


  Success for the 2017 iteration of Maiden LA will involve greater artist
  participation, events well-attended by the community, more social media
  followers and engagement, more newsletter subscribers, a wider promotional
  campaign, and greater press exposure.


  We foresee 300 participants in Maiden LA 2017, with more artists and their
  respective communities being connected and represented. We plan to send out a
  feedback survey to all participants in order to glean various pertinent
  information, such as how they heard about the project, how many guests
  attended, and if they attended any other Maiden LA events.


  Success will also be defined by how many projects continue beyond the scope of
  Maiden LA.  We will of course stay in dialog with the participants and our
  followers in an effort to keep Maiden LA a success.

  Maiden LA, an annual county-wide network of ‘happenings’ throughout the month
  of August, is a way to assemble and connect Los Angeles artists, curators,
  performers, collectives, organizations, etc., to host open studios, group
  shows, or self-initiated projects in both traditional and unconventional
  spaces, making LA the best place to CREATE. 


  Maiden LA, both a playful anagram and homophone of the Hammer Museum’s ‘Made
  in LA’, broadens the scope of what it means to be an artist in Los Angeles and
  how to find and engage with a community in such a vast city. Maiden LA is
  different from other biennials in that it is a community-driven, egalitarian
  event, aiming to dissolve hierarchies.  The artists involved hold the reigns
  in an effort to expand upon rather than undermine the institutional dictates. 

  Because Maiden LA’s application process is 100% inclusive, it provides a rare
  forum where established institutions, like the Getty, are on the same plane as
  an unrepresented artist working out of their garage. Los Angeles is broadly
  acknowledged, especially as of late, as a current artistic hub, with a recent
  influx of galleries and artists moving here, as well as a flood of media
  coverage. In addition to the publicized aspects of the LA art world, there are
  also so many artists that no one gets to see or know about.  By encouraging
  the use of alternative spaces to showcase one’s work, unrepresented artists
  can open up their spaces and share their work to the greater community under
  the Maiden LA umbrella.  


  Regarding the LA2050 metrics: 


  Arts establishments: Through exposure, community engagement, and networking we
  hope to bring artists and arts establishments together to foster new
  relationships.  We plan to invite emerging and established art spaces to
  attend open studios and vice versa. The 2016 iteration of Maiden LA saw
  collaborative efforts between artists and art establishments, with
  organizations adding to or creating new programs.  This is certainly a
  measured success!  New professional relationships will continue to emerge as a
  result of Maiden LA.


  Employment in the creative industries: With over 300 events it is inevitable
  that many of the organizations involved will have a need for additional staff
  and/or volunteers. 


  Percentage of graduates from local higher education institutions that remain
  in LA County 5 years after graduating: By turning Maiden LA into a household
  name, we hope to contribute to the rich texture of this city, providing
  incentive for graduates to stay and thrive here. We will offer 25 need-based
  artist stipends to help launch individual projects.


  Recruiting and retention rates for local higher education institutions: We
  plan to reach out to local higher education institutions, in hopes that our
  ongoing program will aid in their recruitment and retention rates. Our last
  event included involvement with Pomona College and number of recent UCLA
  graduates, among others.
