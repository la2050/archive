Are any other organizations collaborating on this proposal?: ''
Please describe your project proposal.: >-
  Our goal is to phase out fossil fuels and support an equitable transition to
  100 percent clean energy in Los Angeles. Our vision for 100 percent clean
  energy is premised on three pillars of quality of life now and in the future:
  healthy and safe air, equitable economic growth, and resilient communities
  safe from the worst potential damages wrought by climate change.
Which metrics will your proposal impact?​:
  - Exposure to air toxins
  - Self-sufficiency
  - Resilient communities
In what areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South LA
Describe in greater detail how your proposal will make LA the best place.: >-
  Los Angeles is a leader in fighting climate change. From hotter heat waves and
  increased smog to drought and rising seas, Los Angeles will be acutely damaged
  as climate change worsens. There is a lot at stake for Los Angeles in how
  quickly we stop relying on fossil fuels, which cause climate change. 


  The city is acting to reduce our use of fossil fuels by phasing out dirty coal
  and expanding rooftop solar and energy savings programs. Importantly, the city
  is expanding its programs for low-income residents to ensure that every
  Angeleno can benefit from clean energy programs.


  Still, we have work to do. Los Angeles is in the process of replacing 70
  percent of our energy resources over the next 15 years. Will the city double
  down on fossil fuels or expand clean energy resources like wind and solar? As
  it builds clean energy, who will benefit? Will the people of Watts have the
  same access and reap the same benefits from clean energy as people in
  Brentwood? 


  Our goal is an equitable transition to 100 percent clean energy in Los
  Angeles, premised on our belief that clean energy can improve three pillars of
  quality of life now and into the future: healthy and safe air, equitable
  economic growth, and resilient communities safe from the worst potential
  damages wrought by fossil fuels and climate change. 


  Recently, the city council requested that the city’s utility, the Los Angeles
  Department of Water and Power (DWP), create a plan to phase out fossil fuels
  and get to 100 percent clean energy. That is a great step, but now we are
  seeking support from LA 2050 to help ensure that the plan for 100 percent
  clean energy reflects the vision and the values of the city. With your support
  over the next year, we will: 


  ●Engage residents and other stakeholders in a city-wide discussion about what
  Los Angeles’s energy future should look like, ways to ensure that we are 
  training the next generation of workers to build the clean energy economy, and
  how the transition will benefit frontline communities impacted by fossil
  fuels;


  ●Track and evaluate the mechanisms being used by the city to help spur clean
  energy, ensuring that those mechanisms are localizing our energy
  infrastructure, building a more resilient system, and providing equitable
  access to clean energy programs; 


  ●Develop popular education materials to educate the public about the impact of
  climate change and the benefits of clean energy; and


  ●Use social media to help launch city-wide dialogue about the role of clean
  energy in our grid.


  A 100 percent clean energy future will transform our city: 21st century jobs,
  a resilient energy system, cleaner air, and more. We are creating systemic
  change by democratizing and reinventing our energy system in an unprecedented
  way, shifting from an energy system that damages our health and planet to a
  system that supports our health and climate while retooling our infrastructure
  and economy for the 21st century.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.​: >-
  Through recent advocacy, Los Angeles is now developing a plan for 100 percent
  clean energy. Our campaign’s success will be assessed based on whether DWP has
  created a plan that is equitable and that reflects the values and input of Los
  Angeles residents. 


  Is there a plan?  We will track DWP’s plan development process, including
  progress towards meeting stated benchmarks.  


  Are there clear, demonstrable policies to ensure low-income communities are
  benefiting? Along with the technical analysis of the transition to 100 percent
  clean energy, DWP must work with outside stakeholders in academia and
  community organizations to develop an economic plan to ensure the transition
  to clean energy promotes equity and fair job growth. 


  Does the plan reflect the broad values of the city?  Over the next year, we
  will shape the plan by participating in workshops, providing input when
  stakeholder groups are convened by the utility, and ensuring a robust public
  vetting of the plan. Our metrics include engaging 30 organizations, collecting
  input from 10,000 Angelenos, and holding six public events to engage the
  public in helping shape the plan for 100 percent clean energy.
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
  - 'Money '
  - Volunteers
  - Publicity/awareness
  - Technical infrastructure (computers
  - 'Community outreach '
  - Network/relationship support
