  Building a home that shifts interactions from pixels to people, from
  loneliness to companionship.
project_summary: >-
  We plan to create a space that encourages you to use all five senses in public
  - savor our menu, witness people’s gifts, play in the space, listen to
  conversations and music.

  thecool will increase Arts Establishments per Capita by inviting concepts,
  groups, and individuals to host events within the space.  This type of
  collaboration will cultivate a network of concepts that will either transform
  our space into an art establishment or transition externally to build a space
  of their own accessible to all.  As a result, our relationships with local
  community establishments will allow us to guide similar concepts to fruition
  throughout the city.  We will measure the progress of this metric by counting
  the number of new art spaces that develop out of events hosted at thecool.


  We will increase Employment in the Creative Industries by celebrating every
  individual’s innate creativity.  Our platform for all people to share and
  explore their passion will lead to new businesses in the creative field. 
  Picture this, a local resident is encouraged to put on a photo series, and
  because it is well received by the community, he or she realizes their gift
  and makes a career transition.  Monitoring these type of transitions or
  passions that turn into some form of creative employment will be our measure
  of this metric’s progress.


  We will expand LA’s Global and Cultural Economic Influence as it becomes the
  unofficial community research and development studio for side projects,
  passions, and thought.  We believe organization’s and individual’s testimonies
  of their experience and inspiration leading to new paths will become a model
  for other cities globally.

project_description: >-
  thecool will disrupt the standard cafe experience by serving and engaging the
  community in an interactive space, with a culturally adventurous menu that
  integrates popular food and drink from various cuisines while elevating them
  in preparation, aesthetics, and taste.  Guests are encouraged to surface their
  hidden talents, act as a catalyst for the brainstorming and exchange of
  innovative ideas, and provide all Angelenos an outlet to build community in an
  increasingly isolated and digital world.

project_areas:
  - City of Los Angeles
project_proposal_best_place: >-
  Los Angeles is one of the premier cities in the world, the mecca of
  entertainment, art, fashion, and ideas.  While LA is set apart by its creative
  heartbeat and passion to innovate, it still battles with issues such as,
  homelessness, loneliness, depression, violence, and injustice.  We have an
  opportunity to leverage the strength of our City by harnessing its incredible
  gifts and entrepreneurism to create solutions that help solve LA’s chronic
  issues.  We all have an innate desire for community and naturally find it over
  a meal.  We will focus on this desire and enable the community to explore and
  use their talents to solve our City’s pressing issues.


  thecool will provide the fuel and environment for social entrepreneurs to
  flourish, where conversations lead to ideas that are then developed
  elsewhere.  We are venturing into uncharted territory by combining the
  gallery, the cocktail bar and the traditional tea-house into a curated
  environment that blends the strengths of these different domains into one
  cohesive, engaging experience.  thecool will ignite our dormant passion for
  raw childlike creativity and as a result, increase opportunities for people to
  connect on various ideas and topics.  thecool will drive more interest in the
  Arts as it becomes a platform for people to share their craft, whether it be
  performance or static works.  This will infuse inspiration, encouragement, and
  wonder into the community.  Artists can use the space as a tool to generate
  income, while locals can use it as a workshop to showcase and develop their
  artistry.  This dynamic use of the space will not only sustain those employed
  in creative industries, but also grow that number as people change careers to
  work on the creativity explored at thecool.


  thecool collaborates in an intentional way with socially conscious entities to
  help mobilize their mission, such as providing safe meeting grounds for inner
  city programs or leadership workshops within after school programs.  Our
  concept will serve as a new model to other communities that wish to engage its
  people more intimately, improve overall quality of life, and harness the
  collective talents to solve chronic issues.


  Many will be inspired and encouraged to act, as our neighbors expose their
  many hidden talents.  This will further expand our perspectives and abilities,
  as LA has one of the most diverse mix of people in the world.  We believe that
  more diversity will inspire guests to expose more of themselves that will then
  attract more diversity.  This type of integration will net infinite
  possibilities.


  Public spaces throughout history, particularly cafes, have been the birthplace
  and epicenter of movements.  We want to bring back that paradigm and be the
  catalyst for ideas, movements, dreams. Through our welcoming interactive
  space, game changing menu, and talent sharing, we’ll nurture authentic
  community to address a pressing need in an otherwise lonely city.
