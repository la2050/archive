  Coligo will help make LA the best place to connect by hosting novel engagement
  opportunities for nonprofit organizations and donors in the Los Angeles
  region.  

  Coligo is the future of social giving and engagement. Founded in 2016 by Los
  Angeles native, Danielle Wright, Coligo was created to change the face of
  charitable giving. Local corporations and philanthropists do not adequately
  and efficiently distribute their social responsibility funds to charitable
  organizations, primarily because they are not receiving a return on their
  investments. As a result, nonprofit organizations in Los Angeles are left with
  limited access to funding and resources, making them less sustainable and
  making it nearly impossible for them to produce the social impact they wish to
  achieve in the Los Angeles community.


  Coligo solves these issues by taking a strategic approach to donor beneficiary
  segmentation. Coligo adopts the viral content form of the most commonly used
  social media platforms to create the first social networking service for
  nonprofit organizations. Coligo fills a unique gap in the market by
  identifying a convenient and accessible way to strengthen beneficiary and
  donor relationship management and engagement in Los Angeles.
   
  Coligo has two key components: 1) connecting nonprofit organizations and
  donors in Los Angeles 2) to make Los Angeles the hub of community development.
   
  Coligo is the easiest way for nonprofits in the Los Angeles are to make
  impactful connections with local donors. Nonprofits and donors create user
  profiles. Basic information is gathered and the user's social graph is
  analyzed. Using the results of a simple search engine, the app groups
  nonprofits and donors into meaningful and measurable segments based on their
  preferences. Candidates who are most likely to be compatible based on the
  organization mission, population services, location served, demands and needs
  are then streamlined into a catalog of matches. Coligo allows users to
  anonymously “like” each or “pass.” If a nonprofit and donor “like” each other,
  they “match” and can connect, chat and exchange resources and funds.
   
  The second component of Coligo is to make Los Angeles the hub of social,
  environmental and community development. The heart of Coligo is to help
  underserved communities in need, tackle intractable issues that plague the
  community, and successfully implementing transformational change. Coligo will
  place Los Angeles at the forefront of implementing novel approaches to
  mobilizing the city’s human capital to create strategic connections that will
  achieve  social impact.
   
  Coligo stems from the Latin word coligatus, which means to unify, bind, and
  connect. Coligo will outlive its name as a cutting edge online community based
  platform that will plant the seed for social and environmental change. By
  creating engagement and strategic partnership opportunities for nonprofits and
  donors, Coligo will make Los Angeles the best place to make connections
  worthwhile.
