  For many students, the 9th grade is a really challenging year with new
  classmates, harder courses, more complex schedules, and higher teacher
  expectations. No wonder many students who don’t see themselves as successful
  learners think seriously about dropping out.  For LA to have a pipeline of
  well-prepared high school students who transition successfully into
  postsecondary education and 21st century careers, 9th grade students must
  stick it out. They must start by making it over the first hurdles: completing
  9th grade, not being held back, and showing up in the 10th grade. A critical
  part of 9th grade success hinges on students seeing the importance of school
  for their futures and having decent attendance. Why? We know that students who
  miss too much school also miss lots of important content, don’t turn in
  homework, and don’t complete in-class assignments.

  In this project, we define success in terms of how much students in these
  technology-enabled career exposure activities engage in school, how they
  connect school success to their future lives, and their belief that they will
  complete high school. We will use two information sources to measure these
  outcomes: student attendance and responses to in-class survey questions. Our
  specific success measures will be (1) numbers of days absent from school; and
  (2) answers to survey questions about completing high school, readiness to be
  successful in grade 10, and enthusiasm about preparing for postsecondary
  education and a career.

  Dropping out of school is a life-altering decision process that can start in
  middle school but picks up steam in grade 9. When students are not engaged in
  learning and cannot envision themselves in an exciting career, they see little
  reason to stay in school. A thriving and growing LA-region pipeline of
  students who succeed academically, aspire to postsecondary education or
  training, and want to engage in productive work demands significant career
  exposure that helps students create a vision for their own future.

  LA has an abundance of terrific career opportunities, but many of them are
  beyond the boundaries of students’ local communities or even their
  imaginations. To start addressing this problem, for the past 10 years,
  ConnectEd has supported  LAUSD in building pathways that give students an
  engaging,  college preparatory curriculum plus career exposure. LA students
  have accessed ConnectEd’s library of Day in the Life, career-themed videos,
  and teachers have used them and  many other resources to design content for
  academic and technical courses.  However, the number of career development
  experiences students can have in real workplace settings has been greatly
  limited by time, resources, and logistics. The integrated technology solution
  proposed here addresses this limitation by adding Nepris technology and
  resources to an existing, collaborative career development design process. It
  will be a vehicle for teachers, starting in grade 9, to facilitate an initial
  one (expert) to many (students) virtual career development experience based on
  the career theme of  their existing career pathway and the students’
  interests. Specifically, Nepris will match teacher requests to the skills of
  business/labor/and non-profit professionals and bring the right expert(s) into
  the classroom virtually to provide topic relevance, project mentoring, virtual
  tours of workplaces, opportunities for mock interviews, interactive Q&A
  sessions, and evaluation of students’ project work.

  The integrated product we are proposing offers a strong value proposition for
  students, teachers, LAUSD, and the community. A single tool will (1) offer
  relevant career-themed academic, technical, and career development curriculum,
  including a wide array of rich media resources; 2) provide a way for project
  leaders to manage connections between the district and industry, the
  community, non-profits, universities, and labor organizations; (2) increase
  opportunities for the employer community to engage easily with educators and
  students; and (3) enhance efforts by the district to capitalize on the equity
  and community commitments of professional organizations such as Women in
  Engineering, the Greater Los Angeles African American Chamber of Commerce, the
  Society of Hispanic Engineers, local arts organizations, and many others.
  Students from every corner of the region and background will have
  opportunities to learn about careers that have always been so near, and
  frequently so far.
