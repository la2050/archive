  As classroom teachers are the most important in-school factor in student
  achievement, our long-term goals are to elevate the quality and prestige of
  the teaching profession and to increase student engagement, achievement and
  college readiness. E4E-LA has established five intermediate-term goals that
  guide our programming:


  Build a movement of solutions-oriented teachers;

  Identify and train teachers to lead change in their schools, districts and
  union;

  Create teacher-developed policy recommendations;

  Advocate for teacher-developed recommendations; and

  Scale the model with training, partnerships and resources.


  We measure our success based on the following: 

  Expanding our membership by serving hundreds of additional teachers each year;

  Training dozens of additional teachers to take on leadership roles or actions
  on behalf of LA students;

  Elevating research and classroom expertise by publishing one teacher-created
  policy paper per year; and

  Making substantive policy changes by mobilizing our members to promote
  meaningful changes in policy and practice.


  We use the following mechanisms to measure progress:

  Tracking membership and leadership data through a robust Salesforce CRM;

  Surveying members, non-member teachers, partners, parents and students to
  inform our policy positions and papers;

  Tracking education policy issues, bills, resolutions and media; and

  Tracking the outputs and performance of our team against goals to inform
  training and course correction.

project_description: >-
  E4E-LA is building a movement of teachers to take action on behalf of student
  success. As our district responds to decades of demand for better public
  schools by trying to implement higher standards, healthier school climates,
  and improved rates of entry to colleges and careers, E4E-LA provides teachers
  with opportunities to learn about education policy, network with policy
  makers, and participate in leadership development and advocacy campaigns to
  make LA a great place to learn and teach.

  To help transform LAUSD into a great place to learn and teach, we are building
  a teacher-led movement for education equity. In doing so, we will continue
  training teachers to lead policy design, advocacy and implementation where
  critical decisions are made that affect teaching and learning--at their
  schools, unions, district and state. 


  Why are teachers a critical lever for educational equity? Teachers often bear
  witness to the problems and shortcomings of our education system. In addition
  to contending with persistent achievement gaps, our school system struggles to
  empower parents and teachers who are increasingly defecting from public
  education and the teaching profession. In LAUSD and California, student
  enrollment has declined by 2.6% annually since 2002, and enrollment in teacher
  preparation programs has decreased by 53% since 2009. The confluence of these
  and other alarming trends creates less funding and faith in our public schools
  and a looming teacher shortage estimated at 100,000 in the next decade.


  In the face of these challenges, teachers, parents and students intuitively
  know that a great teacher can change the trajectory of a student’s future. In
  fact, research shows that teachers are the most influential school-based
  factor determining student achievement. However, despite what research,
  parents and students already know, teacher voices are rarely included in
  education policy discussions. And as a result, teachers are often positioned
  as the subjects, not agents, of education reform. This leads to lower rates of
  engagement, morale and retention among teachers.


  We are helping teachers harness their passion for students and their
  frustration with “the system” into a movement for smarter, more equitable
  education policy. Five years into this work, we have inspired more than 4,500
  teachers to join our movement and hundreds to lead our policy and advocacy
  work, and they are focused on making LA a better place to learn and teach. Our
  teachers have already taken steps to influence and impact Common Core
  implementation and school climate, affecting outcome metrics such as: college
  matriculation rates, district-wide graduation rates, student education
  pipeline, students’ perceived sense of safety at and on the way to school and
  suspension and expulsion rates. 


  E4E-LA teachers have crafted research-based policy recommendations, testified
  before the LAUSD School Board, taken on formal leadership seats in their
  schools, district and union, written media and participated in coalitions with
  parent and youth organizations that have resulted in concrete changes to
  budget, support plans, staffing and accountability. Most importantly, our
  teachers have experienced improvements in the number of students we engage,
  graduate and send to college. While there is greater room for improvement in
  Los Angeles public education, our teachers are becoming part of the solution.
