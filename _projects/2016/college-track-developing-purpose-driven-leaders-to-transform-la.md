  College Track’s Dream LA project aims to 1) help students identify their
  dreams and passions, and 2) connect those interests in service to the LA
  community


  Success of the project will be measured by:

  -Number of students who participate in the Dream LA project (Goal is 400)

  -Percent of students who complete at least 25 hours of community service by
  the end of the 2016-17 school year (Goal is 90%)

  -Percent of students who report that they understand how a college degree will
  allow them to pursue their passions and purpose (Goal is 90%)


  Progress against these metrics is logged and evaluated via our Salesforce
  database. We also plan to gather qualitative data around the Dream LA project
  through surveys and one-on-one conversations with students and partner
  organizations.

  College Track will make LA the best place to learn by developing
  purpose-driven leaders of change through our Dream LA project, which provides
  students from low-income neighborhoods the opportunity to turn their passions
  into actions, engage in meaningful service projects, and make a positive
  impact in their communities.


  College Track deeply believes that every person has the potential to change
  the world. Our 10-year program is designed to make sure our students are given
  the opportunity to fulfill that potential through earning a four-year college
  degree. We empower our students to transcend the limits of their circumstance
  by providing the support that helps them to discover their dreams, build their
  academic skills, secure financial aid, and persist on the path to and through
  college. As a result, College Track alumni are 2.5 times more likely to
  graduate from a four-year university than their peers. Yet, the magnitude of
  what our students accomplish extends far beyond earning a degree. A college
  graduate is twice as likely to be employed and will earn nearly twice as much
  as a high school graduate. It’s not only the economic impact that’s real –
  it’s also the community impact. A college graduate is twice as likely as a
  high school graduate to participate in society as a volunteer and nearly twice
  as likely to vote.


  Success on the road to earning a college degree is not only about academic
  preparation. It is also highly dependent upon a student’s ability to develop a
  sense of purpose and GRIT – guts, resilience, integrity and tenacity. College
  Track believes that if students explore and articulate their dreams and
  purpose, they will develop stronger ownership over their own actions and
  outcomes, ultimately leading to success in college and beyond. 


  Through our Dream LA project, College Track will support 400 high school
  students from Boyle Heights and Watts to identify their dreams and passions,
  and then connect those interests in service to the LA community. Research
  shows that when students are engaged in service and community work, they make
  gains in measures of academic achievement, citizenship and character. Students
  will participate in curriculum developed by The Future Project related to
  exploring and identifying their dreams, culminating in a dream declaration.
  Driven by their own passions, students will then design and/or participate in
  community service projects, completing a minimum of 25 hours of service per
  year. 


  Service projects will allow students to explore leadership, activism,
  community development and entrepreneurship – creating networks and developing
  interests that propel them through college and beyond. Past projects include a
  book drive to promote early literacy in collaboration with the Boys & Girls
  Club and Project DAD, as well as a campaign around food sovereignty. This
  year, we anticipate that students will partner with at least 15 organizations
  across LA to transform their passions into positive impact
