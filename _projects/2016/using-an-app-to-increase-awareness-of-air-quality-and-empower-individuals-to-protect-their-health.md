  Using an app to increase awareness of air quality and empower individuals to
  protect their health
project_summary: >-
  AirForU is an air quality app that provides real-time air quality information
  and is also a research tool to reduce air pollution-related health impacts,
  particularly for vulnerable populations.

project_measure: >-
  A preliminary measure of success of this project is the number of app users. 
  Currently we have about 2400 users and we hope to at least double the number.
  We will not only consider the number of users that download the app but also
  the number of users that use the app regularly, which is a better measure of
  success. Through data analysis, we will also determine what types of people
  are using the app i.e. specifically vulnerable populations. 


  Another measure of success will be determined by collecting feedback from
  users through a survey to assess how they used this information to protect
  their health and/or their family’s health. 


  The data analysis will enable us to address gaps in research and this will be
  another measure of success for our project. We will able to study which
  populations are most/least engaged with this information and improve air
  quality communication for people that are poorly engaged but could greatly
  benefit from this information.

project_description: >-
  We designed and launched an air quality app (AirForU) for iPhones and Android
  phones a few months ago. AirForU is specifically geared towards populations
  that are vulnerable to air pollution and currently has over 2400 users. For
  this project, we are proposing to enhance the app technology, incorporate new
  research methods, recruit more users and analyze the data to develop more
  effective strategies for protecting the health of sensitive populations.

project_proposal_best_place: >-
  Los Angeles continues to have some of the most polluted air in the nation.
  Densely populated urban cities such as ours are particularly prone to high
  levels of air pollution.  Although everyone is affected by it, hundreds of
  thousands of people in LA such as asthmatics, young children, the elderly,
  pregnant women, people with heart disease, lung disease or compromised immune
  systems are particularly sensitive to the health hazards of air pollution.
  Reducing the health impacts of air pollution requires not just public policy,
  but also individual action. 


  To provide an interactive tool for Angelenos with easy access to air quality
  information, we developed and launched a free air quality app – AirForU – a
  few months ago for iPhones and Android phones. We use information from the
  Environmental Protection Agency’s air quality monitoring and reporting network
  and provide it on our app as real-time air quality updates and next-day
  forecasts. Through AirForU we make air pollution, often invisible, more
  visible. So far we have about 2400 users and we have received tremendous
  positive feedback from many of them.  By knowing when air pollutions levels
  are high based on real-time updates and next-day forecasts, app users are
  empowered to take measures to protect their health and their family’s health. 
  Parents/caretakers can decide what times are best to their children outdoors
  to play; particularly for asthmatic children. Those who exercise outdoors
  frequently can determine best times to exercise outdoors. 


  AirForU is also a research tool; we collect research data through surveys in
  the app and embedded analytics to understand who is using this information and
  how they are using it. Current research on air quality communication is still
  undeveloped and through our project we hope to address the some of the
  existing research gaps. Research data from app users will help determine how
  to further engage sensitive people with air quality information, use targeted
  messages and alerts for specific populations, and develop additional
  strategies to reduce the health impacts of air pollution.


  Through this proposal, we are planning to expand and improve our project by
  enhancing the app technology, incorporate new research methods, recruit more
  users and develop new strategies for protecting the health of sensitive
  populations. Our goal is to improve the communication of air quality
  information and associated health effects.
