  SBCC is partnered with the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs for
  evaluation, utilizing a tool known as the Protective Factors Survey. This tool
  measure gains in social and emotional support. SBCC will measure success
  utilizing the metrics set forth by LA2050’s Connect. They are:

  Government responsiveness to Residents’ Needs

  Co/Lab will be able to measure and convene both online and in-person forums to
  connect local political representatives with residents convening dialogues on
  neighborhood issues. We will be able to measure connection through
  participation and engagement in these dialogues. 





  Rates of Volunteerism 

  This metric will be measured through participation in NAC, CFSK and iHeart
  projects (i.e. cleanup events, senior center visits and tutoring/mentoring)
  and CFSK project. 


  Social Media Friends and Connections

  This metric will be measured utilizing Facebook and Twitter analytics that
  allow SBCC to monitor and track gains in connections (i.e. friends/followers)
  across LA County. Connections will also be measured through tracking
  engagement on the CFSK and SBCC’s website. We will also administer surveys
  online to track participants connection to their neighbors, resources and
  elected officials.  


  Voting Rates

  This metric will be measured through number of voter registration forms iHeart
  volunteers collect during voter registration drives.

  Low-income LA County residents are marginalized by top-down, “expert”
  consultants & institutionally-led programs. Traditional approaches to social
  services do not authentically connect & engage residents. Social service
  experts, practitioners and institutions design services & programs without the
  voices or lived experiences of real people. Evidence-based, best-practice
  models designed by people who do not live in the neighborhood lead to
  ineffective programs & services. Honoring the gifts, talents & capacity of
  residents allows them to be active agents of change.


  The problem of resident disempowerment & disengagement is widely recognized &
  there have been a number of attempts to solve it. However, existing
  initiatives to engage residents consists of focus groups or token
  representation on a variety of committees. 


  The solution: go connect directly with residents & co-create programs,
  strategies & initiatives that are resident-led. SBCC will achieve the goal of
  authentic resident participation through three strategies: Relationship-Based
  Community Organizing, Resident Co-creation & Resident-Driven Civic
  Engagement. 


  The first strategy is Relationship-Based Organizing (RBO). RBO’s approach is
  rooted in an asset-based perspective, focused on harnessing the skills &
  talents of residents. 10,000 residents have participated in neighborhood
  groups. This strategy includes SBCC’s network of Neighborhood Action Councils
  & Community Connection Groups— which connect residents through their talents,
  passions & the implementation of neighborhood projects. These social networks
  form the foundation for the other two strategies SBCC will utilize. 



  The second strategy is Resident Co-creation. Co-creation is an emerging
  approach to social innovation built on the Human Centered Design (HCD)
  movement built on the core value that the end user of any product, service or
  system should be empowered to create effective solutions. Co-creation in the
  social sector takes these core principles further and brings the best
  practices of HCD—end user research, systems, ideation and prototyping—directly
  to residents, empowering them to create solutions that reflect their lived
  reality.


  The third strategy is Resident-Driven Civic Engagement. This strategy empowers
  community residents to act in ways that address social issues in their
  neighborhoods such as public safety, voter registration & neighborhood
  revitalization. This strategy allows residents to hold local officials and
  institutions accountable. In practice, this strategy is the neighborhood-based
  iHeart campaigns currently deployed across Los Angeles County in : Wilmington,
  Carson, Hawthorne, the Antelope Valley, Compton, East LA, Watts, & San
  Fernando Valley. 


  In mobilizing these 3 strategies, Co/Lab will empower Angelenos across the
  county to be effective change agents. By placing Angelenos at the center of
  the solution design process, Co/Lab’s  approach will make LA a premier place
  to connect & live.
