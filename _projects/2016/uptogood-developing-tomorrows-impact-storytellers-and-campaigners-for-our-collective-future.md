  New Roads School and UPTOGOOD intend to: 

  1) Provide the LA community with proper education and tools to empower them to
  create effective social impact video content.

  2) Guide storytellers to execute successful social impact campaigns through
  the UPTOGOOD platform. 


  We will measure our success by doing the following:

  1) Monitor the number of students and community members who participate in our
  classes, workshops and festival 

  2) Analyze the quality of content and campaigns created using a grading rubric
  based on various social impact cinema criteria such as: ethos, transparency,
  etc.

  3) Measure impact stats on UPTOGOOD campaign page (FUNDit, SIGNit, PROMISEit
  SHAREit)

  4) Monitor the number of community members accessing and utilizing the shared
  UPTOGOOD Social Impact Studio space 

  5) Monitor UPTOGOOD website traffic 

  6) Work closely with educators (especially through New Roads) to support the
  integration of our curriculum into classrooms.

  7) Monitor partnerships manifested within campaigns with NGOs and other
  companies

  8) Analyze the number of internship opportunities created with local NGOs and
  employers

  9) Analyze student comfort: Are they going out and creating impact campaigns
  beyond their initial campaign?

  10) Monitor the number of student connections to higher learning educational
  institutions with a focus on impact production

  11) Continuously reflect on the goals and success rate of the partnership
  between New Roads School and UPTOGOOD

  At New Roads School we regard education as an active and ongoing quest to
  develop young people who thrive as they begin to take a larger role in making
  their communities and their world. Our commitment to this quest is manifested
  in the genuine diversity of our school community. We fully and intentionally
  reflect the mosaic of cultures, backgrounds, and beliefs that make up Los
  Angeles in the 21st century. With our open-minded philosophy and approach to
  creating this type of educational environment, we have developed a welcoming
  community in the Bergamot Creative Arts District of West Los Angeles. Our
  community continues to host local events, screenings, talks, protests, etc.
  Nearly 78 years ago, the Red Line Trolly ran from Los Angeles to Santa Monica
  Pier. After years of not having strong public access to our neighborhood, we
  are so grateful for the recent opening of the Expo Line. With this new change,
  we have been able to expand our community and provide greater opportunities to
  people from all over Los Angeles. As our community continues to grow, we hope
  our partnership with UPTOGOOD, will provide even more resources and
  opportunities.

  Hosting the UPTOGOOD Film Festival, will create a place for future impact
  storytellers from all over Los Angeles to partake in our workshops, screenings
  and networking events. We hope to provide a space where like-minded
  storytellers can come together and take advantage of what we present. We
  intend to publicly open the UPTOGOOD Social Impact Studio space on campus,
  especially providing youth without access to the necessary tools to bring
  their social impact videos up to a higher level of quality and production. The
  Metro will provide easy access for students all around Los Angeles. We will be
  able to further connect students and social impact storytellers with our
  community members. Pairing like-minded people will only create more positivity
  for our city and help to develop powerful stories that can be further shared. 


  We can really amplify the motives of LA2050's initiatives through our program
  and participants. We bear in mind, that Los Angeles is also an international
  hub, which brings in social justice figures, filmmakers and change-makers from
  around the world. In addition to providing a bridge to all communities in Los
  Angeles, we hope to attract international figures that visit Los Angeles and
  can provide an even broader, global connection that mimics the efforts we are
  making on a local-level.
