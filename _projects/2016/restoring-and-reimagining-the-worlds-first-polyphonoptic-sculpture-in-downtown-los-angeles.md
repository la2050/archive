  Restoring and reimagining the World's First 'Polyphonoptic' sculpture in
  downtown Los Angeles

  We are a coaltion of people dedicated to reimagining The Triforium,
  transforming it from a forgotten piece of public art to a dynamic,
  interactive, creative site for Angelenos of all ages.

project_summary: >-
  The Triforium is a piece of “polyphonoptic” public art in DTLA that was 40
  years ahead of its time; we want to restore and retrofit it to achieve the
  artist's dream of music, community, and wonder.

project_measure: >-
  Our baseline measure for success will be the basic restoration of the
  Triforium to its intended functionality: all 1,494 multicolored glass cubes
  cleaned and the incandescent bulbs within them replaced by LED bulbs, the 40
  year-old wiring updated to modern safety and efficiency standards, and the
  room-sized machinery at its feet replaced by a programmable computer networked
  to the bulbs and an updated instrument that aurally evokes the sculpture’s
  original 79-note glass bell carillon. With the free app that will allow the
  public to interface with this piece of public art, we can count downloads and
  active users per month. These are the quantifiable indices. 


  The real measure, however, will be on the ground in Fletcher-Bowron Square: if
  Angelenos begin to gather in this vastly underutilized public space during the
  day to play music together, and at night to see their music light up the heart
  of the city, we will know we have succeeded.

project_description: >-
  The Triforium is a six-story, 60-ton public artwork in Downtown Los Angeles.
  Its original design was for a polyphonoptic sculpture lighting up in synchrony
  to music and human movement. It was ahead of his time, and never worked as
  intended. We want to retrofit and reimagine the Triforium, replacing its
  incandescent bulbs with LEDs and a nimble computer system to achieve Joseph
  Young’s original goals. We want to create an app that'll allow people to
  create compositions for the Triforium to play.

  Imagine if you could control the individual street lights in Chris Burden’s
  “Urban Light.” Imagine they made music. How would that artwork, already such a
  magnet, inspire new forms of play? That’s what the Triforium could be: a place
  where people and technology meet to make music, light, and wonder.


  Joseph Young designed the Triforium as 'the Rosetta Stone of art and
  technology,” using motion sensors and a computer system to translate
  pedestrian footfall in the nearby LA Mall into patterns of light and sound
  displayed by prisms and the glass bell carillon, at the time the largest
  musical instrument in the world. It didn’t quite work out that way. 


  But time has caught up to Young’s vision: replaced with LED bulbs, the
  Triforium’s lights could last longer, burn brighter, and respond to an
  inexpensive computer system designed to invite musical interaction.
  Motion-sensitive components could allow pedestrians not only to look at the
  sculpture but to dance with it. 


  The interactive urban light is not only possible—it can move from the streets
  and into the pockets of Angelenos. Using a free Triforium app, Angelenos of
  all ages could create simple compositions and “play” the instrument in public
  space. This is interactivity as Joseph Young could never have imagined it. It
  is networked, creative, and will meet citizens where they are—between the
  digital and the physical, between the wide world and the city.


  Los Angeles is the most park-poor major city in America, and we need fully
  utilize what little open space we have in the city. The Triforium stands in
  the shadow of City Hall, a stone’s throw from Grand Park, in Fletcher-Bowron
  Square. Flanked by a bike lane and located near dozens of Downtown landmarks,
  it’s an underutilized public square with a history both inspiring and largely
  unknown by the public. 


  Restored to its intended grandeur, the Triforium can become an opportunity for
  pedestrians, downtown workers, tourists, children, artists, and commuters in
  Los Angeles to stop, play, and illuminate the city. It will encourage
  sustained collaborative play; the more people interact with the instrument,
  the more brightly it will shine.


  As Los Angeles’ historic Downtown finds itself at the center of massive civic
  reinvestment, we look to the Triforium restoration as a positive metaphor for
  the ways in which urban renewal can revitalize from the inside. By investing
  in the neglected infrastructures all around us, we honor and preserve the
  city’s rich history while weaving it seamlessly into the fabric of the future.
  The thousand-plus points of light radiating from the Triforium are reminders
  of all the Triforia everywhere—the faded municipal underpinnings in every city
  that we take for granted, and which with modest preservation can serve our
  cities in ways well beyond what their architects ever imagined. 


  We see the Triforium as a beacon. It’s been there all along. We just need to
  turn it on.
