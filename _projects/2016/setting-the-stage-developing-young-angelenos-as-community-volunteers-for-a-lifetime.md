  R&S measures impact by:

  • Surveying educators on their Roots & Shoots training and integration of
  Roots & Shoots in their curriculum

  • Surveying educators on their observations of the impact of Roots & Shoots on
  their students

  • Monitoring the number of educators completing the course and the number
  receiving CEUs for course completion

  • Monitoring the number of educators incorporating Roots & Shoots in their
  curriculum; the number of students mapping communities and the number
  completing service campaigns; and the number of service campaigns completed. 

  • Surveying NYLC members on a monthly basis to monitor the number of webinars
  completed with peer groups, the number of training sessions led, and the
  number of personal service campaigns completed. 


  Quantitative outcomes: 

  • 750 students will volunteer in their community through local service
  campaigns; 

  • 5 R&S peer groups will be established with the support of LA-based NYLC
  members; 

  • 25 cultural events will be held in schools and in the communities; and 

  • 5 exemplary youth will complete a one year term on the NYLC. 


  Qualitative outcomes for youth: 

  • Engage with their community

  • Have an increase in concern for their community

  • Increase leadership skills and feelings of personal and civic responsibility

  • Demonstrate compassion for people, animals and the environment

  • Demonstrate initiative and propensity for future responsible action

  • Demonstrate critical thinking and problem solving skills

  R&S will build upon its existing network in LA to connect young people to
  their communities by establishing strong networks that provide social and
  emotional support, implementing cultural community events, and increasing
  rates of volunteerism. The stage will be set for youth participants to serve
  as volunteers and leaders in their communities over the course of a lifetime.


  Fostering strong communities is vital to making LA one of the best places to
  live, work, and play by 2050 and rates of volunteerism are key to measure
  local investment in communities. R&S will engage school administrators,
  educators, and youth during and after school hours to develop a culture of
  service. Peer groups will be established that serve as strong social networks
  and result in increased social and emotional support from peers and community
  members. Projects will culminate in celebration of service events that convene
  the community to honor the volunteers and create an increased “sense of place”
  for young Angelenos. 


  LA educators will have access to an online professional development course in
  the R&S methodology. The course empowers educators to guide a youth group
  through the process of mapping communities using pen and paper or high tech
  mapping tools (e.g., Esri ArcGIS and Google MyMaps), identifying local issues
  through the mapping process, strategizing a plan of action, and implementing a
  service campaign. The curriculum, developed in collaboration with the Pearson
  Foundation, a global leader learning company, supports academic learning and
  development of critical thinking and interpersonal skills. It is Common Core
  compliant and fulfills 21st Century Learning Skills. It is expected that
  educators from at least 25 schools will complete the course and guide 750
  students through service campaigns.


  On campaign completion, each school will hold a celebration of service to
  convene participants with peers, families, educators, and community members to
  honor their hard work. At year end, R&S will hold a citywide celebration of
  service event to convene youth and their educators as well as representatives
  from community organizations and local government.  


  In the first quarter, R&S will work with educators to identify and recruit
  five students to serve on the National Youth Leadership Council (NYLC). These
  students, who model and inspire civic responsibility in their peers, will
  receive access to a national network of peers, benefit from training in topics
  such as community mapping, campaign planning, and fundraising, and attend a
  national summit of their peers. They will lead the process of implementing the
  citywide celebration of service and engage their peers via school visits and
  webinars year round.  


  Dr. Jane Goodall, a visionary scientist and legendary conservation hero,
  travels twice each year through the United States. If she holds a public
  lecture in LA, every effort will be made to extend an invitation to
  participating students and educators.
