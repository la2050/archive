Are any other organizations collaborating on this proposal?: ''
Please describe your project proposal.: >-
  The objectives of the EnCorps STEM Teachers: Translators of Math and Science
  in the Classroom are as follows:


  *Increase the number of qualified STEM teachers and tutors who serve high need
  public and charter schools in Southern California

  *Increase disadvantaged students' access to a first-rate STEM education that
  shows the real-world application of math and science

  *Increase under­represented populations in STEM professions
Which metrics will your proposal impact?​:
  - College completion
  - College matriculation rates
  - Student education pipeline
In what areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles
Describe in greater detail how your proposal will make LA the best place.: >-
  Enduring STEM achievement, access, and literacy gaps disproportionately limit
  low income, under-resourced, and minority student opportunities.


  STEM professionals, when thoroughly prepared, are uniquely positioned to
  meaningfully utilize their talent and real-world expertise as EnCorps STEM
  Teachers to deliver an authentic, rigorous, and relevant STEM education to the
  students who need it most.


  The EnCorps STEM Teachers Program recruits, selects, develops and supports the
  best and brightest STEM professionals and military veterans, as an innovative,
  long-term solution to the shortage of high quality, impactful educators for
  under-resourced students in high need communities.


  We envision a community where:

  •All children learn to become problem solvers, innovators and creators;

  •STEM professionals are regularly and actively engaged in public education;

  •Students see the real-world application of math and science and how these
  disciplines are essential to their future;

  •Underrepresented populations build a strong presence in STEM professions.


  We believe in the power of math and science to propel students, communities,
  our state and country forward in the 21st century.  EnCorps seeks to provide
  one third of California’s annual gap in supply of STEM Teachers to inspire
  these students, totaling 400 STEM expert teachers for 50,000 high need
  students by June 2020 to


  Cultivate the science, technology, engineering and mathematics talent for the
  1.5 million open jobs in STEM fields in California;

  Promote diversity in STEM fields by employing recruitment strategies that
  identify and champion women and minorities; and to 

  Ensure that participants develop into successful, long-term teachers in
  public schools in under-served communities.


  As evidence of EnCorps’ impact, EnCorps 2014 Fellow LaTeira Haynes was
  recently named Los Angeles Unified School District’s Rookie of the Year for
  her outstanding contributions to education. Dr. Haynes teaches Biology at
  Dymally High School, following a career in immunology. She was honored on
  August 13, 2016 at Dodger Stadium.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.​: "We will measure our success by surveying students, partner sites and EnCorps Fellows:\n\nStudents will agree that EnCorps Fellows made them:\n-More aware of STEM career opportunities 85%\n-More interested in STEM 80%\n-STEM grades Improved 70%\n-Understand relevance of STEM better 85%\n\nPlacement sites will agree that EnCorps Fellows:\n-Increase student excitement 90%\n-Increase student achievement 95%\n-Increase student understanding of real-world connections 90%\n-are as effective as other tutors 85%\n-make differentiation easier\t80%\n\nEnCorps Fellows will agree that:\n-they are satisfied with the EnCorps Fellowship 90%\n-they are satisfied with overall support 95%"
