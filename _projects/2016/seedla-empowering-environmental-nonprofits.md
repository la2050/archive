project_measure: >-
  SeedLA defines the success of our project based on the tangible environmental
  impacts our work has on Los Angeles. We will measure our success by tracking
  the number of hours donated and establishing custom metrics for each of our 12
  partner projects. The process outlined below is how the impact of our partner
  projects is tracked and measured.
   
  Prior to starting a project we will establish a statement of work with our
  partners outlining their expectations and goals. Each project manager is
  responsible for tracking the week to week progress towards these goal. An
  experienced senior advisor is dedicated to each team to provide advice and
  oversee quality control.
   
  After the completion of the midterm and final deliverables, the SeedLA chapter
  president will check in with each partner to ensure projects are on track and
  exceeding expectations. Once the project has ended the president will follow
  up 4-6 months later to determine the tangible impact resulting from the
  project. This is how we ultimately define the success of our project. At
  SeedLA we serve to make an impact, not a report.

  SeedLA will make Los Angeles the best place to LIVE by enhancing the impact of
  local environmental nonprofits and fostering the next generation of
  sustainable leaders.


  As Los Angeles progresses towards a more sustainable future, environmental
  nonprofit organizations will continue to play an integral part in pioneering a
  healthier and more sustainable Los Angeles. Unfortunately, many of these
  organizations operate within a resource limited sector. Only 3% of all
  charitable giving in 2015 went towards environmental causes. SeedLA solves
  this gap by pairing LA’s most influential environmental organizations with our
  best and brightest young minds to collectively solve local environmental
  challenges. 


  HIGH IMPACT PROJECTS


  Over the next year, SeedLA will host 12 projects with environmental nonprofits
  working on local sustainability initiatives that directly support the
  advancement of LA 2050’s LIVE metrics. Each of our dedicated project teams
  will donate a total of 400 hours over a 10 week period. The best way to
  understand what each project will do, is to take a look at what we have
  already done:


  - Developed marketing strategies for Prop 67 (Plastic Bag Ban) with The
  Surfrider Foundation.

  - Planned the transition of 1,200 City of Los Angeles vehicles from gas to
  electric

  - Created the first draft of LA’s ‘Building Resilience’ guide with the US
  Green Building Council


  Our consultants stem from a wide range of industries and academic disciplines
  (Caltech Astrophysics PhDs, SpaceX Engineers, and Fox marketing analysts) to
  offer unique perspectives on solving LA’s toughest environmental issues. We
  believe our consultant diversity not only provides more valuable support to
  our partners but also develops sustainability ambassadors across every
  industry. 


  TOMORROW'S ENVIRONMENTAL LEADERS


  SeedLA provides an engaging volunteer opportunity for Angelenos who want to
  leverage their academic and industry experiences for environmental causes.
  Each member gets an intimate understanding about a particular environmental
  issue, feels a deep connection to the city of Los Angeles, and serves to make
  a tangible impact on his or her community. 


  In order to meet LA 2050 goals, our generation has an obligation to transition
  our existing economy into one that can sustain itself over the coming decades.
  That change will not happen by accident. We need leaders throughout the
  economy who will advocate for the LA 2050 we envision. We view SeedLA as an
  incubator that transforms LA’s high achieving outliers into those
  environmentally conscious leaders. Ultimately, SeedLA makes LA the best place
  to live by fostering a stronger culture of sustainability and strengthening
  our environmental organizations.
