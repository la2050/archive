  Community Healing Gardens aims to build a sustainable community garden in
  Watts.  To measure our success, we will base it on the following metrics:

  *Amount of food grown that is provided to the community and sold through the
  market, track by weight and distribution.

  *Number of students participating in classes or after-school programs held in
  the garden.

  *Number of teachers involved with the garden.

  *Number of local citizens volunteering in the garden.

  *Number of jobs created and people employed by the garden

  *Amount of product and revenue generated by sales of produce and products made
  from the garden resources (oils, herb boxes, etc.)

  Community Healing Gardens will make LA the best place to LIVE by building a
  sustainable, thriving production farm for the school and community in Watts. 


  We believe every empty patch of soil has the potential to feed and educate
  people about nutrition, sustainability, connection, art, community and love.


  The Watts Healing Garden at Markham Middle School is a three-year project plan
  by Community Healing Gardens with a goal of building a self-sustaining
  business for the community. Our vision is to create a “blueprint” for building
  a successful community garden that we can duplicate within other underserved
  communities and schools all over Los Angeles.  


  Why Watts?  Known as the “Food Desert” of Los Angeles, Watts is an underserved
  neighborhood located in the streets of South Central Los Angeles. This 2.12
  miles wide neighborhood is a dense pocket of crime, poverty and gangs with
  very limited access to healthy food choices for low-income children and their
  families. The rate of diseases including heart disease, diabetes, hypertension
  and obesity are prevalent in the community. Also, South LA neighborhoods like
  Watts, have some of the highest pollution rates in the state. 


  A vital component of the plan is the partnerships we are forming with key
  stakeholders in the community including: Cedar Sinai’s Coach for Kids, Boy’s &
  Girls Club After School Program, Watts Healthy Farmers Market, I (Heart)
  Watts, Watts Neighborhood Council, Locol (Roy Choi’s new local restaurant) and
  the Watts Gang Task Force.


  Thi summer, we launched the pilot stages of the garden, including 25+ food
  producing trees and 15+ rows of food built with kids from the summer school
  programs in the garden.  This fall, two school programs, the Pre-Med and MESA
  Program (STEM), will be using the garden as a “Learning Space’ for classrooms.
  Additional gardening programs will be launched in early 2017 in partnership
  with the school.


  Year two plans include installing Sky Water, a water system and technology
  game changer creating water made from air that produces over 300 gallons of
  water per day. This system will rely solely on solar energy and supply the
  much-needed access to clean, healthy water. The results will include a much
  higher rate of food production and increase jobs opporunities as well.


  The Watts Healing Garden will grow healthy food, create jobs, improve the
  local environment, grow future farmers from the school, and develop a more
  inclusive local economy in Watts and the surrounding South Central Los Angeles
  area.  Community Healing Gardens will take this “blueprint” and grow it in
  other underserved schools and communities in Los Angeles. This will make LA
  the best place to LIVE!
