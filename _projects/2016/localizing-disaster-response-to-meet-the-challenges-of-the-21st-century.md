  Team Rubicon's vision of making Los Angeles a community better prepared for
  disasters will require working with city and county Emergency Response Teams.
project_measure: >-
  A BRU's volunteer numbers are driven by a set of ratios applied to a city's
  population.  A city of any size is considered to have met its Basic Readiness
  Standard if it has a single functional BRU.  One basic readiness unit consists
  of 100 registered TR volunteers, 25 of which are deployable, 8 of which have
  completed Tools, Tactics and Techniques Training, and 3 of which have
  completed Command and General staff training.  The Basic Readiness Standard is
  not intended to be able to meet the response needs of an overwhelming event in
  LA, but rather contribute to small-scale operations and plan and execute
  impactful projects. 


  An Advanced Readiness Standard is achieved when TR's volunteer density in a
  city regressively scales to approximately one BRU per 100K residents.  At an
  Advanced Readiness Level, Team Rubicon is capable of delivering meaningful
  assistance to the municipality during Type 1 and 2 level responses.  For Los
  Angeles, that would require 22 BRUs.

  Spending money on resiliency and readiness saves money.  An organized, trained
  and equipped Team Rubicon will help stabilize LA once disaster hits, allowing
  municipal and emergency services to perform core functions enabling them to
  focus on getting residents back to normal life as quickly as possible.  By
  leveraging the skills of veterans, TR is preparing for and responding to
  disasters as well as providing purpose, community and identity to our nation's
  veteran's, easing their transition home.

  Cities' ability to respond to our rapidly changing climate and the changing
  nature, magnitude and quantity of natural disasters in general is
  insufficient.  People, property and local economies are being disrupted and
  undermined at an alarming pace, and financial resources for disaster response
  are stretched thin at county, state, national and charitable levels.  That
  said, new thinking and programming suggests that a gap between a disaster
  striking and the first response can be mitigated in ways that save lives, and
  help restore communities and economies faster in ways that save billions.


  Since our founding in 2010 Team Rubicon has responded to disasters both
  domestic and international ranging in size from Hurricane Sandy (with more
  than 450 volunteers over six weeks) to a flood recovery operation in Iowa (ten
  volunteers for one week), and the earthquake in Nepal (60 volunteers).  Early
  on, Team Rubicon made the decision to become fully compliant in National
  Incident Management Systems (NIMS), making it fully interoperable with
  Federal, State and Local emergency services.  


  Imagine as families scramble to save their loved ones, their property, and
  their livelihoods, that teams of local Angelenos who are trained in disaster
  response mobilize immediately to support their communities.  Imagine that work
  is already underway and that these local relief agents are local Los Angeles
  veterans.  Men and women trained for exactly this type of uncertainty and
  confusion from their days serving our country.  


  Based on our experience during the past six years responding to over 140
  disasters, Team Rubicon is launching our community resilience program which
  consists of veteran-led relief teams who can respond immediately to natural
  disaster should one strike Los Angeles; the teams will show through action,
  how an immediate, local response complemented eventually by external disaster
  support can more effectively save lives, protect property and restore
  economies more rapidly than traditional relief modalities; and ensure that
  post-disaster response work continues long after media attention and external
  relief agencies deploy to other crises helping to fully rebuild Los Angeles
  neighborhoods.  This will be achieved through the creation of a Basic
  Readiness Unit (BRU), a discrete capability level achieved within a single
  city limit.  


  The Los Angeles Basic Readiness Unit is comprised of trained local community
  volunteers ready to intervene as a natural disaster strikes, with the number
  of responders calculated based on the size of Los Angeles and geographically
  allocated throughout the city to ensure no one is left behind as the disaster
  unfolds; that basic needs are met; coordinate access to leadership at national
  level to ensure national relief resources are deployed most effectively and
  efficiently when available; and ensure the ability to monitor response,
  recovery and rebuilding efforts in ways external agencies simply cannot mimic.
