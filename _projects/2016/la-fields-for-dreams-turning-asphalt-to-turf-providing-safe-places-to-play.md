title: LA Fields for Dreams - Turning Asphalt to Turf (providing safe places to play)
project_summary: >-
  Turning school playgrounds from black top to green turf to provide a safe
  surface for children to experience team sports without the fear of injury.

  Evaluation plans: 

  ASLA plans to work with current partner, LAUSD, to devise an appropriate
  evaluation plan. Proposed measurements include: school enrollment and school
  choice data, playground injury frequency, ASLA program enrollment and
  waitlist, and key informant interviews pre and post field creation. ASLA also
  plans to partner with local universities to recruit interns to assist with
  data collection. Anecdotal observations from staff at ASBA’s Field of Dreams
  school sites suggest that there is an association between improved aesthetics
  and reduced crime. For example, the staff has observed that by repairing a
  decrepit blacktop and replacing it with a brand new turf field embossed with
  the school logos has resulted in a decrease in graffiti and a reduction in
  equipment theft. This suggests that it is worth exploring appropriate
  measurements to examine the relationship between the installation of fields
  and decreased vandalism and petty theft at both the sites and environs.


  Long term outcomes:

  The Fields for Dreams initiative links community development with youth
  development. The creation of green spaces for the entire school and
  neighborhood promotes physical activity, sports programs, and community
  gatherings. These 3 new fields will provide ASLA with dedicated and safe
  spaces to operate camps and other youth development activities for years to
  come, while also providing a gathering place for community members of all
  ages.

  The sad reality is that children in low-income public schools spend most of
  their recreation time on unsafe and unsightly asphalt playgrounds. Skinned
  knees and injuries are all too common. And many children, particularly girls,
  rarely participate at all. ASLA's vision for Los Angeles is for all children
  to have access to high-quality sports and enrichment programs and safe places
  to play regardless of families’ income levels.

  We would like to replicate the successful model created by America SCORES Bay
  Area (ASBA) and bring the Fields for Dreams initiative to Los Angeles.


  Need: Currently, low-income neighborhoods in Los Angeles lack safe spaces for
  children and families to gather and engage in physical activity and play. The
  actual or perceived safety of the environment is linked with an individual’s
  inclination to engage in physical activity and play. Crime and fear of crime
  are also barriers to physical activity and play. These barriers are further
  amplified when examining how they impact the behaviors of children and youth.
  “Safety concerns play an important role in how people respond to the built
  environment, with perception and fear of crime an important contributor to
  inactivity. Signs of disorderliness, such as broken windows, cue children to
  feel unsafe at school. Children of parents who report anxiety about
  neighborhood safety get less physical activity.”1 


  The creation of safe turf play spaces where there is currently asphalt will
  change the built environment of underserved LA neighborhoods and increase
  physical activity of its residents, thus reducing the risk among adults to
  develop chronic diseases like heart disease and type II diabetes while
  reducing the risk in children to become overweight and/or obese. In addition,
  safe places to gather and play, build connection community and increase the
  social capital of neighborhood residents.2
