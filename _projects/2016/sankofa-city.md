title: Sankofa City
project_summary: >-
  Sankofa City will explore the nexus of emerging technology, art, and
  community-based urban design, to provide visions for the future of local
  innovation and cultural development in Los Angeles.

  The level of success is determined by 1.) community input, 2.) complexity of
  our final design videos and prototypes, and the 3.) public impact. 


  Community Input: The goal of the workshop series is to visualize local
  residents’ desires and concepts for the future. It is a collaborative process
  that requires a deep conversation in co-designing future urban-based
  technologies or urban plans. Our success is determined by our ability to
  retain volunteer participants and engage them in compelling and creative
  ways. 

  Design Complexity: The power of design is its ability to say complex things in
  simple ways. Our final design videos will be short, but need to present a
  holistic image of everyday life in our urban future. The videos must be able
  to present urban forms, technological interfaces, and civic activity in a
  compelling way. Our prototypes and final autonomous car design will also give
  concrete form to our provocative visions. 

  Public Impact: The final goal of our workshops and our videos is to provoke
  public conversations. By creating videos, we’re able to present an accessible
  and naturalistic portrayal of a potential future. These portrayals can be
  screened and discussed locally, as well as shared online. The amount of
  widespread discussion or larger community feedback will prove the relevance of
  our urban model and solutions.

project_description: >-
  The advent of new urban-based technologies means that the future form of Los
  Angeles will be unlike anything one can now imagine.  For example, how might
  self-driving vehicles and augmented reality be used to change our relationship
  to the city - to even change the city itself? We will conduct a series of
  collaborative workshops with artists, students, technical experts, and local
  Leimert Park residents, to create vivid scenarios of the possibilities to
  share with the public and spark debate.

  The future of LA depends on collaboration. “Sankofa City” proves that large
  research universities, nonprofits, and local communities can work together to
  empower local citizens to imagine alternative urban technologies that work for
  the public good. Technologists and students will work in groups with local
  visual artists, musicians, and residents to design urban prototypes, stories,
  and videos about the future of Leimert Park and South LA. 


  For example, a video would show the power of autonomous vehicles, equipped
  with augmented reality windows, to give interactive history tours. As the
  vehicle drives through the neighborhood, passengers would see overlaid
  archival footage or holographic reenactments of jazz greats and past
  residents, like Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, and Ray Charles.
  Multi-channeled audio speakers in the vehicle would immerse the passengers in
  the intoxicating sounds of these local Leimert legends, bringing history to
  life.


  Further scenarios may include paratransit vehicles for the elderly or
  disabled, self-driving karaoke booths, or playful immersive games for children
  and families. But we’re not just looking at transportation and UX/UI. We’re
  also exploring issues of sustainable gardening and local economies. Our
  workshops are holistic and collaborative across a range of stakeholders and
  participants, combining elements of cinema, design, urban planning,
  architecture, and community arts. These workshops build on a four year
  collaboration called the Leimert Phone Company, a design collective with USC
  and Ben Caldwell’s Kaos Network. For the past 30 years, Kaos Network has been
  a space for music, arts, and digital technologies in Leimert Park. 


  We’ll also be working with Urban Systems Laboratories, a nonprofit
  infrastructure systems company with significant expertise in the emerging
  field of autonomous transportation. They've been working with the community to
  envision a number of autonomous low speed vehicle applications to enhance the
  safety, everyday life, and economic well-being of the community. A key aspect
  of their philosophy is to include the community itself in the process to
  develop advanced technologies. For this project, they will engage with
  community members to design low-cost vehicles and develop a plan for their
  local manufacture. Along with Kaos Network and AIL, Urban Systems will staff a
  community workspace for the purpose, providing a full-scale vehicle mockup and
  producing an accurate scale model for use in presentations and manufacturing
  studies.


  The full-scale vehicle and other prototypes will be central to the videos to
  show real solutions for integrating new urban technologies. The videos
  encapsulate complex concepts and multithreaded scenarios, allowing us to
  crisply convey community-generated visions. Our final videos will be presented
  to the community, exhibited publicly, and shared online to deepen
  conversations about future alternatives for local innovation and everyday
  technologies.
