  The Center for Nonprofit Management aims to: 1) provide networking and
  collaborative opportunities for nonprofit leaders and social innovators across
  Los Angeles; and 2) provide peer emotional and professional support by
  incubating new venture partnerships through small group sessions.  

  We will evaluate the program’s success based on the following:

  1. The number of participants who have not participated in such a convening
  before and found it valuable to their operations; 

  2. The number of new collaborations that emerge after the program is
  completed, and what those collaborations look like; and, 

  3. Qualitative evaluation results that show how the small peer groups helped
  provide peer support.

  Specific questions to be asked include:

  * Did you develop strategic partnerships to advance the work of your
  organization?

  * Did you obtain support and wisdom from peers or a network?

  * Number of organizations and/or innovators who you plan to work with now or
  in the future 

  * Number of times your small peer group met and schedule of future meetings


  We will conduct pre and post program surveys before and after the program to
  determine effectiveness of the large scale convenings and the small group
  incubator component.  We will also measure our success in facilitating new
  partnerships and collaborations between the participants.

  Last spring, researchers at UCLA announced that giving in LA is down $1
  billion a year.  That shocking finding means that annual galas and golf
  tournaments are great but given the distress across our community, it isn’t
  enough. So, in the words of frustrated partners, “it’s time to talk.”  SPARK!:
  CONNECT-CONVENE-COLLABORATE will bring together leaders and innovators from
  all sectors across LA to provide peer support and promote new collaborations
  to solve LA’s biggest problems.

  As the leading nonprofit convener in Southern California, the Center for
  Nonprofit Management has over 35 years of experience working to assist
  nonprofit leaders, staff, and board members striving to achieve their
  missions.  SPARK!: Convene-Connect-Collaborate aims to increase the level of
  collaboration and peer support for a diverse group of public, private and
  nonprofit innovators operating in LA County.  By fostering a culture of
  connectivity within and outside of the nonprofit sector, LA can build its
  reputation of interconnectedness that best serves the residents of our city.
  This program will encourage new connections among nonprofit leaders to provide
  the social and emotional support they need in their high-stress roles through
  peer support programming, and expand their access to others in the social
  sector, not just the nonprofit world, who are working to make positive change
  in new and innovative ways.  We aim to expose leaders to new ways of sharing
  resources and ideas that can benefit everyone they serve.   The result is an
  increased positive and long-term impact that each organization can make in our
  community.

  SPARK!: Convene-Connect-Collaborate is a two pronged program: First, we will
  bring together nonprofit leaders and innovative thinkers and doers from other
  sectors by hosting three large events.  We will invite nonprofit leaders to
  participate by accessing our vast network of nonprofit partners. They will in
  turn invite someone they think is doing interesting work – either from the
  nonprofit, corporate or public sector.  The events will be designed as a forum
  to connect: sharing ideas for creating social change, triggering new thinking
  and perspectives, and encouraging continued collaboration among the leaders.
  CNM will facilitate these three interactive events over the course of 9
  months, leading participants through the strategies, methods, and practical
  tools for effective and productive community partnerships. 

  For the second prong, CNM will build upon the connections that were made
  during the large scale events and incubate new cross-sectoral partnerships. 
  By incubating new ideas and providing an environment for people to talk on a
  regular basis, we will promote long lasting partnerships that ultimately serve
  to improve services for those in need across LA.   Small groups of
  participants will commit to meeting every other week and each group will set
  the agenda for the calls.  CNM will facilitate these meetings and ensure that
  participants are getting the peer support and follow through that they need to
  be successful.  Our goal is that these working groups will get people to talk
  about how to resolve some of the most pressing issues Los Angeles is facing,
  and continue to meet long after the grant is completed.
