  GRID Logistics are proposers of a design build maintain and operate
  transportation infrastructure for containerized goods movement. GRID markets
  are the world's leading container trading gateways.

  GRID's Project proposal begins with the need for an independent evaluation of
  the GRID Project, ideally from regional stakeholders in the form of political,
  business, labor, environmental, and social justice quarters.  GRID seeks
  support through its affiliation with the Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator and
  its surrounding community stakeholders to include education, and neighborhood
  councils.

  collaborating with the GRID Project since mid 2013.

  GRID has already succeeded claiming its proper place in Greater LA's history
  as 'The' Pioneer in regional holistic 'Cleantech' solution RE: the container
  supply chain in this 21st Century. GRID first presented its vision project at
  the Transportation & Infrastructure Convention in Washington D.C. in early
  2011. In late 2011, GRID was the very 1st transportation mega-infrastructure
  proposal to be given a resolution for support by Sierra Club.  In 2012, GRID
  was rejected by PortTechLA for membership & also rejected from the newly
  opened LA Cleantech Incubator (LACI). So GRID moved on & was joined in support
  by LIUNA the LA/OC Building Trades, the International Brotherhood of TEAMSTERS
  & the Equipment Operators Unions. In mid-2013, GRID re-applied to LACI & was
  accepted. GRID's next goal was to obtain an independent evalution of GRID's
  viability & received assistance from California University of Northridge
  School of Engineering who assisted GRID to submit a grant application for
  Transportation Infrastructure Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER). GRID
  succeeded in receiving letters of support from key elected officials to
  include members of congress Janice Hahn, Adam Schiff, and CA Pro Tem Senator
  Kevin De Leon.  Unfortunately, the GRID study failed to win the grant lacking
  local support. At this time GRID's success can only be measured by the
  resistance GRID has experienced from entrenched interests. Without independent
  evaluation success to build is TBD.

  Once the envisioned GRID infrastructure becomes operational, the most visually
  and physically impacting characteristic to the citizens of Greater Los Angeles
  will be the immediate reduction of trucks travelling to and from the Ports of
  Los Angeles and Long Beach.  These impacts will mostly be felt on freeway
  networks directly north and northeast of the ports. The most non-visual impact
  will be the privately financed contribution to building transportation
  infrastructure (estimated at $18B) that will create 10's of thousands of jobs,
  primarily jobs in the fields of construction and alternative energy
  infrastructure. We apply jobs created as a CONNECT LA benefit because GRID's
  proposed infrastructure are within the very neighborhoods we hope to grow
  jobs; adjacent to workers reducing commuting times required to travelling to
  and from work. But it's the byproducts of the GRID Project that will have the
  most impact to CONNECT LA.  For historical reference, in 1984, Mayor Tom
  Bradley and Olympic Games chief Peter Ueberroth forged an agreement to suspend
  deliveries of containers on trucks travelling to and from the Ports of LA and
  Long Beach. The move was a success and the 'LA Traffic Miracle' reported to
  have reduced LA's freeway traffic congestion by over 50%. The advent of
  freight pipelines is envisioned to become the 2nd iteration of freeway rights
  of way to increase efficient traffic flow for the Greater Los Angeles
  mega-region. However, freight pipelines with not have the impact freeway
  construction has had over the last 70 years. Natural effects of efficiency for
  freight transportation are anticipated to greatly  enhance other aspects of
  our regional transportation transportation networks (i.e. cars, bike lanes,
  walkways).  GRID proposers anticipate this new iteration of urban
  transportation (controlling truck populations) will have significant knock on
  effects to the point that more pipelines routes will developed. Motivations
  will be concession revenues, carbon tax credit opportunities, continued
  support from environmental, social justice groups and labor unions, and
  business interests primarily from the construction and renewable energy
  sector.
