  Our goals for this program are:


  1. To digitize our existing analog collection of vintage and contemporary
  stereoscopic images and videos, and to format that content for presentation
  via the internet and via 3-D virtual reality viewers.


  2. To conduct a series of classes, workshops and presentations which will
  utilize the digitized media to teach the history of 3-D image creation, the
  science behind stereoscopic imaging, and the techniques and methods of 3-D
  content creation.


  3. To have our students successfully create their own 3-D content in various
  media - still photography, video, and virtual reality, and to present that
  content to the community via the internet and at public events.


  Our work will be directly evaluated by the public who engage in our
  activities. The people who attend our classes, workshops and presentations
  will be given the opportunity to provide feedback that will be used to shape
  future programs.


  The many works and media created by our students will be exhibited in various
  public venues including art galleries, film festivals, and online via 3-D and
  VR video streaming, where the Los Angeles community at large will be able to
  see, experience, and comment.


  Our internal evaluation will be based on measuring levels of continuing
  engagement with the public, growth of class and workshop sizes, attendance
  numbers at our events, and public demand for increased activities.

  3-D SPACE will implement an ongoing program of public presentations, classes
  and workshops in stereoscopic 3-D history and content creation, from 3-D
  photography and filmmaking to immersive virtual reality. These programs will
  include outreach to LA's underserved communities, and also specialized
  educational initiatives for LA's creative youth and senior populations.

  Our goals are to celebrate the work of many talented artists, photographers
  and filmmakers who have used the medium of 3-D as their creative tool, and to
  educate the public on the art and science of stereography, from it's analog
  beginnings in the 1830s to the immersive digital realms of the future.


  The grant funds will be used for the purchase of still and video camera
  equipment and PC computers to be used directly by the students in our
  workshops to create and develop their own 3-D images and content. Funds will
  also be used to purchase the cell phones and virtual reality viewers used to
  show the created content for use in classes, public presentations, and events.
  And grant money will be used to fund the actual costs of these classes,
  including facility and equipment rentals, advertising and promotion, and
  additional outreach opportunities.


  The classes, workshops, and presentations will be open to all residents of the
  greater Los Angeles region, and specific classes and workshops will focus on
  3-D arts and history education for youth, adult, and senior populations. The
  digitized archival media will be made available both to the students enrolled
  in these classes, and online in order to reach a broad local population. The
  creative 3-D media created by the students in these classes will be presented
  at public events throughout Los Angeles, and will also be made available
  online in order to reach a broad local population.


  Research has shown that students who study STEM (science, technology,
  engineering and math) become better problem solvers, innovators, inventors and
  logical thinkers. Studies also show that Students who study the arts are more
  likely to be academic achievers with strong skills in creativity and
  innovation, critical thinking and problem solving, and communication and
  collaboration. Arts specific education is on the decline, but arts conected to
  STEM (STEAM) through mutually-reinforcing objectives deepens learning in both
  areas.


  The proposed plan can be scaled to include increased frequency and
  availability of presentations, classes and workshops citywide and countywide
  in order to provide creative opportunities to larger portions of the
  community. Specific topics and techniques can be expanded upon and programs
  can be individually tailored to meet the needs of specific populations. Our
  programs will also be able to supplement a broader STEAM curriculum in
  partnership with other arts and science organizations.


  Our initiative will provide a contextual and factual foundation for an
  increase in the creation and use of 3-D content by the Los Angeles population.
  Our target populations will gain exposure to current digital technologies
  while learning the analog history of the medium. This knowledge will benefit
  the growing numbers of LA residents who will pursue careers in the numerous
  fields that are rapidly implementing 3-D imagery, including entertainment,
  medicine, design, and education.
