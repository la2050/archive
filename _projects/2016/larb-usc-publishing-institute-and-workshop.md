project_measure: >-
  Four basic metrics: (1) filling the 100 available seats in the program by year
  three, (2) raising the $375,000 to provide full fellowships for half those
  seats by year three, (3) accomplishing a 100% placement rate for people who go
  through the program, starting immediately in year one, and (4) monitoring the
  platforms, start-ups, and projects launched in our incubator as they become
  successful companies and employers in their own right. Our pilot versions of
  this program have been successful in placing people in publishing companies
  across the country and locally, so we already have a track record. And we
  already have 20 applicants in the pipeline before our first marketing push
  this year, so we know we can fill at leas half the seats and provide half of
  them with fellowships the first year.


  In time, of course, we hope that LA will replace New York as the publishing
  capital of the country!


  We will also measure our success by the number and breadth of applications we
  receive. People just graduating with an associate or bachelor degree,
  postgraduate students and PhDs looking for alternatives to academic careers,
  mid-career professionals looking to move into a new field or move up in their
  chosen profession, entrepreneurs looking to learn what they need to know to
  launch projects successfully, people who have known all their lives they
  wanted to pursue a publishing career and those who had never realized this
  path was open to them: we want to serve all.

  people in the country. The LARB/USC Publishing Workshop will change that by
  raising funds to provide access to top-flight, innovative, hands-on experience
  & networking for people whatever their background or means. The Workshop is
  designed to diversify the pipeline, to recruit people & give them access to
  the tools & to the people they need to know to take their place in & help
  create the publishing industry of the future.

  Los Angeles has never had a program like this, a program that can make the
  publishing world as accessible to LA residents as it has long been to people
  living in New York. The LARB/USC Publishing Workshop will not only benefit
  people who already live in Los Angeles, but will make LA a destination for
  people eager to be part of this rapidly evolving (and in Los Angeles rapidly
  growing) set of professions. Alongside many digital ventures (from programs
  like USC's new Iovine and Young Academy, institutes and programs for digital
  culture at USC and UCLA, work at CalArts and the other innovative art schools,
  and within the growing high tech industry), LA Review of Books is doing its
  part to help establish Los Angeles as a hub for digital culture. 


  This intensive summer program will provide a kind of training that has never
  before been part of our cityâ€™s offerings and foster an industry that is vital
  to a thriving, intellectual civic life. Once the summer Publishing Workshop is
  established, we plan to offer weekend and evening sessions year-round to give
  people a chance to learn specific aspects of the industry and specific skills,
  from basic editing to coding to business practices. LA has long been a great
  place to learn writing, and a great place to learn all aspects of other
  culture industries: film, theater, music, art, dance. But until now there were
  no intensive programs in Southern California preparing people to enter the
  publishing world. Every year new publishers spring up in the city and the
  county, and we will help train the people for them and for publishing outlets
  in New York and across the country. 


  The program has two defining characteristics, beyond its diversity, that will
  help make it stand out and give its graduates a leg up: (1) it is dedicated to
  exploring, with the best professionals and thinkers, the future of publishing,
  as well as its current practices, priming our graduates to be in the forefront
  of a quickly evolving industry, and (2) it gives people practical training in;
  the participants leave the program having built and published a magazine or
  website, or having developed a detailed business plan or product design
  agenda. This combination of a diverse cohort, an innovative faculty, and
  hands-on experience will make the people who attend highly marketable, and our
  staff will work with to achieve a 100% placement rate.


  Faculty and speakers include Tom Lutz (LARB), Davan Maharaj (LA Times), Cory
  Doctorow (EFF), Bob Stein (IFB), Henry Jenkins (USC), Jill Bialosky (Norton),
  Luis Rodriguez (Tia Chucha Press), Jeffrey Cole (USC), Dennis Johnson
  (Melville House), Joel Goldberg (Netflix), Mark Krotov (n+1), Colin Robinson
  (OR Books), Joshua Wolf Shenk (Black Mountain Inst, Moth Radio Hour), Mia
  Tramz (Time), Johanna Drucker (UCLA), Guy Bennett (Otis Books), Elias Wondimu
  (Tsehai Publ.), Steve Wasserman (Heyday, Yale UP), publicists, agents, & and
  many others.
