project_description: >-
  an affordable exercise program for a “community.” The “community” will be a
  group of people who assemble on a regular basis for a common goal/interest in
  a predefined structure or building. The Grassroots Training for Health and
  Academy of Strength/Sport will provide the exercise equipment and group
  classes along with a train-the-trainer program for the purpose of the
  Community to maintain an exercise program independently.

  The Grassroots Training for Health project will help make LA a great place to
  live by developing a culture of health through a partnership with community
  members for the establishment of a self-managed physical exercise program to
  combat obesity in underserved communities. 

  In most cases, obesity can be prevented or controlled by regular physical
  activity. However, 80% of people in the United States do not meet the
  federally recommended minimum exercise guidelines. Obesity is a major health
  concern. Adult obesity rates range from 10% to 40% in Los Angeles County.
  Cities and regions with the highest obesity rates of 30% to 40% include
  Baldwin Hills, Bell Gardens, Carson, Compton, Culver City, Downey, Inglewood,
  Lennox, Long Beach, Los Angeles, Lynwood, Hawthorn, Gardena, and Paramount. 


  The Grassroots Training for Health project’s goals are twofold: (1) Establish
  a program within the community to build a culture of health through a
  structured physical activity program, and (2) Establish a train-the-trainer
  program in which members of the community can be the exercise trainer at the
  conclusion of the Grassroots for Health program.


  The Grassroots Training for Health project will equip the Community with the
  necessary equipment to begin a basic workout routine. The Grassroots Training
  for Health has partnered with the founder of Academy of Strength and Sport,
  Danny Henry to be the exercise champion for the Community. Danny Henry will
  teach two fitness classes per week for the Community for the award period.
  This project will work with the Community members and Danny Henry in selecting
  the members that will go through the train-the-trainer program. The Grassroots
  Training for Health, the Community, and Danny Henry will formulate workout
  routines and class times that best meets the schedule of the Community. Danny
  Henry will work with the Community in selecting the future trainers through an
  application process.


  At the conclusion of the Grassroots Training for Health program, the community
  members will have the necessary skills and equipment to run a physical
  exercise training program independently. The engagement and efforts by the
  members of the Community to promote health through physical activity will
  foster and cultivate a Community that is resilient and healthy. The Grassroots
  Training for Health program hopes to empower the Community to cultivate and
  maintain a positive health culture for many generations to come. 


  The Grassroots Training for Health has identified the Community, in the
  initial phase as “Churches.” A “church” provides the structure and the
  Community in which this project will benefit the most.
