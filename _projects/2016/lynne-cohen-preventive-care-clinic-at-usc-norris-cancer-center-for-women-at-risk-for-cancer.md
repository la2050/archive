  This clinic provides an in-depth consultation to examine personal and family
  medical history. Our team collaborates to develop an individual risk
  assessment, educate each individual about their risks, and determine the best
  early detection and risk-reduction strategies. Women at high risk for ovarian
  and breast cancer have access to the following: screening services including
  mammography, MRI, pelvic ultrasounds, and serum-based screening tests;
  consultation with a genetic counselor.

  The Lynne Cohen Foundation has regular meetings with the Directors of our
  Preventive Care Clinics, including the clinic in Los Angeles at USC. We ask
  USC to provide LCF with quarterly reports detailing:

  -How many women have been seen.

  -Background on each patient: religion, race, family cancer history.

  -How many cancers have been found.

  -How many women seen have a BRCA genetic mutation

  -How many preventive surgeries have been performed on women in the clinic,
  i.e. mastectomy, hysterectomy. 


  We also ask for other pertinent details that allow LCF to track the clinic's
  progress and outreach.

  Established in 1998 by Lynne Cohen’s three daughters, the Lynne Cohen
  Foundation’s mission is to combat ovarian and breast cancer through preventive
  care, education, and community.

  With a network of comprehensive, multi-disciplinary preventive care clinics, a
  focus on individual and community education, and a consortium of experts from
  leading cancer centers around the country all dedicated to early detection and
  prevention, we seek to increase survival rates and improve the lives of women
  and families affected by cancer.


  The LCF Clinic at USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center allows women at
  increased risk for breast or ovarian cancer to arm themselves with resources,
  knowledge and doctors by their side to stay healthy. This clinic is for all
  women all over Los Angeles to access their risk by seeing a breast oncologist,
  gynecologic oncologist, genetic counselor and have access to genetic testing
  if deemed necessary and wanted. 


  The goals of the Lynne Cohen Foundation Preventive Care Clinic at USC Norris
  Cancer Center are to:

  -Provide access to exceptional quality care to all women with, or at increased
  risk for, hereditary ovarian and breast cancers, particularly those that are
  underserved. 

  -Expand our treatment and screening efforts for underserved women with ovarian
  cancer or at increased risk of developing ovarian cancer.

  -Advance research opportunities at USC in the screening and treatment of
  breast and ovarian cancers.

  The Clinic provides comprehensive resources for women with hereditary ovarian
  and/or breast cancers, as well as those women concerned with increased cancer
  risks. The clinic provides screening, genetic counseling and testing,
  physician consultations, treatment, education, coordination of care,
  prevention strategies, access to clinical trials, and follow-up for these
  women. The clinic continues to be dedicated to underserved and minority
  populations.


  The following initiatives of this Clinic will help Angelenos take control of
  their health and wellness and remain healthy:

  - Continuing to introduce new screening studies for BRCA mutation breast and
  ovarian cancers at USC by expanding protocols currently underway. This will
  enable all women to have access to the same opportunities, unify the research
  across both sites, and diversify the target population for clinical research.

  - Continuing to enhance coordination of care, outreach, and educational
  materials for underserved women with or at increased risk for ovarian cancer
  and/or BRCA mutation-associated breast cancer.     

  - Increasing screening and outreach, conducting risk analysis and assessment
  for women’s cancer, and providing prevention strategies for those at increased
  risk.
