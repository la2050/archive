  Reduced ongoing water use and maintenance needs

  Increased knowledge of plantings and maintenance by Rec & Parks staff

  Materials to support future Rec & Parks trainings 

  Increased support for the area by local businesses

  Community acceptance of river-business interface plan

  Number of activated access points

  Number of volunteers engaged

  Improved safety and visibility

project_description: >-
  We will revitalize and create connections to Studio City’s neglected LA River
  Greenway, helping the River become a vital part of Los Angeles. Local experts
  will provide best practices training to City park maintenance staff and the
  community for native plant care and invasive plant removal. We will engage
  civic organizations to create a plan that connects local businesses to the
  revitalized Greenway, enhances bike and pedestrian access, inspires
  stewardship and improves public health and safety.

  The Studio City River Greenway, planted in 2004, was the City’s first LA River
  native landscape project. Unfortunately, the area has suffered for 12 years
  from overwatering and neglect and is overrun with exotic and invasive plant
  species. Since key community and business access points were never realized,
  it is used far less than original envisioned. Pedestrian and bike traffic has
  decreased substantially, given lack of stewardship and viable access. As a
  result, the area is a haven for many homeless, further discouraging community
  use.  


  Our project will restore the Greenway’s positive public benefits, reduce water
  needs, and build capacity among the community and City park maintenance staff
  for native plant care and stewardship best practices.  We will reshape the
  Greenway into a vibrant amenity, create educated stewards, activate access and
  connection points, and encourage safe use. 


  The LA River Revitalization Plan designates Rec & Parks as responsible for
  long-term maintenance of future projects so collaboration with the Department
  is key. Building staff capacity in sound maintenance practices is critical to
  long-term success. With this project, staff will receive training that City
  budgets currently prohibit. The training will inform planting and maintenance
  practices for resilient native landscape management city-wide. 


  River greenway plants are chosen for their historic habitat benefits and low
  water needs. Proper maintenance practices need one-fifth the labor and
  one-seventh the water of traditional landscapes. Native plants become
  susceptible to disease and mortality when consistently overwatered, but exotic
  invasive species thrive, choking out native habitat and creating fire hazards.
  Learning to identify and manage invasive plants is crucial to successful
  native landscape management. 


  To foster long-term stewardship and reintegrate the greenway into community
  life, we will engage local businesses and LAHSA in a design charrette to
  reactivate greenway access points, create a more vibrant and meaningful
  river-business interface, and enhance public health and safety. 


  The project’s three phases are:


  1) Survey and inventory existing native and invasive plants along the
  Greenway; create a plan for invasive removal; design a revitalizing native
  planting; and produce a clear plan for ongoing maintenance;


  2) Remove invasive weeds, mulch the site and plant natives. Manage any
  emerging invasive plants; monitor the irrigation schedule; and trim, mulch and
  evaluate ongoing program needs. This will be coordinated with Rec & Parks’
  bi-monthly site visits and will engage community volunteers; and


  3) Organize and produce a charrette, engaging the BID, Chamber, LAHSA,
  community members and four landscape architects to develop resilient design
  plans to enhance the river-business interface, enhance public health and
  safety, and improve river access.
