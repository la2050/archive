project_summary: >-
  Electrify LA will transform the county's polluting buses into zero emission
  vehicles and create good manufacturing jobs for low-income communities
  historically excluded from middle skilled tech jobs
project_is_collaboration: 'Yes'
project_collaborators: >-
  6 unions that represent workers in the various industrial sectors in LA will
  collaborate with JMA and our coalition on creating a new pipeline and training
  program for EV bus workers once our advocacy is successful.   Also, the LA
  County Federation of Labor will collaborate to support the advocacy with LA
  Metro & other local transit agencies. Environmental partners will include the
  Blue-Green Alliance and most likely the Natural Resources Defense Council, and
  the Greenlining Institute.
project_areas:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South LA
  - Antelope Valley
  - County of Los Angeles
  - City of Los Angeles
project_measure: "•\tCompletion of extensive research leading to release in 2017 of a white paper on EV buses,  the bus procurement process & making LA a hub for new manufacturing jobs.  \n* Evaluation of the number of workers employed in good career jobs in EV bus manufacturing, the quality of worker training and terms of employment, and provision of ongoing support to ensure retention.  \n* Evaluation of the number of workers employed who do not presently have access to quality employment, including targeted workers such as women, the formerly incarcerated, and people of color.\n* Evaluation of the number of electric powered buses manufactured in California and in the pipeline.\n* Achievement of community benefits agreements in connection with contracts for EV bus manufacture that include commitments to quality jobs, training and apprenticeship programs, career ladder development, outreach to non-traditional workers; bilingual human resources capacity and workplace ESL; a plan to address barriers for workers (including the need for childcare & local transportation), and recruitment targeted to disadvantaged workers.  \n* Winning strong policies for clean buses that require the creation of good jobs and equity for all purchases above $10 million with transit agencies throughout Southern California .\n* Building a coalition that includes environmental, labor and civil rights movements that can create momentum to Electrify LA."

project_description: >-
  LA has a sky high working poverty rate and aging fossil fuel burning buses
  that are destructive to communities and the environment. JMA wants LA to
  become a leader in the emergence of a clean tech manufacturing sector by
  investing in a high quality, clean public transit system and creating good
  jobs for our communities. Because of California's environmental regulation and
  strong policy leadership in the city and county, LA has the potential to
  create 1,000s of good jobs building new EV buses.

  Two of the great challenges LA faces are the rapid pace of climate change &
  the lack of quality jobs for working families.  JMA addresses climate change
  caused by the county's fleet of fossil fuel-burning buses and the need for
  high quality jobs in manufacturing at a time when a disproportionate number of
  workers in our region are unemployed, under employed or working at jobs that
  do not support a family. JMA aims to make LA a better place to create
  manufacturing jobs & a clean public transit system. JMA plans to launch a new
  campaign for a speedier and more equitable transition to zero emission bus
  fleets that will replace polluting buses.  Momentum for the transition to
  clean technology is growing. The JMA plan will also stimulate creation of
  thousands of manufacturing jobs in Southern California.

  The proposed electric bus campaign will build on JMA’s success in linking
  transportation spending to economic development and good jobs, and focus on
  the intersection between climate change and poverty.

  Our plan will benefit from Measure R, which established a half cent sales tax
  for LA County to finance transportation projects. It may be supplemented by
  Measure M on the Nov ballot, which calls for a $120 billion investment in
  transit. The region already has 3 bus factories & the region's largest transit
  agency--LA Metro--recently issued an RFP for purchase of 200 EV buses.  These
  factors make LA perfect to create sustainable transportation and good local
  manufacturing jobs.

  As we launch Electrify LA, JMA will use a tested policy called the US
  Employment Plan (USEP), which is a contractual provision between transit
  agencies buying equipment and manufacturers that offers incentives to create
  good jobs for disadvantaged workers through recruitment and training
  programs.  We will advocate for evaluating manufacturers’ proposals based on
  the USEP & the use of zero emission technology.

  We will involve a broad based coalition in policy campaigns with local &
  regional transit agencies so that public buses and component parts are made in
  our region and that pipelines are created to allow people of color, women, the
  formerly incarcerated & other disadvantaged LA workers get the jobs.  We will
  urge investors and manufacturers to make EV bus equipment in the LA region and
  to hire and train a more diverse workforce.

  Our long term strategy is to permanently transform the way local transit
  agency procurement functions in order to spur a new green jobs movement that
  will reduce fossil fuel emissions as well as create major investment in
  workforce training and the development of career paths into manufacturing jobs
  for low income workers and communities of color. 

  Our strategy will empower LA communities to transform their neighborhoods by
  promoting a healthier environment and local manufacture and enforceable
  community benefits agreements for taxpayer-funded equipment purchases.
