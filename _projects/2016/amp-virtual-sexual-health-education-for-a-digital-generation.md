  One of the Art & Global Health Center’s key roles at UCLA is to facilitate
  research concerning arts-based methods for health communication. We strongly
  believe in evaluating our programmatic efforts to be able to measure reach and
  impact.


  For evaluating the proposed digital platform and community-level activities we
  will design an evaluation survey that centers around quantitative evaluation
  of numbers served, user demographic information, frequency of use, and
  components used. We will create a targeted qualitative evaluation using
  surveys and focus groups to explore how the platform impacts, enhances and
  improves sexual health education information synthesis and retention.


  Through surveys, focus groups and social media-based feedback we will design
  ways to measure the following indicators of success: 

  * We will gauge interest in users to participate in a future  comprehensive
  training program for AMP! facilitators to prepare them to mentor, lead, and
  open up vital conversations concerning sexual health. 

  * We will seek evidence of a growing recognition for AMP! as a model program
  for arts-based HIV/AIDS prevention, stigma reduction, and comprehensive sexual
  health education for youth in Los Angeles, California and beyond. 

  * We will work with community-based partners and school clinics to promote
  HIV/STI testing and reduce number of HIV and other sexually transmitted
  infections in Los Angeles communities.

  AMP! simultaneously educates and inspires young people to make responsible
  health decisions by harnessing the transformative power of humor and
  courageous storytelling to create performances for teens that are memorable,
  inclusive, and FUN. Ninth grade is the last year LAUSD delivers sexual health
  education. There are approximately 60,000 ninth graders in LAUSD. An AMP!
  digital platform would allow us to reach them by providing an accessible,
  updated resource to all LAUSD health teachers.

  With more new cases of HIV diagnosed among teens and young adults than any
  other age group, the need for youth-focused sexual health education, including
  HIV/AIDS education, has been recognized by LAUSD and the U.S. CDC. Through a
  partnership with the Los Angeles Unified School District HIV/AIDS Prevention
  Unit the UCLA Art & Global Health Center is creating accessible and engaging
  curriculum and delivery to address Los Angeles’ increasing demand for updated
  and relevant sexual education. AMP! (Arts-based, Multiple-Component, Peer
  Education) provides young people with crucial information in a novel
  way—simultaneously educating and inspiring them to make responsible sexual
  health decisions. AMP! utilizes original performance created by Sex Squads
  (made up of undergraduate college students) to increase high school students’
  knowledge about HIV/AIDS and STIs, with treatment of additional topics such as
  healthy communication, consent, self-esteem, gender, sexuality, domestic
  violence and pregnancy prevention. 


  AMP! and the Sex Squads are at the forefront of improving sexual health
  education. In addition to live and digital interventions, AMP! has inspired
  the creation of youth-led High School Sex Squads at four LAUSD high schools,
  with more in development. Crucial to their approach is harnessing the
  transformative power of humor and courageous storytelling to create
  performances for teens that are memorable, inclusive, and FUN.


  While high school students and health teachers in select LAUSD schools
  currently benefit from the live version of AMP!, many more can be reached by
  widening the program’s delivery system to include a digital platform. This
  platform includes digital content created by the UCLA Sex Squad; program
  manuals; sexual health resources; and step-by-step art-making activities and
  workshops that invite youth to engage in conversations and respond to the
  works created by the UCLA Sex Squad.


  Founded in 2006, UCLA Art & Global Health Center has been harnessing the power
  of the arts to improve public health in Los Angeles. The Center is a think
  tank specializing in reinventing sexual health education, devising new methods
  for HIV stigma reduction, reinforcing human empowerment, and catalyzing
  behavior change. Our initiatives blend community engagement with arts activist
  training and rigorous research. A digital platform to increase the capacity of
  AMP! to reach high school students (and health educators) will improve future
  health and lifestyle choices for Los Angeles by providing our youth with
  knowledge and information so they can make the best possible decisions for
  their own sexual health. This platform will have considerable impact over many
  years with minimal maintenance and updates. The digital content will be
  expanded and updated every other year as the UCLA Sex Squad continues to
  create more content. An investment in our young people is an investment in the
  future health of our entire city.
