  This isn't about mental health--it's about transforming pain into creative
  expression. We will interview 40 artists on how they have transformed the pain
  of loss into art and produce the interviews into an interactive media art
  journal, complimented by two live music/art shows where Angelenos can engage
  in conversations surrounding grief, love and art while providing artists
  performances and open mic sharing of our journal entries.

  When people experience the pain of loss, they often hide emotions like
  depression, anger, and anxiety associated with loss for fear judgement and the
  mental health stigma. Grieving is often a tough, lonely process but necessary
  process, though some individuals have a hard time reaching out and asking for
  help. The context usually is, 'Something is wrong with me,' 'nobody
  understands,' 'It's too painful.' 


  We are connecting people who have chosen creative expression to transform
  emotional states like depression, anxiety, and anger into art as a way to
  process their grief. By offering them a safe and personalized space in the
  form of a hardcover documentary art book designed by a community of artists
  sharing openly and authentically about their experiences in grief, The Love
  Story will be able to inspire our community to write, reflect, and share their
  personal stories in a digital and live platform. Using augmented reality
  technology through our partnership with Live Portrait, the artist
  illustrations inside the book will turn into videos when scanned through the
  Live Portrait app, allowing our journalers to write, paint, sketch, doodle,
  rant, and create directly inside the book. The journals will include 40
  interviews and 40 journaling prompts.


  By creating a book designed by artists, aggregated into one documentary art
  journal, we are able to not only connect the broken hearted with those who
  have transformed from it, but we are also able to  change how we perceive the
  pain of loss.


  By leveraging the power of art and expression to transform the mindset of loss
  and grief, those who are experiencing difficult times will view their
  circumstances as an artistic opportunity to discover their inner artistry
  rather than a mental health issue to be fixed. By journaling, writing poetry,
  painting, and expressing creatively, we will be able to bring Angelinos
  together to have open, honest, and authentic conversations about grief and
  share our creative expressions (music, poetry, spoken word, film, etc.) to
  transform our pain.


  American Innovates Foundation will bring together a confluence of influential
  networks (education, small business, entrepreneurs, researchers, health and
  wellness interest groups) who have an interest in how art and music can heal
  us. We also have a network of people America Innovates Foundation can bring in
  to curate talks on the link between social and emotional health and art.
