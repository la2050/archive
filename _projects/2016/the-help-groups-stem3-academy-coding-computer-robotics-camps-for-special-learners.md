  Breaking barriers to STEM education and future life options for children
  diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, ADHD and other special needs through
  engaging camps in robotics, coding & computers.

  None specifically, although The Help Group comprises a family of nonprofit
  organizations working to improve the lives of individuals with special needs.
  Our schools, including STEM3 Academy, accept students from more than 50 school
  districts across Southern California.
project_areas:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - San Gabriel Valley
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South LA
  - Westside
  - South Bay
  - Gateway Cities
  - Antelope Valley
  - County of Los Angeles
  - City of Los Angeles
  - LAUSD
  - We work with more than 50 school districts
project_measure: >-
  We will define success by offering STEM camps and afterschool programs at two
  locations for special needs students across Los Angeles. We will measure
  through data collected on recruitment and attendance rates; successful
  completion of STEM projects including robotics challenges; rates of return
  students. We will evaluate through questionnaires and stakeholder interviews
  to collect detailed information about program success. Information will be
  compiled and analyzed by senior staff members, who will use it to improve
  quality of our programs on an ongoing basis and to determine optimum methods
  for scaling the program to larger audiences across the autism and special
  needs communities.

project_description: >-
  Many special learners are underserved in STEM education. Our project reduces
  barriers to STEM skills for students diagnosed with autism, ADHD and other
  special needs by offering afterschool and summer STEM camps designed
  specifically for special learners. The engaging camps extend the reach of
  STEM3 Academy, the first K-12 school in the nation designed to build STEM
  competence in children with special needs, and will include programs in cyber
  security, robotics, coding and computers.

  The Help Group is known for innovative approaches to educating young people
  with special needs & transitioning them to fulfilling lives. Each year we
  serve some 6,000 students & their families with a range of services, operating
  ten specialized schools on six campuses across greater LA.  Our most recent is
  a groundbreaking model school, STEM3 Academy, where we have developed a unique
  approach for educating special learners in STEM subjects, infusing advanced
  studies with 21st century skills of collaboration, critical thinking,
  creativity & communication. STEM3 fills a void that has been blocking many
  highly capable individuals from succeeding. 


  A staggering one of every 68 children born today is diagnosed with autism.
  Some 6.4 million are diagnosed with ADHD; 2.4 million with learning
  disabilities. Countless numbers of these children across LA are underserved in
  STEM education, creating barriers to future jobs in high tech industries.
  Since opening STEM3 Academy in 2015, we have successfully transitioned
  tech-savvy special learners to college, but we would like to reach more.


  Our proposal is to expand the reach of STEM3 through afterschool & summer
  camps in coding, computers, cyber security, space, animation, robotics & more.
  Cultivating STEM literacy through informal programs helps students build
  competence, apply skills & gain confidence in a relaxed environment. We know
  there is a need for this among our community.  STEM3 camps were piloted this
  summer and were embraced by children and families.  Afterschool STEM pilots
  underway at STEM3 high school have also been enthusiastically received, with
  enrollments exceeding expectations. We believe no similar STEM camps for
  special learners exist in any city across the nation.  LA2050 support will
  allow us to purchase supplies and hire part-time coordinator at San Fernando
  Valley and Westside of LA sites.


  Academically, 34% of students on autism spectrum choose STEM majors, as
  opposed to 20% in general population. These students often have heightened
  pattern recognition and can focus for extended periods, traits helpful in
  engineering, coding, or any of the sciences. However, because most STEM
  programs are not designed to accommodate diverse learners, they inadvertently
  exclude them. Highly capable special learners often drop out of college due to
  poor 21st century skills and fail to live up to their promise. Studies show
  some 85% are either underemployed or unemployed as young adults. This signals
  lost opportunity for individuals and a drain on society as unemployed seek
  public aid; it also represents a rich, untapped resource for our city. 


  The Help Groupâ€™s STEM3 Academy signals a revolution in the way special leaners
  are educated, but also in the way they think about themselves, their futures
  and their roles in society. We have been innovators on ways to improve the
  lives of our community. Please help us reach more students across Los Angeles.
