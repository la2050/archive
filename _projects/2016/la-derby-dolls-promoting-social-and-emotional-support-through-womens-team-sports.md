project_measure: >-
  In order to be successful in its contribution to LA2050's CONNECT goal, the
  Derby Dolls will need to demonstrate (1) increased program participation by
  adults and juniors, and (2) continuing social and emotional support benefits
  of our current and future members.
   
  To assess achievement of these measures, we will track the following:

  - Number of new members joining the adult and juniors programs annually

  - Number of retiring members from the adult and juniors programs annually

  - Number of members from the immediately surrounding neighborhoods

  - Annual survey of members assessing the quality of social-connectedness and
  emotional benefit received from league involvement.

  - 'Exit' surveys of retiring members which assess:
       - reason for retirement from the league
       - benefit received from social and emotional support during their time with the Derby Dolls
       - likelihood that social and emotional support network will continue following retirement
   
  Successful results will demonstrate that:

  (1) the Derby Dolls consistently grow new membership at a greater rate than
  attrition,

  (2) members continue to benefit socially and emotionally from participation,

  (3) departing members are not leaving without having gained the benefit of
  social and emotional support, and

  (4) established support networks tend to persist following participation.

  The LA Derby Dolls is an all-volunteer organization that reflects the
  diversity of women throughout Los Angeles. Within the organization,
  league-members find the fellowship and camaraderie that come with team sports,
  in an environment that is unique to the Derby Dolls community. The LA Derby
  Dolls will help achieve LA's CONNECT goal by increasing the number of women in
  LA who receive sufficient social and emotional support.
   
  Team sports provide for increased emotional wellness resulting from an
  inherent support system and increased social health gained through developing
  teamwork and relationship building. Participants in team sports create closer
  bonds to others, become more accepting of diversity, become more adept at
  facing challenges as a member of a team, are more responsive to teaching, and
  demonstrate more confidence in leadership. However, team sports are less
  accessible as adults get older, with women's team sports being even scarcer. 
   
  For over 13 years, the LA Derby Dolls has provided a space for women across
  Los Angeles to find social and emotional support among other women while
  competing together in a physically and mentally challenging sport. Modern
  roller derby is unique in that it is a fast-action contact sport led by women
  as opposed to so many other sports that present as a 'women's alternative' to
  a male-dominated sport. The pro-women attitude is galvanized by the Derby
  Dolls’ focus on issues of women’s empowerment, body positivity, and
  inclusivity. The result is a safe community where women support each other in
  their successes, encourage each other through their defeats, and receive the
  same in return - whether on or off the track. It is common for women who have
  retired from the training and competition aspect of the organization to
  continue to volunteer with the organization because of the strong bonds that
  they have formed and because they continue to believe in the importance of the
  mission of the Derby Dolls. 


  The LA Derby Dolls are dedicated to ensuring that women in Los Angeles
  continue to have the same opportunity to increase self-confidence, positive
  self-image, empathy, and a strong social and emotional support network from
  our organization that hundreds of members - past and present - have benefited
  from. We plan to grow the program's reach to women who do not know that the
  Derby Dolls is available to them and make our space available to a greater
  number of LA women and juniors through the availability of scholarships.
