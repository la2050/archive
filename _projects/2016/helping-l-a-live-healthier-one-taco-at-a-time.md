  Dear Mama will use the 100,000 grant to  mobilize and revolutionize healthy
  food throughout the Los Angeles county. We have a three-part initiative that
  will allow us to impact and improve the health of millions of Angelenos. We
  will use our mobile food trucks to travel throughout the Los Angeles county
  and deliver healthy plant-based food options. Through engagement of classes
  and workshops will be educated and empower families and community members  to
  charge of their eating habits.

  Dear Mama is focused on expanding access to healthy food the introducing
  affordable fresh plant-based foods to the 90 percent of Los Angeles county
  residents that don't have access to it. By introducing a healthier plant-based
  food option to communities through our program, Boyle Heights and L.A. County
  residents will overcome obesity. We will be serving these communities, not
  only through food products, but also empowering and educating them through
  community-based events. We also strive to make the planet a better home for
  everyone by reducing the exposure to air toxins starting with our food trucks
  that will be hybrid to reduce our carbon footprint. We will teach Angelenos
  how to be self-sufficient by educating them in ways to cultivate their own
  land to bring families plant-based food. This will allow them to lower their
  food cost allowing families to be more self sufficient. Our program will
  sub-contract local water vendors in order to promote and sell local water and
  empower L.A. County to address the drought. Our food also uses less water to
  produce in comparison to animal-based foods saving water and the planet. 




  We collaborate with organizations, like L.A. Burrito Project, to feed the
  homeless as well as the PATH (People Assisting The Homeless)  center to help
  homeless individuals who are moving forward in the next step of their lives.
  Along with Skid Row Coffee, we provide food for charity events while bringing
  light to plant based nutrition that is relatable to the Mexican community. In
  collaboration with Green's Center for Plant Based Nutrition and Gluten Free
  Education, we educate L.A. County residents on cost-effective shopping along
  with a healthy diet to empower individuals that live in low income housing. We
  will be coordinating events in the L.A. County that will allow us to educate
  individuals on preventive health care by educating them on healthier food
  choices. Mental health starts with your food choices., helping feed these
  individuals  will help their overall health including self-esteem. I  grew up
  in boyle heights , raised by a single mother and throughout my childhood and
  adolescence i was overweight,  the resilience of my community taught me how to
  overcome adversity and hardship. 


  By implementing our three part initiative of purchasing two food trucks,
  providing education of health living and the empowerment  through engagement
  we will be able to work with lower economic social status neighborhoods
  throughout the Los angeles county,where we will be offering our services
  bilingual. In addition of food and community engagement s we also empower and
  educate the community by offering  workshops and community based events. Along
  with our workshops and classes we will be present in city and county events to
  promote healthy eating, self-esteem,  mental health that will create bonding
  between families building stronger families better communities a better Los
  Angeles.
