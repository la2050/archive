  Operation Gratitude measures success through quantitative and qualitative
  metrics. Key performance indicators include the numbers of: volunteers,
  in-kind and financial donations, and package recipients. 


  The true benefits and ultimate success of the Operation Gratitude program,
  however, can be found in the Mail Call section of our website which displays
  thousands of letters from heroes who have received the Care Packages. One
  theme that runs through the letters is how surprised and appreciative they are
  that total strangers have taken the time to show they care: “We expect to get
  things from friends and family, but you sent me something out of a deep
  respect for your country & its defenders. That's powerful.” 


  Equally important is our ability to touch troops who served during previous
  wars. A former 82nd Airborne Paratrooper from WWII wrote: 'It's a great
  feeling to know that we haven't been forgotten. Because of you & all Americans
  like you, our country remains strong and united.” 


  The most dramatic illustration of our impact was received from an Army First
  Sergeant: 'Your care packages lifted morale & helped save the life of a young
  soldier who never got mail, care packages, or anything. He was planning to
  commit suicide on Christmas, but because that soldier received your care
  package on Christmas Eve, he changed his mind. Your care package made a major
  difference in a human life. Because of your organization, one less family
  received terrible news at Christmas.'

  Every year, thousands of local Operation Gratitude volunteers form a human
  assembly line to create 200,000+ care packages for Active Military, their
  children, Veterans, First Responders, Wounded heroes & Caregivers. Each
  package contains up to 50 snack, entertainment & handmade items, toiletries &
  personal letters.  Our proposal is to provide every Angeleno an opportunity to
  express their gratitude to all who serve by engaging in hands-on activities at
  our facility and in their own communities.

  Operation Gratitude offers fulfilling volunteer activities and a sense of
  purpose to the residents of Los Angeles.


  During each Assembly Day--15 to 20 per year-- we host 500-1000+ local
  volunteers who assemble thousands of Care Packages within just 3 hours. 
  Year-to-date, 10,197 Los Angeles-area residents have assembled 167,122 Care
  Packages at our facility in Chatsworth. In addition, thousands of Angelenos
  have hosted Collection Drives and donated items, hand-made scarves and hats,
  and made “survival” paracord bracelets to include in the packages.


  Operation Gratitude provides more than just the creation of Care Packages. 
  For retirees, the elderly, the handicapped and Veterans of all eras, Operation
  Gratitude is a way to stay active and engaged while still serving their
  country in a meaningful way. Students complete community service hours while
  working with our diverse group of volunteers and gaining respect for our
  nation's service members. Corporate employees find great team building
  exercises, but also a heartwarming experience – especially when putting their
  own products into care packages. 


  On any given day at Operation Gratitude, one will see volunteers of all ages,
  veterans, corporate executives, people of every race, religion, ethnicity,
  ability, and political persuasion working together to put a smile on a hero’s
  face and say “Thank You.”  It’s a perfect reflection of the diversity of Los
  Angeles, and we are proud to create a community that is so accepting and
  interactive.


  The extraordinary diversity within our community of volunteers would be
  striking to a spectator, but those differences are invisible to the volunteers
  as they work side by side in mission-driven action.


  Discrimination does not exist when gratitude is being expressed.


  Most importantly, we believe we’re the number one organization providing a
  critical bridge between the First Responder/Military Communities and the
  Civilian population – closing a social and emotional divide that many have
  noted causes a serious rift in our society.


  As one example, on September 11, 2016, in commemoration of the 15th
  anniversary of 9-11, we gathered 1,300 volunteers to work shoulder to shoulder
  with dozens of LAPD and LAFD members.  Together they created over 11,000 Care
  Kits to distribute to every Los Angeles area First Responder.  This was an
  opportunity to see the best in each other and develop mutual trust and
  respect.


  The ultimate bridge between these communities occurs when the Care Package
  recipients open the packages, read the personal letters, wrap themselves in
  the handcrafted scarves, place the handmade paracord bracelets on their wrist,
  enjoy the snacks, and use the toiletries. Then they truly understand the
  immense generosity and effort that went into assembling each box by hand.


  This is Los Angeles connecting and saying “Thank You” to all who serve.
