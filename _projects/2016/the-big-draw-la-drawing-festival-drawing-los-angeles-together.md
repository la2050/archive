project_measure: "Ryman Arts will evaluate success through tracking the number of people who participate in individual BDLA events, users of our online resources, types of art shared online, and community groups who register public BDLA events. Ryman Arts will assess qualitative factors through debriefing sessions with the advisory group, post –event facilitated discussions, and analyzing demographics.\n\nThis project will be successful if it:\n1.\tCreates opportunities for LA community members to connect with each other at a BDLA event\n2.\tIncreases the number of LA community members who will have participated in an enjoyable hands-on drawing experience in a community setting.\n3.\tIncreases the number of LA community organizations that will have presented a public art activity\n4.\tEstablishes drawing as a communication tool amongst community members of different age, socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds, and ethnicities.\n\nBDLA encourages participants to rediscover the power of drawing as a tool and as a way of seeing the world.  In 2050, the phrase “I can’t draw” would be removed from our collective speech. Drawing, like speaking, writing and mathematics, would be a language of communication among all people. Drawing would be a basis for social interactions and understanding. With BDLA, we hope that the year 2050 will be one of open, accessible, and welcomed participation in artistic and cultural activities without any feelings of unfamiliarity or intimidation for Angelenos."

  Ryman Arts’ LA 2050 idea is to build on the success of The Big Draw LA
  campaign to expand its reach and to continue to connecting Angelenos to each
  other through community art.


  BDLA is a celebration of the act of drawing that encourages local
  organizations to plan participatory art-making events to connect community
  members with each other in October. BDLA, which Ryman Arts is presenting for
  the 7th year, will increase cultural events in LA, engagement in public
  gatherings, and provide a common thread for Angelenos to connect through
  social media. 


  1.Facilitating the production of public participatory drawing events at LA
  County venues

  Ryman Arts creates and promotes community drawing events at diverse venues
  such as museums, libraries, senior centers, restaurants, parks, and others.
  Participating in art-making and cultural activities leads to a stronger
  community and enhances individual development. BDLA ensures that Ryman Arts
  continues to educate community members on the value of community engagement,
  build awareness of the value of art, and increase opportunities for artistic
  participation among the Los Angeles public. This leads to increased public
  participation and appreciation of both formal/informal arts events, and impact
  on Los Angeles’ role as a leader in the arts. 


  2.Marketing of events and online sharing of artwork 

  Any organization can host an art event, with an emphasis on free or low-cost
  events. Ryman Arts compiles these events on TheBigDrawLA.org website,
  coordinates marketing, and provides additional communication about events
  through Ryman Arts’ social media. Each participant is encouraged to post
  images of his/her artwork with the hashtag #TheBigDrawLA. 


  3.Assisting organizations to create public drawing events

  Program support to community groups includes holding planning events for local
  organizations to assist them in hosting community events – specifically geared
  towards non-arts related organizations. With funding, Ryman Arts will be able
  to build event kits – canopies, carts, banners, art supplies, and additional
  marketing supplies –  that can be lent to partner organizations for usage in
  their events. 


  4.Producing one large scale event for the public at Grand Park

  BDLA includes Ryman Arts’ flagship event, Make Your Mark in the Park, a
  fun-filled, creative, afternoon that celebrates the act of drawing through
  free activities, led by Ryman Arts students. This event connects with local
  partners, including: Artist & Craftsman Supply, CicLAvia, Otis College, and
  Self Help Graphics. 3,000+ community members captured the spirit of art at
  this year’s event at Grand Park in DTLA. Featured on NBC 4 News:

  Help Ryman Arts reach more local organizations, more untraditional venues that
  will create access and opportunity for ALL neighborhoods in LA. Give Angelenos
  the chance to build deeper connections with their community and to create a
  more informed, vibrant, and connected Los Angeles.
