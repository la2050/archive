Describe in greater detail how your proposal will make LA the best place.: >-
  WOW (World of Wonder) on wheels will give greater access to open space and
  park facilities by offering after school programs for multi-age children of
  all social and emotional abilities and seniors. WOW on Wheels offers an
  opportunity for communities to engage in a play-based curriculum and mentoring
  program in natural surroundings within community park spaces. On-lookers,
  residents and dog-walkers in park spaces are encouraged to participate through
  video interview segments, facebook live commentary and unique interactive
  team-building & play elements.

  Because of it's mobile nature, WOW on Wheels will turn green neighborhood
  zones all-around-the-town into informal play spaces. These pop-up play and
  frolic experiences will be announced via social media, building e-communities
  and a WOW factor of 'where will they pop-up next?' Communities can vote to
  have their park be the next stop on the vibrant and inclusive WOW on wheels
  tour, with multi-age volunteers, memory-making and elder wisdom sharing at
  each and every stop.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.​: 'Pre-and post tests, creative portfolio assessment'
