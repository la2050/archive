  Edible Apartments across Los Angeles. These community hubs also provide
  learning opportunities through classes, workshops and group dinners and 'TEA'
  parties. We serve to inspire, educate and beautify existing properties so

  The Edible Apartment is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization.  We re-purpose
  underutilized land in urban areas - particularly on apartment building sites -
  to create a food source, educate and inspire people to take charge of their
  well-being and community. As part of our community outreach, we offer regular
  gardening and wellness-related classes, farm-to-table functions, TEA Parties
  and garden work days.  Our mission also includes using our resources for
  rehabilitation.  That includes partnering with prisons, addiction recovery
  facilities and Veterans to share the healing benefits of gardening, cooking
  and community.  We will make LA the best place to LIVE by connecting people,
  beautifying our great city and helping it to feel more like a community of
  connected, like-minded people supporting each other.
