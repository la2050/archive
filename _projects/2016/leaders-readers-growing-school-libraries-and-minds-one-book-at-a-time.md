Are any other organizations collaborating on this proposal?: ''
Please describe your project proposal.: >-
  Leaders+Readers will flood approximately 50,000 titles, as part of its book
  drive program, to the 12 elementary schools that make up the Lynwood Unified
  School District to support learning and academic excellence. At each school,
  we will restock the school library and classroom libraries, as well as hold a
  “Choose + Keep” Book Fair for students to start their own home libraries
  giving these students access to the reading materials needed to inspire and
  engage.
Which metrics will your proposal impact?​:
  - District-wide graduation rates
  - Proficiency in English and Language Arts and Math
  - Early education
  - Student education pipeline
In what areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - East LA
  - South LA
  - County of Los Angeles
  - City of Los Angeles
  - LAUSD
Describe in greater detail how your proposal will make LA the best place.: >-
  In 2014, Milk + Bookies absorbed the book drive program previously operated by
  BookEnds and transformed it into the full service learning curriculum, Leaders
  + Readers. At its core, this program is founded on the belief that a
  sustainably literate community depends on the accessibility of books.
  Unfortunately, there is a staggering amount of students in Los Angeles that do
  not have access to the books needed to inspire and engage. We believe by
  taking on the challenge of delivering books to every elementary school within
  a single district each year, our program will have a targeted impact and put a
  spotlight on the importance of supporting reading and literacy within lower
  income communities. 


  For the 2016-2017 school year, we will be focusing our efforts on impacting
  the 12 elementary schools within Lynwood Unified School District, where 40% of
  their students are English Language Learners and nearly 80% of them live at or
  below the poverty line. Since literacy is a key factor in determining future
  life success, without building a solid reading foundation early in their
  learning career, students are increasingly less likely to succeed in academics
  and the job market. This barrier to their best and brightest futures is
  hindered further by poverty, as a majority of the lowest-level readers are
  from low-income families.   


  With an average of only 36% of students reading at proficiency or higher in
  Title I Los Angeles elementary schools, we are failing our students and
  condemning them to subpar lives. In a job market that is increasingly reliant
  on higher education, these students stand little chance at earning a livable
  wage as adults, as those who cannot read proficiently by the third grade are
  four times more likely to drop out of high school. Worse yet, those who fall
  behind are likely to never catch up to their proficient peers. In the city of
  Lynwood, nearly half of the population has less than a high school education.
  At its core, the schools in Lynwood Unified School District lack the necessary
  resources to close this income-based inequality. With Leaders + Readers, we
  are working to change this narrative…we are focused on expanding school,
  classroom, and home libraries with books that children are genuinely
  interested in reading and will serve as their “gateway” to a love of reading
  and stronger literacy.


  Our goals grow exponentially each year with our Los Angeles-based program and
  we hope to accelerate our impact on Title I students year after year and make
  LA the best place to LEARN.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.​: "We will measure our programs success based on the following: \n \n1)\tNumber of schools within the Lynwood Unified School District that receive a book delivery\n2)\tNumber of books provided in total and by school\n3)\tNumber of students impacted\n4)\tSuccess in engaging school administration and teachers to allow book deliveries and allocating resources to ensure books are incorporated into the school library and classroom libraries.\n5)\tNumber of students to participate in Choose + Keep Book Fairs\n\nTeacher survey findings are expected to be consistent with the following historical data:\n·      95% of teachers report an increase in student reading after receiving donated books\n·      Students with access to a variety of reading material have higher than average test scores\n \n·      Narrowing the “achievement gap” leads to lower truancy rates and increases in confidence and academic achievement."
