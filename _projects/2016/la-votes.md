  This grant would guarantee another successful LA Votes Project during the LA
  Primary Election on March 7, 2017. The LA Votes Project consists of two parts:
  an exit poll in the City of LA and an election day reception titled Election
  Central. Over 15 years, LMUStudyLA has organized 10 exit polls, mobilized
  1,000+ LMU students as field researchers, collected 12,000+ exit surveys,
  fostered dozens of media hits, and hosted hundreds of guests at past Election
  Central celebrations.

  Given the nature of the LA Votes project there are three very clear measures
  of success. These include the accuracy of our Municipal Primary Election Exit
  Poll, the attendance figures for Election Central, and the number of media
  hits we receive before, during, and after the election. In addition, the 15
  years of experience we have with this project give us the opportunity to
  compare against previous iterations of the project and seek out improvements.
   
  For the Municipal Primary Election Exit Poll, we will unofficially know how
  accurate we are by 8 pm on Election Day and officially as soon as the LA City
  Clerk certifies the election results. Our high watermark for accuracy was
  during the May 2013 Mayoral General Election Exit Poll when we were within
  three tenths of a percent (0.3%) of the official results. We hope to improve
  on that record in 2017.


  Regarding Election Central, we will know the level of success of the event
  unofficially by the RSVP list one day prior to the event and officially the
  day after when we look through our list of confirmed attendees and sort
  through the hundreds of images we’ll take at the event. 


  Lastly, counting the number of media hits and increases in followers to our
  various social networks in the days following the election will serve as the
  final metric for the success of our project.

  Who are voters in Los Angeles? What are their priorities? Why are they
  engaged? How can we grow this level of engagement? How can we turn their
  priorities into realities? In a city as large, complex, and diverse as Los
  Angeles answering these questions is a real challenge. Organized and executed
  over the last fifteen years by the Thomas and Dorothy Leavey Center for the
  Study of Los Angeles at Loyola Marymount University (LMUStudyLA), the LA Votes
  project seeks the answers to these questions by interweaving research, civic
  engagement, service, and dialogue to network, empower, and inform Angelenos
  about their electoral landscape, civic decisions, and self-identity. 


  LMUstudyLA has amassed valuable insight into voter patterns, identity, and
  priorities through its fifteen years of research. Concurrently, it has
  advocated for reform successfully with the following two examples serving as
  highlights:  


  LMUstudyLA's reporting of inequities in polling place conditions during LA
  Votes prompted the late California State legislator Jenny Oropeza into passing
  AB177: Voter Bill of Rights legislation in to law in 2003, which sought to
  'protect all voters so that they may understand and defend their rights.'


  LMUstudyLA's Director chaired the City of Los Angeles Municipal Elections
  Reform Commission in 2014 which ultimately led to Charter Amendments 1 & 2.
  These amendments were approved by Angeleno voters in 2015 and addressed the
  issue of low voter turnout in LA Municipal Elections by moving them to the
  election days with the highest turnout, June and November of the even years,
  alongside gubernatorial and presidential contests.


  The LA Votes Project researching the Municipal Primary Election held on March
  7, 2017 will continue to build on this legacy through an exit poll of LA
  voters and an election reception titled Election Central.


  The LA Votes' Municipal Primary Election Exit Poll will engage 150
  undergraduate students at LMU during their spring break. Through the field
  research they'll be conducting in their community they will learn to become
  engaged citizens invested in their civic processes. In addition to conducting
  field research all eligible students will be casting absentee ballots given
  their commitment to research on Election Day. 


  With LA Votes' Election Central, hundreds of Angelenos will be given the
  opportunity to celebrate and observe their electoral process in a centralized,
  convenient, location free of charge. In addition, Election Central attendees
  will be given the opportunity to interact with and engage with various civic
  stakeholders and leaders including city officials, county officials, elected
  officials, staff, academics, journalists, and activists. 


  The ultimate goal of LA Votes is to foster a stronger sense of Angeleno
  identity that goes beyond labels and focuses on tangible results, commitment
  to the local community, and most importantly true civic dialogue.
