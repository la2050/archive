  CRCD defines success as a participant who enrolls, completes the program, and
  is successfully able to earn dismissal/reduction of gang-related misdemeanor
  charges.


  In addition, the LA City Attorney’s office and CRCD work collaboratively to
  define and measure success for the CURE project. The City Attorney’s office
  evaluates the success of the program by evaluating: 1)  The number of
  defendants that choose to participate in the program, 2)  The number of
  defendants that successfully complete the program, 3)  The time it takes
  defendants to successfully complete the program, and 4)  The rate of
  recidivism for program participants once they complete.


  The City Attorney’s office gathers data on the progress of the program on a
  monthly basis and submits to CRCD’s program manager on a monthly basis. The
  program manager works with his or her team to establish a baseline and develop
  benchmarks to create a continuous improvement plan.

  CRCD also seeks to have third party evaluation of our programs to determine
  success. The most recent third party evaluation of our CURE program was
  conducted by California State University, Los Angeles. The evaluation revealed
  that the CURE program shows promising outcomes among the targeted population.

  CURE focuses on cases prosecuted by the City Attorney’s Anti-Gang Section.
  CURE offers youth an opportunity to earn the dismissal of their case by
  engaging in 12-18 months of education, vocational training, and wrap-around
  services such as mental health care. CURE is a violence prevention effort that
  redirects youth to productive activities in order to prevent escalation of
  misdemeanor offenses to felony level violence and to increase community
  safety.

  South LA has the highest number of youth aged 18-25 on probation - 6,339 in
  2009 –among all LA County Supervisorial Districts (“County of LA Young
  Offender Blueprint”, 2011). Incarceration increases exposure to infectious
  diseases such as hepatitis B and C, and negatively impacts employability and
  wages earned, which affect health (M. Massoglia, Incarceration, Health, and
  Racial Disparities in Health, Law and Society Review, Volume 42, No. 2, June
  2008). With jail overcrowding and exposure to violence, youth with mental
  health conditions often worsen during incarceration (B. Holman and J.
  Ziedenberg, Dangers of Detention: The Impact of Incarcerating Youth in
  Detention and Other Secure Facilities, Justice Policy Institute, 2011).


  The Coalition for Responsible Community Development (CRCD) will make LA the
  best place to LEARN by re-engaging disconnected youth who have been pushed out
  of the education system. Our youth experience many challenges and obstacles in
  obtaining their high school diploma and employment. CRCD tackles those
  challenges by providing an alternative project based education program that
  leads to a high school diploma; academic and support services to address
  barriers to high school diploma and college success; college navigation and
  completion support, and provides vocational training, placement and retention
  in employment.  


  CRCD will expand and promote alternative sentencing for low-income youth aged
  18-25 as a violence prevention and learning strategy. Our model – known as
  CURE (Community Uniting for Resolution and Empowerment) - provides multiple
  interventions to youth charged with gang-related misdemeanors, including:
  workforce development activities, college readiness workshops, weekly
  restorative justice group circles, and community service learning projects
  such as community beautification and the 20th Annual South Los Angeles Jazz
  Festival.


  To prevent criminal convictions and incarceration, CURE redirects youth away
  from jail toward prosocial activities to promote health, prevent escalation of
  misdemeanor offenses to felonies, reduce recidivism and violence, and increase
  community safety. CURE offers youth an opportunity to earn case
  dismissal/reduction by engaging with CRCD in 12-18 months of alternative
  secondary education, postsecondary education and training, career placement,
  and wrap-around services such as mental health care. Completion of this
  program will allow them to earn a reduction of the original charge(s), or a
  dismissal of their criminal case and, in applicable cases, are encouraged to
  petition for removal from enforcement of the City’s civil gang injunctions.


  CRCD, the LA City Attorney, and LA County Public Defender developed a shared
  vision to prevent escalation of offenses. Since its launch in 2010, CRCD has
  engaged a total of 94 young people in diversion from incarceration and has
  catalyzed meaningful change in LA’s criminal justice system.
