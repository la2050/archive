  The evaluation of the project will be based on achieving metrics that
  determine if the program objectives are met. 


  Objective 1: Generate student interest in STEM through hands-on and minds-on
  activities 


  Metric: 90% of students participate and attend 90% of the workshops and
  activities


  Measurement tool: Sign in sheets


  Objective 2: Introduce students to entrepreneurship


  Metric: 100% of student groups create a prototype of a commercial project


  Measurement tool:  Demonstration and presentation of prototype


  Objective 3: Develop students’ critical thinking and problem skills by adding
  real-world context to academic coursework


  Metric: Students will demonstrate problem solving and critical think skills in
  developing products and business plans


  Measurement tools:  Student journals and project notebooks


  Objective 4: Inspire, mentor and guide students towards business ownership and
  careers in STEM 


  Metric: Students will show an interest in STEM careers and entrepreneurship


  Measurement tools: Student Surveys and surveys of participating  USC faculty,
  staff, graduate students , undergraduate students  and community partners.


  Objective 5: Improve student grades and attendance


  Metric: Students attendance and grades will improve over last year’s reporting
  period


  Measurement tools: School records

  STEM Center for Innovation and Excellence (SCIE) is a program that engages
  at-risk high school students in science, technology, engineering and
  mathematics (STEM) by having them create apps and technology based products
  that improve their community and/or create entrepreneurial opportunities.
  Students work in teams to create prototypes of apps and products in a local
  maker space/starter garage setting at their school.

  The goal of SCIE is to engage disadvantaged, and underrepresented Los Angeles
  area high school students in STEM and entrepreneurial opportunities. The
  objectives are: 1.Generate student interest in STEM through hands-on and
  minds-on activities, 2. Introduce students to entrepreneurship, 3. Add
  real-world context to academic coursework, 4. Develop students’ critical
  thinking and problem skills, 5. Inspire, mentor and guide students towards
  business ownership and careers in STEM 


  The lure of STEM has been the excitement generated by projects, experiments
  and activities as well as the potential for high income earning jobs and
  careers.  The Common Core and Next Generation Science standards attempt to
  integrate STEM into everyday curriculum. However, simply changing standards in
  isolation cannot overcome the inertia of public educational institutions. 
  Data has shown that participation in engineering curricula is dependent on
  interest, aptitude and prior success in mathematics and science courses. Thus,
  underrepresented and disadvantaged minority students who have not had the
  opportunity to develop interest or experience success in math and science may
  be excluded from participation. 


  In the study, “Pipeline Persistence: Examining the Association of Educational
  Experiences With Earned Degrees in STEM Among U.S. Students”, Maltese and Tai
  (2009) indicate that the majority of students who concentrate in STEM make
  that choice during high school, and that choice is related to a growing
  interest in mathematics and science rather than enrollment or achievement.
  According to the NACME White Paper Increasing the Achievement and Presence of
  Under-Represented Minorities in STEM Fields (2013), “Strengthening the
  educational pipeline for minorities in STEM fields will have a huge impact on
  their motivation to study and work in those fields”. 


  Based on these studies, there is a benefit to minority and educationally
  disadvantaged students and to the Los Angeles community for programs that
  spark, nurture, encourage and support students’ interest, aptitude and efforts
  to pursue careers in STEM. To that end, SCIE provides instruction, support and
  guidance to students from a STEM and business perspective that also increases
  student academic and social self-efficacy and skills. SCIE helps students to
  gain real-world experience and develop relationships with engineering students
  and professionals.
