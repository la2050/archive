title: 'Northeast Los Angeles and the San Gabriel Valley Get PreP''d and PEP''d!! '
project_summary: >-
  PrEP is the 'miracle' HIV pill, but this revolutionary drug can be costly,
  difficult to reach, and clouded in myth, especially for Angelenos in northeast
  LA and the SGV; let's change that for good!

  Success means offering nPEP/PrEP services at our four health centers in a
  manner that is sustainable, efficient, culturally competent, and serves and
  educates the most patients, especially those who are out of the healthcare
  system, especially difficult to reach, and/or HIV at-risk.  


  We will measure this success as follows: 


  At PPPSGV, every department tracks and reviews indicators in each area of our
  strategic plan. This is done quarterly and then shared with the Board of
  Directors. Additionally, each month, our Leadership Team reviews 51 metrics
  pertaining to: Health Center Access; Revenue; Service and Quality; Compliance;
  Outreach and Marketing; and Finance. Every month, we track whether we are
  on-target or within 5% of our goal, and if we are not, we respond
  intelligently. Health center managers undergo a similar monthly performance
  evaluation on 40 metrics pertaining to: appointment access, quality
  indicators, patient satisfaction, and financial performance. 


  At the start of the grant, PPPSGV will generate additional metrics pertaining
  to PrEP patient services and outreach and integrate these into our existing
  performance measurement plan, so that the program’s quarterly and monthly
  results are not reviewed in a vacuum. This will be especially important since
  the activities of this project will be undertaken by staff in both our Patient
  Services and External Affairs Departments and implemented at all our health
  centers as well as in the community at large.

project_description: >-
  PrEP protects and empowers men who have sex with men and dismantles the sexual
  stigma and shame that still lingers today. But for many Angelenos, PrEP costs
  at least $1,500/year and can be hard to access beyond metro LA. We believe
  everybody deserves first-rate sexual health care--no matter what. PPPSGV aims
  to be the first health centers in northeast LA and the San Gabriel Valley to
  offer sliding-scale PrEP, with the end-goal being to help 960 new patients per
  year stay healthy and HIV-free.

  This proposal will make LA the best place to LIVE because we envision a place
  where honest and proud sexuality is the norm and health equity is a reality—no
  matter who you are or where you live or who you love. PPPSGV was founded over
  80 years ago to provide all women with broad public access to family planning,
  thus empowering them to seize control of their futures. With PrEP now proven
  as a highly effective medical prophylactic against HIV, PPPSGV now has the
  opportunity to offer men who have sex with men (MSM) and other HIV at-risk
  patients with the compassion, security, and freedom we have given women for
  nearly a century. 


  But for many Angelenos, PrEP is a drug of privilege: it can cost at least
  $1,500/year and can be hard to access beyond metro LA. Last month, the
  California HIV/AIDS Research Program published a study showing PrEP awareness
  and usage is lower among Black, Hispanic, and young MSM, and although the
  majority of MSM are interested in taking PrEP, they don’t know where or how to
  access it and have fears about side effects, efficacy, and cost, with nearly
  60% indicating they don’t think they can afford it. This is alarming because,
  although metro LA continues to shoulder the greatest HIV disease burden, the
  Department of Public Health has said “strategies to stem the epidemic in this
  region are working” while other regions, like the San Gabriel Valley, are
  exhibiting signs of emerging epidemics, with MSM, the young, and communities
  of color disproportionately impacted. PPPSGV’s HIV-positive results from the
  past three years underscore these trends: 81% of our HIV cases were MSM; 57%
  were MSM of color; and 70% were under the age of 29. 


  PPPSGV possesses unique capabilities to reach and serve these populations.
  Last year, 75% (23,387) of our patients were under the age of 29 and 81%
  (25,052) were people of color. In the past three years, we performed 32,409
  HIV tests, and in 2015, we distributed 516,926 condoms. Our patients know our
  staff will speak their language, will listen to fears and dispel myths and
  misinformation, will be sensitive to their sexual preferences and gender
  identities, will offer sliding scale or no-cost services, and will help them
  navigate the all-too-often costly and labyrinthine healthcare system beyond
  our doors. As one of six Planned Parenthood affiliates in California, we also
  have successful models of PrEP provision that we can draw upon to replicate
  laterally. Furthermore, our health centers are sexual-orientation neutral,
  meaning: no signage inadvertently “outs” clients entering our buildings for
  care. This is important since stigma, shame, and homophobia continue to be key
  barriers inhibiting HIV at-risk people from accessing the recommended care.  


  Our long-term goal is to offer sliding-scale PrEP to nearly 960 patients/year,
  and at the close of the grant, we will have rolled out nPEP/PReP services at
  all of our health centers and will be seeing at least 40 patients/month or
  480/year.
