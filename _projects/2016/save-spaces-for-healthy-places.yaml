Are any other organizations collaborating on this proposal?: ''
Please describe your project proposal.: >-
  Save Spaces for Healthy Places prepares residents to use their influential
  voices to ensure policies and land-use plans reflect the actual needs of their
  community by: 1) learning about the community planning process and how it can
  be influenced; 2) learning to frame their message so their voices can matter;
  3) understanding the linkage between lack of community resources and health;
  and 4) connecting them to civic engagement through their Neighborhood Councils
  and other pathways to activism.
Which metrics will your proposal impact?​:
  - Government responsiveness to residents’ needs
  - Participation in neighborhood councils
  - Rates of volunteerism
In what areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
Describe in greater detail how your proposal will make LA the best place.: >-
  Save Spaces for Healthy Places will make South LA (SLA) the best place to
  CONNECT by motivating residents to get involved with the Community Plan (CP)
  process through Neighborhood Councils (NC).  CPs reflect the needs and values
  of residents living in the community as it lays out guidelines for land use,
  housing, transportation, and business development.  However, CPs, like those
  in SLA, are not always followed or updated. Of the three Community Plan areas
  in SLA, only one has been updated in the last 10 years. As a result, SLA has
  experienced decades of neglect from decision-makers and investment.  This has
  resulted in residents feeling disillusioned and disengaged from the political
  process and believing that their voices do not matter.  Neighborhood Councils
  are vehicles that can help SLA residents reengage since these are groups
  comprised of residents that the City recognizes as being the voice of the
  people. NCs and other residents can get involved in CP hearings, meetings, and
  other discussions so that they can advocate for equitable access to
  fundamental resources.  Engaged residents can push for a responsible CP that
  ensures future developments will bring in safe parks instead of liquor stores;
  produce markets instead of fast food restaurants; and affordable housing
  instead of only high-priced condos. 


  This project will have a three-pronged approach:

  1) Engagement

  A technical committee will be formed to help design the resident engagement
  strategies and collaborate in the delivery of the Community Planning Literacy
  Workshop Series. The committee will include local NCs and individuals
  currently engaged in the CP Updates.


  2) Training

  The training is organized so that residents are well versed on the technical
  aspects of the CPs and they are equipped to recruit, train, and motivate their
  neighbors. Using CHC’s Community Plan Literacy 6-part Workshop Series, that
  was successful in training and preparing residents to become active
  participants in the West Adams CP Update recently adopted by the City,
  residents will be informed about:


  -The relationship between community resources and health

  -Places where people can get involved in local decision-making

  -How to participate and take leadership in a Neighborhood Council

  -The skills needed to participate in the development of the guidelines which
  are the foundation of Community Plans

  -Strategies to get other neighbors involved 


  3) Neighborhood Councils

  Using our relationships to NCs, we will identify Councils ready to establish
  Subcommittees. These subcommittees will ensure decision-makers keep residents
  informed; and that plans are being implemented according to resident feedback.
  Trained workshop participants will join their NCs to communicate updates and
  opportunities around the Plans and organize community efforts to educate their
  neighbors. Subcommittees will also monitor the CP process to mobilize
  residents around city planning and council hearings when necessary.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.​: >-
  Success will be defined as follows:

  Partner Commitment

  --20% of the Neighborhood Councils in the South and Southeast LA Community
  Plan areas will commit to participating in the project by forming Community
  Planning Sub-Committees, reviewing the workshop curriculum and designing and
  implementing resident engagement outreach plan for the workshops.


  Stakeholder Engagement

  --100 resident & stakeholders will participate in the workshop series

  --60% of workshop participant will join the Neighborhood Council and the
  Community Planning Sub-Committees

  --100% of workshop participants will demonstrate an increased literacy in CP
  process.

  --75% of workshop participants will commit to engage in advocacy around the
  CPU public process – testimony, letters, visits


  This project will adopt a real-time learning model that uses the following
  methods/tools to evaluate success:


  --Partner Commitment Forms: NC’s will be asked to sign a commitment form
  outlining their role in this project.  

  --Attendance Forms: Workshop sign in sheets will be collected at all sessions
  to determine participation levels.

  --Pre- and Post-Test: Pre and post tests will be distributed to determine rate
  of increase in community planning literacy, attitudes about community plan
  development, and intent to participate in activism opportunities.

  --Commitment Forms: Cards will be distributed at the end of the workshop
  series to gauge commitment/interest in continued civic participation through
  NC subcommittees.
