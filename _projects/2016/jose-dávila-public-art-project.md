project_description: >-
  LA residents will have the opportunity to gather and playfully interact with a
  concrete sculpture that will break apart and slowly migrate to diverse public
  locales around the city. LAND, Dávila, and community members will create
  ceremonious public events for the sculpture’s movement, inspired by each
  neighborhood and its residents. The pieces will finally return to its original
  location and form in the end – showing the history of its geography and
  community experiences in its modified shape.

  Jose Dávila’s project will be presented as part of the Getty Foundation’s
  Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA initiative, which seeks to explore the deep
  artistic connections between Los Angeles and Latin America. Other
  collaborative partners include the following venues that will be a site for
  the sculpture: University Elementary School, La Brea Tar Pits, Barnsdall Park,
  Los Angeles River, Downtown Los Angeles Public Library, and the Santa Monica
  Pier, among others.

  Public and media feedback on the project will indicate success within a given
  community for each sculptural piece installed. We project to achieve 100%
  capacity attendance for each event/exhibition, which will demonstrate
  successful event marketing to target audiences. The growing audience for LAND
  events will expand exposure to in-depth art experiences for public benefit,
  and will increase the organization’s position within the LA art
  community—potentially also expanding our current financial support base with
  individual donors. 


  At the culmination of the project, Dávila will complete a brief survey that
  summarizes his experience working with LAND. Audience feedback during and
  after events/installations will reflect the quality of the work, and the
  comprehensive nature of this type of first-hand public experience with the
  artist.


  The quality of artistic work produced is paramount to our success as an
  organization which can help artists and communities grow to the next level of
  cultural recognition and achievement. This will be demonstrated in community
  dialogue and in critical media coverage of LAND’s work with Dávila.


  Another indicator of success is the trajectory of an artist's career following
  his/her involvement with LAND, indicated by new support from art institutions,
  patrons, collectors, and dealers for Dávila on national and global levels; and
  by the ongoing presence for Dávila in international cultural dialogue.

  LAND enables artists to create neighborhood-based work and take his/her studio
  practice outside of the studio and into the community as a way to engage with
  various audiences and residents. LAND’s fundamental mission is to bring
  contemporary art out of the museum/gallery setting and into the public sphere.
  Thus, LAND’s core audience for all projects includes members of every type of
  demographic as LAND’s exhibitions and programs are brought into the daily
  lives of community members that may not encounter or have the means to
  experience art in other ways. 
   
  LAND makes LA the best place to CREATE because it funds local, national, and
  international artists to create work in LA and to directly engage with the
  people of LA, thus creating jobs in the arts sector. The projects are always
  specific to the city’s unique architectural public sites, increasing LA’s
  international reputation as a city that welcomes artists to enhance it. LAND
  hopes to emphasize its commitment to the arts in LA through this innovative
  project, which is part of a larger dialogue with the Pacific Standard Time:
  LA/LA community of prestigious and reputable arts institutions. 
   
  For Jose Dávila’s project, the exhibition will begin with a commissioned
  concrete cubic sculpture installed at West Hollywood Park. The components of
  the sculpture will break apart and travel across the city to be installed in
  various neighborhoods simultaneously, creating connections between the diverse
  communities of LA. The migration of the pieces will occur at various points
  throughout the run of the exhibition, concluding the project with the
  sculpture reinstalled in its original cubic form. 
   
  The project will bring art to new audiences in each neighborhood, inviting
  them to participate creatively, using the sculpture as they wish, as a place
  to sit, play, draw, dance on, skateboard over, relax on, etc. Participants
  will be encouraged to take pictures and post on social media creating an
  archival map which will be connected with the Pacific Standard Time online
  activity. 
   
  The process of discovery of each additional site will create a unique,
  expansive experience for LA residents which speaks to broader concerns of
  navigating the cityscape and LA’s inherent geographic segregation. Audiences
  are encouraged to follow the migration of the sculpture, visiting new
  neighborhoods, and are invited to participate in a series of events to
  celebrate the sculpture’s reformations. LAND will co-present these public
  gatherings with the local organizations/sites that are hosting the sculpture.
  Inspired by the location and the community interest, the events may include 
  artist talks, basketball games, garden tours, salsa dancing, and educational
  activities for children, etc. . 
   
  Furthermore, the transformation of the sculpture and the artwork’s
  neighborhood impact will be documented and photographed in a bilingual
  publication.
