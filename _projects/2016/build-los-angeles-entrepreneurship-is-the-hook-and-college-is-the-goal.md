  For this first year, BUILD's metrics will include: 


  1. A full service team in place at 10 partner high schools, including the
  Volunteer Manager and Program Manager;

  2. 600 students in the 9th grade in the BUILD curriculum;

  3. 150 volunteer mentors supporting BUILD students on a weekly basis.  


  Eventually, as we serve students throughout their high school years, BUILD’s
  three primary indicators of success will be: 


  1. 10th grade enrollment rates, which correlate to a decrease in dropout
  rates, and measured by data from our high school partners and the National
  Student Clearinghouse. 


  2. Continued high school graduation rates above 95% for students completing
  the BUILD program, and measured by data from the National Student
  Clearinghouse;


  3. College enrollment rates of 90% or higher for each class of BUILD seniors,
  and measured by yearly progress toward California public university
  eligibility


  To ensure we meet these outcomes, we will measure the mastery of six (6)
  skills that we have identified, and research supports, are pertinent to master
  for long-term life success. These skills are communication, collaboration,
  problem solving, innovation, self-management, and demonstration of grit.

  BUILD will use these funds to hire two key members of its new Los Angeles
  team, which will serve 600 students in 2017.  BUILD inspires students from
  under-resourced communities to graduate from high school, develop critical
  life skills, and achieve post-secondary success through the highly engaging
  experience of launching their very own businesses.  BUILD will hire its
  Volunteer Manager and its Student Success Program Manager to recruit 150
  volunteer mentors and to work with 150 9th graders.

  For the 2015 – 2016 school year:

  * 95% of BUILD students graduated from high school on time.  In contrast, the
  national average rate of on-time high school graduation is 81%, and the
  national average rate of on-time high school graduation for low-income
  students is 73%.

  * 98% of our students were accepted to a postsecondary option, and of those,
  82% were accepted to four-year colleges.

  * 69% of BUILD students who graduated in 2015 enrolled in college the Fall
  immediately following their high school graduation.  In contrast, the national
  average college enrollment rate is 66%, and the national average rate for
  BUILD’s target population (low-income students of color from urban high
  schools) is 52%.


  BUILD’s Plan for Los Angeles

  Beginning with the 2017-2018 school year, BUILD Los Angeles will serve 600
  students in the 9th grade.  Our initial geographic focus will be on the region
  centered in Downtown Los Angeles and extending several miles into East Los
  Angeles.  BUILD Los Angeles will work with traditional comprehensive public
  high schools, charter schools, and pilot schools.  BUILD’s national Research
  and Evaluation Team will be able to study and learn how the BUILD model works
  in each of those three settings.  


  In succeeding years, BUILD Los Angeles will continue to add a new 9th grade
  cohort of approximately 600 students each year.  By the 2020-2021 school year,
  BUILD will have grown to serve approximately 2,400 students.  Seed grants
  invested now will quickly bear fruit in the form of a highly impactful
  regional team of 30 BUILDers serving 2,400 students, 25 schools and 500
  mentors.  


  Outcomes in Los Angeles

  Most importantly, BUILD has a demonstrated record of ensuring high school
  graduation and college enrollment among low-income high school students.  Of
  BUILD students nationally in 2015-2016, 95% graduated high school on time and
  69% of those graduates enrolled in a post-secondary institution.  Both of
  those figures are much higher than the national cohort’s rates of 73%
  graduation and 52% enrollment.


  Assuming BUILD Los Angeles matches these results, that means over the next
  five years:


  An additional 528 students who graduate high school instead of dropping out
  (2,280 of 2,400 BUILD Students graduate vs. 1,752 students nationally
  graduate)


  An additional 408 students who enroll in post-secondary institutions (1,656 of
  2,400 BUILD Students enroll vs. 1,248 students nationally enroll)


  With its first class of 9th graders, BUILD Los Angeles will be responsible for
  an additional 132 high school graduates and 102 college enrollees in Los
  Angeles.
