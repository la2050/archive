Please describe your project proposal.: >-
  In a community such as Carson, and school district that has seen violence,
  bullying, and behavioral issues among students, the Domestic Harmonizer
  Program is boosting both learning, and promoting the prevention and peaceful
  resolution of conflicts on campus between and among students. Students and
  teachers at Andrew Carnegie Middle School are learning tools, skills and
  processes to prevent and resolve conflicts, and to enhance youth leadership
  and academics.
Which metrics will your proposal impact?​:
  - Proficiency in English and Language Arts and Math
  - Students’ perceived sense of safety at and on the way to school
  - Suspension and expulsion rates
  - Truancy rates in elementary and middle schools
In what areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Gateway Cities
  - LAUSD
Describe in greater detail how your proposal will make LA the best place.: >-
  Los Angeles is already at the forefront of a number of social initiatives, and
  our Domestic Harmonizer Program is another example of our city’s immense
  potential to innovate.  At the Whitaker Peace & Development Initiative (WPDI),
  we believe that education has the power to address some of the most salient
  issues facing our youth, such as bullying, violence, and high suspension
  rates.  We are convinced based on our experience that conflict resolution
  skills should be a part of the school curriculum just like any other subject
  area because conflict is a life-long issue that we all face no matter who we
  are.  However, conflict resolution skills are not innate – we must learn and
  practice these skills in our classrooms, and the sooner these skills are
  learned, the better we can create safe and productive learning environments in
  school, and provide our children with lifelong tools to constructively address
  conflict. The purpose of our program is to create campus- and classroom-based
  assets, which will strengthen and focus the resilience of students onto
  healthy living and making positive transitions to adulthood.  


  Our Domestic Harmonizer Program is a trailblazing program that addresses these
  issues.  With our program partners, California State University, Dominguez
  Hills (CSUDH) and Andrew Carnegie Middle School in Carson (which is a LAUSD
  school), we have launched a truly unique curriculum that integrates Conflict
  Resolution Education (CRE) with the California Common Core subjects of math,
  science, social studies and English.  Students in the entire middle school
  will participate in this program beginning the 2016 academic year through the
  end of the 2019 academic year.  At the end of the program, students have an
  opportunity to create their own social justice projects on their middle school
  campus.


  Our pilot project officially launched at Andrew Carnegie Middle School in
  August 2016, and will continue until the end of the 2019 academic year. The
  program will impact the entire school (900+ students, 50+ educators) each year
  for the next three years.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.​: "There will be an independent evaluation of the program using qualitative and quantitative measures.  \nThe primary data collection methods and procedures include:\n-\tSurveys (a pre-test administered at the beginning of the year followed by a post-test administered at the end of the year)\n-\tInterview administered questionnaires\n-\tOpen-ended interviews\n-\tFocus group discussions\n-\tClassroom observations\n\nSecondary data collection methods and procedures include:\n-\tAnalysis of data collected from documents, reports, and records made available to CSUDH and WPDI such as attendance records, graduation rates, overall schools, administration data\n-\tCase studies conducted by teachers at the school of select youth.  Each teacher implementing the curriculum will select two students to specifically observe over the course of the year, noting any changes or important interactions that were spurred by the curriculum.  These case study notes will be short observational reports done at five times over the course of the year for each student.  The students’ names will not be provided and this will be anonymous data collection."
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
  - 'Money '
  - Publicity/awareness
  - Technical infrastructure (computers etc.)
  - 'Community outreach '
  - Network/relationship support
