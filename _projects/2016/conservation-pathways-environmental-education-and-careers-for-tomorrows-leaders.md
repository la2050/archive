  HYC will measure our success based on:


  - Number of classes conducted

  - Number of individuals in attendance 

  - Program participants’ familiarity with California ecosystems 

  - Program participants’ familiarity with conservation strategies

  - Number of linkages to eco-friendly companies

  - Percent of program participants with increased knowledge of and interest in
  eco-friendly jobs


  HYC will evaluate the above indicators through pre- and post- surveys
  completed immediately before and after participation in on-site conservation
  classes and events. Using the surveys, we will measure improvement in
  conservation knowledge resulting from a class or workshop and steps
  participants plan to take to conserve in their own lives. We will collect
  e-mail addresses and survey randomly selected participants 90 days, 6 months,
  and 1 year after participation regarding their home water and energy usage to
  track learning.  Program participants from throughout the year will be invited
  to take part in a Conservation Pathways Learning Event at LCP where they will
  share conservation progress they have made in their daily lives.

  HYC will help make LA the best place to PLAY by uniting government, community,
  and individual efforts to create quality spaces for individuals of all ages to
  play, including a campus and park with eco-friendly technologies. HYC serves
  as the nonprofit organization managing and operating Liberty Community Plaza
  (LCP), a $20 million community center constructed by the County of Los
  Angeles, 4th District, and serving Unincorporated South Whittier and
  surrounding cities in Southeast Los Angeles County. 


  Our park serves as an oasis in the neighborhood and the epicenter for local
  residents to play and learn. LCP features a quarter track with exercise
  equipment along the perimeter and a playground with slides, swings, a jungle
  gym, and a landscape with 100% drought-resistant California native plants and
  grass that thrive with little water. LCP’s park serves two key purposes: 1) to
  provide a safe, inviting, and fun place to play and where people of all ages
  can gather; and 2) to provide an interactive, engaging, and informative
  environment to learn about water and energy conservation efforts. 


  Our program, the Conservation Pathways Project, will equip low-income
  children, youth, adults, and seniors with education and improved understanding
  of water conservation, drought-tolerant plants, agricultural practices,
  irrigation basics, and garden design. Program participants will have the
  opportunity to learn about careers in the growing environmental industry.
  Conservation workshops will be tailored to each age group as appropriate. 


  A Conservation Pathways Coordinator will teach workshops with the guidance of
  our partners Orchard Dale Water District and Water Replenishment District of
  Southern California (WRD), which provide program input on a volunteer basis.
  Since July 2015, HYC has conducted 30 on-site conservation workshops. With
  LA2050 funding, HYC will expand our project and resources to serve more
  residents. We aim to increase the number of people reached to 25,000 children,
  youth, adults and seniors from throughout Southeast Los Angeles County,
  including students from school districts with which HYC partners. 


  A touch-screen educational Kiosk will deepen the learning experience more than
  existing signage, allowing interactivity regarding local natural habitats,
  water and energy conservation strategies, and sustainable landscaping methods.
  Kiosk content will be especially geared toward children and youth. To
  facilitate the greatest reach for the project, HYC will develop a Southern
  California Conservation mobile app that youth and families can install on
  their telephones to deepen their environmental and conservation learning. A
  10-passenger van will provide increased access to Conservation Pathways.
