  Success for Spark means keeping students:

  - engaged: motivated and invested in their education, seeing a clear path to
  their future

  - on track: attending school regularly, exhibiting positive behavior, and
  succeeding in coursework

  - ready: academically, socially, and emotionally prepared to navigate high
  school


  We’ve established a data-sharing agreement with our partner schools to monitor
  the three warning signs of disengagement -- grades, attendance, and behavior
  -- as well as graduation. Spark also tracks the development of key skills and
  mindsets that set students up for success, including teamwork, positive
  attitude, and other social/emotional competencies. We conduct pre-, mid-, and
  post-program surveys of Spark students, mentors, and teachers to gauge student
  gains in growth mindset (based on Carol Dweck’s research), grit (based on
  Angela Duckworth’s research), classroom engagement (based on KIPP’s school
  character report card), and 21st-century skills (based on the work of MHA
  labs). Finally, we measure the quality of each student-mentor match through
  surveys of both students and mentors.


  Based on Spark’s latest impact report:

  - 91% of students improve their grades, attendance, or classroom engagement
  during our program

  - 77% demonstrate positive academic mindsets (like self-efficacy)

  - 83% meet or exceed expectations on social/emotional skills (like teamwork)

  - 92% have graduated on time or are on track to do so (compared to only 68% of
  their peers)

project_description: >-
  One out of every six LAUSD students drop out of high school -- and of those
  who drop out, two thirds either don’t complete or get held back in 9th grade.
  By 2050, Spark wants every LA student to be ready for 9th grade with the
  support they need to thrive in high school and beyond. Today, a $100,000
  investment from LA2050 will fuel Spark’s next step: matching 300 underserved
  middle schoolers with mentors from top companies for a year of career
  exploration, skill-building, and academic engagement.

  In order to make LA the best place to learn, we have to engage students at the
  right moment. Every year, 1.2 million students drop out of high schools across
  the US. And two out of every three dropouts either don’t finish 9th grade or
  repeat it, only to drop out down the road. That makes middle school a critical
  transition, when as many as 60% of students become chronically disengaged,
  seeing no clear link between what they learn in school and what they see
  around them in the “real world.”


  Spark forges that link. We believe that every student deserves to be engaged
  in their education and inspired to succeed in high school and beyond. So we
  target 7th and 8th graders from underserved communities who display early
  warning signs of disengagement and connect them to a powerful combination of
  mentoring, project-based learning, and a tailored academic curriculum.


  We start by matching students with mentors at leading companies to explore new
  career opportunities through hands-on workplace mentorships. Their weekly
  visits culminate in a capstone project, driven by the student’s interests and
  the mentor’s expertise, like developing a videogame at a tech company. Back at
  school, students participate in Leadership Class, which reinforces these
  classroom-career connections and develops eight key life skills. Finally,
  Spark just launched our High School Transition initiative, supporting students
  and families through the high school selection and application process, with
  300 8th graders at Bethune Middle School.


  Mayra, a Bethune graduate, says that without Spark “I wouldn't be able to see
  myself actually going to college. For me to have somebody in the role that I
  want to become… it gives you the guidelines in where you want to go with your
  life.” With her mentor Perry Wallack, co-founder and former CFO of Cornerstone
  OnDemand, Mayra explored potential careers in business and planned her
  academic and professional path to get there. 


  In her mentor’s view, the greatest impact may have been on her public speaking
  skills: “The ability to stand up in front of a group of people and convey a
  message,” says Perry, “that started with Mayra not having the confidence and
  the composure that you see today.” Ultimately, 83% of students meet or exceed
  expectations on skills like communication, 91% improve their school
  performance and 92% have graduated on time or are on track to do so.


  Spark is also making LA the best place to connect by providing local companies
  with a turn-key corporate volunteerism program -- literally delivering
  mentorship opportunities right to their office doors. Spark has a noticeable
  effect on employee engagement, with 71% of mentors saying our program
  increased their job satisfaction and 97% saying they’re proud their employer
  partners with Spark. The impact goes beyond students and mentors to the
  company itself: “It’s energizing and it’s cool,” says Perry Wallack. “It will
  help your company hire. It will absolutely help you retain.'
