  I3 Arts Fest is a Los Angeles based free festival that will activate three
  venues in Downtown Los Angeles with interactive, immersive and innovate art.
  I3 Arts Fest transforms these public spaces into a vibrant urban canvas for
  regional artists to engage and exhibit their most innovative and imaginative
  works. This nighttime celebration features large-scale installations,
  multimedia and performing arts experiences that will inspire the community,
  entertain visitors, and thrill stakeholders.


  Grand Park will transform into Interaction Park and host large scale
  interactive art installations. These installations will engage its audience
  through technology, media and mechanics. All the pieces featured in
  Interaction Park are created by local artists. This activation will be free
  and open to the public, all ages welcome. 


  LA State Historic Park will become Immersion Field and be home to the Art Car
  Ball. An art car is a vehicle that has had its appearance modified as an act
  of personal artistic expression. Attendees will get to experience the art cars
  through both performance and play. These mobile structures are truly a work of
  art on wheels. Immersion Park will be the only ticketed event, all ages
  welcome. 


  Grand Performances will transcend as Innovation Plaza and present The
  Country’s Tallest Musical Instrument.  LA based installation artist and
  musician William Close has developed over 100 new types of musical instruments
  including the, “Earth Harp.” The Earth Harp is the largest stringed instrument
  on the planet. The body of the instrument rests on the stage and the strings
  travel out over the audience attaching to the back of the venue, transforming
  it into the instrument. The giant long strings are played with violin resin
  covered gloves. The player runs their hands along the strings creating
  beautiful cello like tones. New York Times raved it, 'An instrument unlike
  anything Bach or Beethoven could have ever imagined!” 


  William Close will attach his famed Earth Harp to the top of an 800ft
  skyscraper (Two California Plaza) and transform it into The Country’s Tallest
  Musical Instrument. This innovative concert experience will push the creative
  boundaries on how to make music and how to present it. This activation will
  have three performances and be free to the public. This once in a lifetime
  musical spectacle has proven to be a sight and sound experience for all ages. 


  All three activations are steps away from a metro stop to expand accessibility
  and to encourage attendees to utilize public transit while exploring this
  region-wide festival. 


  We see I3 Arts Fest as a demonstration of how community is built through
  interactions with arts and culture and how this in turn creates the foundation
  for a thriving and dynamic city. Unlike anything produced before, I3 Arts Fest
  will become a cultural destination and global influence in the arts community.
