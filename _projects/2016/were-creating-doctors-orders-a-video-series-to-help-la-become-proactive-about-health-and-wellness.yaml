Are any other organizations collaborating on this proposal?: >-
  The City of Hope, Methodist Hospital of Southern California, Torrance Memorial
  Medical Center, The University of Southern California, UCLA, Senior Concerns
  of the Conejo Valley, The American Red Cross, The Barbara Davis Center for
  Diabetes, The Race to Erase MS, Congress Medical, The Arcadia Fire Department
Please describe your project proposal.: >-
  Doctors' Orders is an innovative video series that features physicians,
  patients and researchers educating on health conditions including obesity,
  heart disease and mental illness.  We have completed the first four half-hour
  episodes and will make the series available to the county health departments
  in Los Angeles so that while patients are in waiting rooms they can learn
  about the link between obesity and cancer, how to spot depression in a loved
  one, and what to do for a diabetic relative.
Which metrics will your proposal impact?​:
  - Obesity
  - Residents receiving coordinated healthcare services
  - Mental illness
In what areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - San Gabriel Valley
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South LA
  - Westside
  - South Bay
  - County of Los Angeles
  - City of Los Angeles
Describe in greater detail how your proposal will make LA the best place.: >-
  Doctors’ Orders has the ability to impact millions who LIVE in LA by
  encouraging and teaching them to live healthier lives.  

  The Obesity Metric shows that so many people in our city need to lose weight,
  but also need solid tools and ideas for changing their habits.  Our obesity
  episode will give them those tools, delivered in a clinic setting where they
  happen to take a child for an immunization.  They can learn simple tricks and
  substitutions that can add up to big changes over a year.  And they can get
  solid facts on how extra weight is affecting their heart, blood sugar and
  blood pressure.  As other organizations are expanding access to healthy food
  choices, we can help inspire people to put more fruits and vegetables on their
  plates because they understand the profound impact it can have on disease
  prevention.

  The series will also support the metric on Mental Illness by teaching families
  how to recognize the signs of depression, bi-polar disorder and chronic
  anxiety.  Real people share their stories of facing a mental health issue and
  improving their lives with treatment.  Lowering the stigma on mental illness
  starts with education, and can save not only personal suffering, but many
  lives.  

  The metric on Coordinated Health Care Services begins with patients
  understanding better what they need and asking for it.  If a person knows they
  are having symptoms of type 2 diabetes, they can advocate to their primary
  care physician and push to get a referral to an endocrinologist.  Patients
  being proactive can force the system to expand care and work as a team.

  Each show is documentary in style, filled with personal stories and experts in
  each field so that our citizens have the knowledge and the courage to be
  proactive about their health and less afraid.  Once the series is completed,
  we hope to get a spot on PBS to expand its reach and impact.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.​: >-
  The first measure of success is to complete the 13-episode series and
  distribute it.  We hope to get a broadcast contract with PBS so that funding
  is in place for the second group of episodes.  Our real success will be the
  distribution into the county health departments of the greater Los Angeles
  area so that it can be seen throughout the next year.  Feedback from patients,
  doctors and organizations will help us to evaluate and expand our shows to fit
  the needs of the community.
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
  - 'Money '
  - Volunteers
  - Advisors/board members
  - Infrastructure (building/space/vehicles
