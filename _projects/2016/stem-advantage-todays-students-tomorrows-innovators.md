  We use both formal and informal metrics to measure outcomes, learn and refine
  our program to grow and scale to support more students and CSU campuses. 


  Formal measures include:

  1) # of applicants

  2) # of STEM Advantage Scholars selected

  3) # of students served through career and personal development workshops

  4) % of Scholars hired into a STEM field within four months after graduation

  5) Average starting salary for STEM Advantage Scholars

  6) # of sponsors


  Informal measures include:

  1) Student feedback, including frequent communication with applicants,
  Scholars and alumni

  2) Internship feedback, including communication with sponsors, supervisors and
  talent leaders

  3) Mentor feedback, plus we are developing an electronic survey

  4) University feedback, including communication with CSU Department Chairs and
  Deans.

  5) Ability to attract future university partners

  university the type of support that many students attending a private
  university receive, including internships, mentors, scholarships, career
  panels, access to and networking opportunities with business and  technology
  executives and hiring managers. STEM Advantage aims to level the playing field
  for young women and underserved communities attending  California State
  University (CSU) campuses in the Los Angeles area.

  California employers report being unable to find qualified candidates in STEM.
  With more than 1 million new STEM jobs on the horizon, STEM Advantage
  addresses this skills shortage by focusing on underrepresented talent.  Women,
  African Americans and Latinos comprise only 20% of the STEM workforce, yet are
  projected to make up 70% of the total workforce by 2017. 


  Our 360-degree program provides students attending a public university the
  type of support that many students attending a private university receive,
  including internships, mentors, scholarships, career panels, access to and
  networking opportunities with business and technology executives and hiring
  managers. STEM Advantage aims to level the playing field for young women and
  underserved communities attending the California State University system. In
  2012 we launched our program at CSU Dominguez Hills. Undergraduate enrollment
  is 55% Latino, 20% African American and 70% women. In 2014 we expanded to Cal
  State LA (60% Latino). In 2016 we added Cal State Northridge.


  Board members use their contacts to open doors for students who have the
  talent, but don’t have the opportunity and network. Over 30 companies
  participate including Avery Dennison, CBS, Farmers Insurance, Sony Pictures
  Entertainment and Toyota.


  STEM Advantage makes LA a greater place to learn as we mentor, prepare and
  inspire STEM talent. We want businesses to think of Los Angeles as a hub for
  STEM talent and a reason to keep/locate their businesses in LA! Focus areas:


  1) Grow flagship STEM Advantage Scholars program at CSU Dominguez Hills, CSU
  LA and CSU Northridge. Expand to CSU Long Beach and Cal Poly Pomona. Scholars
  say the program is “life changing” as it provides opportunities they never
  thought possible and builds their confidence. Most receive job offers over
  $55,000.
    
  2) Provide mentors to STEM students at CSU campuses beginning their Freshmen
  year to increase retention, especially of women, African American and Latino
  students, in a STEM major. Fewer than 50% of students who enter college
  intending to major in a STEM field complete a STEM degree; the majority switch
  to non-STEM majors during their first two years of study. By increasing
  retention we can have a significant impact on the number of STEM graduates and
  develop a diverse skilled workforce. Plus we build a talent pipeline to
  participate in the flagship STEM Advantage Scholars program.   


  3) Galvanize STEM Advantage Scholars and Alumni to “pay it forward” as role
  models and mentors to excite young people, especially girls and minorities,
  that STEM is cool and encourage and inspire them to pursue their dreams. We
  can have an exponential impact on diverse STEM talent as we build pathways
  with programs that focus on K-12. Many STEM Advantage Scholars are women and
  students of color. Young people will see someone who “looks like them” and be
  able to relate because they have similar backgrounds. There’s a saying ‘if I
  can see it, I can be it’.
