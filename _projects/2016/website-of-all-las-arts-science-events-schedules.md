project_description: >-
  UEP project seeks to build a website to list arts & science events in LA. It
  will be all in one spot and united. The site is populated with curated,
  accessible and affordable choices. We will seek short interviews to the events
  to humanize and engage all sizes and shapes of humans to attend. UEP wants
  people to learn how easily, enjoyably and important navigating all levels of
  art & science can be.

  - The website can list significant events beyond LA
project_measure: >-
  We will define success by 1) how many people hit our site. 2) How many people
  attend the events they read about on the site. 3) By how many people give
  interviews for their events on the site and seek to post their events on the
  site. 4) By how many people stuck in either science or arts find the other
  side and its importance and usefulness for balancing them both together.

project_proposal_best_place: >-
  1) We will have one destination accessible by phone or internet to show all
  the arts & science happening in LA

  2) We will focus on accessible, high quality events to widen support.

  3) We will bring arts & science back together again as they should always be
  together on the site and in peoples minds.

  4) We will do short video interviews to add to the site and engage those
  interested in events. 

  5) Free listings and perusing of the site will keep the accessibility high.
