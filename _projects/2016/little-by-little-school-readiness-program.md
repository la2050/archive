  The Little by Little School Readiness Program has developed a comprehensive
  research and evaluation project to measure the success of the project. One
  such study was completed in 2008 and we are currently rigorously evaluating
  the program with a key measurement being school readiness (as measured by the
  Bracken scale) Bracken Basic Concept Scale-Revised (BBCS-R) is a revision of
  Bracken Basic Concept Scale (1984). It is used to assess to basic concept
  development of children in the age range of 2 years 6 months through 7 years
  11 months. It is used to measure comprehension of 308 foundational and
  functionally relevant educational concepts in 11 subtests or concept
  categories: colors, letters, numbers/counting, sizes, comparisons, shapes,
  direction/position, self/social awareness, texture/material, quantity, and
  time/sequence. Of the 11 subtests, the first six compose the School Readiness
  Composite (SRC). The SRC can be used to assess children's knowledge of those
  readiness concepts that parents and preschool and kindergarten teachers
  traditionally teach children in preparation for formal education.

  WIC as a Platform for the Promoting Early Literacy and Health: Partnerships
  for Sustaining Impact

  In 2003, First 5 Los Angeles funded Public Health Foundation Enterprises
  (PHFE) and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and
  Children (WIC) to develop and implement the Little by Little (LBL) School
  Readiness Program, an intervention designed for participating WIC families. 
  LBL was designed to engage parents in their children’s education, create a
  stimulating home environment, foster early literacy skills and significantly
  improve school readiness for underserved children living at or below the
  poverty level.   The genesis of Little by Little was in understanding key
  health disparities that unfortunately have developed in low income
  communities. Research has consistently demonstrated that children born into
  poverty hear 30 million fewer words before they reach kindergarten than those
  who come from middle and higher income families. This is difference has come
  to be referred to as the “30 million word gap.”  

  Because of this gap, children born into poorer families tend to test lower on
  school readiness scores than those born into higher income families, and this
  disparity develops before kids are even five years old. The gap continues
  throughout their lives, affecting high school graduation rates, job prospects,
  income, health and wealth.Funded by First 5 LA, LBL reached over 118,000
  children and pregnant women between 2003 and 2008.  As published in the
  journal Pediatrics (Whaley et al., 2011), the LBL intervention was found to
  significantly improve children’s school readiness, and the program now
  continues in 10 WIC centers with seven partner agencies in Los Angeles County.
  Currently, LBL serves more than 70,000 children and pregnant women annually
  through renewed funding from First 5 LA. At a cost of approximately $52/child,
  LBL represents a low-cost, low-dose program that has the potential to reach
  hundreds of thousands of low-income children and families who often are not
  served by other family engagement and early literacy programs. Another unique
  aspect of this program is the distribution of corresponding educational
  handouts that WIC families receive.  These handouts inform parents about age
  specific child development milestones which help educate parents about their
  child’s growth and development.

  PHFE’s Little by Little School Readiness Program would like to replicate this
  program in other Los Angeles County Communities. In order to do this, we must
  work with our local state and federal legislators/decision makers to advocate
  for systems change so that the long-term costs for LBL’s early literacy
  education is supported by public dollars either through USDA (as part of the
  WIC allocation),the Department of Education and/or through local public
  funding sources. We propose hiring a Public Policy consultant who will help
  create and implement a public policy/education strategy to engage
  legislators/stakeholders.
