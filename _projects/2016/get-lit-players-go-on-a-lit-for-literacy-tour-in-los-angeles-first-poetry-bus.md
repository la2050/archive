  Over the past 10 years, thousands of testimonials and an external evaluator
  have confirmed Get Lit’s capacity to transform dismal statistics into a
  literate, engaged community of youth who have reclaimed their lives by
  claiming poems. 


  Get Lit will measure the impacts and success of the Lit for Literacy Tour
  using all key quantitative data elements – including how many schools
  implement our curriculum, how many students graduate from our program, and how
  many students attend performances – as well as qualitative data from student,
  teacher, and principal surveys that assess changes individually, in the
  classroom, and in the school culture. We will also collect and compare pre­
  and post­English Language Arts test scores in the schools that we work with
  and evaluate improvements in writing, reading, and memorization; increased
  life skills as students apply their learning across curriculum and make
  connections to future careers; and broadened horizons full of personal
  relevancy, hope, and renewed enthusiasm for learning. 


  Get Lit’s school curriculum promotes literacy and college readiness; develops
  critical thinking, public speaking, and performance abilities; creates
  leaders; and develops vital social skills that are rooted in self-awareness
  and confidence, personal responsibility, collaboration, and compassion. A
  successful Tour will achieve all this while increasing exposure to and
  engagement in media literacy and the transformative power of poetic
  expression.

  Beat poet Lenore Kendel once wrote she was “taking poetry out of the classroom
  and into the streets” and that’s just what she and her Beat contemporaries
  including Keroac, Ferlinghetti, and Ginsberg did. Their innovative poetry
  created a new art genre that they “took on the road” from clubs and gatherings
  to classrooms across San Francisco and the nation. 


  Similarly, you can HOP ON THE BUS with the Get Lit Players, an award-winning
  performance troupe made up of teenagers from high schools throughout Los
  Angeles, who are going on a “Lit for Literacy” Tour to share personal stories
  as well as classic and response poems from their new book “Get Lit Rising” to
  inspire youth literacy and social activism. A book alone can change a life.
  Especially this one, which youth can relate to the true stories of their
  peers' journeys navigating crushing circumstances to find hope and personal
  voice through poetry. 


  Currently, literacy rates in Los Angeles rank among the lowest in the state,
  with high school drop out rates exceeding the national average. This creates a
  sense of hopelessness and separateness in one of the country’s largest
  counties stretching over 4,751 square miles, with the second largest school
  district where over 90 languages are spoken and geography ranges from the
  ocean to inner-city to canyons. 


  Get Lit’s “Lit for Literacy” Tour creates a connection between these diverse
  schools and communities through the universal language of story and poetry.
  Combining the book with performances can lead to extraordinary transformation,
  setting lost youth on a path they did not even know existed. Through LA2050,
  the Get Lit Players will perform for over 30,000 teens at 50 Los Angeles
  middle and high schools, 10 libraries, and 20 community events, modeling
  engaged learning and performance achievement, and leading workshops from Get
  Lit’s unique curriculum which was recently approved as a University of
  California ‘A-G’ college prep elective. 


  The Get Lit Players will travel on the only poetry bus in the country, with
  original artwork by Ernesto Yerena, a Boyle Heights-based artist who trained
  for years as Shepard Fairey’s right-hand man. An online app will make it
  possible to follow the Tour stops and location of the bus, and a professional
  documentary crew will accompany the Tour to tell the story through the
  powerful medium of video. The completed digital film will be submitted to
  major film festivals and distributed online. 


  In this crucial time of elections with growing tension around police-community
  relations, inner-city violence, and inflated rates of type 2 diabetes,
  educating and awaking the activism of our youth has never been more important.
  Get Lit’s model has proven effective. Now we have the vehicle and book to
  reach many more people. By connecting Los Angeles youth from different areas
  and amplifying their voices to adults and policy makers, we can create a more
  engaged populace that betters the lives of all Angelinos to come.
