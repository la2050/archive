  The founding concept of CoachArt was to create an Ebay-like marketplace for
  students with chronic illness to be matched with volunteer coaches. The
  CoachArt Matching Platform will bring this concept to life by implementing a
  technological solution to our current volunteer program. We intend to move our
  entire process of engaging, training, and on-boarding volunteers online to
  reduce excessive overhead and time needed to prepare them to be matched with a
  student.

  For the project, we define success in how efficient and effective we recruit,
  train, and engage volunteers. 


  We will measure success in the following ways: 

  - Recruit volunteers more efficiently and effectively. We will achieve a 50%
  increase in the number of volunteers in our database

  - Train volunteers more efficiently and effectively. We will achieve a 50%
  decrease by moving trainings online with self-learner functionality

  - Provide a volunteer community. We will increase volunteer engagement by 500
  instances online in the first year of the creation of the volunteer forum

  Los Angeles is booming. From the re-emergence of a thriving downtown to having
  the third largest technological ecosystem in the nation, Los Angeles is a
  force to be reckoned with. Residents continue to find innovative ways to
  connect to the community and expand their impact. That community importance
  has also been prevalent in the world of volunteerism in the city. About 21% of
  Angeleno residents volunteer -- giving 283.3 million hours of their time
  amounting to $6.4 billion of services contributed per year.
   
  CoachArt wants to revolutionize how volunteers are matched to individuals in
  need by creating a platform to allow for ease, scale, and automation. We are a
  nonprofit that creates a transformative arts and athletics community for
  families impacted by childhood chronic illness. 


  According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, 22% of U.S. children live
  below the poverty line, and one to four of those children suffer from a
  chronic illness.  Caring for a child with a chronic illness can put a
  financial strain on a low-income family -- often 30-50% of a low-income
  family’s income goes towards healthcare and out-of-pocket costs.


  We have approximately 400 volunteers working with 1,000 children impacted by
  chronic illness through different arts and athletics programs. Each month, we
  have a backlog of between 15-20 volunteers waiting to be processed before they
  can work with students, which have resulted in a 70-student waitlist. To solve
  this problem, we are working to modernize our volunteer program. 


  Our current volunteer training and onboarding methods are slow and
  inefficient. Once volunteers are recruited, trainings occur in person, which
  can take 4-6 weeks to prepare them to work with our students. Additionally,
  volunteers only have four opportunities a month to participate in these
  in-person orientations. This limits the number and quality of available
  volunteers for our students. We plan to implement an online system where
  volunteers can sign-up, be prompted to conduct their own background check, and
  follow a self-learner training portal. With the support of this grant,
  CoachArt will be able to implement this new system, modernize our volunteer
  program, and impact more students.


  Moreover, our “moonshot” includes the creation of a replicable tool that will
  empower any current and future organizations with a matching model in their
  organization helping increase volunteerism rates in LA.
