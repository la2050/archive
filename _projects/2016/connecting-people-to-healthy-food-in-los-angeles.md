title: Connecting People to Healthy Food in Los Angeles
project_summary: >-
  We want to make a healthier LA! We think the best way to do this is to
  leverage current tech and build a platform to empower everyone with the right
  tools and resources to easily find healthy food.

  Our definition of success is primarily founded in the success of our cause. We
  hope to reach at least 50,000 residents through marketing and to get testing
  feedback from at least 10,000 LA residents to better understand the landscape.
  In addition to this, we would define success by partnering in 2 local advocacy
  efforts (with at least 1 policymaker) to further reduce the effects of
  food-deserts by the end of 2017. A few other metrics of success include:
  incorporation, earning 501(c)(3) status, and recruiting a pro-bono staff
  accountant to oversee the financial aspects of our project.

  Now that Food Oasis LA has created a minimum viable product, we desire to get
  this into the hands of Los Angeles residents from all walks of life. Being an
  entirely volunteer-run and non-profit organization, we are understandably
  seeking funding in order to assist with our goals. These goals involve heavy
  real-world usability testing, marketing and promoting our product to the Los
  Angeles landscape, and ultimately improving our product's UI/UX and back-end
  to maximize our effectiveness in LA.

  By performing usability research and testing to improve our product offering,
  we will be conducting research within the city/county and engaging residents
  and stakeholders at the same time. This will also give us a great amount of
  data to further analyze and understand the likelihood of adoption (or adoption
  rate) of technology for the city/county as a whole.


  Taking steps to ensure incorporation under the 501(c)(3) status will allow us
  to introduce operational overhead to push this project further and enhance our
  existing organizational capacity.


  Lastly, we feel that earning this grant will enable us to spend appropriately
  on paper-marketing materials, online-marketing services, and meeting-space
  rentals to further promote our desire to develop a solution to this
  food-desert obstacle. This spending would also give us the opportunity to
  advocate with policymakers and leaders in the community.
