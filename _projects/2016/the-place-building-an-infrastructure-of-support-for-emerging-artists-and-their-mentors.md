  We'll rent a commercial space & build infrastructure for The Partnership for
  Los Angeles’ Creative Education (PLACE), a collaboration between the
  nonprofits, DSTL Arts,  Emerging Arts Leaders/Los Angeles & our organizational
  affiliates.


  With our organizations sharing the space, we're committed to collaborating
  across all our programs to create a pipeline of arts mentorship & educational
  opportunities for creative, at-risk youth, emerging artists, & seasoned arts
  professionals, with various entry points for anyone from the ages of 16 to
  116. Via our mentorship programs, we intend to continue providing deep social
  & emotional support to our communities of emerging artists, especially those
  who are from communities which are continually underserved & underrepresented
  in the arts. 


  The centralized location will house DSTL Arts' programs, including our Arts
  Mentorship Program for at-risk youth ages 16–21, a new fiscal sponsorship
  program for individual artists, Art Block (a zine-making workshop series for
  youth ages 16–21) & Conchas y Café, an arts-literacy & creative writing
  workshop series for Spanish-speaking adults & caretakers of youth in DSTL
  Arts' programs.


  The space will also host regular, free-to-low-cost educational & professional
  development workshops for adults ages 18 & over, conducted by Trade School LA
  volunteers & Emerging Arts Leaders/LA, ranging in subject matter from art
  appreciation & DIY crafts, to freelance creative business & arts
  administration. Trade School LA, through barter-based programs, offers
  pedagogical training to anyone interested in sharing skills through workshops,
  regardless of age, providing a low-stress environment for knowledge-sharing.
  Additionally, Emerging Arts Leaders/LA will coordinate its Protégé
  arts-professional mentorship program out of the space.


  We'll rent a 1000–1500 square foot space within 6–8 months of funding, &
  purchase furniture & equipment to convert the space into a gallery & creative
  workspace for our co-working membership program, including internet, copy,
  print & phone service. The space will continually host arts-related events,
  including art shows, poetry readings, & book release parties that we will
  coordinate in partnership with all organizations forming The PLACE.


  We'll also purchase volunteer management software for The PLACE. DSTL Arts
  will utilize up to 10 volunteer arts mentors & interns yearly in support of
  our Arts Mentorship Program, & Art Block & Conchas y Café creative writing
  programs. Trade School LA will use up to 75 volunteer instructors & interns
  yearly in support of their educational workshops. Emerging Arts Leaders/LA
  will use up to 40 volunteers & interns yearly in support of their Leadership
  Council, “Protégé” emerging arts-professional mentorship program, &
  professional development workshops. Our shared infrastructure will match
  skills & interests of all volunteers with the appropriate programs.
