  For a community to be safe, everyone in the community needs to feel safe. We
  have to change the statistic of one in three women being assaulted in their
  lifetime, so we train women, specifically women who grew up in the mostly
  unsafe environment of foster care, that they can prevent violence and how to
  defend themselves when necessary.

  When girls are emancipated from the foster care system, they often have no
  support system and have few, if any resources to navigate life as an
  independent adult. Statistics show that as many as a third of them will have
  at least some periods of homelessness over the ensuing years.  During those
  years violence is common.  They are often the victim of intimate partner
  violence, and they decry homeless shelters because of the violence reported
  both in the shelters and in the surrounding area.

  Through the Fostering Safe Communities program we will

  * Transform the experience of young women coming out of the foster care system
  from having a victim mentality about themselves, to knowing that they have
  strength and skills that they have gained through the adversity of their
  situation

  * Empower young women with the confidence and skills to prevent violence
  against them

  * Give young women the confidence and skills to defend themselves when
  necessary

  * Expand the number of women who know it is their right, and that they can
  defend themselves, and how

  * More men and women will be aware that women can and will defend themselves,
  serving as a deterrent to would be perpetrators

  Through our advocacy to public and other nonprofit agencies, we will 

  * Address the issue of violence in and around homeless shelters

  * Continue to explore the needs of young women emancipating from the foster
  care system and meet with this population and the agencies to identify and
  create solutions for these women and the communities in which they reside
