  The success of our Give Los Angeles program will be defined by meeting two
  goals: to connect Angelenos with nonprofits in their community and to provide
  a sustainable business model for the program to continue in the future.


  In order to measure success in connecting Angelenos with nonprofits in the
  community, we will capture user data via the online Give Los Angeles Challenge
  to quantify how many donors are viewing nonprofit pages, sharing and engaging
  with the nonprofits on social media, and ultimately donating to each nonprofit
  partner. In addition to relying on online user data, we will also follow up
  with each nonprofit to assess how their organization was impacted by
  participating in the program - whether they saw increases in volunteers,
  increases in donations, establishment of new supporters, and inquiries into
  their services.


  To reach our goal of providing a sustainable business model for Give Los
  Angeles to continue in the future, we will assess two key metrics: first,
  revenues must exceed the operating costs incurred by Los Angeles magazine to
  produce the program. Second, we hope 75% of participating nonprofits exceed
  cumulative donation levels of $5,900 (the cost to participate in the custom
  publication and online challenge.) If this goal is achieved, we believe the
  participants will view the program as a valuable addition to their
  organization and ensure participation in the future.

  This winter, Los Angeles magazine is embarking on our most ambitious
  non-profit initiative, the GIVE Los Angeles Challenge. As a custom publication
  and online fundraising challenge, GIVE Los Angeles will connect passionate,
  engaged supporters with deserving non-profits, in an effort to encourage more
  local philanthropy. This is our public call to the people of L.A. to support
  local organizations by donating and/or volunteering.

  According to a 2016 study from the UCLA Luskin School for Public Affairs, Los
  Angeles is suffering from a 'Generosity Gap' and philanthropic giving in Los
  Angeles County has dropped over $1 billion from pre-Recession levels in 2006.
  This statistic, coupled with anecdotal conversations between business and
  civic leaders in the city, compelled the Editor-in-Chief and Publisher of Los
  Angeles magazine to propose a call to action for Angelenos to embrace local
  philanthropy by establishing the GIVE Los Angeles program. With a mission of
  informing citizens of the various nonprofit organizations available in the
  community and providing a way for nonprofits to share their stories, this
  program creates a platform to connect these important groups.


  Receiving a grant through LA2050 will immediately lend credibility to this
  pilot program and ensure its financial success, which ultimately benefits all
  the nonprofit participants who will use GIVE Los Angeles to engage with
  donors, volunteers and potential benefactors.


  Additionally, a grant from LA2050 will help conduct research by funding the
  collection of user data via the online giving challenge, to gain a better
  understand of giving patterns based on location, donation amounts and other
  demographics. 


  Ultimately, a grant from LA 2050 will provide a foundation for the GIVE Los
  Angeles program to transform the way Angelenos think about philanthropy. By
  engaging donors across the socioeconomic spectrum and connecting them with
  extraordinary nonprofits serving the Los Angeles community, GIVE Los Angeles
  will attempt to reverse the downward trend in civic giving in Los Angeles.
