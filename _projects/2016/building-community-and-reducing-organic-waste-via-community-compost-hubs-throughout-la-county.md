project_summary: >-
  L.A. Compost will create a countywide composting program, connecting the
  community with the soil that feeds them via workshops and use/access to
  neighborhood community compost hubs.

project_measure: >-
  The success of L.A. Compost will be measured by pounds of organics diverted
  from landfills, community involvement, attendance at workshops, finished
  compost/seedlings given back to the local community, and community feedback.

  Organics diverted from landfill: Scales, journals, and visual trackers have
  been placed at all our hubs and residents will continue to weigh and track the
  organics they deposit in our compost systems. 

  Community involvement and attendance at workshop: Our current diversion logs
  show how many people are visiting our hubs and using the compost bins weekly.
  By taking attendance at our monthly workshops, we will be able to measure the
  overall interest from the local community surrounding each hub.

  Distribute finished compost and seedlings to local community: The compost
  created at each hub will be weighed, recorded, and distributed to local
  growers. By providing this compost to local growers, individuals will have the
  starting block to grow their own healthy food. Along with distributing
  finished compost, seedling starters are made using old newspaper and finished
  compost. We will continue to keep track of how many seedlings are made and
  given away each month using the same method as our diversion tracking system. 

  Community Feedback: Community message boards will be used at specific hubs to
  address specific needs. Quarterly surveys will be emailed to all those engaged
  with the compost hubs and surveys will be given out at all workshops and
  workdays.

project_description: >-
  LA Compost is working to create an entirely local solution to food waste
  through composting. Our community supported compost hubs will keep organics
  within the same community in which they were consumed, and provide finished
  compost for local growers. By expanding our current countywide compost hub
  network, we will continue to divert thousands of pounds of organics from
  reaching landfills monthly, while also providing residents with the tools and
  education needed to compost on their own.

  LA Compost will help make LA be the best place to LIVE by reconnecting
  communities across LA County with their food, their soil, and their neighbors.


  Communities across the country are proving that local food systems not only
  work, but also are the way of the future. Areas such as New York, Austin, and
  Washington D.C have proven that local composting within larger cities can
  succeed, and have gained the support from their local city departments. Los
  Angeles is slowly moving in the right direction by appreciating the local food
  movement, but due to its expansive size, LA still has a long way to go.

   Los Angeles County is the most populated county in the country with over 10 million people eating daily. This ongoing purchase and consumption of food for over 10 million people leads to large amounts of food going uneaten, and if not donated to a local food recovery agency, ends up in landfills. Due to our unique situation in Los Angeles, the solutions for these problems need to be as creative and beautiful as the cities that make up our county. 

  LA Compost is creating a countywide composting program neighborhood by
  neighborhood. The hubs we place throughout the county keep organics within the
  same zip code where the food was originally grown or consumed, and they create
  a space for educational workshops and workdays to take place. They are a tool
  for educating the public about composting for soil health, a testimony to the
  practicality of composting, and a distribution center from which we send
  compost made on-site into the local community. 


  By keeping organics in the same zip code where the food was grown or consumed,
  communities become less reliant on trucks hauling their “waste” away. The
  material that trucks often haul away still has value, and can help with many
  issues that communities across the county are facing. Creating compost locally
  improves the way our soils store water, sequester carbon from the air, and
  produce healthy food. The act of composting locally increases a community’s
  ability to become self sufficient, as residents now have the means to grow a
  portion of their own food and manage their excess organics from the kitchen
  and their landscapes. 


  Beyond composting locally our hubs serve as an educational platform for
  residents to coexist well and learn alongside their neighbors. Our monthly
  workshops and workdays encourage residents to slow down, get outside, and
  interact with both their neighbor and the soil. When neighbors come together
  and are working towards a common goal, there is an undeniable sense of
  community. 


  We believe that taking responsibility for the environment you live in can be
  empowering and healing, and that Los Angeles needs just this. Composting is a
  beautiful, regenerative process that is collaborative, self-giving, and
  exemplifies the type of city we want to embody.
