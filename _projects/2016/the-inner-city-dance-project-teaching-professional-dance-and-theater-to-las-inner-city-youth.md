  The success of the project will be measured using three methods. The first
  method will take place at the five-week point of the intensive. We will host a
  meeting for all of the parents and students in which they can provide verbal
  and written feedback to the Artistic Directors regarding the progress of the
  program. Progress will be determined by the students’ increased interest in
  the performing arts, physical abilities, and sense of community at ZPA.


  The second method will take place at the final performance. We will provide a
  survey to all students and audience members asking for them to evaluate their
  experience, the quality of the instructors and performance, and whether or not
  they would continue to participate in the performing arts. 


  The final method will be determined by student retention. We will count the
  number of students that continue to take class with Zeneith Performing Arts
  after the summer intensive. Considering the financial cost of class, despite
  the 80% subsidized tuition, might prevent some students from continuing to
  train with ZPA, a successful program would be measured by a retention of at
  least 65% of the students.

project_description: >-
  The Inner City Dance Project will bring professional dance training to
  students who other wise would not be able to access this training due to
  financial and geographic difficulties. We will identify 40 middle school and
  high school students, 5 foster youth, and 5 Zeneith Performing Arts (ZPA)
  students to participate in a ten-week dance and theater intensive that will
  conclude with a performance. The project will also subsidize class tuition for
  students who train with ZPA after the project.

  With more than 28,000 performing arts jobs, Los Angeles has the nation’s best
  market for performing artists. However, young performing artists within Los
  Angeles’ low-income communities face poverty, crime, and other economic risk
  factors that can hinder their competitiveness in the performing arts
  industry. 


  To counter these factors, Zeneith Performing Arts (ZPA) will identify 40
  students from two inner city middle schools and two inner city high schools to
  participate in the Inner City Dance Project. These schools will be located in
  school districts that ZPA has a current working relationship with including
  Compton, Long Beach, Gardena and Los Angeles. These students will take ten
  classes per week in the areas of ballet, tap, hip-hop, jazz, Afro-Caribbean,
  modern dance, acting and performance. These classes will be challenging but
  not competitive, inspiring all students to work as a team and to value their
  performing arts community. In addition, students will take a field trip to the
  world-renowned Dorothy Chandler Pavilion to view a professional dance
  performance. This will introduce the students to the vast and masterful Los
  Angeles performing arts arena. Finally, the project will conclude with a
  student performance at an inner city theater to provide the students a
  well-rounded and creative experience as performing artists. ZPA will subsidize
  80% of class tuition for all participants interested in training and
  performing with ZPA for the remainder of the year.


  ZPA will also identify five foster youth to participate in the project. After
  implementing a dance program at a Long Beach group home in 2014, ZPA’s
  Directors recognized a critical need for an artistic discipline such as dance
  in these youth’s lives. The Inner City Dance project will inspire their
  creativity, talent and potential in the performing arts that will help them
  cope with the unique emotional and social risk factors they face in their
  homes and community.


  ZPA will also identify five of its current students for the project, as more
  than 90% of ZPA students meet the target demographic of The Inner City Dance
  Project.


  This intensive will also allow ZPA to employ professional dance and theater
  instructors who have overcome socioeconomic barriers to succeed in the
  performing arts industry. These instructors will serve as role models with
  whom students can relate.


  For more than fifteen years, ZPA has professionally trained dance and theater
  students who have come from single-parent homes, poverty, families that deal
  with physical and mental health issues, and other disparities common to
  low-income communities. Despite these circumstances, ZPA alumni have graduated
  from college, performed on Broadway, become dance instructors and pursued
  other notable careers.  Just as past ZPA alumni have done, the goal of the
  Inner City Dance Project is to inspire all participants to believe that, in
  spite of their circumstances, Los Angeles is a place where they too can create
  and thrive.
