  As a public media service, we measure success in expanding our audience by
  tracking growth in listening loyalty and membership support. We evaluate the
  impact of our programs through qualitative and quantitative metrics that
  examine listenership/viewership data, community feedback, participation via
  digital platforms, and attendance at live events. We measure our success in
  advancing access to arts and culture through feedback from the artists,
  storytellers, and public and private cultural institutions with whom we
  partner. We measure our success in educating and engaging the public by
  measuring the impact of our original journalism and special reporting
  projects. We measure success in building and engaging communities through the
  attendance and feedback received at our original live event programming. 
  These metrics inform KCRW’s leadership of the public response to our work and
  guide strategic decision-making and investment in new opportunities.

  In 2017, KCRW will open the KCRW Media Center—a 35,000-square-foot
  multipurpose facility that will be a vibrant, publicly-accessible performance
  and community gathering space for Southern California.  Already an influential
  source of news, music, and cultural discovery, we will expand our
  programming—on air, online and in person—to engage our devoted audiences here
  in Los Angeles and around the world.

  In 2017 KCRW will move into the state-of-the-art KCRW Media Center,
  custom-designed to allow us to expand our music and cultural programming,
  enhance our journalism, and build community among our devoted audiences in
  Southern California and beyond.


  KCRW is more than just a radio station. For over 30 years we have inspired
  curiosity within the hearts and minds of listeners through the creation of
  intelligent and thoughtful content. Each week KCRW takes audiences on a shared
  journey of discovery through more than 100 hours of original music, news, and
  cultural programming that enriches and informs millions of listeners.  One of
  the most respected music outlets, KCRW is widely regarded as the best source
  for independent music and a home for music discovery.


  KCRW is a thought-leading community center of Los Angeles. We bring thousands
  of people together by hosting and curating hundreds of events throughout
  Southern California each year.  Our engagement of these audiences has made
  KCRW what is today—the future of public media.


  The KCRW Media Center will be a Los Angeles landmark and a space to galvanize
  the public. We are working with our education partner Santa Monica College
  (the licensee of KCRW’s broadcast signals) to ensure that our new home meets
  production needs, reflects our history and unique programming, and provides
  unprecedented access to audiences. The KCRW Media Center is being built as
  part of an expansion to the College’s Center for Media and Design campus,
  located in Santa Monica’s Creative District near the LA Metro Expo Line stop
  at Bergamot Station.  


  A 1,400-square-foot performance studio and viewing gallery will enable
  hundreds of people to experience intimate live in-studio sessions and
  performances each week, and we will broadcast these performances to millions
  of listeners and viewers worldwide. KCRW will also have access to a
  180-capacity auditorium and an outdoor courtyard and stage that can
  accommodate 1,500 people for live concerts, cultural events and public forums.
  With the ability to present live public programming in its own space, KCRW
  will deepen its relationship with members, engage new audiences, and serve as
  a cultural epicenter for Los Angeles.


  Building the KCRW Media Center is only the beginning. KCRW will host free,
  public concerts, live talks, and cultural events in its new facility for all
  Angelenos to attend!
