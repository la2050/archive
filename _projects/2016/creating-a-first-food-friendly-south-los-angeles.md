  BreastfeedLA (BFLA) plans to increase its efforts to transform community
  clinics in South LA into Breastfeeding Friendly health centers affecting
  thousands of families. We will help implement comprehensive institutional
  changes that allow mothers to turn their breastfeeding goals into reality. In
  addition, BreastfeedLA and SFYB will work together to bring a dynamic
  culturally congruent breastfeeding education and support program to the
  underserved community of South LA.

project_measure: >-
  We aim to increase baseline exclusive breastfeeding rates by 3% over a
  one-year period in South Los Angeles.  This measure along with process
  evaluation will help measure and define the success of our program.


  We plan to:


  1.  Identify champions to participate in this project – 2 community clinics.
  (Several clinics have already expressed interest in participating)


  2.  Advocate for policy reform within community clinics to implement policy
  revision.


  3.  Educate and train health care providers at the chosen clinics.  This will
  be tracked through sign-in sheets.


  4.  Assist clinics with implementation of the State’s Guidelines and
  Criteria.  This will be tracked through MOUs with the clinics.


  5. Help facilities establish a follow-up support system for new mothers,
  including referring them to SFYB education and support groups.


  6. Assist SFYB to provide ongoing breastfeeding and education groups to
  African American families in SPA 6 and 8. To assess breastfeeding knowledge
  gained, a pre- and post-test survey will be administered at each session.
  Based on results in other programs, we estimate that participants will score
  an average of 5%-10% higher on the post-test compared to pre-test scores.


  7.  We will evaluate baseline, midpoint and concluding breastfeeding rates in
  South LA.


  8.  Ensure financial sustainability of programs. This will be measured through
  attendance of a financial sustainability workshop and pre/post surveys.

  BFLA is positioned to effectively help address the immediate needs of the
  community with direct services, resources, and technical support that is
  beyond basic health care.  A significant root cause of poor health is food
  insecurity within Los Angeles County, especially critically underserved areas
  in South LA.  Food insecurity impairs growth and development among children,
  affects academic success and contributes to childhood obesity.  BFLA can
  combat food insecurity and obesity with the promotion and protection of
  breastfeeding. The highest prevalence of food insecurity, poverty, and obesity
  is found in South LA.  The 2014 Los Angeles Mommy & Baby (LAMB) survey showed
  the lowest rates of breastfeeding were also found in South LA.  


  BFLA plans to make South LA the best place to live for moms, babies, and
  families through an innovative program supporting beginning families.  We plan
  to do this by providing prenatal breastfeeding classes and support groups
  through a partnership with SFYB and providing technical assistance to clinics
  to achieve improvements in communities with low breastfeeding rates. We will
  use the newly developed guidelines released by the State of California, The
  Nine Steps to Breastfeeding Friendly Outpatient Settings: Guidelines and
  Criteria. These guidelines provide a framework for community medical
  facilities to support breastfeeding and early infant attachment through policy
  development, professional education, discharge follow-up, and evaluation.


  By December 30, 2017, SFYB in partnership with BFLA will provide two series of
  culturally relevant breastfeeding classes and nine support groups for African
  American families led by a culturally congruent peer counselor and/or
  certified lactation educator (CLE) in South Los Angeles. The 6 hour course is
  taught over three weeks. 


  Using research and findings from focus groups, classes will link breastfeeding
  to the African American experience, history, and hope for better health
  outcomes. The program will address sociocultural concerns as well.


  In addition to classes and support groups, by December 31, 2017, BFLA will
  assist two Community Health Centers (CHC) with enhancing, implementing, and
  adopting policies that promote breastfeeding initiation and continuation.


  BreastfeedLA will support a minimum of two CHC’s in South LA to successfully
  implement practices and policies that protect, promote and support
  breastfeeding and create and sustain a community-based, universally
  accessible, support system for breastfeeding mothers and their families. BFLA
  will work with CHCs to implement evidence-based practices that have been shown
  to increase breastfeeding initiation and duration. BFLA will provide guidance
  on ways to deliver high quality, culturally competent breastfeeding promotion,
  support and care services to mothers and their families within clinics. BFLA
  will assist CHCs with establishing written procedures that ensure a
  breastfeeding-friendly clinic environment.
