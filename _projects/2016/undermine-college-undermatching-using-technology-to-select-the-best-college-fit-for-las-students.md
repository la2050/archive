  YPI’s College Choice Tool helps students find “best fit” schools for
  academics, cost, and preference, helping them earn a college degree with less
  debt.

  YPI works with ideas42, the behavioral sciences agency that developed our
  College Choice tool, along with the following LA Unified School District high
  schools: Miguel Contreras Learning Complex, Camino Nuevo, New Village Girls
  Academy, LA Academy of Arts & Enterprise, Larchmont Charter, RFK Community
  School, STEM Academy, APEX Academy, and Helen Bernstein High School. YPI also
  partners with UCLA, USC, Cal State Northridge, the Claremont Colleges and UC
  Berkeley to host college field trips.

  Overall outcomes associated with our project include the following:

  * 1,000 low-income students utilize the College Choice Tool and receive
  services from YPI College Ambassadors or Advisors (approximately 50% 11th
  graders and 50% 12th graders)

  * 252 students will enroll in college (LA2050 college matriculation metric) 


  Each College Ambassador works with 40 students to ensure they graduate from
  high school and develop a path for postsecondary success. Metrics used to
  ensure that the above outcomes are met include the following:


  * Each student participates in College Knowledge workshops to understand their
  post-secondary options;

  * Each student utilizes College Choice Tool technology to explore options that
  are the best fit for their academic achievement and interests;

  * Each enrolled student develops a post-secondary plan with goals, timeline,
  and specific steps, ensuring they are on track to enter into their selected
  post-secondary option after they graduate from high school; and

  * Each student participates in small group and individual advising to complete
  college and financial aid applications, personal statements, and enrollment
  paperwork.

  Too many low-income students “undermatch” when they apply for college, a
  situation where well-qualified students apply to less competitive or cheaper
  schools. They wind up at a community college, for example, when they could
  have gone to UCLA. YPI’s College Choice Tool technology matches students to
  the best schools based on their GPA, SAT/ACT scores and interests, resulting
  in higher college enrollment and completion rates, while reducing student loan
  debt.

  For anyone who has gone through it, you know how stressful and daunting the
  college application process can be. Getting into college takes a lot of time,
  effort and knowledge about just which colleges you should apply to and which
  ones may accept you. It’s an overwhelming process culminating in a decision
  that has long-term effects – college graduates have a lifetime earning
  potential of $2,927,000 compared to $1,193,000 among high school graduates
  (Harrington et al, 2010). No pressure, right? Now imagine you’re the first one
  in your family to apply for college, your parents have an 8th grade education
  and do not speak English very well, and your school’s college counselor is
  responsible for serving 700 students. That’s the reality for many of the kids
  we work with at YPI, and the lack of knowledgeable support results in
  'undermatching' where, for example, a high school valedictorian accepted to UC
  Berkeley who opts to enroll in community college due to concerns for cost.


  Ironically, the more academically competitive and expensive schools generally
  offer the most financial aid to low-income students. And academically
  competitive schools have higher success rates, so a qualified student who
  selects Harvard over community college is more likely to complete a degree
  than their undermatched counterpart. 


  YPI sees undermatching as an opportunity. We place College Advisors (paid
  staff) and College Ambassadors (full-time AmeriCorps members) at high-need
  schools to offer college readiness workshops and 1:1 advising. Advising
  sessions use YPI’s College Choice Tool technology, in which students input
  their GPA, SAT/ACT scores, and personal preferences like distance from home,
  cost, academic reputation, campus feel, and diversity. The Tool then
  calculates best match schools for each student to reduce undermatching. 


  Ambassadors and Advisors served nine schools in 2014-15. In these schools,
  only 33 students applied to a UC, 107 applied to other CA 4-year schools, and
  172 applied to a community college. In 2015-16 (the second full year of
  services with the College Choice Tool) results were dramatically different.
  106 students applied to a UC, 242 to a CA 4-year college, and 393 to a
  community college. After the 2-year pilot phase, YPI is ready to expand this
  program to nine new schools and serve even more students. YPI’s long-term goal
  is to take our College Choice Tool to scale so that by 2050, all LA high
  school students, but especially those with limited resources, will have access
  to this Tool to augment limited college counseling. This will ensure that
  every LA high school senior is matched to their most competitive and
  compatible college, resulting in higher college enrollment and graduation
  rates. This will ensure lifetime financial stability among LA’s youth, making
  LA not only the best place to LEARN, but the best place to PLAY, CREATE,
  CONNECT, and LIVE – all feasible thanks to the foundation of LEARNING.
