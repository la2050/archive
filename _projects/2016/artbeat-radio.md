  Following 35 years of progress towards inclusion and access for people with
  intellectual disabilities, Able ARTS Work launched Artbeat Radio, an
  innovative community project presented through the lens of disability culture.
  As engagement has increased and content producers are demanding more access to
  share their voices, Artbeat Radio is prepared to go mobile.  Programming has
  been hosted and produced by adults with intellectual disabilities since 2013,
  introducing communities to a population historically sidelined from society. 

  * Build new or enhance existing organizational capacity?

  Able ARTS Work aims to continue our role as disability culture advocates by
  delivering relevant, stimulating and meaningful content after 35 years through
  the creative arts.  We seek to continue this work by expanding an existing
  program to address the evolving creative goals of the resident artists who
  receive our services.  In doing so, we will continue our role as community
  leaders in the disability and arts community.  

  * Engage residents and stakeholders

  Our plan is to add the mobile element to a traditionally structured radio
  program. Our mobile recording studio will travel to a variety of community
  spaces, delivering “on the scene” coverage, providing resident artists and the
  general population an opportunity to engage with Artbeat Radio personalities,
  creative projects and contribute to themes addressed.  Participants will
  therefore actively make connections throughout diverse Los Angeles
  communities, revealing shared cultural, socio-economic and creative voices
  represented in disability culture.  Including the voices of a general
  population is relevant and crucial to our advocacy work in presenting
  inclusive opportunities for people with and without disabilities.

  * Expand a program 

  Expanding Artbeat Radio from a traditional radio program to a mobile program
  available to the community at large will bring participants increased
  opportunities to share their voices, make connections and actively participate
  in changing perceptions on disability.  Expanding the program will include the
  addition of community collaborative concerts, interviews and expressive arts
  therapy podcasts to an already successful music podcast program.  Those
  participating in the Artbeat Radio project will have the opportunity to share
  their contributions through social media, which will be further enhanced by
  broadcasting segments with our partners on KPFK 90.7 FM and KCSN 88.5 FM

  * How to Develop a communication or marketing strategy 

  In partnership with KPFK 90.7 and KCSN 88.5, Able ARTS Work will implement a
  comprehensive communications and marketing strategy targeting the disability,
  art, music, clinical arts therapy and education communities in the South Bay
  and other targeted Los Angeles neighborhoods.  Through social media and
  leveraging partnerships with ACLB and the LACAC, a communications plan will
  include the sharing of strategic information to build  engagement.
