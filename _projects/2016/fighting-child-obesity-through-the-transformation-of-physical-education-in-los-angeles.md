project_description: >-
  Los Angeles is in dire need of quality physical education resources and
  training within its schools. Sound Body Sound Mind (SBSM) plans to fill this
  void by providing recipient schools within LAUSD a state-of-the-art fitness
  center, SBSM Curriculum, and professional development training. This
  comprehensive package gives underserved students a space to transform their
  physical education experience, and P.E. educators new and inventive resources
  to implement within their class.

  SBSM commits its services to an array of student populations and needs that
  would otherwise go unnoticed in many communities. The lack of fitness
  resources is particularly acute in low-income and minority communities where
  safe outdoor play space is limited and an abundance of fast food restaurants
  has created the child obesity epidemic in Los Angeles. 


  According to the L.A. Department of Public Health, 42 percent of our children
  are obese or overweight. 


  Obese children have more risk factors than their normal-weight peers for what
  were formerly considered “adult” diseases such as cardiovascular ailments,
  hypertension, and Type 2 diabetes. Studies also show overweight and obese
  children struggle with peer-to-peer socialization and exhibit lower
  self-esteem overall. 


  At SBSM, we believe that eliminating childhood obesity begins by filling the
  void in quality fitness resources at school. Since 1999, SBSM has provided
  over 100 underserved schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District
  (LAUSD) with a comprehensive fitness program designed to promote lifelong
  confidence and wellbeing among adolescents. 


  Each school within our program receives a state-of-the-art fitness center
  equipped with commercial-grade cardiovascular equipment (ellipticals, hybrid
  cycles, spin bikes, and arm cycles), strength training equipment (weights and
  strength machines), and mobile equipment such as jump ropes and agility
  ladders. 


  In addition, each new school receives the SBSM Curriculum and professional
  development training. The SBSM Curriculum is an evidence-based instructional
  program combining circuit training, the fundamentals of movement, and
  methodologies for motivating students. The Curriculum provides 36
  age-appropriate lessons that are structured yet flexible, and also discusses
  the research and theories that inform them.


  Along with the tangible aspects of the SBSM program, fostering an inclusive
  and encouraging P.E. environment is especially important. The strength of our
  program lies not only in improving students' fitness, but also in beginning to
  change their mindset. We strive to create a sense of emotional safety in the
  classroom, thereby facilitating students' intrinsic motivation to exercise.
  Students learn that exercise is fun, and that they can succeed in maintaining
  physical fitness for the rest of their lives.


  Furthermore, students can incorporate these lessons outside of school, thus
  enabling them to independently combat the growing issue of childhood obesity
  and lowering their risk factors for Type 2 diabetes and heart disease. 


  Along with health risk factors, LAUSD is in critical need of exercise
  resources, with Physical Education budgets averaging only $500 per school.
  LAUSD schools are rarely able to compensate for recreational and fitness
  resources their neighborhoods lack. With implementation of our program model,
  SBSM can provide LAUSD with an impactful solution.
