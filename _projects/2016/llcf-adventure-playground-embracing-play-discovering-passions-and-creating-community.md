project_measure: >-
  We will define and measure the success of the Adventure Playground in several
  ways. Due to the fact that our mission revolves around the idea of
  reconnecting children to their imaginations and reintroducing play into the
  community, our most prominent method of measuring success will be through
  tracking the number of children visiting the playground weekly. The more
  children there are visiting the playground, the more children exposed to the
  concept of interactive play. In addition, the Light and Life Community Center
  values young adult involvement in the community and we wish to assist with the
  struggles of finding a job at this age. Therefore, another way we intend to
  measure the success of the Adventure Playground is through tracking how many
  internships and jobs the Adventure Playground is able to create. To summarize,
  the Light and Life Community Center will define the success of the Adventure
  Playground through analyzing how many individuals are participating in this
  outreach- whether being served or serving the community.

  We intend to construct an Adventure Playground, taking advantage of the vacant
  space that used to occupy a school on our campus. The playground will extend
  from the already existent community garden and encompass a center for learning
  about arts, building, and gardening as well as incorporating free play areas
  for children to explore. We hope that this outreach will connect with children
  and families of the neighborhood to create a safe environment to learn and
  emphasize the importance of play.

project_areas:
  - District 9 of Long Beach - Los Angeles County
project_proposal_best_place: >-
  Through the construction of the Light and Life Community Center’s Adventure
  Playground, we hope to take actions steps that will foster a sense of
  community and ensure that Los Angeles is the best place to play. We want to
  create the playground that children visit in their dreams every night,
  comparable to Peter Pan’s Neverland or Tom Sawyer’s Island. We want to create
  a playground that is simple and natural, connecting children to nature and
  creating a place for children to explore their surroundings. Why do
  adventure’s only exist in storybooks? Well, this doesn’t necessarily need to
  be the case. At the Adventure Playground, we will embrace imagination and
  exploration giving children the opportunity to create their own exciting
  worlds with wooden free play and climbing structures, obstacles courses, tree
  houses, and building centers. In addition, we will have guided play
  opportunities such as geocaching and scavenger hunts as well as a myriad of
  learning centers with focuses on visual arts, music, and sustainable
  gardening.


  The Adventure Playground will not only broaden the opportunities for children,
  but also connect parents and teens to the community. The Adventure Playground
  will be strictly operated by college and high school interns. Several young
  adults will attend to leadership positions, coordinating special events and
  overseeing management. Meanwhile, teens will act as mentors and counselors for
  the children. This will hopefully begin to counteract the difficulties of
  finding jobs for young adults and teach them to embrace community as well. In
  addition to creating job opportunities, we hope to create programs where the
  entire family can play. After the initial construction of the Adventure
  Playground, we hope to expand the opportunities for people in the community by
  hosting enrichment classes, after school programs, and summer camps. A major
  focus will be providing parenting classes while children are enjoying the
  playground. 


  The Light and Life Community Center focuses on creating outreaches that will
  empower the individuals of their immediate community. We are located in
  District 9 of the city of Long Beach, adjacent to Andy Street. This particular
  location is known for it’s high crime rates as well as abuse and neglect in
  the home. In addition, our zip code (90805) has the highest caseload for
  Department of Children, Family Services. We hope to counteract these
  statistics by strengthening families by providing a safe, learning
  environment. We want to increase the number of individuals and families
  spending their time in encouraging environments, thus decreasing crime rates.
