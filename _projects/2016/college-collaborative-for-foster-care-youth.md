  In order to track case progress for those youth who are assigned a CASA
  volunteer, CASA has recently transitioned to Efforts­-to­-Outcomes (ETO)
  Impact Software Solution, which is a web­ based, centrally managed application
  that allows staff to capture and review real­ time data for analysis and
  reporting on efforts, outcomes, and participant progress. With the
  implementation of ETO, we aim to: (1) improve the ways in which we capture,
  measure and assess our activities; and (2) improve the CASA volunteer
  experience through better recruitment, training and retention. ETO is the
  beginning of outcomes measurement at CASA. When a case is assigned, both the
  Senior Program Coordinator and the CASA volunteer examine the case and rate
  the status and level of risk of the child on a baseline scale along the three
  core dimensions of safety, permanency and well-­being. We now document in the
  database the initial assessment related to these dimensions; the advocacy
  goals and plans (steps and procedures to be implemented); the degree to which
  the plan is then implemented; and how the assessment of safety, permanency,
  and well­being measures changes over time. 


  Over the course of the grant period, CASA will 1) Establish three Memorandum
  of Understandings (MOUs) with other post­-secondary agencies and institutions;
  2) Serve 30 youth aged 14­-20 with Post-Secondary Advocacy; and 3) Develop and
  implement the Post­-Secondary Resources core training, which will be completed
  by 30 volunteers.

  CASA of Los Angeles is making a high-level commitment to expand the
  educational support our volunteers provide to foster youth through the College
  Collaborative. CASA/LA will establish formal collaborations with local
  partners to provide post-secondary readiness and support for abused and
  neglected youth, and will develop a training for CASA volunteers to better
  coordinate these partnerships. CASA will serve at least 30 additional foster
  youth in Los Angeles County through this advocacy.

  The comprehensive 2011 study “Young Adult Outcomes of Youth Exiting Dependent
  or Delinquent Care in Los Angeles County,” supported by the Conrad N. Hilton
  Foundation,  found that older youth in the care system are much more likely to
  remain there without ever achieving permanency. Over 30% of children who
  entered the system above the age of 12 aged out. Subsequently, by the time
  they are approaching the age of emancipation from care, they are also more
  likely to have endured multiple placements, leading to lost personal
  connections, a disruption of health services, and often, several changes in
  school which is extremely detrimental to both academic and social development.
  According to the study, of the youth aging out of the foster care system in
  Los Angeles County, one third experienced extreme poverty, 20% received
  outpatient mental health services, 25% spent time in jail, and only 25% were
  consistently employed. 


  All of these issues—challenges to maintaining educational continuity and
  meeting grade level standards in high school, failure to secure a permanent
  placement, as well as basic dependency care transition and independent living
  issues—converge when foster youth approach post-secondary education, so it is
  unsurprising that the Alliance for Children’s Rights found that only 3% of Los
  Angeles County foster youth graduate from college.  Equally important is the
  statistic that 70% of foster youth want to pursue a higher education. So
  what’s happening to this missing 67%, between the hope to attend and graduate
  from college and the failure to do so?


  As many CASA of Los Angeles success stories, and other success stories around
  the country, demonstrate, despite the serious challenges foster youth face,
  they can do it. But they can't do it alone. The critical relationship between
  higher educational attainments and more positive long-term outcomes for foster
  youth clearly indicated by the Hilton funded study is a powerful incentive to
  implement more effective strategies that address these missed opportunities.
  CASA intends to raise awareness around this important issue within the
  dependency care system, and with the support of other post-secondary programs,
  to facilitate more foster care youth attending college. 


  From the standpoint of the CASA, there is probably no other role in the
  dependency care system better suited for this level of advocacy. Because CASAs
  work with the youth one-on-one, and many hold the educational rights of the
  youth they serve, CASAs are able to make recommendations to the Court to
  request for services and supports to enable youth to participate in
  post-secondary preparation activities, and to better promote those
  opportunities in all areas of their life. By working directly with the youth’s
  teachers, counselors, case workers, attorneys, and care givers, CASAs help
  establish networks of support and services around educational opportunities
  for these youth, increasing their likelihood of educational success.
