  We will define our success by the number of people we connect to nature in LA.


  We will measure our success based on:

  Number of high school students engaged in after-school program

  Number of students participating in field trips

  Feedback from students and teachers surveyed re: their nature experience

  Number of college interns assisting with program management

  Number of people who attend our public nature programs

  Number of employees who participate in Silicon Beach nature awareness program

  Number of people participating in restoration at beach, creek, park and
  schoolyard events

  Number of acres of restored parklands and beaches (amount of trash and weeds
  removed and the number of native plants planted.)

  LA Audubon Urban Nature Explored connects people of all ages to outdoor
  experiences at parks, beaches and open spaces. We provide thousands of public
  school students from under-served communities with nature-based field trips
  and after-school programs. High school and college students receive
  stewardship training as part of paid internship programs, leading habitat
  restoration events that engage their communities and improve the quality of
  open space for people and wildlife.

  Urban Nature Explored will help make LA the best place to play through
  educational nature walks, park and schoolyard restorations, school field
  trips, and after-school programs at parks, beaches and open spaces.

  Locations include:


  Ballona Wetlands

  (1) “First Saturdays” a monthly event, welcomes people of all ages to explore
  one of the last remaining coastal wetlands. (2) Weekly school field trips
  bring thousands of students and their teachers to view the wetlands up-close
  through microscopes and binoculars, witnessing birds and wildlife that call
  the wetlands home. 


  Ballona Creek Watershed 

  All ages will participate in 2 Creek Restoration Days in partnership with
  Ballona Creek Renaissance (BCR), a non-profit organization dedicated to the
  long-term renewal of Ballona Creek and its watershed. The creek runs adjacent
  to the Ballona Creek Bikeway, where recent improvements include native
  landscaping, artist-designed gates and murals initiated by public and
  non-profit agencies, including BCR. This continuing process is creating a
  pleasant recreational facility for riders, walkers, joggers and families. 


  Silicon Beach 

  We will develop a new nature awareness program for the Playa Vista/Silicon
  Beach business zone. Employees will be guided on a lunch break exploration of
  the nature and wildlife found beyond the boundaries of their desk!  Employees
  will also be invited to 2 shorebird habitat clean-up days at the beach.


  Kenneth Hahn State Rec. Area

  Thousands of elementary and middle school students will hike the park during
  weekly school field trips led by docents and college interns who provide
  lessons in geology, plant life, and local wildlife found in the park. 


  Dockweiler & Venice Beach

  Led by LAAS biologists and docents, hundreds of students and the public will
  experience the beach in a whole new way during nature walks that explore sandy
  beach ecology and conservation. 


  Baldwin Hills Scenic Overlook

  Serving 40-50 high school students a year, our paid after-school and weekend
  internship program at Baldwin Hills Scenic Overlook State Park incorporates
  environmental science research, community leadership, hands-on habitat
  restoration, and art to address local environmental issues. Students lead
  hundreds of community volunteers in parkland restoration work and  help to
  maintain the schoolyard habitats and mentor younger students. Upon graduation,
  students become part of an alumni network eligible for future paid
  environmental work opportunities.


  Schoolyard Habitat

  Students will assist community volunteers to implement a new schoolyard
  habitat at Esperanza Elementary. The goal is to turn a once degraded area into
  a thriving outdoor nature lab with habitat for pollinators, birds, lizards,
  and more. Habitat plans have been approved by LAUSD officials, and LAAS has
  secured separate grant funding for design work and curricula development. The
  Esperanza Habitat will serve 800+ students and is modeled on our successful
  Habitat at Politi Elementary.
