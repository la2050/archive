Are any other organizations collaborating on this proposal?: ''
Please describe your project proposal.: >-
  By opening a community owned natural foods market,SoLA aims to increase food
  equity in South LA. We envision our store as a place not only for shopping but
  for learning about cooking and nutrition, a place for the community to gather,
  celebrate, share food, fresh juices, and organic coffee. SoLA Food Co-op
  promotes Healthy Food, Healthy Living, and Economic Empowerment.
Which metrics will your proposal impact?​:
  - Access to healthy food
  - Self-sufficiency
  - Obesity
  - Resilient communities
In what areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South LA
Describe in greater detail how your proposal will make LA the best place.: >-
  SoLA Food Co-op will empower the South LA community by bringing organic foods
  within reach . In an area anticipating much in the form of new
  development,including a new Metro line coming in, there is still insufficient
  access to healthy foods. SoLA offers an opportunity for community stakeholders
  to retain influence in and preserve the history and culture of the community
  through shared ownership of an organic co-op grocery. Simultaneously, SoLA
  will also be an attractive resource for new families moving to the area.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.​: >-
  By the end of this grant year SoLA will have a site selected and have begun
  external financing. This grant will make the next necessary steps in our
  development possible by funding the hire of a Project Manager, retention of
  our Outreach Manager, and professional co-op consultants. These experts will
  guide us as we build member/ownership, conduct market studies, select the
  site, and initiate a capital campaign.
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
  - 'Money '
  - Volunteers
  - Advisors/board members
  - Publicity/awareness
  - Infrastructure (building/space/vehicles
  - 'Education/training '
