  The proposed activities for the Man2Man Project are designed to give at-risk
  young males hope, goals, purpose, a positive attitude, and the knowledge and
  skills to become responsible adults and successful parents.  Objectives
  include:

  * Recruit, train, and involve at least 150 participants (15 Young Dads, 15
  Adult Mentors, 120 middle and high school youths) over a one year period

  * Increase social and emotional connections to positive male mentors and peers

  * Increase the rate of volunteerism in our community

  * Increase knowledge of male responsibility in pregnancy prevention

  * Increase respect for importance of parenting responsibilities and skills

  * Increase goal setting skills

  * Increase leadership, organization, and presentation skills

  * Increase respect for women and girls, especially parenting partners

  * Decrease incidence of unplanned pregnancies

  Friends of the Family (FOF) will develop and administer validated evaluation
  surveys to measure progress toward these objectives before, during, and after
  activities and will gather qualitative data via group and one-to-one
  discussions throughout the project. The surveys will measure changes in
  perceptions, attitudes, knowledge, and behavior. The domains of social and
  emotional competence, connectedness, and rates of volunteerism will be
  prominent measureable components of the evaluation.

  FOF utilizes a web-based data system called Efforts to Outcomes (ETO) to
  organize and track program information

  The Man2Man Project will expand the lauded Young Dads program at Friends of
  the Family in two ways.  Adult male volunteers will be recruited and trained
  to provide one-to-one mentorship for Young Dads participants, a majority of
  whom did not have a father or male role model as they grew up.  The Project
  will simultaneously train the Young Dads participants to work with middle and
  high school at-risk boys in an effort to prevent them from also becoming
  fathers too soon.

  The Man2Man Project (M2M) will help make LA the best place to connect by
  creating a network of support for boys and young men from disadvantaged
  neighborhoods who struggle to break the cycles of teen pregnancy and single
  parenthood that contribute to generational poverty and lack of opportunity. 
  The Project will be anchored in Friends of the Family’s Young Dads program, a
  long-term training and support program with a 20 year track record of
  success. 

  Research confirms that poverty has great negative impact on children and
  teens, creating an atmosphere of chronic stress that impairs attention and
  concentration and can lead to depression, low self-esteem and a sense of
  powerlessness over the future.  Children being raised by a single parent miss
  out on learning about healthy relationships. For boys, the absence of a
  positive male role model at critical developmental stages has a long-lasting
  impact.  They emerge from their homes into a culture that links masculinity
  with toughness, violence, and sex.  They face social pressures to initiate sex
  at an early age, a pregnancy happens, and the cycle is set to repeat itself
  for another generation. 

  The Man2Man Project seeks to interrupt this cycle by influencing two key
  metrics selected to measure progress toward making LA the best place to
  connect – enhancing social and emotional support and increasing volunteerism,
  in this case among multiple generations of boys and men in our community.  It
  has two key components:   (1) the Young Dads Impact Team and (2) the Adult
  Mentor program.

  Young Dads Impact Team members will be trained and coached to connect with
  middle/high school youths to educate them about male responsibility for teen
  pregnancy prevention and the real-life challenges of being a young dad.  This
  approach capitalizes on the peer-to-peer influence of young men who are close
  to the youths in age, come from their own community, and face the same
  challenges they do.  This activity also increases the self-esteem of the Young
  Dads as they recognize that that their life experiences have value as they are
  “giving back” to the community.

  The Adult Mentor Program will provide the kind of mentorship that Young Dads
  need as a part of their ongoing support system.  Adult male volunteers will be
  recruited from a variety of sources – academia, business, trades, sports,
  churches, retirees – successful men with a wide span of life experience to
  share.  They will be trained and supervised by qualified FOF staff to develop
  enriching relationships with individual Young Dads and provide insight,
  advice, and encouragement.  In turn, the Young Dads will be coached to become
  mentors for younger men following in their footsteps.

  By fostering the development of a vital network for men and boys to support
  each other “man to man” around the importance of responsible fatherhood, the
  M2M Project will impact future generations and help make LA the best place to
  connect.
