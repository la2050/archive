Please describe your project proposal.: >-
  The Patrick Henry Foundation, in collaboration with California State
  University Long Beach, will develop and incubate the Scientists, Engineers,
  Mathematicians and Innovators (SEMI) program, a new bilingual (Spanish and
  English) curriculum that introduces 5th grade elementary school students to
  STEM in a culturally-relevant manner.
Which metrics will your proposal impact?​:
  - Proficiency in English and Language Arts and Math
  - Early education
  - Student education pipeline
In what areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - South Bay
Describe in greater detail how your proposal will make LA the best place.: >-
  The Scientists, Engineers, Mathematicians and Innovators (SEMI) is a bilingual
  program that will help make LA the best place to learn by incubating a
  culturally relevant Science, Engineering, and Math (STEM) educational program
  for elementary students in English and Spanish. 

  Los Angeles County is one of the most diverse counties in the U.S. with 47.7%
  Latino/Hispanic, 27.8 % Caucasian, 8.3% African American, 13.5% Asian Pacific
  Islander and 11% other. Per Census data, 39.4% of the population in LA County
  speaks Spanish at home. This means that our future scientists, engineers,
  entrepreneurs and thinkers will be bilingual and bicultural. Not to mention,
  STEM opportunities are on the rise in the county with companies boasting
  innovation and new technology. The SEMI program will prepare all students with
  the opportunity to learn STEM in a hands on interactive course in both English
  and Spanish. 

  Patrick Henry Elementary School is 1 of 4 two-way English Spanish Immersion
  School in the Long Beach Unified School District, and the only school where
  100 percent of the classrooms are dual immersion.  The Patrick Henry dual
  immersion education gives children the opportunity to become bilingual,
  bi-literate and bicultural by the end of 5th grade. The school is designed to
  serve speakers of other languages and English speakers in the same classroom.
  The students are purposely mixed in the same educational environment to
  provide communicative and academic language development through an interactive
  and cross-cultural setting. Participation begins in Kindergarten and continues
  through fifth grade. 

  Over the past 2 years, the Patrick Henry Foundation (run by parents of Patrick
  Henry School students) has funded a “Teacher Innovation Grant” and subsidized
  a fee-based after school program (“Beyond the Bell”) to supplement the regular
  curriculum. These programs have expanded the curriculum at the school to
  include over $40,000 in new technology and web-based curriculum in the
  classrooms, as well as provided hundreds of students with science, arts, and
  technology classes before and after school. The Foundation would like to
  expand on these successful pilots to make these programs and technology
  available to all students at the school for free, and to refine culturally
  appropriate techniques for delivering these learning experiences to English
  language and Spanish speaking students.

  The combination of the English Spanish Immersion with a STEM Curriculum
  creates an innovative learning environment which will develop the next
  generation of scientists, engineers, mathematicians and innovators. The SEMI
  program will be delivered to all students at the school. Each class will
  receive SEMI instruction on a grade-level basis. Students will receive
  coaching and technical assistance on how to conduct projects and experiments
  in the classroom setting. The program is unique in that is designed to dispel
  negative stereotypes about scientists (e.g., eccentric, isolated).
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.​: >-
  The SEMI program aims to provide 1) a bilingual learning environment for all
  students to learn STEM in a culturally relevant manner in English and Spanish;
  2) train all teachers on best practices for teaching bilingual STEM material,
  3) provide technology to enhance student learning and teaching practices; and
  4) to provide the next generation of global thinkers by incorporating STEM in
  a culturally relevant atmosphere beginning in elementary school. 


  PHF will partner with CSULB to provide formal evaluation of the program.


  * Number of students participating in the program.

  * Student gains (i.e., science interest, non-stereotypical images of
  scientists).

  * Number of teachers trained on culturally-relevant STEM curriculum.

  * Student test scores before and after program participation.

  * Teacher and parent qualitative analysis of the program effectiveness.

  * SEMI Program Tool Kit (to be replicated at other schools).

  - 'Money '
  - Volunteers
  - Publicity/awareness
  - Technical infrastructure (computers etc.)
  - Network/relationship support
  - Quality improvement research
