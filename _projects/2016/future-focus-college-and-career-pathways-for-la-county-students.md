  Personalized college and career planning should not be something only
  accessible to the wealthiest Angelenos. In California’s public schools,
  college counselors on average can only spend 38 minutes once a year per
  student advising them on this critical process. The Future Focus program
  ameliorates this situation by providing group workshops and individual
  mentoring to students and their families to ensure that everyone is given
  equitable support to pursue their dreams beyond high school.

  Future Focus will make LA the best place to LEARN by improving the student
  educational pipeline, increasing college matriculation rates, and decreasing
  the rates of youth unemployment and underemployment.
   
  Educational Pipeline/College Matriculation Rates
   
  Currently, there are no county-wide programs to help students and their
  families navigate the transition from high school into college and career.
  Wealthy families can afford expensive private schools or personal coaches who
  will assist their children in the transition. For the rest of us, we are on
  our own to figure it out. The result is often stressed families, students
  entering college without a major or career plan, or students attempting to go
  to college but unable to due to mistakes made on college or financial aid
  applications.
   
  Future Focus, accessible to all, is a comprehensive college and career
  preparation program for students and their families that includes 11 group
  workshops and ongoing individual or small-group mentoring. The workshops
  include topics from the following categories: Planning for College and Career,
  Choosing a College and Career, Applying to College and Careers, and College
  Tests. The program is offered, in part or in whole, to students in grades
  7-12. Students build a portfolio with their transcripts, test scores,
  extracurricular activities as well as researched college plans that is
  maintained at the YMCA and updated annually.
   
  While most of the students’ research, planning, and applications are completed
  at the YMCA, families and school counselors are also engaged in the process.
  At a minimum, a students’ school counselor and family reviews college and
  career plans and provides feedback. In terms of financial aid for college,
  families attend the workshops and complete the applications with their child.
  The cost of college is a major concern for most students and families. Through
  Future Focus, students and families will make the final decision about whether
  or not they can afford college based on their financial aid award letters and
  not on a notion that it might be too expensive. Further, responses from the
  colleges are tracked and students are taught to follow-through to ensure all
  mistakes are corrected.


  Youth Unemployment and Underemployment
   
  The question, “What do you want to be when you grow up?” is not easily
  answered by most teenagers; it is not even easy to answer as an adult. Through
  Future Focus students will begin the exploration through web-based tools to
  discover personality traits and natural talents as well as possible careers
  that may be a good match. From there, they will research regional job growth
  categories, wages, and educational requirements. Students will explore
  internships and summer jobs in their chosen fields to determine fit, build
  their resume, and plan for future employment. All of their research and
  experiences are organized in their portfolio assisting them in their
  transition into college or career.
