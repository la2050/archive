Are any other organizations collaborating on this proposal?: 'LATCH Collective, Makes A Village, LLC'
Please describe your project proposal.: >-
  Makes a Village, LATCH Collective and the Patrick McCaffrey Foundation are
  collaborating to demonstrate how to use tiny homes to create
  affordable-by-design housing and increase self-sufficiency in Los Angeles.
  With $100,000, we can take 5 important capacity-building steps for
  implementing our approach.
Which metrics will your proposal impact?​:
  - Housing affordability
  - Self-sufficiency
  - Resilient communities
  - Homelessness
In what areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles
  - Locations of LATCH & Makes a Village are TBD
Describe in greater detail how your proposal will make LA the best place.: >-
  Our proposal supports Los Angeles in its goal of becoming housing secure,
  promoting self-sufficiency, encouraging resilient communities, and preventing
  further growth of homelessness, by enabling owner-built, affordable-by-design
  housing. We hope this model will have a ripple effect in LA, and encourage
  other models of creative housing solutions.

  Tiny Houses – Affordable-by-design:  While tiny homes are generally under 300
  square feet, they are highly customized to fit the homeowner's lifestyle and
  needs, and use design innovations to maximize useable space and reduce waste.
  Their small size substantially lowers build costs and increases efficiency. 
  The average cost of a Tiny Home is $22,000, allowing a minimum wage earner to
  become a mortgage-free home owner within four years using less than 30% of
  their income. There are creative possibilities available to a house with
  mobility incorporated into its design, most notably ease of syncing to
  existing infrastructure, allowing occupiers flexibility, and communities
  adaptability. Resilient communities are diverse and adaptable, and we believe
  increasing housing options to include Tiny Homes will make communities
  throughout LA County stronger and more resilient. 

  A Maker’s Space for Tiny Houses: LATCH provides the opportunity for Angelenos
  to take action towards increasing their housing security by providing the
  space, tools, training, and support necessary for collaboratively building
  their own affordable-by-design DIY homes. The benefits of this maker’s space
  reach beyond those directly involved in building a Tiny House. Community
  members will have access to educational workshops focusing on building
  specific skills like framing, siding, electrical wiring, etc. A tool share
  program will allow them access to rental tools they need to improve their own
  dwellings. LATCH will be a center for research, support and housing advocacy,
  offering assistance to anyone in Los Angeles in understanding their options
  for legally living in small structures, on or off wheels. 

  Helping Veterans Build Housing: By working with local agencies to identify
  veterans and other housing insecure candidates, we will sponsor these
  individuals to be participants of our “Hammer & Heart” program, which provides
  dedicated building space at LATCH and connects participants to the support and
  resources they need for a safe and successful home build. 

  Land for a Tiny House Village: Makes A Village wants to create a Tiny House
  village as part of their plan to help Los Angeles residents finance and build
  affordable housing. The village aims to have owner-occupied housing, integrate
  living-wage jobs into the community design, and implement a hyper-local
  economy. 

  Starting a Housing Cooperative: The development of our housing cooperative
  will allow LA residents an opportunity to work together to overcome high costs
  of living and participate meaningfully in the development and management of
  each housing community.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.​: >-
  1) SUCCESS IS LA County residents developing homebuilding knowledge and
  skills. THIS LOOKS LIKE 300+ hours of home building labor; 12+ workshops; 50+
  participants trained in shop safety; 80%+ of membership holders feel they’ve
  gained the skills and confidence to start their own projects; and 80%+
  individuals in, or desiring to enter, the homebuilding/related industry feel
  their experience with LATCH is beneficial to their resume or a future
  interview. 2) SUCCESS IS LATCH becomes valued as a home-building resource
  center by LA County residents. THIS LOOKS LIKE 100+ Community memberships; 12+
  Builder Memberships; 20+ Partner members; 10,000+ visits to LATCH online
  resource library; 100+ tool rentals through Tool Share Library; 50+ hours of
  1-1 consultation; 10+ municipal leaders visit LATCH; and 80% of partner
  members receive at least 1 client as from LATCH. 3) SUCCESS IS increase in
  self-sufficient homeowners. THIS LOOKS LIKE 24+ homes built at LATCH; 12+
  Veterans sponsored through Hammer & Heart program; 5+ traditional (non-tiny)
  homeowners support their mortgage payment through income from the
  addition/renovation of an SDU with support of LATCH. 4) SUCCESS IS laying the
  foundation for a permanently affordable village of owner occupied housing.
  THIS LOOKS LIKE PMF purchase of a site to develop a Tiny House village
  demonstration. 5) SUCCESS IS previous strangers connecting and willfully
  becoming neighbors. THIS LOOKS LIKE... Formation of housing cooperative.
