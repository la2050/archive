project_measure: >-
  The NDY Health and Recreation Center will teach youth and parents about the
  connection between obesity and other health risks, empowering families to make
  better health decisions, giving youth and local community members an
  opportunity to have structured physical activity in a safe environment, and
  job training and employment for youth.


  Success will be defined by the number of participants in programs in
  activities, fitness assessments to track progress and growth toward personal
  goals, and the number of youth that obtain employment and a “living wage.”


  During the first year, the NDY Health and Recreation Center will


  - provide fitness and nutrition education workshops to youth and family
  members to increase their understanding of the connection between obesity and
  the related health concerns and risks. 


  - provide physical fitness activities to youth and family members that include
  weight training, sports clinics, dance, aerobics and yoga classes to help them
  to become more physically fit.


  - provide unemployed and/or underemployed youth with job, operations
  management, and soft skills training.


  At the end of the year, 


  - youth and parents will increase their understanding of the connection
  between obesity and health concerns and risks as measured by pre and
  post-tests.


  - youth and family members who participate in the program will become more
  physically fit by reducing their BMI score.


  - employed youth will be placed in new job opportunities.

project_proposal_best_place: "The NDY Health and Recreation Center will make LA the best place to live by providing the most underserved communities with a place to learn, work, and exercise. \n\nOUR NEED\n\nYouth referred to New Directions for Youth (NDY) are at high-risk of, or already involved with, gangs, criminal behavior, substance abuse, victims of physical and/or sexual abuse, school failure, early pregnancy, or juvenile delinquency. NDY's programs provide a secure, welcoming environment for youth who are involved with the juvenile justice system, are in foster care, or who are experiencing poverty and hardship. Parents and guardians referred to NDY are challenged by issues of violence, economic hardship and lack of basic services. \n\nIn addition to the challenges these families face, there is a lack of nutrition education and physical fitness activities for underserved low-income youth and families. Traditional fitness centers are not available or are outside their financial reach. \n\nThe 2015 Obesity in California report from the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research notes that obesity has a greater impact on vulnerable Californians. \n\n-\t“Thirty-one percent of adult Californians below 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) were obese compared to 20% percent with incomes at or above 400% FPL.”\n\n-\t“The prevalence of obesity was higher among African-American, American Indians, and Latinos than among whites.” \n\n-\t“Neighborhood safety is linked with obesity and physical activity… (The) lack of safety can hinder physical activity and increase stress.”\n\nOUR SOLUTION\n\nThe NDY Health and Recreation Center will have weights, a dance studio, and cardio equipment that youth and their family will be able to use. These fitness activities and workshops will be available to help reduce obesity and the onset of chronic conditions in disproportionate rates for high-risk and underserved minority populations in Los Angeles. (NDY clients currently served are 70% Latino/Hispanic; 10% African American; 10% Caucasian; and 10% from other ethnic backgrounds.) The Center will also provide healthy opportunities for stress relief to individuals facing life’s most difficult challenges.\n\nTo further help the community, the NDY Health and Recreation Center will also provide job training and employment to local youth. The Center will be led by youth employees (ages 16 – 24) who will oversee day-to-day management. For many, this will provide a first time job experience that will give them an opportunity to build their résumé and provide them the necessary hard and soft skills to gain employment."
