  L.A. Works has designed the following program goals and outcomes to guide our
  evaluation. These ensure we meet our overarching goal of connecting music
  industry professionals to after-school music program opportunities in order to
  (1) raise the profile of service in the community to increase the rate of
  volunteerism, and (2) strengthen music education for underserved youth.


  For the volunteers, volunteer leaders, and nonprofits, L.A. Works will conduct
  post-project surveys to collect the relevant data in order to track and
  measure our success in achieving the desired outcomes. We will ask that the
  nonprofits provide us with quantitative data on the impact the volunteers have
  had on their mission and clients served.


  We will track the following outcomes in order to measure the success of this
  program:

  • Number of masterclasses or collaborative concert between
  renowned/professional mentors and students from selected nonprofit
  organization. 

  • Percentage of volunteers that continue to volunteer at ongoing opportunities
  after participation at masterclass. 

  • Number of non-professional teaching artists serving as teaching assistants
  to classes, rehearsals and concerts. 

  • Funds provided by new donors to the program. 

  • Academic and social gains of youth who participate in extracurricular music
  program with a mentor.

  To leverage our prime location in the capital of the entertainment and music
  industries, L.A. Works has launched MusicWorks to harness the excitement
  garnered by music-industry professionals in order to significantly increase
  volunteerism in L.A.. This project will make L.A. the “best place to connect”
  by bringing together music industry pros with after-school music programs to
  excite youth participants; inspire a new cadre of skilled-volunteers; and
  raise the profiles of the programs served.

  Through volunteer mobilization and management, as well as some creative
  marketing, L.A. Works will address the challenges facing music education
  programs. We have launched the pilot MusicWorks program to connect volunteers
  from the entertainment and music industry to collaborative music projects.
  During the one- to eight-week long projects, students will prepare for and
  participate in a “masterclass” or concert session with a guest artist,
  culminating in an intimate performance showcasing the collaboration and aimed
  at attracting new volunteers to the host nonprofit. Each project is to be
  professionally filmed by a volunteer, resulting in a 3 to 5- minute video used
  to promote our incredible partner organizations and the MusicWorks mission. 


  In addition to these project-based opportunities, MusicWorks volunteers are
  individually vetted and placed in ongoing opportunities at over forty
  nonprofit programs as volunteer teachers, teaching assistants, and other roles
  as appropriate. Our volunteers are musicians, producers, directors, teaching
  artists, recording artists and other entertainment professionals and
  amateurs. 


  Early, intensive, consistent educational intervention, provided by volunteers
  through in-class and after-school programming, can help struggling children
  achieve more than double the academic and social gains of their peers who do
  not receive these services. In the recession years half of California's public
  schools shuttered their music programs. As a result, there are now 700,000
  fewer students enrolled in school music classes than before the budget cuts,
  with California ranking last in the nation in the ratio of music teachers to
  students.


  Additionally, Los Angeles ranks an appalling 45th out of 51 major cities in
  the U.S. for volunteerism. Long commuting times and high poverty rates can
  adversely affect volunteering rates and the most frequently cited reason for
  not volunteering is not knowing how or where to plug-in. In a region as
  diverse and vast as L.A., we need to make it easy for people to connect to
  service. Leveraging celebrity reach for MusicWorks will increase total number
  of local social media friends and connections Angelenos have, organically
  spreading the word about this volunteer opportunity, and drive volunteer
  participation rates to increase – moving us from the embarrassing 45th place
  nationally.


  Of course equally important to our L.A. pride, is the positive benefits that
  will come from significantly increasing the rates of volunteerism.
  Volunteerism is an avenue for individuals to have first-hand experience in
  learning about the pressing issues in the community; it bridges gaps within a
  community for greater cohesiveness and diminishes residential segregation; and
  inspires further action to bring about change. With the help of this award, we
  hope that in the near future, L.A. will be thought of as a model for service
  as much as we are known for entertainment, sports, and our weather.
