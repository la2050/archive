project_description: >-
  Over the summer of 2016, we piloted an 8-week internship program that uses the
  United Nations Sustainable Development Goals to teach youth that their local
  actions have global relevance. Youth intern with non-profits or local elected
  officials for 10 hours a week, and then spend another 10 hours developing
  their own project that addresses an issue such as sustainability, poverty, or
  inequality. With this proposal, we will expand this program to thirty students
  across LA County in 2016.

  Student education pipeline: 

  We will impact the student education pipeline by bringing together underserved
  high schoolers, community college students, and 4-year college students in Los
  Angeles. By bringing these groups of students together, we hope to create role
  models for high schoolers that can encourage them to go to college and
  graduate. In addition, we will hold students to university-levels of research
  and writing during their summer internships, which will help them prepare for
  their college career. 


  Youth Employment and Underemployment: 

  We will focus on youth unemployment and underemployment through tackling the
  skills-gap with high school and college students. In particular, we will focus
  on developing skills that are needed for effective leadership in public
  service, such as: conducting research, developing presentations, public
  speaking, writing budgets and reports, conducting interviews, building social
  media campaigns, and connecting with the public. 


  CONNECT: Rates of volunteerism

  In addition, our project will address the “rates of volunteerism” metric under
  CONNECT. We will do this through having students volunteer 10 hours a week
  with a non-profit or government office over the summer. 


  LIVE: 

  Finally, our project will potentially address all LIVE metrics, depending on
  the community improvement projects our students propose.
