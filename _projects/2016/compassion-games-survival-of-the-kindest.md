  Pick a compassionate action for you and/or your group:

  Each hour of a community service project, per individual translates into 1
  (one) Point”

  Each act of compassion per individual translates into “1 (one) Point”

  Every dollar raised for charity translates into “1 (one) Point”

  Every item collected for charity translates into “1 (one) Point”

  As an individual, your points are pooled with your organization and then your
  county (we'll be playing as a county rather than a city). Then your actions,
  projects, stories, etc. are added to the Compassion Map where the whole world
  can witness the Compassion Games efforts. To learn more about finding a way to
  participate in these games, go to CompassionGames.org.  Once you decide what
  service you will participate in or organize, you publish it on the Compassion
  Map: http://compassiongames.org


  Once you’ve participated in a Compassion Games, report on the hours spent.
  Every compassionate hour brings one point to the city. At the end of the games
  all the data is published and we learn how we fare against other cities.

project_description: >-
  No other initiative has struck a nerve, inspired the uninspired, raised the
  eyebrow of the skeptic, or gotten the attention of the weary and the tired as
  much as the Compassion movement.  And no idea to mobilize people into a new
  way of being compassionate has been more creative, effective and awe inspiring
  than the Compassion Games: Survival of the Kindest. Next year we want to
  transcend the geographical divide and include LA County in our efforts.

  The Compassion Games are designed to make our communities safer, kinder, more
  just, and better places to live, work and play. Touch somebody’s life! By
  participating, players are called upon to perform acts of service and kindness
  in our neighborhoods, on the job, in service-providing agencies, and wherever
  their daily journey takes them. The acts of service are organized service
  projects or simple acts of kindness to aid a neighbor in need. If a project
  already exists during this time, simply add it to the Compassion Games family
  and get more attention and support. Showing up in the most unexpected places,
  organizing in formations unseen before, expanding and deepening in ways no one
  could have designed, the Compassion Games is proving to be a license to dream
  and find new solutions to old problems. What’s more, the Games make it OK to
  do serious work and have fun while doing it. Inspired when Mayor Greg Fischer
  suggested his city of Louisville, KY was “ the most compassionate city until
  proven otherwise,” Compassionate Seattle took him up on it. Both great cities
  put their days of community service in the ring and the Compassion Games were
  on. It did not take long before other cities heard the same challenge. Santa
  Monica, Nashville, Milwaukee, Cincinnati, New York City, even Gurgaon India
  galvanized their communities and proved they knew what “coopetition” means.
  Santa Monica has been participating since 2013 and its City Council voted
  unanimously to sign and affirm the Charter for Compassion in September of
  2013, making it the first city in LA County to do so and 4th in the state of
  California.  LUSH cosmetics sponsored our compassion cards and media kits. 
  From the promenade we inspired and promoted compassion all over our city. 
  Reports were submitted through a crowdmap and data was collected. At the heart
  of the Compassion Games’ purpose is the belief that within each of us exists
  an innate, powerful, and ready kindness. We’re passionate about harnessing
  this kindness in service of “compassionate action”, defined as action
  motivated by the intention to alleviate others’ pain and suffering. We're also
  passionate about the importance of playfulness and fun as an effective means
  by which to build healthy community. The games are a way for civic leaders,
  community organizers, educators, parents, non-profits, religious groups, and
  businesses to produce collective impact. We are here to uplift each other, to
  help each other, be kind to each other, and serve each other. We play the game
  in at least three ways:

  1. Community service projects (create your own or pick one of our suggested
  ideas)

  2. Individual random acts of kindness

  3. Games that build personal and community resilience
