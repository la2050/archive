  1) We define success as the creation of meaningful and sustained relationships
  among community members, organizations, and government officials. 


  -Establish multiple one on one meetings and increased communication between
  electeds and stakeholders strengthens the communities voice far beyond simply
  voting. 

  -Have 8-12 elected officials and their staffers attend our LA Poverty Hearing
  in 2017.

  -Have at least 10 core partners and their members participate and attend our
  Poverty Hearing, lobby days, and actions.

  -Collect 2-3 personal testimonies of partners on their experience working as a
  collective.

  adding more partners to our coalition, and engaging them in county level
  work.

  -Invite 5-7 new organizations to become core partners in our LA chapter.

  -Identify 2-3 county priorities and create community strategies with CAP LA
  partners.

  relationships and build new ones to amplify their voice.

  members.

  California Partnership’s (CAP) goal, as a statewide economic justice
  organization, is to sustain the safety net and ensure low income folks and
  communities of color have access to adequate health and human service
  resources. Los Angeles is home to our longest running and strongest chapter.
  Our LA partnership is made up of community folks, grassroots organizations,
  policy advocates, statewide organizations, service providers, and labor unions
  who come together to solve issues impacting our communities. 


  Our project will build off our work by expanding our efforts in community
  education and outreach, help build stronger, effective relationships among our
  different partners and elected officials representing greater Los Angeles, and
  continue our community-driven strategies and policy advocacy at the county
  level. By providing these tools and resources, we hope to increase
  accountability, transparency, and build trust between Angelenos, elected
  officials, and other governmental stakeholders.   


  Community Education

  At California Partnership, we conduct budget presentations and trainings on
  county and state systems in a community friendly way.  We also provide
  resources that help break down state and local legislative processes. Our
  project will continue to foster accessible, shared learning spaces by
  providing multilingual resources and expanding our reach to communities and
  organizations all across LA county. Our goal is for our trainings to engage
  community leadership to take initiative and share these strategies with their
  own members.


  Relationship Building

  Through our monthly chapter meetings, community groups and organizations from
  all over Los Angeles county doing various types of work come together to work
  through shared values and common concerns. CAP uses a shared leadership and
  development framework, where our partners help decide what our priorities are
  as a collective. Our goal is to continue to support our partners’ work and
  build a common understanding that the work we do is multifaceted and requires
  an intersectional framework. 


  It is important that we build relationships with elected officials, staff, and
  agency leaders so there is an open line of communication established between
  governmental stakeholders and their constituents.Our proposal seeks to
  strengthen government and community ties by collaborating on community events
  and forums, doing one on one visits with officials and their staff, and
  providing opportunities for open dialogue, where community members can express
  their concerns and work alongside political stakeholders to create change. 


  Strategy and Implementation

  CAP’s statewide work has been instrumental in our local advocacy efforts
  because of the state budget’s impact at the county level. Our project looks to
  further delve into countywide policy advocacy and implementation by engaging
  both core and new partners in identifying local issues, expanding our tools
  and trainings, and tracking county policy.
