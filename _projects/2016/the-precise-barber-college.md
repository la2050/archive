  We will be collaborating with Mr. Gabe Torres, owner/operator of Precise
  Barbershop in Long Beach.

  We will measure success by the number of students who graduate the program.
  Considering some of the barriers that our youth have faced and continue to
  face as they receive CHC supportive services and shelter while attending the
  college, we would be pleased with a scholarship student graduation rate of
  80%.


  We will measure success by the number of students who gain meaningful
  employment as a barber or hairstylist after graduation. With a license in
  hand, each graduate will be qualified to work as an entry-level barber
  anywhere in the country and earn a respectable wage doing so.


  Another measure of success will be our ability to draw customers for haircuts
  at the college. Establishing a reputable brand will enable us to engage the
  community and provide value in the neighborhood. Low and no-cost haircuts to
  targeted populations (homeless, elderly, school-aged youth) will be served
  through appointments and walk-ins. The more customers come in, the more
  practical experience students receive and resources are added for
  sustainability of the project. 


  We will measure success by our ability to ensure a sustainable social
  enterprise that increases the capacity of Angelenos to earn, start their own
  businesses, and serve the greater good.


  Finally, we will measure success by our ability to inspire our graduates to
  become involved with their community. We want to show them the power of social
  profit, and we fully expect to see a rise in local volunteerism and
  collaboration.

  So many of the jobs available to homeless youth are low-paying jobs, and we
  think they deserve more than that; they deserve the opportunity to have a
  career. We will use these resources to open a barber college attended by
  traditional students and homeless youth where they can become certified
  barbers. The college will encourage an entrepreneurial spirit rather than a
  charitable one, and its students will quickly understand the ways in which
  community and service work together in L.A.

  In order for homeless young people to truly be independent, they are going to
  need careers, not just jobs.  We will take the best of the for-profit world –
  the aggressive pursuit of customers, an emphasis on efficiency, and the
  flexibility to meet the needs of the community– and combine it with the best
  of the non-profit world – an understanding of the ways people navigate dark
  times, an unconditional approach to engagement, and a love of finding
  resources and opportunities where there appear to be none.


  This will help to make L.A. the best place to live because it will seize upon
  the fact that this city is ripe with resources, viewpoints, opportunities, and
  purposeful struggle. This social enterprise is a business that will ensure
  that the capacity for earning power is equal between homeless and non-homeless
  alike, equipping all with in-depth trade knowledge and small business acumen
  taught by an expert in the field, and provide a new understanding of just how
  close we all are, despite the challenges we’ve faced. This cooperative model
  creates a higher level of accountability and opportunity for community
  engagement; its income will not only fund the efforts of the college, but will
  underwrite the comprehensive services that we provide to Los Angeles’ homeless
  and trafficked youth.


  We are firm in our belief that non-profits and for-profits have a lot to gain
  from one another. The charitable sector could be better at being unapologetic
  about economic progress and businesses could be better at understanding the
  real needs of the communities they call home. This project will address the
  issue of rent burden and earning capacity in L.A. Those armed with a trade
  that is relevant in a city this that employs hairstylists for myriad
  entertainment productions as well as the thousands of opportunities for barber
  positions. What’s more, we will create a body of graduates who will also be
  schooled in the art of starting and managing their own small businesses, a
  skill that translates anywhere. Finally, with the emphasis on service, we will
  generate a population of young, eager men and women with an eye for justice. 


  Students enrolled in the barber college will have the option of joining our
  street outreach team and offer free haircuts to youth who are still on the
  streets. This takes the charitable model of service in the community and turns
  it on its head – we’re accustomed to the ‘givers’ in society being those who
  are blessed with resources but we know from experience that our youth who have
  the least are eager to give, and we couldn’t be more excited to help nourish a
  whole new population of givers who are creating positive change in L.A.


  We are eager to witness the effect that hundreds of service-oriented graduates
  with earning power and a unique perspective on social engagement will have on
  our social and fiscal economies. We are building a replicable model that
  serves people, inspires service, and facilitates connection between Angelenos.
