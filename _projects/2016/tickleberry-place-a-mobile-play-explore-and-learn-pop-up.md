project_measure: >-
  a. An increase in attendees to our pop-up events. Through our marketing
  efforts, we will increase attendance at our events and develop a loyal
  following for future events.


  b. An increase in community engagement/support. Our branded outreach programs
  will communicate our goals to the community. We envision a large, diverse and
  dedicated group of supporters and advocates.


  c. An increase in the number of business partnerships/collaborations.
  Partnering with like-minded local businesses is a win-win proposition for all.
  Cross-promotion and collaborations will increase visibility and business
  opportunities.


  d. An increase in the number of school and after-school programs. Developing
  programs specific to a school’s needs will foster growth while exposing both
  teachers and students to the virtues of Tickleberry Place.


  e. An increase in followers on social media. Again, through our marketing
  efforts, we will increase the number of active and engaging followers on
  social media through consistent and informative dialogue.


  f. An increase in opt-in email addresses. We will implement email address
  captures at every pop-up event or activity. With these opt-in records, we can
  target our audience and provide updates, information and news about
  Tickleberry Place. 


  g. Business profits. Turning our events into profitable enterprises will allow
  us to re-invest. With better organization, planning and marketing strategy, we
  can lower costs while exceeding expectations.

  Our project will make LA the best place to PLAY because we’re committed to
  bringing healthy play environments to South Los Angeles. Tickleberry Place is
  currently in the process of securing its first brick-and-mortar location. But
  in the meantime, our monthly mobile pop-up play events will be an introduction
  to our indoor play concepts and activities. We hope to build an avid following
  in the community, engage area businesses that advocate eco-conscious living
  and to generate buzz and excitement for our pop-up play events.


  Our program features both play and learning activities that will teach
  children how to be healthy and environmentally conscious through exercise,
  recycling, eating healthy and water conservation. Our pop-up play events will
  be held monthly at local parks, community centers and open spaces available
  for usage. We are also working in conjunction with local elementary schools to
  provide pop-up programs as an after school activity. Being mobile allows us to
  bring the FUN to you and your neighborhood.


  Tickleberry Place pop-up play events will create impact in our community by
  encouraging families to PLAY, EXPLORE and LEARN alongside their children as
  well as interact with other eco-conscious families and businesses. The best
  way to affect change from a grass roots level is through organic growth. The
  more children and families exposed to the virtues of Tickleberry Place will
  help foster this growth, which will ultimately assist us in promoting our
  brick-and-mortar site.


  Tickleberry Place remains committed to children having fun in a safe and
  positive environment. Whereas learning about sustainability or water
  conservation may not be at the forefront of any child’s mind, we will
  encourage participation and EXPLORATION through fun and exciting activities.
  Gardening or planting seedlings and tracking its growth are activities we have
  incorporated. Seasonal activities revolving around the holidays or special
  events are other fun ways to help children LEARN. 


  PLAY remains the primary focus for Tickleberry Place and we will provide
  unique toys, activities and play structures that stimulate imagination and
  expression. Building life-size fortresses or castles, dressing-up and face
  painting, pumpkin decorating or crafting Valentine’s Day cards dedicated to
  the environment are but a few of the planned activities for our monthly pop-up
  events.


  We envision Tickleberry Place becoming a beacon in the community, drawing
  children and families together who are looking for a safe and FUN play
  environment that offers much more than just supervised free play. Our monthly
  mobile pop-up play events will be the perfect vehicle to establish our
  community roots and to help spread the seeds for continued growth.
