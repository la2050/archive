  Social & emotional support- After each event we give participants practices to
  do on their own to help them create and sustain their own methods for healing
  and connection which supports the health and wellness of both the individual
  and the community they are a part of. We will have surveys and online chat
  rooms designed for people to engage and report on their feelings of support.  

  Cultural events - We honor the diversity within our communities and our
  gatherings offer creative, and innovative ways of bringing connection to
  people from all walks of life. Success for these events are influenced by the
  amount of attendees and the overall impact that the events are having on
  attendees and their communities.  These impacts can be measured through
  post-gathering surveys and interviews.

  Public/open streets gatherings - We plan to create two large, communal music,
  art, wellness, and cultural festivals that will bring together all the
  communities we’ve worked with and others.  Each community will be able to
  contribute in some way which will ultimately show the power of community in
  co-creation. We will measure the success by how many communities decide to get
  involved and their enthusiasm in helping. 

  Rates of volunteerism- We intend for the large festivals to be volunteer
  based, and will track the number of volunteers helping out with each event. 
  As our other events become larger we will also have volunteers help with
  setting up and breaking down spaces, and other tasks.

  LA is one of the largest and most spread out cities in the country. It houses
  many diverse communities, but is also a place where many suffer from feeling
  lonely, isolated, and disconnected due to the vastness of the city. Recent
  studies show that rates of loneliness are increasing throughout LA, and
  bringing symptoms like anxiety, stress, and depression with it. This is
  undoubtedly affecting Angelenos’ physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual
  well being and is likely to be a major factor in community wellness and
  overall engagement. In order to make LA the best place to be in 2050, we must
  CONNECT our people and communities with each other in new and innovative ways
  that promote empowerment and wellness, which lead to further strength,
  vitality, and engagement within communities. 

  Nation of Vibration’s (NOV) mission is to bring people together to connect in
  conscious, compassionate, and mindful ways with the collective intention of
  moving away from limited notions of ourselves and others, so we can come
  together to heal our communities, and the planet at large.  The L.A.vation
  Project will do this by creating community-centered events that are focused on
  generating trust, accountability, and responsibility through practices that
  give people the tools to overcome anxiety and fears, so they have ways to
  engage deeply within society.  Some of these events include, but are not
  limited to: cultural sensitivity and education trainings, meditation circles,
  yoga classes, conscious music, art, and wellness gatherings, and mindfulness
  workshops.  NOV intends to bring these events to different schools,
  businesses, organizations, and communities throughout Los Angeles. Although
  our interest is to reach out to diverse communities across LA, we are
  especially focused on healing, organizing, and empowering inner-city
  communities, schools, and organizations that work with marginalized identities
  because alternative spaces like the L.A.vation Project are normally not
  accessible to these communities due to costs, location, and other factors.

  Recent studies are showing the incredible effect that mindfulness, connection,
  and embodied practices have on improving work spaces, school environments, and
  the day-to-day interactions that people have with the world. It is only
  through collaboration that we will be able to create solutions to overcoming
  our isolation and lack of engagement in social, environmental, and political
  life. With LA being arguably one of the most creative and innovative cities in
  the world, it is our duty as Angelenos to set an example for the rest of the
  world. In order to elevate LA to where it needs to be in 2050 requires
  collective envisioning, creating, and action in new and transformative ways.
  This is why the L.A.vation project is so crucial to Angelenos lives; it will
  help many people to connect to one another in ways that go far beyond the
  existing norms.
