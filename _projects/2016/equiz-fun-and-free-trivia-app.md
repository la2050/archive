  By becoming a recipient of an LA2050 grant, eQuiz will be able to expand its
  operation from its remote operation in Burbank to an office space in the Los
  Angeles area. eQuiz is also looking to hire employees in the Los Angeles area
  in key positions, including marketing, content creation and creative
  positions. By having a greater presence for our start-up in the Los Angeles
  area, we will garner the attention and support of the community, which will
  translate into greater visibility for investors, developers and other
  start-ups in the Los Angeles area. We want our presence to highlight the
  importance of L.A. as a start-up friendly incubator that rivals that of Paolo
  Alto.
