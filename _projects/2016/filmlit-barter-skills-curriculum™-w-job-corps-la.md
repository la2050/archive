  Job Corps Los Angeles located in the heart of downtown has agreed to
  collaborate by yielding their pupils and facilities to host the expansion of
  the Filmlit Barter Skills Curriculum™. Our organization proposes to utilize
  the grant to guide the pupils of Job Corps LA through a 36-week course,
  training in the bartering of developed production skills to collaborate on
  filmlit projects. Pupils will own stock in the projects they bring forth to
  fruition.

project_measure: >-
  Job Corps LA will conduct the TABE® assessment on our pupils to determine
  increase in literacy comprehension and application. The
  enrollment/attendance/completion ratio will determine pupil acceptance of the
  program. Completion of marketable, commercial filmlits will determine course
  efficiency and impact. Residuals from prospective sales of commercial filmlits
  produced will help address youth unemployment, in addition to prospective
  employment with FilmLit™.

  The significance of this proposal is the associated methodology. The FilmLit™
  technology is a utility patented design and brand conceived to convert
  scripted works with storyboard images into commercial, literary products. The
  proposal introduces the technology through an applicable training course that
  is also a patented methodology. The Barter Skills Curriculum method is
  designed to yield marketable, commercial filmlits in which the participants
  would own percentages of the intellectual property. Job Corps Los Angeles
  currently serves over 600 circumstantially challenged youth between the ages
  of 16-24. The Filmlit Barter Skills Curriculum™ groups the pupils into
  production units according to skills that will be bartered for the completion
  of a course project. Each pupil participates with the expectation of
  monetizing their collaborative work as the ultimate goal. A program such as
  this initiative seizes the opportunity to build a pioneer class of producers
  utilizing this paradigm shifting concept here in Los Angeles, unequivocally
  proving LA to be the best place to learn!
