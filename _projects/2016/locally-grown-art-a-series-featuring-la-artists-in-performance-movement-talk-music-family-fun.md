  SIJCC’s campus being filled with local artists and creatives working,
  rehearsing and sparking new work, audiences engaged in conversation about
  relevant issues through an artistic lens, and community members seeing ideas
  presented in new ways will all be indicators of this program’s success. We
  will measure series attendance, track retention and attrition over the course
  of the series and the number of new people coming to SIJCC. We’ll track
  audience engagement both online through social media insights and in person to
  learn what is and isn’t working, and to adjust accordingly. We will survey
  participating artists, civic leaders and creatives to understand the value to
  the series to them and their work.

project_description: >-
  We believe in the power of arts and culture to transform communities. Our
  pilot cultural series is built on the creative capital of LA’s east side
  neighborhoods and will highlight local artists from diverse disciplines,
  compensate them for their time and talents and offer space for rehearsal and
  creative work at reduced rates. Through five key focuses — talk, music,
  performance, movement and family — we will bring the community together to
  learn, create and discover together.

  SIJCC’s new cultural series will value artists and creatives who live and work
  in Los Angeles and share our mission of redefining rituals, collaboration and
  experimentation. We hope to present 10 events in the next year across the
  spectrums of music, performance, movement, talk and family programming, with
  at least 2 presented in each category, featuring local innovative and
  influential artists.  


  Los Angeles is brimming with artists and talent of all varieties. It is
  extremely important to SIJCC, and to this program, that artists and
  collaborators are compensated fairly for their time and talents. Too many
  artists in Los Angeles are expected to work for little to no pay. We wish to
  create an environment where artists feel truly supported, emotionally and
  financially, and are encouraged to collaborate, expand their own artistry, and
  connect with their community on a deeper level. We envision this pilot series
  to be the start of a much larger collaboration between SIJCC and the local
  artist community for years to come, further cementing the idea –for artists
  and community members alike— that Los Angeles is in fact the best place to
  create. 


  Audience members will have the opportunity to engage and interact with
  presenting artists, through intimate musical salons, talkbacks with local
  authors and screenwriters, live podcast recordings, readings and/or workshops
  presenting new works of theatre, live dance and music performances,
  interactive art exhibitions, film screenings in partnership with local
  filmmakers and more. Whenever possible, artists and creatives will be brought
  into conversation with community leaders, activists and experts from different
  industries to further anchor the artistic presentations in current and
  contemporary narratives. This series will support and showcase local artists,
  expose the community to the arts, shed light on current events and offer the
  community an opportunity to communicate and connect on a deeper level with one
  another.  


  In addition, we plan to offer space on our desirable campus, located in the
  heart of Silver Lake, at highly discounted rates for use for rehearsals,
  collaborative meeting space, co-working and more to truly support our local
  community members who are pursuing the arts. Space would be reserved on a
  first-come, first-serve basis, and participating artists would be encouraged
  to find ways to share their work back with the broader community.
