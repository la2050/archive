title: California Native Plant Public Education Project
project_summary: >-
  Short films empowering people to create evergreen, flowering California native
  gardens that bring back LA’s butterflies and birds and save water! Learn how
  to plant native to revitalize LA!

  LIFE’s YouTube channel analytics measure our playback locations, traffic
  sources, subscribers and distribution partners. A dramatic increase in our
  audience size will be a direct measure of the success of our project. Indirect
  measures of success will be increased native plant availability and sales at
  nurseries, more native plant landscapes in public and private spaces, growing
  interest in native plant gardening, a healthier watershed, and more
  butterflies and birds (not just generalist species such as crows and pigeons,
  but specialist species such as cedar waxwings, scrub jays and Square-Spotted
  Blue butterflies.) All these, along with water bills that reflect a reduction
  in water consumption, will provide visible evidence that the films are driving
  change for a healthy, resilient and beautiful Los Angeles by 2050.

  The 2050 Challenge grant will fully support one series of short-content films.
  Our proposed series is “Mixing California Native with Non-Native Plants”.
  These short films show people how to retrofit their non-native gardens with
  native plants adapted to our rainfall, climate, and soil – plants that most of
  our butterflies, birds and other animals can’t live without. Use these films
  to retrofit with native plants for creating a beautiful resilient LA where
  nature and urban agriculture can thrive!

  Through the content of these films and the action they inspire, the LA2050
  landscape can be one of beauty with ecological function and decreased reliance
  on aquifers and imported water. For LA to become this environmentally
  inspiring place to live, we need an informed public. 


  Everyone knows we are in a water crisis, but not everyone knows we are also in
  an extinction crisis and that how we landscape matters. The world has lost 52%
  of its vertebrate wild animals – birds, mammals, fish, reptiles and amphibians
  – since 1970. Two-thirds of California’s arid-land bird species are at
  moderate to high risk of extinction without aggressive conservation action.
  Native gardening is something we can do across the vast LA landscape, in
  containers, parkways and yards, to help mitigate the extinction crisis and
  support biodiversity and the nature of LA.  


  Our proposal supports a major shift in public awareness that is needed for LA
  to meet the challenges of long-term drought, climate change and extinction of
  pollinators and other species. If 50% of LA were landscaped native, this vast
  area could be evergreen flowering habitat for birds, butterflies and other
  wildlife – landscape habitat that achieves an 80% reduction in water and
  corresponding energy use compared to conventional non-native gardens. Native
  landscaping requires no soil amendments, fertilizers or pesticides, all of
  which can harm ecosystem and watershed health. Our short films will help
  create an informed public that knows practical steps they can take at home, at
  school or the work place to help slow climate change, heal the bay, and bring
  birds and butterflies back to LA.


  Los Angeles is a biodiversity hotspot blessed with an incredibly rich natural
  heritage threatened by population pressure and habitat loss. Our proposed
  films will show how to use this incredibly rich natural heritage for
  landscaping that uses less water, creates less green waste, requires fewer
  maintenance hours, and supports the nature of where we live.  These films are
  essential because we have so thoroughly erased most of LA’s natural landscape
  that most people know little or nothing about native plants:  

  Myth:  All green is the same. Non-native plants feed the ecosystem just as
  well as native plants. Fact:  Only native plants support the nature of where
  we live. Up to 90% of leaf-eating insect species (caterpillars of
  butterflies!) can eat ONLY native plants; these insects are protein that fuels
  the food web. 

  Myth:  Most California native plants are cacti. Fact: only 1-2% of
  California’s 6,000 species, subspecies and varieties of native plants are
  cacti.

  Myth: California native plants don’t make flowers. Fact: Yes, they do, and
  native gardens can produce flowers throughout the year!


  Our proposed films will help inform the public about how to use LA’s rich
  natural heritage for making LA the best place to live in 2050.
