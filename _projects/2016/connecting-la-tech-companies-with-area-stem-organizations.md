title: Connecting LA Tech Companies with Area STEM Organizations
organization_name_2: Tech LA Cares
organization_activity: >-
  We aim to connect LA-area tech firms with volunteer opportunities at local
  STEM-based organizations via events, web, and weekly emails -- and lots of
  one-on-one real-world engagement.

  Tech LA Cares (TLC) aims to connect LA tech companies with volunteer
  opportunities at area STEM organizations in order to faciliate a more diverse
  future workforce for LA.
project_is_collaboration: 'No'
project_collaborators: >-
  None -- no direct collaboration, but we are talking to nearly two dozen area
  STEM orgs to assess their needs in order to help them obtain the resources
  they need to thrive.
project_areas:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - San Gabriel Valley
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South LA
  - Gateway Cities
  - County of Los Angeles
  - City of Los Angeles
  - LAUSD
project_measure: >-
  Metrics used to define and measure success include:


  Boost in student enrollees year over over (YoY)


  Boost in completion / graduation rates YoY


  Boost in volunteer signups YoY


  Number of area STEM-based organizations signed up


  Number of area tech companies signed up


  Number of employees pledged to volunteer at organizations


  Number of hours served by volunteers


  Amount of funds raised by each organization as a result of deeper ties with
  area companies


  Number of hardware devices and software packages delivered to orgs


  Number of white papers developed to help organizations improve their internal
  protocol


  Number of white papers developed to help companies better connect with area
  orgs


  Number of events listed on TLC events calendar


  Number of volunteer queries based on web properties


  Number of opportunities created as an effect of a direct connect between orgs
  and co's


  Online efforts will be measured digitally (Google Analytics, Squarespace,
  SumoMe, Mailchimp, etc.)


  Real-world efforts will be measured via phone calls, emails, surveys, and
  conversations with companies and the STEM organizations

  LA-based STEM organizations are strapped for resources; area tech firms need
  any easy path to become more involved with their communities.
   
  Tech LA Cares (TLC) aims to build a gateway for the two worlds to connect and
  create long-term relationships that foster a more diverse workforce that
  reflects LA's culture, and to offer resources for both sides to more
  efficiently give and receive manpower, internships, mentorships, scholarships,
  monetary support, hardware, software, and more.

  TECH LA CARES aims to take what LA is already doing, and make it BETTER.  LA
  is home to over 20 STEM-based organizations, and to hundreds of tech firms of
  all types and sizes.


  Tech LA Cares would help facilitate connections between area STEM-based
  organizations with local tech companies via four distinct, interconnected
  initiatives:


  PHASE ONE would be to work directly with the local STEM organizations to
  assess their needs: Are they looking for funding? Manpower? Mentors?
  Internships? Marketing help? Instructors? Hardware? Software? Project
  management tools? 


  Understanding how each organization is set up to ask for, and receive, such
  help will be crucial in building a program that serves their needs.


  Phase One would also involve working with area tech firms to understand their
  capabilities. Do they have a dedicated Corporate Social Responsibility team?
  Do they have a framework for individuals or teams to seek opportunities to
  volunteer their expertise? How do you make volunteerism part of a company's
  DNA without interrupting their pursuit of growth, no matter their size? How do
  you instill a sense of community service into a company's existing mission and
  values?


  PHASE TWO would involve building out a website to reflect all this -- having a
  mechanism that catalogs organizations and their needs, that calendars one-off
  and regularly-recurring events for easy signup, that has profiles of
  organizations and companies, any resultant partnerships, and the fruits of
  their labors. The listing of local / statewide / national grant / award
  competitions and deadlines will also come into the fold over time.


  PHASE THREE would be a springtime event to bring area tech firms and STEM
  organizations together in real life, to facilitate connection, to inspire
  action, and to give practical advice on how to run successful campaigns.


  Roundtables, breakout sessions, and workbooks featuring each org's story will
  help turn connections into actions long after the event ends.


  PHASE FOUR would be to follow up with the businesses and the orgs to monitor
  progress, to help strengthen any ties made at the event, and to foster
  long-term relations between the two worlds.


  All this is a lot of work for a third party to enable, but I truly believe
  that an organization such as Tech LA Cares can be the training wheels for
  success.


  Tech firms and STEM organizations are overwhelmed with their current
  responsibilities, but by building an entity solely dedicated to facilitating
  such partnerships, it will strengthen us all -- by creating opportunity for
  minority youth, for creating a smarter local workforce, and for creating a
  more DIVERSE workforce that truly reflects the international nature of LA's
  population.
