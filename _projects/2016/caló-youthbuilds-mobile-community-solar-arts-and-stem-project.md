Are any other organizations collaborating on this proposal?: YouthBuild Charter School of California
Please describe your project proposal.: >-
  CALO YouthBuild's Mobile Community Arts and STEM project will allow its
  students the opportunity to design and create mobile solar powered generators
  to bring arts and STEM programming to underserved communities affected by
  youth violence, drug use, and academic apathy. The project will target local
  parks, housing projects and schools to identify young people who are at risk
  of engaging in drug use or violent/gang activity. Mobile programs will include
  music instruction/production and recording.
Which metrics will your proposal impact?​:
  - Number (and quality) of informal spaces for play
  - Number of children enrolled in afterschool programs
  - Number of parks with intergenerational play opportunities
  - Per capita crime rates
  - Perceived safety
In what areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - East LA
  - County of Los Angeles
  - City of Los Angeles
Describe in greater detail how your proposal will make LA the best place.: >-
  East Los Angeles and Boyle Heights are communities with a history rich in
  culture, art, and activism. Unfortunately, these contributions are often
  overlooked because of the communities' reputation for low academic achievement
  from under-resourced schools, cycles of poverty, unemployment and
  under-employment and neighborhood violence. The proposed project was developed
  in response to a recent increase in violent, gang related activity among east
  side middle school, and early high school youths.  Many local youth who have
  been identified as 'problematic' because of their behavior or neighborhood
  affiliation are being lost to gangs, and drug use because the local parks,
  community centers, or schools lack the resources or training to support them
  and they often find themselves pushed out of programming with nowhere else to
  turn to but the streets. Several of the youth at CALÓ YouthBuild found
  themselves in similar situations before reclaiming their lives and education. 
  This project will allow CALÓ youth to put into practice the leadership
  development, green building construction and engineering skills, and arts and
  culture training provided to them in the YouthBuild program by designing
  mobile solar powered generators to power arts and STEM programming to younger
  versions of themselves.  Students will work with CALÓ and YouthBuild Charter
  School of California staff to develop arts and STEM programming to take to
  underserved young people in local housing projects, parks, community centers,
  and schools. Programming would include music instruction, full band
  rehearsals, music recording and production, introduction to solar
  photovoltaics and energy efficiency, introduction to engineering, STEM
  careers, construction basics, leadership development, mentoring, and
  recreational community movie screenings. The proposed project will make LA the
  best place to play by using youth driven solutions to address serious
  community issues in an innovative way, integrating the arts, culture, and
  technology into programming that fosters community and promotes healing.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.​: >-
  Using the metrics provided by LA2050, the project will provide between 10-15
  informal places of quality play; enroll a minimum of 200 children in
  after-school programming; provide at least 6 local parks with
  intergenerational play; show a decrease in per capita crime rates by
  decreasing the amount of youth ages 14 -24 who are active gang members, reduce
  the amount of drug use among participants by 75%, and commit to a 5% rate of
  recidivism; and reduce the amount of incidents of violence and drug use by 75%
  at the participants schools, parks, housing projects, and community centers.
