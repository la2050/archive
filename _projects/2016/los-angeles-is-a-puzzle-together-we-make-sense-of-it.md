  LASA proposes to expand its learning activities by investing in greater
  cohesion amongst our students, easing transportation concerns, and creating
  and sustaining our community of alumni to create change in LA. LASA plans to
  create a comprehensive database of current students and alumni to capture
  feedback after each session as well as feedback from alumni who can articulate
  how LASA changed their career or study trajectories.

  LASA's definition of success is twofold. First, LASA seeks to introduce youth
  to the complexities of LA infrastructure. Second, LASA seeks to empower youth
  to become problem-solvers and agents of change.


  LASA measures success via:

  * Number of students participating and number applying;

  * Positive written feedback from students, teachers, and speakers. 

  * Students' knowledge of the aspects of LA infrastructure and ability to frame
  issues they plan to address moving forward;
   * Further, by creating the alumni database, LASA will be able to track, foster, and celebrate the change LASA graduates bring to LA in concrete terms.

  Designed as a supplement to the regular school year, LASA will make greater
  Los Angeles the best place to learn by providing an intensive introduction to
  the infrastructure and institutions of greater Los Angeles for high school
  juniors who have expressed an interest in public, civic, and civil service. 
  Through LASA, students learn from the very heart of the region's history and
  culture, and, in so doing, learn how best they can contribute to the region
  and our collective problem-solving obligations.


  LASA engages their curiosity and desire to create change in a diverse
  landscape of spaces from the Metropolitan Water District, the Port of Los
  Angeles, the business community, to the local arms of the judicial system. 


  Participants gain the experience and knowledge necessary to better understand
  the intricacies – infrastructural, historical, political, economic, and
  otherwise – of the region in which they live, and build lasting bonds of
  friendship, camaraderie, and work experience with a diverse group of peers.
  LASA combines seminars, fieldwork and student engagement. LASA speakers - in
  the dozens - including Jeff Kightlinger of the Metropolitan Water District,
  Raphael Sonenshein of the Pat Brown Institute at California State
  University-Los Angeles, and Maria Cabildo of the East LA Community Corporation
  - help the students create a foundation of knowledge to inform their visions
  for the future.


  LASA contributes to LA as a space to learn by encouraging the students to
  learn by sharing their diverse experiences with each other and with the
  speakers. They listen to each other and define the issues in LA they want to
  address moving forward.


  Our hope is that, over time, LASA will change the lives and career paths of
  hundreds of high school students in the region and will become an agent of
  change and community building throughout Los Angeles.
