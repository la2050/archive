project_summary: >-
  LACI will help make Los Angeles a more creative, inclusive economy by training
  our city's youth in the technical and business skills necessary to join LA’s
  rapidly growing cleantech sector.

  Our pilot project is focused on providing cleantech technical and
  entrepreneurial training to Los Angeles’ disadvantaged youth.  To integrate
  our programs into the fabric of LA's youth workforce development programming,
  we aim to establish robust pre- and post-program referral relationships with
  other high-impact organizations in order to develop a pipeline of qualified
  program applicants and a suite of follow-on services for program graduates.

project_measure: "LACI is committed to ensuring the quality and impact of our 'Youth Cleantech Training Program' and will measure our success through the following metrics:\n* Youth Program:\no\tNumber of students participating in the Youth Program\no\tStudents’ ability to demonstrate a deeper understanding of the cleantech sector \no\tStudents’ ability to design a working prototype and present their solution to a panel of industry experts\n* Intern Program:\no\tNumber of students placed in internships in the cleantech sector\no\tFeedback from Interns and cleantech companies at the conclusion of the internship placement\no\tPercent of interns who continue in the cleantech sector beyond their initial fall semester internship\n* Alumni Program:\no\tLevel of alumni engagement with the LACI network after the completion of their internship\no\tNumber of alumni who convert from INTERN → EMPLOYEE or from INTERN →  ENTREPRENEUR (long-term goal)\n\nIn addition to the CREATE impact metrics checked above, we would like to offer a method to quantify LA’s “Measures of cultural and global economic influence (‘soft power’).” After years of positioning LA as a global cleantech hub, we believe our proposal will support LA’s ascent in “soft power”, which can be quantified by measuring: (1) the vibrancy of the region’s cleantech ecosystem, (2) the regional interaction between domestic and international cleantech players, and (3) LA’s attractiveness and convening power as a global influencer."

  With the opening of the new 60,000 sq. ft. La Kretz Innovation Campus located
  in Downtown LA, LACI has training space, an advanced manufacturing prototyping
  lab, and access to growing cleantech companies – all under one roof. Our focus
  now is to leverage these assets and build a “sticky” talent pipeline that
  creates a more inclusive, robust cleantech sector in LA.  We propose a summer
  youth program that includes technical training, a sponsored internship, and
  follow-on alumni programming.

  Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator (LACI) is working to make LA the cleantech
  capital of the world and the best place to CREATE. Our top-tier incubator
  services and one-on-one mentoring has helped 55+ companies raise $70M+ and
  create 1,000+ jobs. In 2015, LACI was recognized by UBI Global as the #1
  Cleantech incubator in the world.


  Yet, despite LACI’s success and globally recognized programming, the
  participation rate of underrepresented Angelenos in the region’s cleantech
  sector mirrors the national trend -- very low.  And since research shows more
  diverse teams make better decisions and yield better financial results, in
  order for Los Angeles to enjoy significant climate improvements and long-term
  economic growth, it must create a bridge for all talent to access the
  cleantech sector and spur innovation.


  To help us achieve this vision, LACI is launching the ‘Youth Cleantech
  Training Program,’ an integrated, multi-stakeholder approach which will
  support the cleantech and advanced manufacturing sectors' growth while
  maximizing Angelenos' training and employment opportunities,  particularly
  among women and people of color.  The program will start with theoretical work
  in the classroom, shift to hands-on work in the labs, and culminate in
  internships with cleantech companies. The aim of our comprehensive training
  program is to serve as an entry point for underrepresented Angelenos into the
  Cleantech Talent Continuum: STUDENT → INTERN →  EMPLOYEE / ENTREPRENEUR.  The
  3-part program includes:
   
  1.)   Youth Program: The youth program will engage youth ages 18-24 from
  disadvantaged communities in an intensive summer program where they will have
  the opportunity to design and build a prototype to address an existing
  sustainability challenge in LA. This project-based learning approach will
  culminate in a Demo Day event where each participant will present their
  prototype solution to a panel of industry experts.

  2.)   Intern Program: Once the summer program is complete, youth program
  participants will be enrolled in fall-semester internships at a cleantech
  company, where they will gain additional exposure to career opportunities in
  the cleantech sector.

  3.)   Alumni Program: After their internships, youth program participants will
  join our Alumni Program, where they will engage with an extended network of
  resources, mentors, and support as they pursue their career goals.


  By creating a 'sticky' cleantech pipeline of local innovators and problem
  solvers, LACI will activate Angelenos and make LA the best place to create.
