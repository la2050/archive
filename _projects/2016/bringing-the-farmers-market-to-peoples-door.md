organization_name_2: Natch
organization_activity: >-
  We are creating a marketplace app where anybody in Los Angeles can create
  their own local craft shops, and sell and delivery anything they make (foods,
  crafts, clothes, etc.) to other locals.

  We are bringing the Farmer's Market to people's doors, by creating a platform
  where local farmers and artisans can sell and deliver the things they make. We
  then deliver these products to people's door, so that people anywhere in Los
  Angeles have a way to be connected to local producers and have a way to find,
  support and receive their craft products.
project_is_collaboration: 'Yes'
project_collaborators: >-
  Farmers and Artisans from Los Angeles. The app is a marketplace where any
  creator in Los Angeles can open up their own craft shop. So we plan to be
  collaborating with any and every creator in LA that is looking for a platform
  to sell the things they produce.
project_areas:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - San Gabriel Valley
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South LA
  - Westside
  - South Bay
  - City of Los Angeles
project_measure: >-
  1. The number of craft shops local producers have opened on our app.

  2. The amount of locals using and buying from the app each month.

  3. Monthly sales.


  Within the first 6 months after launching, the goal is to have at least 300
  local craft shops, 2500 monthly shoppers, and $25,000 in monthly sales on the
  app.

project_proposal_best_place: >-
  People all over LA have the urge to create. But currently indie creators do
  not have the power to sell their creations, because they do not have a
  platform for people to buy and receive their goods. 


  Having a physical store is expensive, and getting partnerships with big chains
  to sell one's products in is difficult. It is also inconvenient and expensive
  for shoppers to search across the internet for locals that make craft goods,
  and then get the goods delivered from each person.


  So our solution was to create an open marketplace app, where anybody could
  create their own craft shop and sell their products. By storing and delivering
  these goods, it becomes much easier for people to buy and receive goods from
  local creators. So any local creator that bakes their own bread, grows their
  own fruits and vegetables, makes their own salsas and jams, will now have the
  power to sell directly to anybody in their area. Thereby removing all barriers
  for indie creators, and creating a market where Angelinos can support and
  enjoy locally crafted products.
