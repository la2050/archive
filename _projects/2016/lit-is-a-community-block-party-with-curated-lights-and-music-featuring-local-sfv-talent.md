  LIT will be a block party celebration of San Fernando Valley history, art and
  culture in the heart of the San Fernando Valley - on the Reseda Blvd Great
  Street. The event will capitalize on the momentum of the [RE]visit [RE]seda
  Blvd partnership, utilize and feature the new Great Streets amenities, while
  demonstrating responsiveness to community input captured during the Challenge
  Grant series of [RE]visit [RE]seda Blvd events in 2015-16. 


  Leading up to LIT, San Fernando Valley youth will be engaged in STEM-driven
  coding training that produces a requested community outcome - more lighting
  and art and cultural events on Reseda Blvd. Students from the local Devonshire
  PALS Center for at-risk youth, will receive training and mentorship from Light
  Riders, a San Fernando Valley-based event lighting design partnership. The
  Light Riders will train the PALS kids to create and activate custom event
  lighting that will be programmed to correlate with music generated by 8 live
  DJ sets over the course of a 5-hour block party event. The training will meet
  the Visual and Performing Arts (VAPA) content standards and provide technical
  education and workforce training geared toward the entertainment and event
  industries, including professional mentorship.


  In addition, LIT will feature various curated art shows, interactive dance
  demonstrations by Strife TV, a Valley Relics-curated light installation
  featuring the light-up signs of the San Fernando Valley’s past, children’s art
  activities directed by the Museum of the San Fernando Valley and will showcase
  Valley food and beverage vendors, local artisans and the corridor’s
  businesses.


  LIT’s partners include Light Riders,Valley Relics, The Museum of the San
  Fernando Valley, the Devonshire PALS at-risk youth center, the Northridge
  South Neighborhood Council, Northridge Chamber of Commerce, California State
  University Northridge Students and Alumni, Mayor Eric Garcetti’s Great Streets
  Studio, Councilmember Mitchell Englander and the Twelfth District Council
  Office, Northridge Sparkle Campaign beautification team, the San Fernando
  Valley Rescue Mission, Collective Lifestyle, Reload LA and many other local
  merchants and finally, the local music and art community.


  LIT quite literally will shine a light on the rich culture of the San Fernando
  Valley, giving the diverse residents, businesses and visitors an opportunity
  to proudly celebrate a unique past, in the present, while building the
  community of their future.
