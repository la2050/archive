Are any other organizations collaborating on this proposal?: ''
Please describe your project proposal.: >-
  Like to ride a bike in LA? Wouldn't it be nice if you could map out:


  1) the most chill-safe-stress free route

  2) the faster route


  and then see if there was anyone else doing the same commute so that you could
  have company and enjoy safety in numbers?


  You know there's a great bike path (Ballona Creek, LA River) but it's
  confusing.. signage anyone?


  It's possible! LA Bike Trains has been running a similar education program in
  LA since 2013. Based on feedback this is what people want.
Which metrics will your proposal impact?​:
  - Social & emotional support
  - Government responsiveness to residents’ needs
  - Travel time to work
  - Public transit riders
  - Total number of local social media friends and connections Angelenos have
In what areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles
Describe in greater detail how your proposal will make LA the best place.: >-
  An app that connects people to better understand and utilize city streets and
  infrastructure - as well as to each other!


  LA might be home to millions of people - but it also has a well deserved
  reputation for isolation - it's hard to get to know people when you're
  enclosed in your own vehicle, listening to some jams and frustrated by
  traffic. 


  Lots of people would be into riding a bike - but for people born and raised on
  freeways, it can be like learning a new language to figure out what streets to
  take instead of a freeway. 

  New residents and lifelong ones all benefit by being able to find the easy (vs
  the faster) routes. Get to work/school/errands or connect to transportation
  without wondering what way to take.


  And, in cases where the infrastructure just plain sucks for cycling -
  encouraging signage and the ability to find someone to ride with makes a big
  different to how easy, fun and safe it can be to chose to bike. It's hard to
  get to (or out of) the west side. Knowing the best route and having a (new?)
  friend to go with is enough of a motivator to create real behavior changes in
  transportation. 


  More people on bikes = more interaction with neighbors, coworkers, people from
  all walks of life in this amazing diverse city.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.​: >-
  1) Minimum Viable Product functionality checklist/beta release

  2) Number of users involved in beta

  3) Official (alpha) launch within 12 months

  4) User reviews (star system on iTunes/Google Play)

  5) Number of downloads on iTunes/Google Play

  6) Comparative product review w/Strava, GO LA, Google (bike) Maps, CycleTracks
  (SFMTA)
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
  - 'Money '
  - Advisors/board members
  - Publicity/awareness
  - Technical infrastructure (computers etc.)
  - 'Community outreach '
  - Network/relationship support
  - Quality improvement research
