Are any other organizations collaborating on this proposal?: ''
Please describe your project proposal.: >-
  We are proposing to deliver a combination of prototypes, research results and/
  or outreach to other non-profit organizations in order to lay the foundations
  of Synergy Village:  a self-sustainable community where we help the homeless
  get reintegrated back into society as productive citizens of Los Angeles.
Which metrics will your proposal impact?​:
  - Housing affordability
  - Self-sufficiency
  - Resilient communities
  - Prevalence of adverse childhood experiences
  - Homelessness
  - Walk/bike/transit score
In what areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - County of Los Angeles
  - City of Los Angeles
Describe in greater detail how your proposal will make LA the best place.: >-
  What better way to live, learn, work and connect in Los Angeles than by
  cleaning our streets, helping our less fortunate homeless population get back
  on their feet and make them productive members of society.


  We don't just give them fish to eat; we give them the tools to fish and remind
  them how to do it.  Helping the homeless will also help our taxpayers;
  businesses and districts affected by homeless encampments.  We will see
  improvement in commerce and neighborhood safety as this issue is addressed.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.​: >-
  The goal is to be able to create prototypes of residential pods, conduct
  exhaustive research on construction, building codes, real estate, and outreach
  to non-profit organizations so we can incorporate their cause to our mission.


  These will be prioritized and plotted within an achievable timeline and
  submittals should be defined within anticipated milestones, example: deliver a
  scope of work from architect/ engineer within six months, or deliver a
  prototype of a residential pod within 12 months of grant approval.

  - 'Money '
  - Advisors/board members
  - 'Staff '
  - Infrastructure (building/space/vehicles
