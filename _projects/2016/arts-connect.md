  Around the world Los Angeles epitomizes glamour and is regarded as the
  international epicenter of creative industry and its foremost hub for
  innovation. In spite of the city’s progressive reputation for trendsetting and
  trailblazing, a great dichotomy exists between the flourishing state of its
  commerce and the reality of how its children are educated. LA has the dubious
  distinction of ranking as one of the 10 worst school districts in the USA – a
  status due in large part to low reading & math scores, high dropout rate, and
  overcrowded classrooms. These undesirable realities generate apathy among
  students and teachers alike, producing environments short on inspiration,
  employment opportunities, technical training, and preparedness for
  contemporary problem solving.

  Arts Connect proposes to change these circumstances by implementing creative
  strategies grounded in real-life, direct experience learning deployed through
  a system where traditional education methodology intersects with
  state-of-the-art, next-generation multimedia tools. The goal is to nurture
  students’ capacity to succeed by engaging them in enriching, real-life
  learning scenarios presented through digital media by some of the world’s most
  notable experts, admired celebrities, sports figures, and other individuals
  distinguished for their success in their chosen fields. Arts Connect responds
  to the demand for education reform by offering a program that inspires
  teachers and students alike, and is distributed free of charge throughout LA
  irrespective of the instruction venue.

  Arts Connect challenges both left-&-right-brain thinking in students in order
  to provoke both imagination and creative problem-solving, but also in order to
  cultivate a high level of individual character formation, instill
  self-confidence and solid skill development, and generate personal pride. 
  Success results from lessons which are fun, engaging, authentic, relatable,
  and designed by classroom teachers dedicated to achieve optimal learning and
  comprehension outcomes. 

  Arts Connect curricular integration could not be more timely! Education reform
  lands squarely on the shoulders of STEAM learning programs (Science,
  Technology, Engineering, Arts & Math) - a curriculum education experts say is
  imperative to meet the classroom standards put forward by California’s
  education authorities. Arts Connect strives to cultivate Math, Science, and
  English disciplines with imagination, culture, innovation and creativity.

  Architects of Arts Connect chose to launch its first pilot for grades 6-12,
  with the distinct purpose of trying to offset the low achievement by many of
  L.A.'s middle and high school students. Arts Connect will be developed by
  trained and certified teachers. Arts Connect will ignite a fresh enthusiasm
  for learning, connect students with contemporary icons whose accomplishments
  can be seen as “relevant” for young scholars, and energize student interest
  and a desire to continue and succeed in school.
