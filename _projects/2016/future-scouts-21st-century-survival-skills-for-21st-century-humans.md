  Future Scouts ran a crowd-funded pilot program in July 2016 with 12 teens from
  across LA for a two weeks, culminating in a Future Worlds Fair: LA 2036! We
  propose to run two summer sessions in Los Angeles in 2017 for teens aged
  13-18, on a by-donation basis, as well fund an after-school program with
  C:/DAGS @ Hawkins HS for Spring 2017.

  There are various quantitative metrics we use to measure success from an
  operational perspective:


  Full enrollment in our programs (serve 150 LA youth & families thru 2017).

  Diverse community served across various LA neighborhoods.

  Returning youth from our 2016 pilot and other events during the year.

  Sociable outputs - guides, processes, CC-published curriculum and resources.

  Placed youth in internships in the creative industries.

  Sponsorships and donations

  Volunteers and partnerships

   We collect surveys and exit interviews with participants that provide us first-hand with qualitative data on the outcomes of our program. Some snippets from 2016:

  'I learned how I can rely on other people to work on a team instead of working
  by myself.' - Harper, 14

  'It helped me move faster with my creative processing, when i would sit down
  for about a day and i would write something, but for this I would have to do
  something in a few hours...I'll take home with me much better work ethic,
  discipline, for sure, trust, in myself, and other people.' - Miles, 16

  'Soak everything in, because you can learn so much from just observing the
  systems around us.' - Nina, 15

  'There's so much you could learn, and its not the boring school learning, its
  the fun, but still educational, real learning.' Rama, 13

  'The future isn't something that other people control, its what you create'. -
  Michael, 16

  'I wanna meet all these people again later, everybody's so great.' - Eli, 13

  Our children are growing up in a world with a rate of accelerated change. With
  each passing generation, the minds of youth evolve and adapt to new behaviors,
  cultural mores, new interfaces and technologies, ways of learning and
  communicating.


  Currently there's a gap between what kind of future we're preparing youth for,
  and what they are likely to face, even in the next 5-15 years. In a recent
  report from the World Economic Forum, 65% of jobs that will exist in 10 years,
  don't exist today. Another study claims that 50% of jobs that exist today
  won't exist in 15 years. Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) is becoming more
  and more vital in 21c environments. Youth unemployment and underemployment
  depend on how adaptive the youth of today can be to non-traditional working
  environments and a quickly changing social, cultural and technological
  landscape.


  LA's future relies on the Millenials and Gen Zers being well-prepared to meet
  the complex challenges our city faces in the near future. We need adaptive,
  capable individuals that can communicate well, collaborate to face challenges
  and create better futures for their communities.


  Future Scouts combines art, science, technology and the urban landscape to
  create experiential learning environments. Our program exposes youth from
  across LA to design and production processes by visiting next-gen companies,
  makerspaces and public spaces, where they observe the workings of systems in
  order to prototype solutions themselves. With the city as their laboratory,
  they collaborate, engage their curiosity, and create through a futuristic
  project-based learning approach. Future Scouts asks, what kind of world do we
  want to build towards? And it puts in their hands the frameworks and means to
  do it.


  Future Scouts makes LA the best city to LEARN by:


  exposing youth to new types of jobs and fields of work

  inviting youth to university labs and real-world creative enterprises

  coaching youth through design + creative processes

  demonstrating social and emotional learning practices

  helping youth creatively imagine their own preferred futures

  discussing issues that affect youth today.

  placing youth in the context of their city in experiential learning
  environments

  encouraging youth to become self-directed, lifelong learners.


  We create opportunities for ongoing engagement & community development
  through:


  developing curriculum for futures studies for middle and high schoolers

  helping them develop their innovations with our wider network

  providing them opportunities to engage with the city through ongoing events.

  making our frameworks creative commons and available to others to adopt.
   
  The mission of FutureScouts is to prepare youth with the survival skills for
  the 21st century – the ability to problem-solve, model complex systems,
  evaluate knowledge, and create their own narratives. We do this through
  providing knowledge, experiences and tools that help them become authors of
  their own futures.
