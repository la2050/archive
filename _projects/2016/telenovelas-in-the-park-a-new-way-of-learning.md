  Telenovelas in the Park utilizes a fun and entertaining platform of the
  traditional Latino soap opera to educate, inform, and instill a high
  environmental ethic. Telenovelas in the Park catalyzes and inspires Angelenos
  to change their behaviors by emphasizing the importance of water conservation,
  of reducing plastics pollution, and other actions individuals can take to
  protect our environment and our city. The platform is flexible, which allows
  us to address multiple environmental issues.

project_measure: >-
  Telenovelas in the Park is a 35-minute presentation, followed by a 10-minute
  talk to discuss the main environmental issues addressed in the Telenovela. 


  To measure the success and impact of our Telenovela, we will provide surveys
  to all of the participants before and after each performance to compare their
  knowledge.  At each performance, we will identify small focus groups (8-10
  participants) and provide them with an evaluation toolkit where we will be
  able to measure their changes in their daily routines based on the information
  acquired at the presentation.  We will follow up with each focus group thirty
  days after and quantify how their changes have impacted their lives and the
  people surrounding them.


  We will also use an extensive social media campaign  to share tips and
  information related to the Telenovela and to  document success stories from
  the audience about how they have changed their habits and are making a
  difference through their daily actions.

  Telenovelas in the Park will make LA the best place to LIVE by activating a
  change in behavior that will make Angelenos environmentally conscious and will
  inspire them to protect and heal their city.


  Telenovelas in the Park will achieve this by building upon the success of our
  pilot launch—an episode focused on the drought, water conservation, and
  plastic pollution—to provide education and information about environmental
  issues affecting all of us living in LA. Further, Telenovelas in the Park will
  show examples of positive habits individuals can adopt and develop to heal and
  protect La Madre Tierra.


  By combining performing arts, educational programs about the environment, and
  funny, dramatic aspects from traditional Latino Soap Operas (Telenovelas) we
  will engage communities and educate them about the consequence their day to
  day habits have to the environment. We are utilizing an innovative and
  original communication vehicle to make the message stronger and have a
  positive impact on the future. 


  Mujeres de la Tierra wants to inspire, motivate and teach individuals to
  become more active within their community. We are firm believers in the power
  of one and know that by inspiring individual participation we will create more
  active community members to help build a strong network to change their
  neighborhoods and the future of LA.


  The goals of Telenovelas in the Park are to:


  •Provide environmental education such as information about the drought, water
  conservation and other ways of healing la Madre Tierra to members of the
  community through an entertaining and creative platform.


  •Provide messaging point about the drought and how it is the new way of life
  for all Californians.


  •Provide knowledge and awareness to the audience so they can incorporate
  appropriate environmental changes within their daily decision.


  •Create in the public civic engagement in individual and collective action.
