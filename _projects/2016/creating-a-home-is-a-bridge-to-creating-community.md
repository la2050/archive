  In just two years, ASOH has created 125 homes and has placed 185 youth in
  beds.  We are currently creating a minimum of two homes per week, 130 homes
  over the next 12 months.  We are powered by 3,000 volunteers giving over
  300,000 hours annually.  


  ASOH documents the effects of the home creation experience from beginning to
  end in multiple modalities.  A pre-assessment  is administered & again 6
  months and then a year after the home creation. 


  In 2 years all youth are still in homes, are on an upward trajectory in terms
  of career, education & emotional well being.


  There are several formal psychological assessments that ASOH will be
  integrating into a more elaborate assessment process. These instruments
  measure areas that are important for these youth for their recovery from
  trauma and their life-long success in life. These are:

  * The Emotional Quotient Test – measuring all aspects of emotional
  intelligence

  * The Trauma Symptom Inventory

  * The Tennessee Self-Concept Scale

  * The Behavioral Rating Inventory for Executive Function (BRIEF)


  Additionally ASOH is inviting outside assessments that might affect policy .
  For example APS Fellow Eldar Shafir of Princeton University published in Vol.
  341 of Science, that individuals functioned 10 IQ points higher when they were
  not living in scarcity. The National Scientific Council Report attributes
  substandard housing and separation from parent(s), among the main factors that
  are toxic to the developing brain.

project_description: >-
  ASOH brings together volunteers to serve as a family would utilizing donated
  furniture to create the youth’s first permanent living space. The state of
  one’s “home” affects one’s physical health, cognitive development,
  social/emotional well-being & how an individual views themselves. By creating
  a physical home that embodies the aspirations of each youth & connecting them
  with a community of care— Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs is satisfied & the youth
  can focus on building a prosperous future.

  With an all former foster youth staff, and former foster youth paying it
  forward, ASOH is a solution to recidivism being implemented by whom the impact
  is intended. ASOH is a solution being implemented by former foster youth,
  shoulder to shoulder with a swelling community of volunteers. ASOH is true
  grassroots community building. It began in LA and is ready to be replicated in
  every major city in the USA. The youth become inspired to be as successful as
  their new environment, move from an existence of scarcity and survival towards
  building a prosperous future (with the support of a community of care). 

  Eliminating the financial impossibility of furnishing one’s home dramatically
  improves cognitive capacity & emotional intelligence & an uncluttered,
  organized, and serene home environment has been proven to significantly
  improve the productivity of an employee & student & the ability to build &
  form healthy relationships. 

  Every 2 minutes a child enters foster care in the US. A large percentage of
  those kids are never adopted. Up to 35,000 age-out of the system each year
  having never been adopted. Aging out foster youth are more likely than those
  in the general population to 

  • become incarcerated,  homeless, not finish high school, be unemployed, be
  dependent on public assistance , have addiction issues, & higher rates of PTS.
  Aging-out youth cost the US $8 billion/year.

  LA County has the largest population of foster youth aging out of the system.
  A full 50% fall into homelessness. Resourceful former foster youth may secure
  Section 8 housing but with no support system to help them set up their first
  homes, their apartments are empty of furniture and basic necessities most
  people take for granted.  Having already endured lives of emotional and/or
  physical trauma, these young people have no sense of security.  They‘re left
  to fend for themselves, quite often sleeping, eating and studying on bare
  floors.  They store their belongings in plastic garbage bags.  Together, as a
  community, ASOH is a proven model to reduce youth moving back into
  homelessness, unemployment, incarceration, & mental health issues.

  Each home creation is a true celebration of youth who beat the odds, and
  through ASOH they become agents of change.  The key is the human-to-human
  connection, one youth at a time, and the fact that they are both the drivers
  of the solution and the recipients of the outcome.  

  Another important aspect of the ASOH model is the seamless experiential and
  powerful process of the home creation that provides a bridge between
  communities. Working side-by-side, adult volunteers become mentors to the
  youth and open career opportunities. The entire experience unearths youth’s
  sense of dignity, self-worth, & confidence. The completion of each home
  creation is celebrated with a housewarming party in which youth share their
  stories and educate the gathered through powerful spoken word poetry, original
  music and songs.
