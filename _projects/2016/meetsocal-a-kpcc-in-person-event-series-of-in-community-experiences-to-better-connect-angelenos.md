  KPCC will use both quantitative and qualitative data to measure the success of
  #MeetSoCal. Quantitatively, we will track the number of event attendees,
  social media activity generated (for instance, by reviewing live tweet stats),
  and signups for the Public Insight Network, KPCC newsletters, membership, and
  volunteering. Qualitatively, we will gather input from event attendees,
  speakers, and/or performers; any community groups who helped us conduct
  outreach for the event; and our social media audience to inform our coverage.
  We will review the amount and quality of any content generated as a result of
  the event (such as any audio recordings we use on air as part of a news story
  or show segment). We will also conduct a holistic internal review of each
  event and of the overall series to assess what went well, what can be
  improved, and any lessons learned.


  By bringing community members together for dialogue, the events will help
  foster a more robust public conversation about life in LA and increased social
  support and emotional connection. When suitable, portions of these
  engagement-driven conversations and events could be used for content on KPCC’s
  broadcast and digital channels, thus sharing their benefits with even more
  Angelenos. Ultimately, by helping Angelenos feel closer to their neighbors,
  communities, and Los Angeles as a whole, we believe that #MeetSoCal can
  inspire increased civic engagement in the form of greater community
  involvement, volunteerism, and even voting.

  To quote “Love Poem to Los Angeles” by LA Poet Laureate Luis J. Rodriquez,
  “This is a multi-layered city.” One of the most diverse and dynamic
  metropolitan regions in the world, it is also one of the most geographically
  sprawling and civically fragmented. Critical problems such as homelessness,
  pollution, and a crumbling infrastructure have metastasized for years, and
  voter turnout rates are among the country’s lowest. Yet every problem has
  inspiring, innovative individuals and organizations working to solve it.


  KPCC’s #MeetSoCal will help further that important work and make LA the best
  place to CONNECT by promoting more robust, inclusive civic dialogue in
  communities throughout LA County. Ultimately, we aim to help Angelenos feel
  better connected to their neighbors, their communities, KPCC, and Los Angeles.


  Our engagement and live events platform, KPCC In Person, is a crucial part of
  our public service mission. Since 2010, KPCC has produced over 500 events
  attracting more than 60,000 people. Our events explore timely civic and
  cultural issues with experts, advocates, policymakers, community leaders, and
  artists and create opportunities for community members to speak out, interact,
  and feel connected. Through our mobile recording booth “Big Mic” and signups
  for our Public Insight Network (a community reporting tool to find sources and
  gather data), we also use events to gather input, perspectives, and voices to
  inform our coverage. Recent examples include our live broadcast from Watts on
  the 50th anniversary of the 1965 civil unrest and our #WhyIVoted party on
  primary election day at Downtown LA’s La Plaza de Cultura y Artes.


  After we pilot 2-4 #MeetSoCal events in early 2017, LA2050 funding will enable
  KPCC to launch the post-pilot phase in Spring 2017 with 4-6 events in LA
  County communities, emphasizing those underserved by and underrepresented in
  public media. The format of each event will be designed to best fit the
  particular community and venue. Our goal will be a fun, entertaining,
  thought-provoking, and connection-building experience uniquely tailored to the
  community’s character and needs.


  Community input and insights gathered at each event will inform KPCC’s
  coverage to help us better reflect and serve our region. We will live tweet
  events (and encourage audience members to do the same) to further broaden the
  conversation. If the event format is appropriate and lends itself to audio or
  visuals, portions may be edited and distributed on one or more of KPCC’s
  content platforms. Overall, social media and the Public Insight Network will
  ensure that the #MeetSoCal events are just a beginning of ongoing
  conversations with the communities we visit.


  Through #MeetSoCal, KPCC will elevate the concerns of diverse communities and
  foster greater and more inclusive dialogue within and among them, helping
  Angelenos feel more connected to one another and to the complicated but
  inspiring place we all call home.
