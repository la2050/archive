  Success will be defined and measured through how the program achieves key
  milestones in the areas of A) Quality Outreach and Level of Participation, B)
  Program Completion and Content Generation, C) Training Delivery and
  Programmatic Efficiency, D) Strategic Partnerships, and E) Community and
  Regional Impact.    


  Measuring the success of milestone A and B will be highly quantitative
  ensuring good recruitment numbers and monitoring performance of content in
  order to achieve a highly engaged audience.  The qualitative piece will be
  ensuring that we attract the highest caliber students and provide them with
  the opportunity to hone in on their craft     


  Measuring the success of milestone C will be measured by the continual
  improvement and overall quality of our curriculum and the delivery of the
  curriculum by our staff.  We will implement program evaluations involving
  students and strategic partners to each of the sessions as well as an overall
  program evaluation that measure the overall skill development of the students
  as a result.


  Finally, measuring success of milestone D and E will consist of measurably
  reviewing our success in both developing and building strong fruitful
  partnerships as well as measuring community impact.

  Latinos are the fastest growing demographic in the US, but only represent a
  fraction of the filmmaking community. As a result, they are underrepresented
  in all forms of media. mitú Accelerate LA’s main focus is to bring
  opportunities to aspiring Latino filmmakers and teach them how to express
  themselves and tell their own stories through the use of digital media.

  The program will elevate stories that highlight critical issues impacting our
  region, community, culture and local governments as well weaving in
  storytelling told in an entertaining yet reverent way with high engagement and
  participation. The program will enrich the LA community by communicating
  through personal stories that are unique, highly engaged, and activate agents
  of change on key issues.

  With digital and streaming content becoming the most popular platform for
  content consumption amongst millennials, the need to diversify the digital
  content creation space becomes that much more essential. mitú Accelerate LA
  allows participants to advance their goals by putting the tools in the hands
  of each student and giving them hands on experience to use these skills. By
  the end of the program, they will understand the content lifecycle, so that
  the learning does not conclude after content is created. Instead, they will
  understand how to test content, how to optimize it and how to relate it to
  future pieces.

  The first major track of the program is the bootcamp component. This is a
  2-day intensive content creation bootcamp which will teach aspiring filmmakers
  how to create snackable content based on their individual interest;
  storytelling, producing-directing, and meme creation. At the conclusion of the
  workshop, the top 3 in each group will be showcased in an evening celebration.
  The top 20-25 people from 2-day bootcamp will be eligible for a scholarship in
  the second phase; our 4-week intensive bootcamp

  The second major track of the program is the 4-week intensive program that
  filmmakers will participate which includes 8 training sessions. These sessions
  are broken out into two layers, 4 advanced content creation training
  in-persona and 4-online. Participants will work together to create additional
  content as well as final project; a minimum of 1 piece of content per week and
  1 final project. The best piece of content will be eligible for distribution
  across our own and operated platforms and 1 person may be considered as a
  content contributor for a future project of mitú. 

  Most significantly, the program will also empower local organizations, key
  influencers and policy makers to identify, work with, and develop local talent
  to engage in supporting and elevating local stories and issues while advancing
  the mission of their organization. This project presents an exciting
  opportunity to, taking into account the changing regional and national media
  consumption landscape, proactively work at expanding diverse digital creator
  talent and build opportunities for multicultural communities.
