title: Los Angeles Resilience Hubs - Developing a Model for a Resilient City
project_summary: >-

  residents can safely and quickly bounce back from extreme weather events and
  natural disasters.

  Success to us is a city properly equipped to face the realities of climate
  change, natural disasters, and infrastructure interruptions. As such, we
  define success with two key indicators: 1) the development of a robust,
  replicable model for Resilience Hubs in Los Angeles, and 2) working local
  community development corporations to identify sites and structures in
  disadvantaged communities that can become the city’s first Resilience Hubs. 


  We will measure success by:

  The number of disadvantaged communities in Los Angeles with access to
  Resilience Hubs

  The percentage of disadvantaged community members served by Resilience Hubs
  during natural disasters and infrastructure interruptions 

  The number of local community development corporations collaborating with our
  team to identify suitable pilot project locations 

  The duration between disruptive event [black out, fire, earthquake…] and
  neighborhood bounce back 


  We plan to conduct interviews with residents, community development
  corporation staff, and government leaders throughout the duration of the
  program to inform the design, development, and implementation of the Los
  Angeles Resilience Hubs program.

project_description: >-
  As the effects of climate change manifest in Los Angeles, prolonged heat
  waves, dry spells and fires threaten to disrupt power grids, force families
  from their homes, and underscore the need for off-grid centers where residents
  can gather, cool down, charge phones, contact family, and receive critical
  updates from emergency personnel. We will work with local communities,
  designers, and government organizations to develop a model for Resilience Hubs
  in neighborhoods throughout the County.

  Los Angeles Resilience Hubs will help make LA the best place to live by
  providing secure off-grid shelter for residents during severe weather events
  and natural disasters. 


  Global climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme
  weather events, manifesting in Los Angeles as heatwaves, droughts, dry spells,
  and fire. Global Green’s experience with green building efforts in Los
  Angeles, New Orleans and New York has led us to identify a key moment between
  response and recovery when needs are high and disadvantaged populations are
  likely to suffer most from extended power outages. Our solution is expanding
  our Resilience Hub program that we have piloted in New York City since 2013.
  The program provides grid-tied solar with off-grid battery storage for
  emergency power to centrally located, familiar community buildings within
  areas that suffered disaster damage, power loss and have no emergency
  shelters. These hubs provide back-up energy capacity to provide emergency
  services, creating safe and reliable points of distribution following
  emergency events. Year round, they engage the community in climate adaptation
  and resilience. 


  Action on climate issues has been limited on a national level due to political
  controversy, however some cities and metropolitan regions that have
  experienced disasters have developed responses. The responses and lessons
  learned from our work in places like New Orleans and New York after Hurricanes
  Katrina and Sandy are valuable tools for the transferability of adaptation and
  resilience pathways to Los Angeles. Global Green’s experience with green
  rebuilding efforts in disadvantaged communities in Los Angeles, New Orleans
  and New York has led us to identify a key moment between response and recovery
  when needs are high: after the disaster, but before stabilization - a gap
  comprising five to ten days, where the most disadvantaged among us will suffer
  without access to power, water, heating, and cooling.


  As extreme weather events and corresponding electricity disruptions become
  more regular, it is critical that Los Angeles’ most disadvantaged residents
  have access to safe, reliable community centers that can quickly support
  residents during recovery efforts. Building off previous experience, Global
  Green will develop a Resilience Hub model specifically suited for our
  increasingly hot, arid climate, and work with local community development
  corporations to identify sites for building pilot hubs.
