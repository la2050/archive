project_summary: >-
  An all-female theater collective creates an original, interview-inspired play
  that sparks change-activating dialogue about consent, rape culture and sexual
  violence on Los Angeles College Campuses

  At our current stage, we are collaborating as individuals and cultivating
  relationships with organizations.  Once we have a script, we plan to enlist
  organizations to help collaborate.
project_areas:
  - County of Los Angeles
  - City of Los Angeles
project_measure: >-
  After producing a free prototype of the play for the public at large, we plan
  to offer the script and production for free to colleges in Los Angeles, work
  with multiple entities within each college to personalize the script to their
  specific campus, help guide the production element in order to involve as many
  students and departments as possible, and facilitate post-show dialogues from
  which specific actionable ideas can emerge.  Afterwards, we would love to help
  the colleges implement individual and institutional change. The more colleges
  and voices that are involved in this conversation, the more successful our
  project will be.  We will calculate the number of people involved in making
  this project come to life: the number of people interviewed, contributors to
  the script, participating colleges, performances, audience members and
  post-show dialogue participants serve as a measure of awareness created.  We
  also want to count the number of potential solutions that emerge from the
  post-show dialogue, and to then track how many of those ideas were realized. 
  Although, if our work prevents even one sexual assault, that will solidify our
  project as a success.

  Inspired by interviews with the Los Angeles college community, The LadyParts
  Collective is writing an original play about consent, rape culture, and sexual
  violence on Los Angeles college campuses.  The play will be offered to local
  colleges as a tool for sparking a productive conversation about sexual
  violence, brainstorming actionable solutions, and enacting specific changes. 
  We plan to work with colleges to personalize the play to their specific campus
  needs.

  In this bustling entertainment city saturated with talent but plagued by
  gender inequity and lack of diversity in the arts, The LadyParts Collective
  will make Los Angeles the best place to CREATE.  As an organization, The
  LadyParts Collective provides opportunities to women who want to explore the
  range of their creative talents and leadership abilities in a supportive
  environment, and who want to apply their skills towards creating a safer,
  happier, more equitable existence for all women.  Members of The LadyParts
  Collective derive from all over the world and country; several are Los Angeles
  natives, but all of us currently call Los Angeles our home.  Our creative
  talents and backgrounds run the gamut: writers, producers, actors, dancers,
  designers, stage managers, singers/musicians, visual artists, educators,
  mothers, social activists, casting directors, creative executives - the list
  goes on.  Some of us have long resumes of professional experience, while
  others are just starting to pursue their artistic endeavors professionally. 
  Our group is inclusive to all female-identifying artists, and our doors are
  always open to new members. The only prerequisite to be a 'Part' is a passion
  for serving the Los Angeles community.  This grant will enable us to offer the
  play to the public and to colleges for free, and also to provide paid
  opportunities for women to direct, design, build, facilitate dialogues, write,
  choreograph, dance, stage manage and perform – and all for positive social
  change.
   
  In all stages of our project, we enlist the community’s participation in
  creating our play: we provide a safe space for anyone impacted by the problem
  of sexual violence to share their stories, invite them to help us transform
  these stories into a fictional theater performance by using fun, collaborative
  writing exercises, and offer the final script to colleges for free as a
  collaborative tool to make their campuses safer, more equal places for
  students to learn.   


  For many of us involved in this project, the topic of sexual violence aligns
  with personal experiences, and writing this play serves as a cathartic and
  proactive way of healing and helping others. We all feel the urgency in fixing
  this problem and want to use our combined skills to make a positive impact.
