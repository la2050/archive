  The success of the project will be measured by the following:


  - student involvement and learning


  - implementation of the project with students and teachers actively using the
  outdoor spaces 


  - a resultant improvement in student academic achievement and behavior


  - long-term research that provides real-time documentation of the process


  - integration of technology and outdoor space 


  - successful collaboration between Wyota Workshop, Rockdale VAPA Magnet,
  Rockdale PTA, and LAUSD

  Our proposal is a school, and community-led project to convert the existing
  schoolyard into a living landscape and to create an outdoor learning
  environment that supports the visual and performing arts, and the school
  curriculum. The components include multipurpose areas for open-air classes,
  sculpture, art, and sensory gardens, performances, adventure and water play,
  nature discovery and informal gatherings. Both the project and its outcome are
  envisioned to support learning.

  There has been an incredible amount of research that has accumulated over the
  last decade on School Greening Projects. It shows that green spaces are more
  conducive to learning, creating and the well-being of students. The Children
  and Nature Network, in its infographics, very succinctly summarizes the
  research that Green Schoolyards can 'provide mental health benefits, improve
  academic outcomes, encourage beneficial play and increase physical activity.'
  Numerous organizations like the International School Grounds Alliance, Green
  Schoolyards America, Children and Nature Network, People for Parks, school
  districts across the United States and researchers like Herbert W. Broda &
  Sharon G. Danks have promoted the transformation of large swaths of asphalted
  shool yards into inspiring and exciting spaces. 


  Our project is a continuation of this movement towards improving the learning
  environment in schools by enhancing the areas outside the classroom buildings.
  The research intent is to explore multiple ways the students can use the
  schoolyard. The application is to create a landscape that directly supports
  the school’s magnet program- visual and performing arts as well as LAUSD
  academic goals. The idea is to generate low-cost designs that can help
  transform the current outdoor spaces into a landscape with numerous social,
  visual, sensory, and dynamic opportunities for the students. 


  We see the design project itself as a learning opportunity and want the
  students to actively participate in its development. We also want to introduce
  visual research through videos and movies that record the process and
  familiarize students and teachers with moviemaking.


  To summarize, the project encompasses the following in the service of
  learning:


  - enhancement of outdoor spaces that support the visual and performing arts
  and school curriculum through low-cost schoolyard improvement.


  - involvement of students, teachers, staff and community with design and
  implementation.


  - integration of technology and open-air learning by visual documentation and
  moviemaking.


  - production of a research document and videos that detail the process from
  conception to completion. 


  - assistance in teacher training for outdoor learning and media editing that
  directly supports the Magnet's visual and performing arts emphasis.


  - formulation of guidelines for other LAUSD schools and PTA’s to implement
  similar projects.
