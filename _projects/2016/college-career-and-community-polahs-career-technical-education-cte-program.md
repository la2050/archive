  Port of Los Angeles High School (POLAHS) will make LA the best place to learn
  by preparing all students to graduate and be college and career ready through
  our Career Technical Education (CTE) program. POLAHS offers a college
  preparatory curriculum with CTE pathways in Boat Operations; Digital Media;
  and Construction Technology. CTE provides core academic skills aligned with
  state standards, employability skills, and technical, job-specific skills.


  In 2005, POLAHS became the first new public high school to open in San Pedro
  in over 100 years. Educated on our campus are 950 students as diverse as the
  City of Los Angeles. Most students enrolling at POLAHS are considered at-risk;
  they struggle academically in middle school and would likely drop out of the
  education pipeline. POLAHS helps close the achievement gap and provides an
  environment in which students succeed. 


  POLAHS’ CTE program was introduced on campus in fall 2015. Approximately 400
  students in grades 9-12 participate, the majority of whom are traditionally
  disadvantaged. POLAHS’ program offers individualized instruction, small class
  sizes of 25:1 on average; highly qualified teachers; and a network of
  postsecondary and industry partnerships. POLAHS maintains 98% high school
  graduation and college enrollment rates, and last year was named a California
  Gold Ribbon School.


  The program addresses an important theme: that all students learn and thrive
  in different ways. High school students involved in CTE are more engaged and
  graduate at higher rates. CTE also fosters postsecondary completion and
  addresses youth underemployment. Studies show that 4 out of 5 CTE graduates
  who pursue college earn a credential or are still enrolled two years later
  (Association for Career and Technical Education, 2016). Technical skills from
  POLAHS' CTE program provide a viable way for students to work and pay for
  their college degree. 


  Overview of CTE Program 


  Introduction to CTE: Survey course required for all 250 freshmen. Students are
  familiarized with the CTE program pathways.


  Boat Operations: Students master sailing, navigation, boat building, and
  seamanship through classroom instruction, apprenticeships, and a partnership
  with the Los Angeles Maritime Institute (LAMI). Certifications include: Red
  Cross CPR; First-Aid; and U.S. Coast Guard STCW through El Camino College. 


  Digital Media: Six semester-long courses in Graphic Design, Photography, Web
  Design, and apprenticeships. Students complete the Adobe Certified Associate
  exam in Graphic Design and Photoshop, as well as Communications or Web
  Authoring.


  Construction Technology: Students are equipped for employment and
  postsecondary education in the residential and commercial construction
  industry. Students earn college credit and certifications by completing an
  advanced Construction Technology class through El Camino College.
