  Success is defined as a strong Master Plan which incorporates a robust public
  response from park stakeholders, including residents of the surrounding
  community, park tenants and visitors, and transit riders. 


  In order to measure our success, we will take a stakeholder inventory at the
  outset of the project, including the population of surrounding neighborhoods,
  annual park visitors, park tenants, and nearby transit riders. We will set
  numerical goals based on our assessment of these populations, but our current
  working assumption is that we will seek the following measurable input: 


  • Launch of an Exposition Park oral history and storytelling website
  soliciting input from the public, with promotion through social media and
  public events. 


  • 800 surveys of residents of adjacent neighborhoods


  • 500 surveys of park visitors 


  • 750 attendees at public meetings and events


  • 5,000 unique visitors to project website


  • 5,000 followers on Exposition Park Twitter and Instagram pages


  • Engagement from a comprehensive list of museums and other park tenants,
  nearby schools, and adjacent businesses.

  This is the first step in making Exposition Park a true transit crossroads
  linking South LA, Downtown, the Westside, and nearby communities. Our project
  is a participatory planning process, soliciting meaningful input from the
  community to improve transit access, increase bike and pedestrian trips, and
  improve Exposition Park's contribution to surrounding neighborhoods by
  planning for additional amenities and better-marked links between public
  transit, pedestrian routes, and biking trails.

  Our project is a participatory neighborhood process for a much-needed
  Exposition Park Master Plan. The Master Plan will make the park both a
  destination and a gateway, bringing together South LA, Downtown, the Westside
  and nearby communities in a single park that is connected to much of the City
  through multiple Expo Line Metro stops and several buses, and through a unique
  blend of cultural, recreational, and sporting activities. We will promote
  transit ridership and pedestrian activity among visitors, while making
  tangible improvements to the neighborhood. 


  Exposition Park (“Expo”) sits just south of Downtown Los Angeles, adjacent to
  the USC campus. Its 160 acres are an iconic place to meet friends, visit a
  beautiful park and gardens, exercise, and enjoy life. It is home to celebrated
  museums, including the California Science Center, the L.A. County Natural
  History Museum, and the California African American Museum. The Los Angeles
  Football Club (a Major League Soccer team) is building Banc of California
  Stadium there, and the park’s Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum is the home of USC
  Trojan Football, and the Los Angeles Rams through 2018. 


  Expo is a jewel in the center of the city, but it faces several challenges.
  Visitors and residents are concerned that navigation within and around the
  park is challenging. The park is located on two stops of the new and expanded
  Exposition Line, a direct route from Downtown to Santa Monica, but this is not
  immediately clear to all visitors and transit riders. Additionally, there is a
  clear inequity in amenities: the north side of the park hosts plentiful green
  space and museums, but the south and west sides of the park are largely
  dedicated to surface parking, limiting the experience of visitors and nearby
  residents.


  Our goals include:


  • Preserving the historical legacy of Exposition Park, while enhancing its
  character, landscape features, and relationship to adjacent communities and
  transit.


  • Addressing the lack of amenities on the park’s neighborhood boundaries,
  reinforcing the value of the Exposition Line and the bus system, and managing
  traffic and parking impacts.
    
  • Preparing for larger crowds and a growing number of uses for the park, and
  reducing growth in vehicle miles traveled by encouraging the use of transit to
  and within the neighborhood.


  • Promoting biking and pedestrian activity through a clearly delineated system
  of pedestrian walkways and improved linkage between light rail, buses, bikes,
  and cars.


  • Increasing space dedicated to recreational uses and cultural events.


  LA2050 funds will pay for the following components of our vision: 


  • A comprehensive online presence, including social media and a dedicated
  Master Plan website. 


  • Public events including charrettes, workshops, public transit education, and
  surveys of neighborhood residents and park visitors. 


  • Interviews with park stakeholders, such as LA Metro, USC, and nearby
  businesses, schools, and the Neighborhood Council.
