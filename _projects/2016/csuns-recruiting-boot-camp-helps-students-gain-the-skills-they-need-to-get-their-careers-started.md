  We will define success by increasing the number of traditionally underserved
  students who participate in career center activities, including the Recruiting
  Boot Camps, and the number of underserved students who are placed in jobs in
  accounting and information systems industry positions. Students in the
  Department of Accounting and Information Systems will be required to complete
  a survey immediately prior to graduation to determine career center programs
  in which they participated and their perceived impact on job placement,
  post-graduation employment status, starting salary, etc. The results from the
  survey will provide the metrics by which we will analyze our success.

  CSUN’s business education extends throughout the San Fernando Valley and well
  into the Los Angeles region and beyond. Since its founding in 1958, CSUN has
  made a significant and long-term economic impact on the region and the state
  of California, generating nearly $1.9 billion in economic impact and nearly
  12,000 jobs each year.


  One of the benefits of a CSUN accounting education is the mix of theoretical
  and hands-on training students receive. The online platform College Choice
  recently ranked CSUN’s bachelor’s program in accounting and informational
  systems third best in the nation. 


  Serving more students on Pell Grants than any other institution in California,
  CSUN is one of the most diverse universities in the country and has been
  recognized by Insight into Diversity, Diverse Issues in Higher Education and
  the National Role Models for Diversity conference. Traditionally underserved
  students in the accounting program have grown steadily, increasing from 18.8%
  in 1993 to 34.6% in 2015.


  The Department of Accounting and Information Systems career center serves as a
  bridge from college life to the world of work. Services provided by the career
  center include career and job search counseling; a campus recruiting program;
  job listings; workshops on resume writing, interviewing, job offer and salary
  negotiation, internships and more; employer panels on topics such as
  interviewing and resume writing; a credential file service; and career fairs.
  Center staff also help the over 2,000 students in the Accounting and
  Information Systems majors polish their resumes and cover letters, provide
  appropriate interview clothes to those who can't afford to buy their own, and
  get them ready for recruiting. This level of coaching is particularly helpful
  for students from underserved communities, who may not have had access to
  learning the skills necessary to help them find and win the jobs that they
  have prepared for during their time at CSUN. Improving and adding capacity for
  our accounting Recruiting Boot Camp program helps these students take their
  skills further and helps opens doors to employment and fulfilling careers. 


  The Accounting Career Center is a key example of why the annual Social
  Mobility Index, sponsored by CollegeNet, recently ranked CSUN fifth in the
  nation for its impact on the improved earning power and economic prospects of
  its graduates. With additional resources, the Career Center will be able to
  provide services to all those students who deserve them.
