  No Mind Left Behind Tutoring Service provides mentorship and multi-level
  tutoring services for FREE to students throughout the greater Los Angeles
  area, allowing them to accelerate academically and socially through our
  distinguished services. With the help of the LA2050 Grant, we can grow from
  currently servicing over 350 students to thousands of students in LAUSD, ISD,
  ICEF, and so on. We have seen how our services have helped strengthen and
  maintain students’ mentality and self-esteem.

  I’m A Movement Not A Monument monitors the success of our tutoring service
  from the time we interview each student and create an academic profile for
  them. We implement weekly progress reports for every student to track their
  performance and exhibit increase or decrease per subject.  Finally, we create
  monthly timed assessment tests to allow each student to show us how they are
  advancing. This hands-on approach allows us to determine where the student is
  having problems, enabling our team to catch the mistakes and gradually and
  consistently improve their performance.


  We ultimately measure our success by having every student show up to each
  session prepared to learn. In the past, we have assessed a ninth grader at a
  fourth grade reading level and fifth grade math level. This is one of many
  similar cases we have encountered in our program. 


  As mentioned in item #11, the performance of our students is strongly related
  to their everyday environments. Many of these at-risk youth end up in jail or
  pregnant at an early age. In 2014, out of 86,823 California juveniles, more
  than 60% are Black and Hispanic, and ¼ of these juveniles are eventually
  detained with a 2nd offense (www.aog.ca.gov). Also, a total of 249,078 babies
  were born to women aged 15–19 years, for a birth rate of 24.2 (www.cdc.gov).
  Being aware of such statistics will help enhance the measure of the No Mind
  Left Behind program’s success.

  With the help of LA2050, No Mind Left Behind Tutoring Services will make Los
  Angeles the place to CREATE because we will open the doors to growth in the
  educational system throughout the nation with our proven successful program. 


  Over the past two years, I’m A Movement Not A Monument’s tutoring services has
  been fortunate enough to tutor and assist more than 350 students, and we are
  looking forward to helping more.


  I'm A Movement Not A Monument will hire more tutors looking to improve the
  education system, and also provide intern hours for college students in the
  educational field.  We will also recruit peer tutors per site allowing juniors
  and seniors to get involved by giving back to their community in a unique
  way.  Every student that is a peer tutor will receive volunteer hours allowing
  them to graduate high school with additional Honors and recognition, thus
  strengthening their college resume for scholarships.    


  We will be able to engage more students with our services, which in turn
  provides a quality convenience to a community with minimal amenities, keeping
  children off the streets and engaging them in more mentorship, leading them to
  post secondary options rather than jail or early teen pregnancy.  


  If our communities fail to CREATE signature programs such as No Mind Left
  Behind, Los Angeles will not improve. Inglewood School District is already in
  receivership as schools are under capacity due to parents pulling their
  students from certain public schools and bringing their scholar to a charter
  school. Such changes force budget cuts due to enrollment decreases, which
  result in the termination of teachers, cutting of after school programs, and
  minimizing janitorial services making the teachers unmotivated to teach and
  the students unmotivated to learn. Also, a lack of security on site in areas
  that gangs are infested results in the unapproved presence of gang members and
  riots erupting. 


  We are forced to maintain school systems in the inner city where teachers are
  in fear of their lives because our children are being raised in the streets
  rather than in adequate environments consisting of educated and effective
  guardians, mentors and advocates. It takes a village to raise a child and it
  is not only up to the parent. If we left it just up to a single mom who can
  barely afford rent, utilities may be shut off, the family might then be placed
  on government assistance of some sort, and the household is left struggling to
  get by on a daily basis, forcing an ongoing cycle of instability and poverty.


  I know we can help change this system by CREATING quality after school
  programs that improve our children’s lives by working hand in hand with
  teachers on a consistent basis, with ultimate efforts to build a solidly
  structured team focused on uplifting our youth.
