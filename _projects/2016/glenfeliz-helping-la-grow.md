  Numerous studies have proven a connection between good nutrition and
  performance in school. J. Michael Murphy, an associate professor of psychology
  at Harvard Medical School, noted that 'when students in large urban
  communities are given the opportunity to learn about ecology in a real-world
  context, they are more enthusiastic about attending school, make better
  grades, eat healthier food due to wiser food choices, and become more
  knowledgeable about natural processes.' 

  We have access to several key metrics which can help measure the effectiveness
  of our program:


  1) We anticipate an increase on our standardized test scores of five
  percentage points per year over the next five years.


  2) Fitnessgram results. Each year, fifth graders go through a set of physical
  fitness tests. In spring of 2016, [averages data from the most recent
  fitnessgram results]. In Los Angeles City Council District 13, where Glenfeliz
  is located, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health estimates that
  27.6% of children are obese, compared to 22.4% across the County and with
  rates under 10% in many more affluent communities. We expect that over the
  next five years, Glenfeliz's average performance on fitness tests will improve
  by 25%.   In five years, the fifth graders who are being tested will have
  mostly been enrolled in the SAS program since Kindergarten.


  3) We administer two different health and nutrition awareness surveys to our
  students each year, at the beginning of the year and again a

  This year, Glenfeliz Elementary School became the first LAUSD School for
  Advanced Studies (SAS) focused on Farm-to-Table Garden and Culinary Arts. Our
  program integrates gardening and cooking into the Common Core curriculum,
  stimulating student interest in learning while promoting good health. Now that
  the first of our program is complete, our goal is to expand our cooking
  program and to grow into the model elementary school in Los Angeles for
  health, nutrition and sustainability.

  Obesity, access to healthy food and the environment are all major concerns in
  Los Angeles. Several years ago, Glenfeliz Elementary  School began a
  multi-year collaborative process to help address these concerns within our
  school and our community. We were incredibly proud earlier this year when
  Glenfeliz was designated the first ever Farm-to-Table Gardening and Culinary
  Arts SAS Program in the Los Angeles Unified School District. The kitchen
  garden and outdoor classroom we built with our partner EnrichLA is the first
  public school garden certified by the Department of Agriculture, County of Los
  Angeles.  Our goal is to increase student interest and achievement in school,
  while promoting good nutrition and the health of our community, both in
  Atwater Village and throughout Los Angeles.


  As a diverse Title I public elementary school located in the heart of Atwater
  Village, Glenfeliz Elementary is ideally situated to implement this new and
  innovative Farm-to-Table Gardening and Culinary SAS Program. Over 70% of our
  students qualify for assisted lunch. For some of our students, the meals and
  snacks they receive at school are their primary source of nutrition. Because
  families in Title I schools often lack the education and resources to provide
  balanced nutrition at home, our program aims to improve both our students and
  their families’ awareness of health and nutrition, while meeting key LAUSD
  education metrics. We serve over 300 local families and also open our doors
  for many community events, including our annual Harvest Festival and Friday
  Night in the Garden. 


  With our new SAS distinction, our hope is to grow our Farm-to-Table Gardening
  and Culinary program in order to draw students from all over Los Angeles, as
  well as to open our door for even more community involvement. Over the past
  several years, with the help of our community partners, including local
  restaurants like Forage, we have placed an increased emphasis on health,
  nutrition and the joy of cooking within our curriculum. Our students learn
  lessons in math, science, English language arts and the fine arts all while
  working in our garden and preparing healthy and delicious food. 


  Due to our passion and commitment, non-profits EnrichLA and Common Threads
  have chosen Glenfeliz as their flagship school. This grant will allow us to
  expand our program by building three fully-equipped kitchen classrooms,
  increasing our gardening hours with EnrichLA’s Garden Ranger Program, offering
  more cooking classes for both our students and parents through Common Threads,
  as well as providing us opportunities to share our gardening and culinary
  expertise through more nutrition-oriented community programs.
