  Success for expanded services in our Employment Services program will be
  measured by various means.  We will count the number of new participants
  enrolled, the rate of success on GED examinations, the number of online
  certifications obtained, the number of participants hired, and by test results
  for computer literacy education services.

project_description: >-
  Safe Refuge seeks to expand our Employment Services Program, which provides
  access to resume writing services, job readiness training, and job search
  opportunities.  Safe Refuge is proposing to expand services to include online
  GED preparation/fees, online training opportunities with certifications, and
  computer literacy education for various vulnerable communities, including the
  formerly incarcerated and homeless adults.  Funds will be used to purchase
  software, equipment, and to train staff.

project_proposal_best_place: >-
  Safe Refuge is seeking funds to expand our current Employment Services
  program.  Through this program, community members are able to access on-site
  job placement and job training services for low-income and disadvantaged
  individuals re-entering the job market after an extended gap in employment.
  Our tools include employability assessments, written employment plans,
  one-on-one employment specialist services, employment preparation training,
  job placement, job training and job retention services. All services are
  available, at no cost, to residents of Long Beach and surrounding areas. We
  educate local employers on the unique challenges and rewards of hiring our
  clients and help them overcome their reservations. If funded, Safe Refuge
  plans to expand this program by implementing GED preparatory services, online
  training programs with certifications, and computer literacy education.  These
  additional services directly link to multiple CREATE metrics, including Jobs
  per capita and Unemployment rates and opportunities for the formerly
  incarcerated, although the project would benefits multiple vulnerable
  populations.
