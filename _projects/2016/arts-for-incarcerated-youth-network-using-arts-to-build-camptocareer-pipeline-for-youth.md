  AIYN is building a #camptocreativecareer pipeline through engagement,
  exposure, and connection to arts as a viable career option to youth in the
  justice system – youth who are also dramatically underrepresented in the
  creative economy. 


  AIYN is helping to strengthen voices of underrepresented youth, building
  pathways to the creative economy and creative industries, increasing the
  likelihood these students will graduate from higher education institutions
  with a goal of staying in Los Angeles (the creative economy capital of the
  country), and increasing employment opportunities for formerly incarcerated
  youth. We’re doing this by providing ongoing, multi-disciplinary arts
  engagement and skills-building by our members conducted in juvenile detention
  sites across Los Angeles County, contact with creative industry professionals
  through our teaching and guest artists, and connecting youth to creative
  economy pathways post-release. 


  The arts are known to be extremely effective in strengthening 21st Century job
  skills (creativity, cooperation, critical thinking, communication, and
  compassion) — skills favored by today’s employers and necessary skills for
  entrepreneurship. By building a pathway to employment in the creative
  economy/creative industries, we are not only providing a positive, long-term,
  sustainable career to youth who are in desperate need of options, we are also
  creating a pathway for inclusion of underrepresented voices in the creative
  economy. The vast majority - 97 percent - of youth AIYN serves are from
  communities of color. 


  Due to our collaborative structure and unique partnership with LA County
  Probation Department and LA County Arts Commission, AIYN has unparalleled
  access to youth currently in detention and their families. Since our
  inception, we have rapidly expanded to serve youth at 10 of the 14 active
  juvenile detention sites in LA County. Additionally, we are beginning
  programming in all six Juvenile Day Reporting Centers (Probation-run schools)
  where we can more directly connect youth to creative economy pathways.


  The very nature of our scale means that AIYN is itself increasing the number
  of creative jobs per capita, by providing steadier, increased opportunities
  for our teaching artists. Several of these teaching artists are in fact alum
  of our members’ programs. By providing opportunities for high school credit
  recovery through arts classes, we believe our efforts will significantly
  increase the enrollment and retention rates in higher institutions,
  particularly in creative economy fields. As one of the youth stated: “[Now] I
  see myself finishing school at CSUN and receiving a masters in art so I can
  continue my goal and do art therapy with incarcerated youths.”


  AIYN is poised to become a powerful vehicle for partnership among community
  agencies, and between community agencies and public partners. With support,
  AIYN can become a valuable asset in strengthening and diversifying LA's
  creative economy.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.​: "We're thrilled that our success to date has solidified our partnership with public agencies.  Additionally, we will use evaluation surveys to gather information from students at the beginning and conclusion of each 12-week program cycle — in order to measure success for the project. Survey feedback will help us measure:\n-\tnumber of students enrolled in classes\n-\tincrease in student social-emotional skills, as measured by pre- and post- evaluation surveys\n-\tincrease in 21st Century creative economy job skills (communication, cooperation, compassion, critical thinking, creativity) as measured by pre- and post- evaluation surveys\n-\tnumber of students continuing a pathway to creative economy careers (as measured by enrollment in internships, jobs, etc.) \n-\tnumber of Probation staff who receive hands-on arts training (systems change)\n-\tNumber of youth engaged in defining advocacy and policy priorities\n-\tNumber of AIYN members and supporters who send letters, emails, and phone calls regarding advocacy opportunities\n\nAdditionally, we have a standard list of qualitative questions for the wrap-up class to gather more open-ended student feedback.  This feedback will also inform a collective platform for advocacy, as well as helping ongoing program improvement.  \n\nWe also implement pre- and post-surveys for Probation staff, as well as for our teaching artists, to ensure constant program evaluation and improvement."
