  CWC LA will contract with the Fellowship for Race and Equity in Education
  (FREE) as an expert facilitator for some of our core training sessions. FREE
  supports education organizations to realize their missions of providing a
  truly equitable education for every student. FREE starts with race, the most
  taboo and unreconciled American subject, so that when inequities of any kind
  surface we can recognize, disrupt, and rebuild.
project_measure: "Our organization has identified a set of 12 CWC-specific “dispositions” we aim to develop in our students. The dispositions are as follows:\n* Self: self-aware, response-able, confident, agile, courageous\n* Together: culturally competent, curious, empathetic, compassionate\n* World: systems thinker, global, scholarly\nAs CWC approaches learning with a strategic equity focus, we anticipate our graduates will more fully embody these 12 dispositions.\n\nAdditionally, we will define and measure success for this project using a variety of metrics pertaining to race and equity, including:\n\n•Teachers and Staff \n\t-Diverse hiring practices and talent pipelines\n\t-Modeling behavior of successfully engaging in crucial conversations about race and equity\n\t-Feedback from continuing education/PD/dialogue\n\t-Feedback on school culture\n\t-Shared understanding of definitions and key terms  (e.g., diversity)\n\n•Families\n\t-Feedback on school culture and access to the school community\n\t-Implementation of structures to ensure equitable parent voices\n\n•Students\n\t-Feedback on school culture\n\t-Observed student leadership and agency\n\t-Development of a plan to address issues of diversity and difference with students\n\t-Shared language and values among students"

  Through CWC’s school model, students learn to meaningfully connect with each
  other, be part of any community, and courageously decide who they are in the
  world and how they want the world to be. The goal of our race, equity and
  diversity project is for staff and students to realize their full potential to
  thrive in a diverse society. To achieve this ambitious goal, CWC must equip
  our staff with the values, skills, and tools to empower students to navigate
  lines of difference and build community.

  CWC LA’s unique model is built upon three core tenets: academic excellence,
  diversity and community.  We believe true learning can occur best in a diverse
  school environment that honors and engages the community it serves. CWC
  schools bring individuals with diverse backgrounds and perspectives together,
  so students can learn how to engage others respectfully and productively, and
  develop the competencies they will need for future success in a fast-paced,
  diverse world.


  Research supports the academic benefit of a diverse learning environment, as
  noted in a recent Scientific American article that states: “diversity enhances
  creativity. It encourages the search for novel information and perspectives,
  leading to better decision-making and problem solving.” When students
  recognize and learn to transcend lines of difference, it allows them to work
  more effectively with each other, while also achieving better academic
  results, becoming stronger critical and creative thinkers, and contributing to
  society in meaningful and positive ways.


  Schools are uniquely positioned to address the social challenges we are facing
  in LA and across the country. By educating our next generation of leaders to
  deeply understand race, equity and diversity, we can help avoid some of the
  unrest we see today. CWC’s educators aspire to lead this work in LA, setting
  an example for how to maximize the benefits of diversity. Our approach to
  embracing diversity will fundamentally reshape equity in our schools by
  allowing all students to achieve at equal and high levels (compared to the
  persistent “achievement gaps” seen throughout our city and country).
   
  CWC aspires to create schools where there is a culture of learning for all,
  starting with the adults in our buildings who will learn to engage with issues
  of race, equity, diversity and education openly and honestly. By changing some
  of the language/frameworks we use, the conversation we have among staff and
  the goals we set, we expect to see positive growth in school culture and
  student achievement.


  We started on this important work in August, with a two-day all-staff training
  as a pilot. Going forward, we intend to expand our race and equity project to
  include:

  •          Building adult staff capacity for navigating differences

  •          Creating more structures to support and engage all families

  •          Developing strategies to address issues of diversity and difference
  with students
   
  We are establishing a regional leadership team that will focus on equity
  issues, provide thought leadership and help drive the outcomes we hope to
  achieve at our schools. The CWC LA race, equity and diversity working group
  will include:

  •          Experts in race/equity and SEL as facilitators

  •          Leaders across the CWC LA region – including teachers, TAs, and
  office staff

  •          Principals and other leaders
