title: The Robin Hoods of Rubbish are building STEAM Labs!
project_summary: >-
  We are the Robin Hoods of Rubbish and we want to build STEAM Labs (Science,
  Technology, Engineering, Art and Math) out of upcycled materials in 20 Title 1
  Schools in Los Angeles.

project_measure: >-
  The teachers and students who work in the our STEAM Labs will evaluate the
  process and outcomes through feedback forms. This will be done through
  pre-then-post surveys (designed with the assistance of LAUSD Science
  educators)will be completed by the teachers, parents and participating young
  inventors. We will measure attitudes toward learning the STEAM disciplines
  prior to engaging in our STEAM Labs and again at the end of the year with
  access to the STEAM Lab.

project_description: >-
  We inspire creative and critical thinking by allowing the students to create
  working head-sets, model homes with complex circuitry, robots, simple engines
  and more - out of clean, colorful items captured from manufacturers waste
  streams (that’s where the Rubbish comes in). Using this material rather than
  allowing it to head to landfill will also advance the notion of environmental
  stewardship in a generation of Los Angeles’ children.

  We will offer students with no access to a Makers’ Space our exciting STEAM
  Labs. Hands-on learning is the key to developing the next generation of
  Scientists and Researchers but where do they get the material for that
  exploration? 

  Offering these students a dedicated room filled with inspiring materials and
  tools with which to create allows all students regardless of economic
  realities an opportunity to engage in the design process where they are able
  to test ideas, fail, rethink and redesign the same way that all successful
  scientists and engineers operate.  

  We currently have 44 schools on our wait list. Schools that have need, room,
  and no budget for a STEAM Lab (this is where the Robin Hood part comes in).
  LAUSD has among the highest concentration of low-income students in the state,
  with more than 80% living at or below the poverty line. We want to teach these
  students to invent out of clean, rescued, rubbish.
