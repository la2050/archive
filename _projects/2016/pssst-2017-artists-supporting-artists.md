  LA is becoming the US capital for contemporary art, attracting artists through
  cheaper rents and ample space. In an inscrutable and hierarchical art world,
  where few artists live off of sales of their work, PSSST is committed to
  sustainability for artists and diversity in the art world. With a 20-year
  rent-free lease, a professionally-equipped Boyle Heights facility, and
  artist-driven programming, PSSST is integral to LA serving the local arts
  ecosystem. 


  PSSST was founded on the principle of artists supporting artists through fair
  compensation, community-building, interdisciplinary experimentation, and
  exchange between diverse communities through exhibitions, events, artist
  residencies, lectures, screenings, educational programs, and support for new
  work. PSSST actively works with artists underrepresented in institutions and
  in the art market--women, POC, LGBTQ, and artists whose work is not easily
  monetized.


  Founded in 2013, PSSST’s 2000 sqft, exhibition/performance space opened to the
  public in June 2016. PSSST boasts an Inter/National Residency and a Local
  Residency, both of which provide artists with live/work space and substantial
  stipends. Inter/National Residents thus far include: Marissa Perel, a
  self-identified disabled and queer choreographer, Elliot Jenetopolous, a
  transgender Lighting Designer, and our current resident Carver Audain, an
  African-American sound artist; Audain’s residency will culminate in a solo
  exhibition in October 2016. Local Artist in-Residence Guadalupe Rosales is a
  queer Chicana whose archival project on the Chicano party crews and ditch
  parties of the 90’s will result in a solo show in January 2017. 


  Since opening in June, PSSST has hosted a large-scale and
  internationally-recognized exhibition, 3 Community Conversations, 8 public
  programs that included film screenings, experimental music performances, and
  panel discussions that featured 37 artists and served over 1100 audience
  members. 


  In 2017, PSSST will host 6 Inter/National residents, 3 Local residents, 2
  Young Artist Fellows, 6 Community Conversations on intersectional topics
  ranging from gentrification to queer space, and a monthly Crit Club where 15
  invited artists will gather to discuss their work. PSSST will host 4
  exhibitions and 24 events that will include performances, film screenings,
  lectures, and live music. PSSST will present and compensate 80
  underrepresented artists at over 50 events for more than 5000 audience
  members/visitors. 


  PSSST staff are all working artists. Co-director Jules Gimbrone is a queer,
  non-binary, transgender performance and sound-based artist and composer.
  Co-director Barnett Cohen, a first-generation American, is a queer Jewish
  cisgendered man, who works in text and sculpture. Community Outreach
  Coordinator Pilar Gallego is a transgender Latinx artist. Young Artist Fellow,
  Brenzy Solorzano, is an undocumented Chicana developing a long-term exhibition
  project.
