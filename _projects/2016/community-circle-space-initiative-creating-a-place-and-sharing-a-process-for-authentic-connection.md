  The Community Circle Space Initiative's objective is to increase connection
  among residents of Southeast LA. We will use the following metrics to measure
  our success:

  - Number of elders who participate in and complete training to facilitate
  councils and restorative circles

  - Number of elders who are facilitating councils and restorative circles at
  end of year

  - Number of community members who participate in circles

  - Effect on level of participation at neighborhood council meetings

  - Rate of volunteerism

  - Crime rate

  - Number of cultural and street events and level of participation

  - Effect on attendance, academic performance, and suspension rates at local
  schools

  - Voting rates


  We will survey elders and community members at the start of the initiative,
  during the year, and at end of one year. We will also gather quantitative and
  qualitative feedback from participants after community circles, as well as
  from the community at large and from grass roots and city leaders.

  Collaborating with the local YMCA, community leaders and residents, artists
  and builders, we will design and build a public circle meeting space and train
  and support community elders to facilitate circle dialogs for the community in
  the space we co-create. The project will give elders renewed purpose and
  provide the community a place and a process for sharing stories, discussing
  matters of importance, resolving differences, determining action steps, and
  making authentic connections.

  Community Circle Space Initiative (CCSI) will make LA the best place to
  connect by bringing the power of the circle into the Southeast LA City of
  Maywood. The most densely populated city in LA County, with the highest
  proportion of immigrants, Maywood has been beset in recent years by government
  disfunction, corruption, and financial mismanagement, along with high levels
  of unemployment and gang activity. It is an ideal place to pilot the Community
  Circle Space Initiative. 


  CCSI has two components: (1) a structural component - designing and building a
  simple circular structure using natural building materials, and (2) a process
  component - training and supporting community elders to facilitate
  circle-based dialogs within the structure, providing a forum for residents to
  share stories, discuss matters of importance to them, resolve differences,
  determine action steps, and make authentic connections. 


  CCSI is a collaboration between the local community and The Ojai Foundation, a
  nonprofit with a 35 year history of building circular structures and using the
  circle dialog practice known as 'council' to foster connections. A modern
  version of ancient dialog practices of indigenous peoples around the world,
  council involves the use of a few basic elements. The first of these is
  circular seating. The quality of the circle is that the form itself creates a
  sense of connectedness. Gathered together in a circle with others we know we
  are part of something greater than ourselves. In our age of
  digital/virtual/virtually-anonymous connection, having a space and process to
  actually come together to connect in circle is perhaps our most pressing
  need…and deepest yearning. Meeting this need is the purpose of CCSI.


  By engaging residents in a collaborative, hands-on process of creating a
  unique, special place to meet in ceremony, the design and build component of
  this proposal will instigate the connection CCSI envisions. By training elders
  to serve as stewards of community dialog, CCSI will reduce the residential
  segregation they frequently experience, while increasing community
  participation in all manner of civic activities, cultural events and public
  gatherings. By establishing a place and a process for residents to listen and
  speak to one another from the heart, CCSI promises social and emotional
  support for all who participate. By creating a forum for voicing their needs
  and collective wisdom, CCSI offers residents the opportunity to mobilize for
  systemic change and the development of grassroots solutions to civic
  obstacles, as well as the increased likelihood that those needs will be
  addressed by government or volunteers. Finally, as a pilot program
  exemplifying the profound social impact of meeting in circles, CCSI will
  inspire the creation of community circle spaces in neighborhoods throughout LA
  and this will truly make LA the best place to connect.
