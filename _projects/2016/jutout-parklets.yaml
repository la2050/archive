Are any other organizations collaborating on this proposal?: >-
  I will be collaborating with landscape architect Ian Horton, PLA, ASLA of
  Working Landscapes on this proposal.
Please describe your project proposal.: >-
  To create a series of cantilevered 'Jutout' parklets overlooking Los Angeles
  waterways -- with a priority of installing the parklets in park poor
  communities.
Which metrics will your proposal impact?​:
  - Social & emotional support
  - Cultural events
  - Public/open streets gatherings
  - Government responsiveness to residents’ needs
  - Public transit riders
  - Participation in neighborhood councils
  - Rates of volunteerism
In what areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Central LA
  - East LA
  - San Gabriel Valley
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South LA
  - Westside
  - South Bay
  - Gateway Cities
  - Antelope Valley
  - County of Los Angeles
  - City of Los Angeles
  - LAUSD
  - Los Angeles Rivers and Washes
Describe in greater detail how your proposal will make LA the best place.: >-
  The priority will be to create the 'Jutout' overlook parklets adjacent to
  schools -- such as one next to Vista Middle School in Panorama City, and one
  adjacent to Grant High School in North Hollywood. The existing infrastructure
  of sidewalks that cross the L.A. River and L.A.'s washes provide a unique
  opportunity for parklet/viewing platforms that overlook the waterways. These
  road and sidewalk overpasses are strewn throughout Los Angeles -- which
  provides ample opportunities for researching and selecting sites that are
  closest to heavily populated areas -- within walking distances to dense urban
  environments. A priority will be to first build the parklets in park poor
  communities.


  Given the lack of land available to build parks and plazas in urban Los
  Angeles; I feel this is a good solution for creating more park space in Los
  Angeles by 2050. There are tons of these overpasses throughout Los Angeles
  that people just pass through; what if these overpasses instead become places
  -- places where people can connect and idle whilst viewing and learning about
  L.A.'s urban waterway system -- seeing both the complexity and beauty in its
  natural elements and its engineered elements.


  These overpass parklets would be different than the current parklet model seen
  across the U.S.; different as they will be grade separated (above curbs and on
  the outside edges of sidewalks) from traffic -- making them much safer than
  parking spot parklets -- where the risk of cars running into parking spot
  parklets is high.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.​: >-
  Heavy use -- particularly near schools. And the establishment of programs that
  facilitate learning and opportunities for public art -- such as the
  establishment of a public arts program that will create unique,
  community-based art, for each 'Jutout' park.
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
  - 'Money '
  - Volunteers
  - Advisors/board members
  - 'Staff '
  - Publicity/awareness
  - Infrastructure (building/space/vehicles etc.)
  - 'Community outreach '
  - Network/relationship support
