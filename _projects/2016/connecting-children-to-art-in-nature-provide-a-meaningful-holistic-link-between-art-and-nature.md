  We will define success by observing and documenting the process by which
  children are engaging in the Connecting Children to Art and Nature Program. 

  Evidence can include:

  1. Children's ability to use nature as a form of expression 

  2. Children's ability to manipulate materials within nature to represent an
  idea or plan

  3. Children's ability to follow-through with a concept from start to finish

  4. Children's excitement in engaging with the CCAN program and teacher

  5. Parents response to arts program based on feedback and documentation of the
  children's experience

  6. Children's ability to use vocabulary learned from CCAN to explain concepts
  and ideas

  7. Teachers use of natural materials to expand learning within the framework
  for the existing program

  Overview:


  Connecting Children to Art in Nature (CCAN) promotes multi-disciplinary
  explorations through a variety of settings with the sole purpose of providing
  a meaningful and artistic link between the child and nature. The comprehensive
  arts and nature educational program adheres to the State Board of Education’s
  model of integrating three modes of instruction:

  • Subject centered

  • Instruction connecting themes and other disciplines

  • Instruction connecting the arts and other core subjects


  Benefits of Art Experiences for Young Children:


  By learning how to manipulate the variety of natural media and becoming
  masters of technique, children can better articulate their ideas and be
  empowered to communicate with visual language before they learn to read and
  write.  Under the supervision of the CCAN Art Specialist, the children would
  also be encouraged to think for themselves in creative ways and also to move
  ahead with their creations in a more sophisticated manner.  The CCAN Art
  Specialist would work together with ABACC teachers and be involved in helping
  them understand the process of how children learn through experiences with art
  and nature. 


  Making Learning Visible:


  Documentation would contribute to the extensiveness and depth of learning
  gained by the children from their work; make it possible for parents to become
  aware of their children’s experiences in school; provide opportunities for the
  teachers to sharpen and focus their attention on understanding what children
  know and their role in the children’s experiences; children can revisit their
  work to see what they are learning and their progress.  It is important for
  children’s work to be documented because this encourages children to move
  forward or expand in their work as opposed to having their experiences only be
  a fading memory. The staff will meet weekly with the CCAN Art Specialist to
  evaluate the creative experiences, what has been accomplished, what directions
  should the next project take, what art experiences have been most successful,
  what have been least successful, and any particular concerns.


  Overall Benefits to ABACC:


  By working with CCAN, the Anna Bing Arnold Children's Center would:

  - Extend the range of art experiences it currently provides;

  - Teach children to use a variety of art media to express themselves;

  - Teach art techniques to children so they would be able to channel behavior
  to allow them to release pent-up feelings of energy or stress;

  - Encourage children to feel a sense of accomplishment by creating art that is
  admired for its beauty and uniqueness;

  - Teach children to experience new emotions that come from creating something
  that will not be judged as right or wrong.

  - Teach children to communicate visually and creatively what they may not be
  able to communicate verbally.


  Lastly, our project will help children develop higher self-esteem, cope with
  stress more effectively, increase communication skills, be creative and act in
  pro-social ways
