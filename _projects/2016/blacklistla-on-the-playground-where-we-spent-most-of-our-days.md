  The success of our work will be measured by our ability to make progress
  toward our expected outcomes. Included below are our two desired outcomes: 


  (1) More Angelenos will be moving, playing, and connecting through BlacklistLA
  programs and offerings.

  Number of Angelenos who attend BlacklistLA runs to 300+ every week, number of
  runners in BlacklistLA training groups to 500 participants, number of runners
  who participate in BlacklistLA’s 5K to 1000 registered runners, diversity of
  communities represented among BlacklistLA runners, and presence of BlacklistLA
  community members at major league races e.g Dodger 5K.


  (2) More Angelenos will be informed on how to run safely which will contribute
  to the city’s vision zero goal of eliminating traffic deaths by 2025.

  Number of Angelenos who are trained in runner safety to 50, number of runners
  who report running more defensively as a result of the training, number of
  runners using reflective gear to make themselves visible, and number of
  Angelenos who are aware of Vision Zero L.A.


  We will conduct surveys and interviews with runners, parents, and community
  members to help grade the effectiveness of our Project 4242, Happy Birthday
  L.A. 5K, weekly runs, and safety

  PLAY doesn’t end with childhood; adults need recess, too! In 2017, BlacklistLA
  will provide 100+ opportunities for Angelenos get active and play in their
  city with diverse programming on physical fitness, runner safety, local
  running events, public art and community building. Our team of volunteers will
  offer unique running experiences that integrate landmarks, public art, parks,
  Metro stations and Los Angeles’ Great Streets as vital spaces for movement,
  connection and community building.

  BlacklistLA is committed to transforming Los Angeles into the country’s most
  vibrant urban playground by creating unique opportunities for Angelenos to
  engage with it. We use running as our platform given the low-cost of entry,
  physical benefits, and life skills learned from this sport. We regularly
  engage our community by: providing three runs a week in different parts of the
  city; offering free training programs; activating informal open spaces for
  play; hosting an annual 5K run/walk; and organizing runner safety workshops.


  Our training program, Project 4242, provides coaching, support and motivation
  for runners of all abilities. We train our runners for our official 5K race
  (Happy Birthday L.A. 5K), a

  local half marathon, and the L.A. Marathon. Comparable training programs
  typically cost $75 — $150 dollars and can be daunting to most individuals.
  Project 4242 is free of charge, eliminating any hesitation, thus allowing
  runners to explore local neighborhoods – while unlocking human potential and
  bringing added vitality with every footstep. In our 2015-2016 season, a total
  of 446 runners participated in our activities. Of the 446 runners, 335
  completed the program, which amounts to a 75% success rate.  


  Happy Birthday L.A. 5K was created not only to celebrate L.A., but to prove
  that anything from roads to empty parking lots can be used as open space for
  PLAY. This year our run/walk saw a 23% runner increase and 10K in social media
  interactions.


  With the help of our volunteers, our weekly runs, the Happy Birthday L.A. 5K
  and Project 4242, BlacklistLA has been extremely successful in mobilizing and
  strengthening our community, highlighting the efficiency of activating public
  spaces, reduction of obesity, and inspiring active individuals for years to
  come. However, our work to make L.A. the best city continues.


  As we increase runnership in Los Angeles, we feel obliged to address and
  improve the safety of pedestrians, runners, and cyclists alike. We believe to
  make L.A. the best place to play we need to simultaneously increase open
  space, physical activity, community building, and most importantly, put an end
  to pedestrian fatalities. According to Vision Zero L.A., a road safety policy
  that committed to eliminating traffic deaths by 2025, amongst peer cities that
  have committed to this effort, our city has the highest transportation death
  rate at 6.27% per 100,000 people. We can all agree that statistic in
  unacceptable.


  Being awarded this grant would allow us to both continue our work in running
  and make strides in helping Vision Zero eliminate traffic deaths by 2025. To
  support this vision, we will facilitate workshops, create runner safety
  campaigns for our specific community, and collect data from our members to
  create a safer city for all.


  Through our efforts in both inspiring runners in L.A. and increasing runner
  safety, Angelenos will finally enjoy working and playing in The City of
  Angeles. 


  The hashtag #BlacklistLA explains it best!
