  We like to say the best surfer in the water is the one having the most fun!  


  We define our success by what our students retain of their ocean literacy
  curriculum over a two week period of immersion in surfing: TOES.  We are
  studying the impact of TOES on Self-Esteem, Motivation, Endurance, and Trust
  (in self).


  We measure the success with anonymous surveys given to students before their
  two weeks of immersion in TOES and then a follow up survey upon culmination of
  the second week.  We will also employ participant observation, staff and
  student interviews, and daily surf journals kept by the surf teachers.


  The surveys will have questions asking the children to rate their perceived
  levels of self-esteem, motivation, endurance, and trust.  The questions will
  relate to school, sports, and life at home.  


  The interviews with staff and students will be video-taped and their content
  assessed by the executive director.  The questions will relate to our ocean
  literacy curriculum, their experience of the beach, and their experience in
  the water.


  The surf logs will be kept by the staff.  Every day they will record the
  weather and water conditions, adherence to timeline, and receptiveness by
  students of lessons.  These logs will be assessed for any positive/negative
  correlations with the perceived success of the program (interviews) with the
  actual success (surveys).

  TOES programming breaks down barriers of access to LA County beaches.  Surf
  Bus invites LA City Park and Recreation Departments out to the beaches of Los
  Angeles to become 'ocean literate' and we provide the transportation, bathing
  suits, wetsuits, surf boards, boogie boards, munchies, and the ocean safety
  and education needed to surfvive and thrive in Los Angeles!  Our program has a
  measurable positive impact on the self-esteem, motivation, endurance, and
  trust (in self) of our participants.

  We are a social justice organization working to connect at-risk youth with the
  wonder and healing power of the sea. We believe that the ocean, a healing
  resource, should be accessible to all. Unfortunately, most low-income
  communities in Los Angeles County are cut off from ocean access through lack
  of transportation. It is our mission to connect youth growing up in urban
  areas with the ocean in a way that is empowering, playful, and safe.  Surf Bus
  Foundation was honored by the Justice Department in 2012 for our work with
  at-risk youth.  Apparently a trip to the beach improves internal security of
  our country (gang prevention!  The time children spend with us is time free
  from the pressure of gang recruitment).


  The Surf Bus Foundation was founded as an urban outreach program in response
  to the drowning of Theresa Robertson, a twelve-year old girl from South Los
  Angeles, who was caught in a rip current in Manhattan Beach. She came to the
  beach to play and was caught unaware and uneducated about the great power of
  the sea.  There continues to be a public health and education crisis for youth
  that engage in open water settings, especially ocean rip currents. Statistics
  from the CDC show that youth of color drown at higher rates than their
  Caucasian counterparts, most likely because they grow up without the same
  open-water awareness, experience, and education as youth residing in coastal
  communities. 


  We wholeheartedly believe in the healing power of the ocean. Children live in
  a physical world of exploration and the ocean environment is kinetic in
  nature.  The energy of the sea has a calming and centering effect on all those
  who enter and we believe this connection directly benefits Los Angeles
  County.  Our past work has far-reaching therapeutic benefit for youth with
  trauma pasts, mental health challenges, or autism. It seems that the sea of
  life on land for these youth has rip currents of depression and danger. The
  marine environment, ocean immersion, and the direct engagement of surfing
  waves (whether on a surf board, body board, or body surfing) offers
  therapeutic intervention similar to that of equine therapies which are now
  embraced as transformative for trauma survivors.  The shifts in life-outlook
  through successfully engaging turbulent waves of the sea are transferable to
  negotiating turbulent seas on land â€“ at home and in school.


  Surf Bus Foundation is applying for the LA2050: PLAY grant because our love
  for this city and its coastline are central to the work we have done with
  youth since 2003. Our educational programming leverages our deep roots in the
  community.  We cultivate fondness for the sea through teaching youth about how
  human actions are negatively impacting our local and global ocean
  environments. Our ocean safety education is empowering. We teach youth how
  they can make a difference by becoming ocean stewards, starting in their own
  communities, and thereby protecting the Santa Monica Bay for all to enjoy.
