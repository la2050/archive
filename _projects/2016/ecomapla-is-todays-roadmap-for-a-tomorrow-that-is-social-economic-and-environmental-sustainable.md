  Because EcoMapLA is a hosted site, we have the ability to document interface
  analytics that track and report traffic both in counts and duration of visits
  so as to gauge what works, what doesn’t and what needs improvement.  We also
  have a feedback form where users can provide input and valuable insight into
  what they wish to see.  We will have the ability to set stats for traffic,
  goal completions, and other metrics to assure we are on target, such as
  Location demographics of visitors to assure all communities are represented
  and accurately display.  Through strong analytics we are able to establish
  patterns and learn about what people are searching for on our site and assure
  we meet the need.  We will also continue to log our Volunteers activities and
  hours.

project_description: >-
  We will make significant upgrades to our website, and enhance usability of
  EcoMapLA to provide the first real time interactive map of Iconic Los Angeles
  landmarks, sustainable buildings and businesses for all Los Angeles
  Communities. Information will be displayed in an intuitive way to navigate
  with on demand tools and layers to control what you see, including pictures,
  text, videos, external links, etc. for a fully customized experience.

project_proposal_best_place: >-
  Bloomberg projects that Los Angeles will become America’s densest city by as
  early as 2025 with an estimated 38% population growth. Will our city’s
  infrastructure and services meet the demand, and sustain viability beyond
  2050?  EcoMapLA is part of the solution to a tomorrow that is social, economic
  and environmental sustainable.  


  This grant would allow EcoMapLA to add additional information such as,
  Businesses that meet the highest standards of verified social and
  environmental performance, sustainable restaurants (such as Farm to Fork)
  Local Farmers Markets, Los Angeles City and school programs, and much more,
  that support sustainable environments in all our Los Angeles neighborhoods.
   
  We will also use the funds to create the EcoMapLA App and upgrade our hosting
  site.  This would enable us to host all pertinent information, in real time
  via overlay into one cohesive platform.   We would then be able to enhance our
  Transportation category by adding EV Charging stations and transportation
  options in real time.  We currently show all major rail & bus routes however
  with additional funding we would be able to report running times and current
  locations adding live data feeds that would report current location of bus
  routes and or trains with a unique color coding making them easily
  recognizable.  Option to set up Text alerts or provide custom reporting via a
  mobile app would quickly render this feature invaluable to navigate about the
  city. This will save users time, money and energy resources.
   
  A sustainable lifestyle is a right, not a choice.  Every decision we make,
  from what we consume to what we obtain, to every step we take, whether it’s to
  work, live or play has an impact on our ecosystem. So it is only natural that
  we seek out our options when making informed decisions of where we go, what we
  do, how we get there, and what we consume.  Having a resource like EcoMapLA
  available to Angelenos, regardless of race, creed, social or economic status
  allows the community to have a choice, to make more informed decisions about
  their surroundings and help transition into a more sustainable lifestyle by
  connecting with the very community they live and work in. 
   
  By giving people a voice to identify what is important to them, and have it
  reflected in the very tool they use, gives a sense of community identity, and
  a responsibility to one another to care for that  community which facilitates
  engagement, helps create a strong bond where neighbors are no longer
  strangers, connecting people, neighborhoods and cities.  EcoMapLA is designed
  to assist people in transitioning seamlessly into a more sustainable lifestyle
  by providing pertinent information, at their fingertips in real time, on the
  sustainability of businesses, places and spaces along with transportation
  options in and around LA.
