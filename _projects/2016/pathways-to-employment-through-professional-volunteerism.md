project_measure: "OBJECTIVES\n(1)\tAlmost 600 individuals with developmental disabilities will gain or maintain integrated, community-based volunteerism.\n(2)\t50 adults with developmental disabilities will obtain volunteer positions in integrated settings in the community.\n\nTo ensure long-lasting change, this project instills the following skills into participants’ daily lives: \n(1) Social skills and relationship building in person and via social media, thereby empowering clients to access social and emotional support at the volunteer position;\n(2) Self-advocacy skills for personal relationships as well as for advocating for government responsiveness;\n(3) Accessing generally-accessible resources such as cultural events, public/open street gatherings, and voting;\n(4) Safe travel using public transportation; and\n(5) Identification of resources and volunteer jobs that are close to home and thereby reducing their travel time to work."

project_proposal_best_place: "Tierra will empower adults with developmental disabilities to break out of social isolation via valued, community-based volunteerism, thereby:\n\n(1)\tEnhancing organizational capacity\nThe State of California contracts with Tierra to provide basic support to adults with disabilities; However, the level of government funding does not allow for the innovation and customization necessary for people with disabilities to fully connect with their community. Tierra creates change-based community involvement to support adults with disabilities to be valued for their contribution.\n\n(2)\tEngaging residents and stakeholders\nDuring the discovery phase of Tierra’s program, participants experience and evaluate career opportunities. These experiences culminate in a planning session, in which they meet with family and a representative of the California Department of Developmental Services, to create a three-year plan for achieving their goals.\n\n(3)\tExpanding a program\nVolunteer and Employment Developers create partnerships to expand opportunities for career-driven volunteerism.\n\n(4)\tMobilizing for systems change\nEmployees and volunteers, at partner organizations, learn the possibilities for their family member(s) with disabilities, and spread these values throughout the organization. These organizations reported that their partnership with Tierra improved their workplace’s morale and atmosphere.\n\nSix partners found such value in the skills of Tierra clients, that they hired them as permanent employees. As a result, volunteers shifted from a temporary volunteer position, to connecting with their co-workers via a paid job. Companies increased their inclusiveness of people with all ability levels, allowing employees to connect with often-isolated individuals.\n\nThe impact extends beyond volunteerism into all areas of community life.\n\n(1)\tThe number of potential VOTERS with disabilities exceed that of either Latinos or African-Americans (Rutgers 2016). However, their voter turnout is 5.7% lower than those without disabilities (U.S. Election Assistance Committee 2013). Volunteerism strengthens the communication and self-advocacy skills necessary to engage in the electoral process.\n\n(2)\tVolunteering is linked to improved social/communication skills and inclusion (Disability & Rehabilitation Journal 2016), which are critical to SOCIAL/EMOTIONAL SUPPORT. Participants learn how to continue the relationships established via volunteerism by making SOCIAL MEDIA CONNECTIONS.\n\n(3)\tTierra’s staff have wifi-enabled devices which allow clients to ACCESS FREE WIFI.\n\n(4)\tParticipants’ consistent efforts allow partner art galleries (i.e. da Center for the Arts) and museums (i.e. Discovery Cube) to more effectively and efficiently execute CULTURAL EVENTS.\n\n(5)\tTravel training empowers participants to MINIMIZE TRAVEL TIME to volunteer positions by using PUBLIC TRANSIT systems, such as Metro, in lieu of costly and time-intensive options such as Access."
