title: 'Reading Makes A Difference: Inspiring Kids to Read & Care About Others'
project_summary: >-
  We will ignite a love for reading while developing compassion among

  We expect to see: 

  •Increased student interest in reading

  •Raised test scores 

  •Increased student compassion 

  •Teachers’ use of Jester teaching resources

  •Hospital use of Jester therapeutic tools for patients

  •Positive response from patients and families to “Jester” books & dolls 

  We measure these outcomes by evaluating reading logs and questionnaires given
  teachers and administrators observing student behaviors and parent
  participation, including:

  •The total pages read by the student body & individual classrooms

  •The number of pages read by top readers 

  •The number of students raising their grade-level reading

  •The number of students reading more challenging books & increasing fluency

  •Published standardized test-score results released after the program

  •Anecdotal reports from teachers on increased acts of kindness by students

  Teachers observe that an average of 72% of their students showed increased
  concern for others during and after our program. A 4th grade teacher in
  Central L.A. reported that students “became more aware of various causes and
  thought of ways they could help in the world.” An East L.A. 5th grade teacher
  noted that “My students became conscious about how they treat each other. They
  refrained from teasing and calling each other funny names. They learned how to
  respect people.”

  We will bring our Reading Makes A Difference program to 5 low-income
  elementary schools to develop a love of reading and kindness through
  read-a-thons benefiting ill kids. Student reading results in “Jester” books &
  dolls given to local hospitals in the name of the school & LA2050. Following
  inspiring Introductory Assemblies, all classrooms receive a “Jester” book &
  set of 3 educator enrichment manuals, with a final Recognition Assembly
  showcasing student reading achievements and compassion.

  L.A. will become the best place to LEARN when more low-income elementary
  students discover the joy & importance of reading & giving. The RMD
  program–with “The Jester Has Lost His Jingle” as its inspiration–is the
  catalyst for this empowering experience.Students read in free time not to gain
  anything for themselves but to help sick kids. Students fall in love with the
  story of a banished Jester on a quest to rediscover laughter, only to find it
  in the heart of a little girl in the hospital.They realize how much the book &
  doll will help real kids, and the world changes for them. 

  When young children are introduced to giving back, they make more positive
  choices. Instead of going down the wrong path,they find fulfillment helping
  others. Schools are likely to see truancy & suspension rates go down, as
  graduation rates rise and students stay in the education pipeline.

  When their school supports a charitable venture that changes lives around
  them, the experience transforms students’ own lives. “The outreach component
  of your program motivated many of our students to perform community service,”
  said one of many principals. “Your program provides a wonderful catalyst for
  understanding the importance of giving of ourselves to help others.” We have
  worked closely with educators in 170 Title I schools, motivating 104,769
  students to read 36,110,952 pages. 

  Our plan is to build systemic change through the children we inspire. We
  address the high percentage of illiteracy among low-income elementary
  students, most of whom do not perform well on standardized tests. In L.A., 54%
  of 4th graders eligible for free lunch read at a level considered “below
  basic.”  Among Latino students, 56% read below basic compared to 16% of
  Caucasian students. Children who suffer failure in the classroom lose interest
  in school at an early age, a predictor of dropping out of high school. A N.Y.
  Times report on an NEA study reinforces the importance of reading for pleasure
  on student achievement: “The data showed that students who read for fun nearly
  every day performed better on reading tests than those who reported reading
  never or hardly at all.”

  Students also become personally engaged in helping others with our program. A
  5th grader at Vermont Elementary in an RMD program funded by USC’s Good
  Neighbors Campaign decided that she and fellow Tigers should add to the
  “Jester” books & dolls generated by student reading for Children’s Hospital.
  Although most Vermont students receive free lunch, they rallied to collect
  loose change to help even more CHLA patients. When the principal announced at
  the Recognition Assembly that students raised $330, the CHLA Trauma Program
  Manager’s eyes filled with tears. “You all have such good hearts,” she told
  students who were waving hand-made Pharleys. “This is such a beautiful thing
  to do. You have no idea how much you will be helping our young patients who
  have been injured in accidents and need smiles. Your thoughtfulness is beyond
  measure.'
