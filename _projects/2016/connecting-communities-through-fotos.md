  The following are three outcomes to our project. Each will be measured through
  participant surveys, social reach reviews and summative evaluations of the
  nonprofit partners. 


  Outcome #1: The majority of students involved in the photography project will
  have reported increased self-awareness and social awareness. These young
  people (ages 14-18) will have expressed greater ambition and motivation to
  succeed, specifically in their community in the City of Los Angeles.
   
  Outcome #2: Eighty percent of participants in the community photoshoot
  sessions will feel a desire to be more civic-minded and socially empowered
  through the telling of their story. 
   
  Outcome #3: In the course of the year following the creation of the
  photography and specific photography shows in LA, the nonprofits that we
  worked with will see a 20% increase in online engagement through their website
  and social media sites. This will be measured by google analytics and the
  increased participation in nonprofit events and volunteer engagement.

project_description: >-
  Pictures are a powerful way to convey your mission and communicate your social
  impact. But let’s face it, many nonprofits don’t have flexible funds for great
  photography and marketing. Our project will host photoshoots for 20
  organizations across Greater LA, in order to help them tell their story and
  create visual representations of the life-changing work being done.

project_proposal_best_place: >-
  Los Angeles is a sprawling urban city. Through past projects and collaborative
  events we have seen the power of the arts bring communities and people
  together. Although LA is one of the most diverse cities in the world, it is
  also one of the most segregated. Through photography and social marketing we
  will tell the stories of these diverse communities and the nonprofits working
  in them to foster positive change. Through this creative process we will allow
  people to connect through images across the boundaries of our freeways. Images
  will encourage Angelenos to get up, get out, and connect with the great
  agencies that make Los Angeles the beautiful city it is today.


  With this project we will impact multiple of the connect metrics. Through each
  photoshoot our team will provide social and emotional support to the
  individuals being photographed by creating high-quality images of them, their
  families, their staff, and the people they serve. Our project has both an
  immediate  personal emotional impact and long-term social impact in Los
  Angeles. The individuals and nonprofits we will work with will feel an
  immediate social connection to each other and their community, increasing the
  social and emotional support needed for healthy cities. 


  The 20 photography shoots could have an impact on over 100,000 people that
  interact with these groups in Greater LA, decreasing the residential
  segregation and giving these groups more exposure in their community and
  throughout Los Angeles. Each photoshoot will also enlist the support of
  volunteers, who can assist with the shoots and promotion of the photos. Using
  volunteers and mentors at every photoshoot will increase rates of volunteerism
  and the social connections of everyone involved. Photography will connect
  people throughout Los Angeles. The young woman taking the photos will empower
  professionals to connect themselves to local nonprofits and volunteer
  opportunities. The students through the photography process will find adult
  allies throughout Los Angeles to help them follow their professional paths.
