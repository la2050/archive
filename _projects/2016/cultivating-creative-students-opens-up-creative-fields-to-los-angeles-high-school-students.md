  Cultivating Creative Students (CCS) broadens access to creative fields by
  supporting hs students as they prepare for life after high school. While most
  students have access to some form of college counseling, few high schools are
  versed in supporting students for creative college programs. CCS will provide
  rigorous creative college prep resources, including college counseling,
  portfolio coaching, documentation and more, to students lacking the financial
  resources for such focussed support.

  Prep for Art - College Coaching for creative students, based in Los Angeles.
  Prep for Art is spearheaded by Linda Pollack, a Los Angeles based artist and
  member of the National Association for College Admission Counseling (NACAC)
  and the Western Association for College Admission Counseling (WACAC). Linda
  gives presentations about supporting student creativity and college
  supplements in public libraries as well as events like College Day at Beverly
  Hills High School.

project_measure: >-
  The success of this project will be measured in terms of the number of 
  students we will reach out to in general presentations, as well as the number
  of students we ultimately work with in supporting them as they develop,
  complete and submit their college application. This includes students who are
  applying to arts programs with a required portfolio as part of the application
  process, as well as students who receive our college counseling support and
  create portfolios as a supplemental component of their application package to
  broader college programs (ie, liberal arts, communications and other majors).
  We will track students as they journey through college to provide support
  during their college years and track and note their completion, transfer and
  withdrawal rates.

  Most schools in Los Angeles, including public schools, provide some form of
  basic college counseling for their students. Providing college counseling
  geared towards creative students pursuing arts and/or broader liberal arts
  programs is especially challenging because it requires an individualized,
  intensive, intuitive approach that is time consuming in order for it to be
  effective. In the more resourced schools and communities of Los Angeles, many
  students have access to a vast network of college coaching support, be it
  through the school itself with offerings itself, or through access to a number
  of private college counselors and private tutors. There is a remarkably
  different picture, However, in the public schools of resource-challenged
  communities. In these schools, support beyond the most basic college
  application requirements is rare. With Cultivating Creative Students (CCS),
  Wisdom Arts Laboratory of Pasadena collaborates with Prep for Art (College
  Counseling for Creative People), to provide rigorous and innovative college
  counseling resources for creative students who would otherwise lack the
  financial resources necessary to have access to this more sophisticated
  network of support .


  Cultivating Creative Students will develop a program for high school students
  that will include support for portfolio development, documentation, the school
  list, personal essay /other statements development, interview preparation,
  financial aid coaching, and out reach to parents unfamiliar with the US
  college system and application process. Cultivating Creative Students could
  also help identify possible internships, competitions, and events such as
  National Portfolio Day and other occasions that help students grow their
  fluency with presenting their creative talents.


   In addition to supporting students intending to pursue formal art programs, Cultivating Creative Students will also support students who want to pursue broader liberal arts programs, through developing a supplemental portfolio that can showcase and platform endeavors in broader cultural production, such as students who are involved in advocacy work, newspaper work, self initiated projects, students who have created an innovation on solving a problem. There is no limit to where creativity is found!

  In this way CCS opens up creative fields and practices to a more inclusive Los
  Angeles.
