  Both Groceryships and Netiya have extensive evaluation tools to measure
  success. For Groceryships’ programs, participants are surveyed on BMI, fruit,
  vegetable, and soda consumption, self-esteem, and quality of life scales
  developed by the WHO before and after the 20-week program. Netiya completes
  site-specific measurements after the community garden installs, tracking
  square footage converted into food-based gardens and percentage of produce
  grown that grows community food security.  Netiya tracks the number of
  participants at garden work days, number of repeat garden volunteers, and
  participation in Garden courses.


  Further success will be evidenced through community engagement. Netiya and
  Groceryships believe in empowering local community to gain the tools necessary
  to continue growing health beyond our initial year of funding. 70% of
  Groceryships groups are co-taught by graduates. We will train congregational
  leadership to lead future groups on-site.  Additionally, congregational
  leaders can use Netiya gardens for educational purposes to host workshops and
  community gatherings on sustainable farming and food preserving methodology. 
  We will track the number of garden volunteers who have begun or improved
  gardening at home, and continue to volunteer at their church or attend other
  gardening programs around LA County, the amount of food donations generated
  from the gardens, and the participation rate and occurrence of food drives and
  other related events at each church.

project_description: >-
  Groceryships and Netiya believe that a healthy life has two ingredients: whole
  foods and whole people. With the The Trellis Project, we’ll combine each
  organization's expertise, offering one year of comprehensive food-focused
  education and community engagement from two distinct and interrelated
  perspectives: cooking and gardening. While the approaches are different, the
  intention is the same, to grow health by empowering local communities through
  existing support structures at their churches.

  To make Los Angeles the best place to LIVE, all residents need access to
  healthy food and sustainable green environments. Today, many don’t have this
  access; only 36% of residents live within a 5 minute walk to a grocery store
  and tree canopy cover only makes up 21% of our land (contrasted with a
  national average of 27%).  Only 16% of the city is park land, and from 2007 to
  2012 county farm land declined by 15%; only 3% of the total land area in the
  county is devoted to farming and only 2% of food consumed is locally produced.
  Access to community garden plots is in high demand and often too expensive due
  to fee hikes for water and the density of agricultural production associated
  with higher median income neighborhoods with higher percentages of white
  residents.  Lack of access combined with health and environmental inequalities
  have dire consequences. 20% of LA County residents are obese and the poverty
  rate is 15%, one of the highest in the country.  Poverty, obesity, and lack of
  access to fresh food are linked to negative health outcomes, including
  diabetes and depression.


  The Trellis Project is a multi-pronged collaboration by two established
  nonprofits, Groceryships and Netiya, designed to address these health and
  environmental inequalities by integrating nutrition support education into
  pre-existing faith communities and making use of underused lands at
  congregations throughout LA County. Through LA2050 we propose to work at two
  south LA churches, offering Groceryships’ 20-week nutrition education support
  groups, the installation of two Netiya community gardens, and the Netiya
  Victory Garden certification course.  Groceryships’ support groups include
  fresh produce “scholarships,” emotional support, and tools to consume more
  whole foods on a budget; Netiya offers the creation of water-wise community
  gardens on underused lands at faith-based institutions. Both empower
  communities to create lasting change in their food consumption habits, and
  increase access to healthy, whole foods. 


  Our two church partners, Emmanuel HM Turner AME Church and New Mount Calvary
  Church in Central Alameda, are home to a bustling community among the highest
  density neighborhoods in LA.  Residents are 97% Latino and Black with a median
  household income of $32,000, well below the county median of $53,000.  28% of
  people in the 90011 zip code are food insecure, contrasted with 9% for the
  city overall, and the nearest grocery stores are over 4 miles away from our
  proposed garden sites. 35% of 90011 zip code’s residents are obese, compared
  to only 25% across LA County. Life expectancy here is estimated at 77.6 years,
  compared to 84.2 for West LA.


  The Trellis Project will bring fresh produce and new ways of thinking about
  nutrition to the surrounding community. Food grown will supplement local food
  pantry offerings. Community residents can volunteer in the garden, participate
  in community events, and attend Groceryships’ and Netiya’s respective classes.
