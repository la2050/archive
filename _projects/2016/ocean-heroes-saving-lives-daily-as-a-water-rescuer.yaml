Are any other organizations collaborating on this proposal?: ''
Please describe your project proposal.: >-
  Geared for youth ages 9-17, the Open Water Junior Lifeguard Program operates
  during the summer at two open water locations within the City. Taught by
  certified lifeguards, our Program is competitive and rigorous providing
  instruction in physical conditioning, competition skills and the use of
  professional lifesaving equipment. Our Program is designed to educate and
  impassion youth to appreciate and respect the marine environment and introduce
  youth to a potential career choice in water safety.
Which metrics will your proposal impact?​:
  - Access to open space and park facilities
  - Attendance at major league sporting events
  - Number (and quality) of informal spaces for play
  - Number of parks with intergenerational play opportunities
  - Number of residents with easy access to a “vibrant” park
  - Perceived safety
In what areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - San Fernando Valley
  - South Bay
Describe in greater detail how your proposal will make LA the best place.: >-
  Southern California has a reputation for offering easy beach getaways all
  summer long.  In fact, thousands of youth within Los Angeles never see the
  beach at all, and a few who are lucky enough to make a trip may actually be
  more fearful of the waves than ready to surf.  The opportunity for youth to
  play in the ocean, to swim in the waves without fear, and to be able and ready
  to help someone else in trouble in the water – that is what this amazing
  program offers. The Open Water Junior Lifeguard Program operates for six weeks
  during the summer months at two open water locations – Cabrillo Beach (ocean)
  and Hansen Dam (lake).  Each week, the youth are instructed in aquatic skills
  such as swimming, running and paddling, with the intent of instilling
  participants with confidence in their abilities in the ocean.  Additionally,
  this program is designed to promote physical development and water safety. 
  Youth are instructed in lifeguarding skills such as effective swim rescues,
  Community CPR and First Aid. Each week there are conditioning and competitive
  activities, such as rescue board relays, run-swim-runs, buoy swims, rescue can
  relays, run relays, and beach flags, with the intent of promoting teamwork
  ethics culminating to regional and national Junior Lifeguard competitions
  against other agencies.  This grant will subsidize the costs to run this
  program and allow youth who normally would not be able to get to the ocean,
  have a summer to be on the beach and in the water, places they otherwise might
  never enjoy.  The youth will be integrated into a program that builds social
  skills and mutual respect along with healthier bodies and strategies of water
  rescue, and do it in an environment with quality facilities and friendly,
  skillful adult instructors.  In fact, a major positive element of the program
  is the student-mentor relationships that blossom, and the interaction of the
  youth participants with adult staff and the other older adults. The Cabrillo
  Beach Booster Club made up of retired lifeguards and other lifelong ocean
  water swimmers take part in organizing the Battle of the Beaches event for our
  Program.  The Cabrillo Beach and Hansen Dam Lake facilities are among the top
  destinations for RAP year-round, genuinely vibrant facilities that receive
  extra care because of high public use. (Both facilities offer kayaking and
  fishing opportunities.) This program also includes field trips to the Cabrillo
  Marine Aquarium located within walking distance from Cabrillo Beach and a trip
  to Santa Catalina Island, where youth can learn to appreciate and respect the
  marine environment first-hand. Most important in this program is the basic
  objective of teaching children to be safe in the water, to be able to rescue
  themselves and to immediately and confidently rescue others as well, making
  any beach or body of water safer for all in Los Angeles just by their
  presence. The Open Water Junior Lifeguard Program makes LA the best place to
  Play.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.​: >-
  Our work will be evaluated based on the success of the participants. RAP
  Aquatic instructors create a curriculum prior to the beginning of the program
  based on the United States Lifesaving Association, which is the governing body
  for all open water programs/agencies. RAP's program is divided into four age
  groups:  9-11/12-13/14-15/16-17.  Staff set the same goals for all the
  different age groups. For instance, during the first year, the goals set for
  the younger group is to ensure water confidence in the surf and open water
  environment. By the end of the summer, all junior guards are to be confident
  in the following: Open water swim in ocean/lakes, Long distance swim and run,
  Run/swim/run time trials, Basic CPR-First Aid-swim rescues, and
  Competitiveness at meets with other open water agencies. Although each of our
  participants attend the California Surf Lifesaving Association regional event
  at the end of the summer, RAP identifies the strongest youth from our program
  to compete with over 40 Junior Lifeguard Agencies. The top five winners of
  each event move on to represent California and their respective agency at the
  United States Lifesaving Association - National Lifeguard competition. RAP has
  success stories of our participants winning Nationals. On the heels of these
  success stories, one of the outcomes of our Program besides life skills and
  conditioning is to also be a feeder into RAP's Lifeguard program. Many
  generations of our lifeguards began as Junior Lifeguards.
