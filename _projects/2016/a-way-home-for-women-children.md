  At Union Rescue Mission, we believe that providing a way home for women and
  children is just the right thing to do. What better way to transform Los
  Angeles than to provide a tangible pathway from the streets, and from under
  the bridges, from cars and motels, from hopelessness to healing and to a
  home. 


  Our dream for LA in 2050, is a city where no-one is homeless. LA will be a
  place where EVERYONE has the chance for a job, food, and LIVE with a roof over
  their head. As part of this $100,000 Grants Challenge, Union Rescue Mission
  wants to team up with the people of LA to help 15 mothers and their children
  get into permanent housing over the next year. 


  In Los Angeles, our city, there are more than 46,000 people who live on the
  streets. More than half are women and many of them live in one of the most
  dangerous parts of Central Los Angelesâ€”Skid Row. Right now, Union Rescue
  Mission has 735 women and children living at the Mission. These are record
  numbers and for the first time in history, we have more women than men living
  at the Mission. Union Rescue Mission is one of the only places where families
  experiencing homelessness can go. We never turn a woman or a family with
  children away, setting up emergency shelter in the chapel when at full
  capacity. The women and children we serve come to us lost and broken. They are
  depressed and deeply worried about their children. Many have simply given up
  hope. 


  As a result of this Grants Challenge, more women and children will get off the
  streets of Skid Row and get their lives back on track. This starts with the
  provision of emergency food and shelter at the downtown shelter, followed by
  transitional housing and access to comprehensive, holistic services at Hope
  Gardens Family Center. This is followed by help finding a job and moving into
  permanent housing. More than 1200 women have found a pathway to healing and
  hope at Hope Gardens Family Center, since the program began in 2007. We plan
  for many more miracles to take place in this life-transforming place. 
    
  At Union Rescue Mission, we provide more than a meal. Our comprehensive
  services and transitional housing programs provide a tangible pathway to
  health, jobs and housing. We are a group of people who believe that every
  person deserves to LIVE with a roof over their heads, and want to do something
  about it. Please join us. Together, we CAN end homelessness.
