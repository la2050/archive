  The Engineer Factory: Producing engineers in South Los Angeles...one student
  at a time!
organization_name_2: 'The Engineer Factory, a project of Community Partners'
organization_activity: >-
  The Engineer Factory “plants seeds to grow STEM” in students in underserved
  communities through project-based learning in community & afterschool
  programs, engineer competitions, and TA for educators.

  The Engineer Factory, in collaboration with the UCLA MESA Program, Los Angeles
  Southwest College Urban Teachers Fellowship (LASC UTF) and the Girl Scouts of
  Greater Los Angeles seek to spark the interest of 4th- 8th grade females and
  students of color in being engineers. The program includes: consistent fun,
  hands-on, project-based learning through one-day Pop-Up community workshops;
  participating in MESA & engineer-based competitions; and providing practical
  training and resources for teachers.

  Engineer Factory will use the following SMART Objectives to measure project
  success:


  Objective 1: By December 31, 2017, the Engineer Factory will conduct at least
  twelve Pop-Up Community workshops with at least with at least 450 4th-8th
  grade participants.  Via pre- and post-tests, at least 70% of the participants
  will demonstrate increased engineer knowledge.


  Objective 2: By December 31, 2017 at least five EF supported teams of at least
  10 members each will successfully design, build and enter projects into local
  regional engineer-related competitions.


  Objective 3: By December 31, 2017 Engineer Factory will successfully execute
  an agreement with the UCLA MESA program to be its first non-school-based MESA
  program based in South Los Angeles.  EF will conduct due diligence to meet
  program training and requirements, partner wih LASC UTF to hire at least two
  student instructors and recruit at least 30 students to enroll in the EF MESA
  program.  The program will be fully operational in 2017-18 school year.


  Objective 4: By December 31, 2017 the Engineer Factory will have strengthened
  internal capacity by achieving the following: hired at least 1.0 FTE staff;
  complete comprehensive strategic and fund development plan; secured Network
  for Good Donor Management software to support fund development activities; and
  completed the EF Resource website that will link students and educators to
  various resources.

project_proposal_best_place: >-
  The Engineer Factory (EF) will help make LA the best place to learn by
  supporting and strengthening the engineering education pipeline for
  populations traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields, particularly
  females and students of color.  


  Historically, women, African Americans, and Latinos have been underrepresented
  in STEM employment. Men are employed in a STEM occupation at twice the rate of
  women and Blacks and Hispanics have been consistently underrepresented in STEM
  employment. Engineering is one of the fastest growing industries in this 21st
  century economy, providing high incomes and quality of life for its
  practitioners.  The Engineer Factory’s goal is to positively impact these
  disparities with early introduction to the engineer education pipeline via
  one-day builds for 4th-8th graders at community venues; we hope this leads to
  longer term projects and competitions;  and finally culminate in more
  structured MESA programs and elective classes offered in Inglewood, South Los
  Angeles and surrounding neighborhoods.


  Pop-Up Community Workshops: The Engineer Factory will conduct at least twelve
  (12) one day project-based workshops at community sites in South LA and
  surrounding areas (e.g. schools, faith organizations, Girl & Boy Scouts,
  afterschool programs, etc.).  Participating 4-8 grade students will learn Next
  Generation Science Standard (NGSS) engineering concepts while building fun
  projects.  Examples of projects include, but are not limited to: mouse trap
  cars, gliders, etc.  Many of the workshops for elementary and middle school
  students will be led by trained high school students.  The Engineer Factory
  plans to have at least 500 students participate in its Pop-Up Workshops in
  2017.   Since the EF launch in December 2015, 448 students have participated
  in our Pop-Up Community Workshops.  Pre- and post-test found that 71% had
  increased science knowledge as a result.


  Engineer Related Competitions: Engineer firms and aerospace organizations
  conduct engineer-based competitions throughout the year. However, girls and
  students from underserved communities are underrepresented.  Competitions help
  students gain skills such as team work, problem-solving, engineer design,
  testing and modifications and the scientific process.  Pop-up workshop sites
  interested in deepening their investment in STEM will develop teams to enter
  competitions such as JPL, MATE ROV, Rubes Goldberg, etc.  Our goal is to enter
  at least five (5) teams in competition in 2017. EF’s ROV team won 2nd place in
  the regional MATE ROV contest in May 2016.


  Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement (MESA): MESA provides a 40 year
  evidence-based track record of success.  EF will partner with UCLA to create
  MESA programming in neighborhoods that lack MESA schools, led by the
  teachers-in-training in LASC’s Urban Teacher Fellowship, a program with the
  goal of increasing the number of teachers of color.  EF’s goal is to enroll at
  least 30 students in its MESA program.
