  We will define and measure the success of this project through the following
  metrics:


  1) Event press coverage (number of outlets that cover the exhibit)

  2) Number of students that take water-savings pledge from pop-up experience

  3) Number of educators that pledge to run our 4Liters curriculum in their
  classrooms beyond the experience

  4) Surveys that will measure both student and educator feedback

project_description: >-
  DIGDEEP Water would like to create a temporary exhibit, coined the '4Liters
  Pop-Up Experience' for a hands-on-learning experience with middle school
  students in Los Angeles. 


  The 4Liters Pop-Up Experience includes several interactive displays that will
  help students explore fundamental concepts about water conservation both
  locally and beyond their communities.

  In 2010, Xylem (a water technology company) released its Value of Water Index
  examining American attitudes toward water. The survey revealed that 69% of
  Americans take clean water completely for granted (“Value of Water Survey.'
  xyleminc.com. ITT Corporation, 3 Sept. 2010. Web. 6 Aug. 2010.) This lack of
  concern is easily observable in Los Angeles, where water consumption rose by
  8% in 2014, despite an historic drought (Sanders, Sam. 'Despite California's
  Drought, Taps Still Flowing In LA County.' npr.org. NPR, 20 July 2014. Web. 20
  July 2014). 


  One contributing factor is a lack of experience-based water education for
  young people. Los Angeles Public Schools have no existing program to give
  young people hands-on training in fresh water consumption and conservation.


  Los Angeles is among the top ten (10) areas at highest risk for water scarcity
  in the US according to a 2013 study by the Columbia University Water Center
  (Shi, Daniel, Naresh Devineni, Upmanu Lall, and Edwin Piñero. 'America’s Water
  Risk: Water Stress and Climate Variability.' GrowingBlue.com. Columbia
  University, 1 Feb. 2013. Web. 31 Dec. 2009). The city is also a national
  leader in conservation, technology and entertainment. Taken together, these
  strengths and weaknesses make Los Angeles an ideal place for innovation in
  water education.
