Please describe your project proposal.: >-
  The City of West Hollywood will soon release an RFP for a Smart City Strategic
  Plan. The plan will aim to solve a number of questions regarding project
  priorities, funding options, implementation strategy, citizen privacy
  concerns, and technology best practices. The LA2050 Grant would allow this
  strategic plan to be open-sourced and serve as a model for other cities,
  especially small cities, throughout the County, through development of an
  interactive website and toolkit for other cities.
Which metrics will your proposal impact?​:
  - Access to free wifi
  - Government responsiveness to residents’ needs
  - Travel time to work
  - Public transit riders
In what areas of Los Angeles will you be directly working?:
  - Westside
  - County of Los Angeles
  - City of West Hollywood
Describe in greater detail how your proposal will make LA the best place.: >-
  The Open Sourced Smart City Collaborative, led by the City of West Hollywood,
  would build off the forthcoming West Hollywood Smart City Strategic Plan and
  create an open sourced toolkit of resources and best practices for all cities
  in Los Angeles County. 


  The West Hollywood Smart City Strategic Plan will give the City a roadmap to
  responsibly and efficiently incorporate smart technologies into City Hall and
  the urban infrastructure and leverage that technology to improve our citizens'
  quality of life, provide data to make smart decisions, and create
  opportunities for attracting and maintaining business.


  Most Smart City strategies are tailored for large cities and disregard the
  opportunities available for smaller cities.  With a population under 35,000
  and number of new smart technology initiatives underway, including development
  of a municipal fiber backbone network, acquisition of light standards from
  Southern California Edison, and a robust smart bus shelter replacement
  project, the City of West Hollywood lacks a model guiding plan to integrate
  and streamline its Smart City projects.  


  We suppose that many of the other cities in Los Angeles County are in the same
  position as West Hollywood in this regard. While larger cities like Los
  Angeles and Long Beach are large enough to attract the attention of major
  Smart City infrastructure providers, smaller cities in the region often get
  left behind. 


  This project proposes to develop the West Hollywood Smart City Strategic Plan
  as an open sourced document from the beginning. The plan would be developed
  with the other 87 cities in LA County in mind, and would include shareable
  countywide, regional, state, and national policies, funding mechanisms, and
  best practices. An interactive, robust website would allow for easy Countywide
  collaboration and provide a digital toolkit for our fellow LA County Cities. 
  West Hollywood would convene quarterly regional meetings to build the Smart
  City network across LA County.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your project.​: >-
  Success for the Open Sourced Smart City Collaborative will include
  participation in the collaborative by at least 16 (20%) cities in LA County,
  50 downloads of the toolkit, and 2 round table events.
How can the LA2050 community and other stakeholders help your proposal succeed?:
  - 'Money '
  - Advisors/board members
  - Publicity/awareness
  - 'Community outreach '
  - Network/relationship support
