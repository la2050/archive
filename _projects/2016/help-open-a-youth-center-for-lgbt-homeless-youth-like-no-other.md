  We believe that listening to our Clients is always the best way to judge our
  success, or lack thereof.


  Methods such as surveys and feedback forms will be used as a way to evaluate
  our work. Through a series of thorough questions about our events and
  activities, we will give both our youth and adults the opportunity to freely
  express themselves on the use of this Youth Center. Surveys will be made
  available on-site and online as well. These can be submitted anonymously as a
  way to comfort the author and not let them feel pressured.


  The tracking of case progress would also be a key component of our success, as
  we would follow up with local service providers to ensure that youth are
  taking the next step in the rehabilitation process and reaching out for help.


  Leaders of the Youth Center will also have to hold themselves accountable for
  the goals they have collectively outlined for the facility. By meeting
  regularly, giving each other feedback, and identifying any potential issues,
  Staff can increase their chances of providing the best possible service for
  all of its Clients. A majority satisfaction rate in performance would be the
  target for both statistics and client satisfaction. A database of these
  evaluations would be maintained regularly as a way to document the progress of
  the Youth Center.


  We would also solicit feedback from our local community as a way to maximize
  the use of the Youth Center by discussing both its strengths and areas for
  improvement.

  To open a unique Youth Center for LGBT Homeless & at-risk youth (ages 14-24)
  that offers fun, educational, and resourceful activities on a regular basis.
  At our signature dances, youth attendees would get an opportunity to escape
  their day-to-day challenges while at the same time gaining access to services
  available to them locally via our community partners & agencies (i.e.
  transitional living, GED programs, emotional support, & other social
  services).

  This new and unique Youth Center would serve as a hybrid of activities that
  are both fun and resourceful. We feel that the best way possible to make L.A.
  the best place to CONNECT is by using the same formula we have used for over
  10 years: DIVERSITY. Diversity in safe place where individuals from different
  cultures, backgrounds, faiths, identities, and cities can all come together to
  lift the next generation and get them off the streets.


  57% of homeless teens spend at least one day every month without food and a
  large percentage of LGBT homeless youth are at high risk for HIV infection &
  substance abuse. Reaching out to them and encouraging them to seek services
  can be a challenge through traditional means currently available. A Youth
  Center that offers regularly scheduled (fun) activities like dances, movie
  screenings, and social mixers, is more likely to attract the attention of
  these teens and serve as a 'first-step' in their rehabilitation process. As we
  like to say, 'The fun gets them in the door, but the resources inside can save
  their lives!'.


  We anticipate servicing as many as 2,000 youth via our signature dances alone
  in the Center's first year. An additional 1,000 (or more) can be serviced
  through workshops, incentives, and special activities. These numbers are a
  significant increase of our current reach and LA2050 would allow us to have a
  greater impact in solving the issue of homeless LGBT teens in Hollywood. 


  All major events & activities at the Youth Center would partner with local
  service providers as a way to link youth to valuable services like
  transitional living, GED  programs, HIV & STD Testing, emotional support, &
  other social services. As we have done for over 10 years at our events, we
  would engage existing youth organizations in the area by offering them
  outreach tables, the opportunity to present workshops, distribute
  informational materials, and interact directly with our attendees. These
  partnerships are key and would serve as a centerpiece for both our work and
  our on-going effort to help get kids off the streets. While some organizations
  may already have their own youth center, ours would serve as a crossroads for
  all agencies and a neutral ground where we can all come together and service
  these teens.


  In an effort to involve the surrounding community, this Youth Center would
  regularly reach out to local residents, schools, neighborhood councils, and
  community leaders. Increasing our current volunteer base from 50 to 200
  affords more people the opportunity to have a stake in the overall mission and
  to bring something different to the table. Activities such as Open Houses and
  Community Fairs would give us a golden opportunity to educate residents on
  homelessness and what they can do to help solve the problem.
