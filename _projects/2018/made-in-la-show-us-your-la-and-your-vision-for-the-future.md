  LA is one of the most diverse places on earth and is home to people from every
  country and culture. It is also home to the film industry — a place that falls
  dramatically short of reflecting the diversity of Los Angeles. To quote Mayor
  Garcetti, “When ‘Oscars So White’ and ‘Time’s Up’ put a spotlight on
  inequality in Hollywood, they captured the frustrations of people shut out of
  the opportunity in what the world knows as LA’s signature industry.” With Made
  in LA, we aim to open the door for those opportunities, giving a voice to
  everyone in LA and creating a more connected sense of community by including
  these important stories in the conversation. We will empower 50 filmmakers (or
  50 filmmaker teams) to show us their LA through a series of shorts to be
  featured as part of an online interactive map and with select films premiering
  at the LA Film Festival.



   Film Independent will host an open call for community members to submit short films inspired by a three-part prompt: 1) show us your LA, 2) tell us who you are and 3) speak to your future hopes for your neighborhood or the county. There will be no cost to submit, eliminating barriers for filmmakers. Submissions will be solicited via outreach to film schools, LA-based cultural organizations, Film Independent online presence (one million subscribers) and more. All submissions will be reviewed by our Digital Content and LA Film Festival programming team. 50 short works will be selected to represent every corner of the county—from Malibu to East LA and from Long Beach to the Valley. Creators will be diverse, representing an inclusive spectrum of race, gender, ability, sexuality, immigration status and socio-economic status. Likewise, creators are encouraged to explore the prompt across a variety of genres.



   The call for entries will be announced at the LA Film Festival in September 2018. Allowing time to finalize selections, the shorts will begin to premiere online in February 2019. The films will roll out over approximately six months and will be added to a custom playlist on YouTube. The primary digital activation will be on an interactive microsite at filmindependent.org featuring a map of LA, with tiles for the short films placed over their neighborhood that play and expand when clicked. Each short film will include bios, headshots and social media info for the filmmakers. As each film is released, our marketing team will promote the film through social channels, inviting Angelenos to have open discussions about the future of LA and connect on social media. A selection of shorts will play on the big screen as part of a free community event at the LA Film Festival including a conversation with filmmakers discussing how to get more involved in your community followed by a networking event, serving as a way for people to engage and connect in-person. We intend to open up a dialogue about LA and its future by inviting all Angelenos to participate in the conversation and have their stories told.
