  Our organization is based in Los Angeles and while we have activations all
  over the country, we tend to work with local artists for our Arts Education
  program. These artists develop art projects using crayons that are then
  applied to Common Core standards. Research shows that students who have access
  to art tend to do better in all subjects. These art projects are posted on our
  website and made available for any school or institution to download and apply
  to their classrooms.
