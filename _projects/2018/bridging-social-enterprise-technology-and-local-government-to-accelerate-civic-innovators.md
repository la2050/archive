  Los Angeles has the potential to be the premiere ecosystem for civic
  innovation and entrepreneurship. Already home to the nationâ€™s third largest
  technology community behind Silicon Valley and New York City, Los Angeles has
  demonstrated the talent, resources, and empathy that are the foundation of a
  successful entrepreneurship community.
   
    
   
   However, like any innovation community, its success or failure will hinge in part on its infrastructure for taking new ideas to market. This infrastructure is especially important for civic technologists and entrepreneurs who are on the front lines of breaking down barriers to new frontiers of public and social sector innovation.
   
    
   
   Over the last decade, we have seen cities become overburdened with increasing demands and limited resources, all the while a cadre of local citizens and organizations have been raising their hands to utilize technology to help make their cities work better. The rise of the hackathon model is evidence of the pent up demand from the tech community to work on issues that matter. While hackathons can jumpstart the process that leads to lasting solutions, we are fundamentally missing the civic infrastructure that bridges the digital divide and brings expert citizens, the tech community, and local government together in a process to yield measurable civic and social impact.
   
   
   
   Launched in 2014, Civic Innovation Lab (CIL) serves as a platform to facilitate cross-sector collaboration and the creation of civic and social solutions through a mix of design challenges, structured programming, and networking with public and private sector experts.
   
    
   
   We believe all citizens, not only developers and programmers, need to be engaged in how technology improves our public lives and makes government more effective. We recognize that experts in policy, urban planning, social justice, and citizens at large may be the best suited to develop solutions that lead to measurable impact in the public sphere. To this end, our programs aim to engage anyone with a project or idea and connect them to volunteers with the necessary design and tech skills and subject matter expertise in order to partner and prototype solutions.
   
    
   
   We also know that to get real traction and develop civic tech that works, it needs to happen through a facilitated process that involves engagement and testing over time. We aim to create civic infrastructure that brings expert citizens, the tech community, and government together in a process to yield measurable civic and social impact.
