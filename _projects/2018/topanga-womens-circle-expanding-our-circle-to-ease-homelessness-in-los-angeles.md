  The Community Circle Project (CCP) will make LA the best place to live through
  creating hands-on civic engagement that will lessen the burden of homeless
  families as they transition to life off the streets.

   Los Angeles is America’s capital city for the homeless. Thousands of families with young and teenage children find themselves on the streets for a variety of reasons. Every family has a different story ranging from addiction to a fluctuating job market Partner all of that with an overpriced rental market that has little relation to the average earnings of many Angelenos and the combination of factors is a perfect storm for growing a large homeless population.



   The Community Circle Project has two key components: (1) a strong, volunteer outreach program and (2) developing relationships with supportive local housing authorities.



   By sharing 15 years of successful metrics from Topanga Women’s Circle (TWC) we will create a guide detailing aspects of our 100% volunteer organization. The guide will include storage, purchases, maintenance of a volunteer base, fundraising and strong communications with volunteers.



   Helping other city service group transform bare-bones, bridge housing into comfortable, welcoming homes for the homeless, a sense of pride is established for both the volunteer and the homeless client, often carrying forward as the client moves into their permanent housing. By being a part of every aspect of creating a welcoming home for these families, the volunteer develops a better understanding of the challenges the homeless population faces and can feel confident that their time spent setting up a home is appreciated beyond measure.



   We will cultivate a relationship with Los Angeles County’s supportive housing authorities and develop a comprehensive database of those groups in need of CCP’s services.



   A CCP goal is to create an environment of love and comfort with a focus on dignity and self-worth and all items provided are new or like new. CCP volunteers not only provide these building blocks to comfort but also decorate each apartment in order to welcome all families with dignity and love. Everything purchased is a straight donation to the families as they move forward from bridge to permanent housing.



   CCP will improve the lives of homeless Veterans, children and families in Los Angeles County by giving the tools necessary to area service groups to create a strong civic engagement program that will help LA be the best place to live.
