  Success would be defined as a measureable change over at least a month. The
  kids with the help of associates and volunteers would be recording the success
  in their tablets.

   1. Weekly Weight of each member of the family. 
   
   2. Monthly Dietary changes implemented and sustained by the family.
   
   3. Monthly BMI of each member.
   
   4. Final Rubric for reduction in Calories, Saturated Fats, Salt, Sugar and High Fructose Corn Syrup by the families.
   
   5. Feedback and Testimonials from families, volunteers and community.

  YEAR-1
   
   Project Design: 
   
   For this project, 25 Kids (elementary to high school students) with at least one obese member of the family, would be recruited from schools and faith based organizations from East LA and San Fernando Valley. They would be motivated and mentored for a research project based learning regarding nutrition, especially calories, sugar and salt. They would be given a tablet to collect the data to share in a monthly meeting with the mentors. The kids would finish the projects in 3-4 months and share with their families. Based on their research, they would record the changes in their own lifestyle and the lifestyle of their family. The outcome would be measured as weight and BMI of each member.The project and results would be presented to the community at the end of year in a fundraising dinner as well as on the website.

  We would win the war on Obesity in LA by making it less than 8 percent. 
   
   It would create at least 50 budding leaders in Science Education by our next vision of 'Each One, Reach One'
