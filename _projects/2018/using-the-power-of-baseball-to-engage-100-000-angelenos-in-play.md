  We promote play to a level that will increase the number of residents that
  access a vibrant park, increase enrollment of kids in after-school programs,
  and increase opportunities for inter-generational play in LA.
   
   
   
   We refurbish fields across LA County to support community play in underserved communities through Dreamfields. At these fields, we set the stage to play baseball/softball by adding stadium aesthetics to existing fields, planting new sod, and upgrading backstops, dugouts and benches to make parks a safer place to play baseball/softball in the community. Our data shows that these revitalized fields have the power to create vibrant play spaces, as well as cultivate safe and centralized environments for communities to play.
   
   
   
   Through Dodgers RBI, fitness clinics, skills clinics, workshops and community events, we promote programs that are necessary to sustain park activity and ensure these spaces remain vibrant parks for the community. With RBI, we provide underserved communities with equipment and program resources that are necessary for youth ages (5-18) to play baseball/softball in LA. Here, youth are able to participate in a positive recreational activity after-school, alongside their peers. To engage adults in RBI, we provide training to coaches, parents and park administrators to empower them to be better role models and leaders for their community. We encourage them to share their experience with us, and each other, to inform program design and improvements. We also provide them access to LeagueApps, an online sports registration and communication platform, to stay informed of program activities at Dreamfields, within RBI, and in the community. LeagueApps allows park staff to share announcements of upcoming events at their local park so as to drive digital organizing efforts in the places where they live. Collectively, these efforts engage the community to be active in play and to participate in inter-generational programming at Dreamfields and RBI.
   
   
   
   We also provide a breadth of volunteer opportunities for corporate and community volunteers at Dreamfields sites and RBI activities. Volunteers participate in registration and coordination of special events, such as community service days to further promote their involvement in the community and invest in play-related programs. Additionally, we collaborate with numerous fitness, sports, and play-oriented organizations to promote play in the community through fitness clinics, skills clinics and coach development workshops. These collaborations further engage youth in after-school programs, build cohesive community identity, reinforce play in our programming, and contribute to the vibrancy of the park that supports a play-active LA.
   
   
   
   Lastly, we engage over 3 million Dodger fans each season to support play and donate to our cause. At Dodger games, we interact with fans to enhance awareness of our mission and to get them activated for play in LA through individual giving opportunities.
