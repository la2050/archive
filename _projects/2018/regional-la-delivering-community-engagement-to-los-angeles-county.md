  Information exchange between government and residents is disjointed and
  one-way, with each agency or body employing its own broadcast channel.



   A tool is needed that allows residents to gather all of these streams into a single flow and also to add their own voice in the dialogue.



   REGIONAL.LA is a social media tool that allows residents to find and connect with their civic community according to local geography: cities, neighborhoods, service areas.



   By bringing these parties together, REGIONAL.LA allows residents to obtain better response from their local governments, participate more meaningfully in their neighborhood councils and other bodies, and form more & deeper social media connections with other residents through shared participation.



   Regional.LA works as follows:

   (a) PLUG-IN: Create an account and link it to your other social media so that you may consume the experience in your preferred environment (Regional.LA means to work with other social media platforms rather than compete).



   (b) GEOGRAPHIC DISCOVERY: Identify your address or neighborhood and be presented with a list of gov't agencies & bodies operating in your area (this is accomplished by analyzing intersections between your area and the service areas of the gov't entities).



   (c) EXPEDITE SERVICES: Browse from available services listed by local gov't entities and submit any requested info that would expedite these services (Gov't can serve you better if they know you better). This can apply to utility initiation, emergency response, volunteer opportunities, etc.



   (d) STAY INFORMED: Subscribe to news feeds from gov't entities in your area.



   These software capabilities have already been deployed in early form in select pilot areas, and over the course of the grant life cycle deployment will be expanded ultimately throughout all of Los Angeles County. In addition, deployment will be accompanied by a robust "ground game" of local ambassadors, drawn from local communities, and funded to actively promote adoption of the platform in their areas.



   This activation will enhance GOVERNMENT RESPONSIVITY by providing a venue for direct citizen/government connection: residents can discover and make themselves known to their local government agencies, facilitating better interactions. Furthermore, governments can post surveys & questionnaires and also advertise volunteer opportunities and services --residents can respond & register online to enhance government response.



   This activation will enhance CITIZEN PARTICIPATION (voting) in Neighborhood Councils by providing (a) a means for the Councils to have a higher profile amongst residents and deliver more value to residents, and (b) a means for Councils to actively advertise and facilitate voting opportunities.



   This activation will deliver more and deeper SOCIAL MEDIA CONNECTIONS among residents by providing new ways for them to participate together in activities of common interest, thus promoting direct residents-2-residents discovery.
