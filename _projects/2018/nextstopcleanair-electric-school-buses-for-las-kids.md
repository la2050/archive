  When people think of Los Angeles, they think of the incredible mix of cultures
  that make up the backbone of our city, the sunshine, and maybe the beach. But
  they also likely think of the traffic and the smog, and their effects on our
  environment and our kids. It’s true that in our state, emissions from our
  transportation system accounts for a majority of the emissions that lead to
  climate change, and dirty air days are on the rise for the last three years
  running. These impacts are magnified on our city’s kids, leading to an
  astounding million days of missed school for kids suffering from respiratory
  problems, who travel to and from school on polluting school buses powered by
  dirty energy we don’t need. It shouldn’t be this way. Through intentional
  policies, we have the power to end this problem and create a more livable,
  breathable, and greener city for all—most importantly for our youngest
  residents—while creating pathways into good, clean manufacturing jobs for
  youth and underserved communities. 
   
   
   
   Every weekday, over 40,000 kids and hundreds of bus drivers and climb aboard 1,300 school buses around Los Angeles. But what if these school buses were powered by electricity, generated from the sun and the wind? The LA County Electric Bus Coalition is working to convince the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) to take a critical step towards making our city the best place to live, cleaning up our air and creating a safer, healthier climate for the kids of today and tomorrow by transitioning its old polluting school buses to new, clean and safe electric buses by 2030 or sooner, that are manufactured right here in Southern California. 
   
   
   
   Our coalition has already had two major successes that are laying the groundwork for an all-electric school bus fleet. First, we convinced LA Metro to make a historic commitment to transition its fleet of more than 2,400 buses to electric buses by 2030. Second, we won a commitment from the LA City Council to transition the Department of Transportation’s 350 buses to electric by 2030 or sooner. Together, both commitments represent more than a quarter of all transit buses in the state.
   
   
   
   We know how to win this fight, and it will take Angelenos of all stripes to make it happen. We will activate 100,000 students, teachers, parents and community members in our campaign, engaging them in activations as simple as signing a petition to training a teacher to turn out her students to an event in support of electric buses to engaging young people to monitor air quality on their daily bus commutes. The members of the LA County Electric Bus Coalition are committed to empowering kids to become leaders in their communities and build the movement fighting for a better city for decades to come, cleaning up our air, and creating good jobs for the region.
