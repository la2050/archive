  A house for Tommy in my backyard! 
   
   If only LA knew the opportunity that lies in our backyards…

  There is no room for Tommy, the spaceman, and many more people in LA. But in
  our backyards may lie a great opportunity to make an extra rental income while
  increasing housing in LA. If only LA knew…

  LA will be the best place to LIVE when it has enough affordable housing to be
  considered a truly inclusive place. We plan to activate Angelenos to build
  more housing units in Los Angeles: one unit - per backyard - at a time, to
  accomplish this goal.
   
   
   
   Our activation will create an easily accessible database that identifies which properties in Los Angeles County can have secondary units (also called Accessory Dwelling Units or ADUs) on their lots. We will also create an awareness campaign to educate homeowners on the opportunity that lies in their backyards: an additional housing unit that can create rental income while helping with efforts to increase affordable housing in LA.
   
   
   
   Los Angeles is struggling with lack of affordable housing and an increase in its homeless population. ADUs are a significant way to increase the housing stock in Los Angeles.
   
   
   
   LA County and the City of LA have relaxed zoning regulations in order to allow for construction of more ADUs. The number of permitted ADUs has grown this past year. However, if we are to make a dent in the affordable housing crisis we have to build many more ADUs per year.
   
   
   
   Nowadays, a process to determine if a lot is eligible for an ADU addition requires the design consultant’s or homeowner’s investment of time to read and interpret complicated zoning code constraints.
   
   
   
   We propose to streamline this process by generating quick answers for homeowners on their possibilities regarding ADUs on their properties. To accomplish this task our database will use machine-learning and existing Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to predict with good certainty the likelihood of a property being allowed by zoning codes to have an ADU. 
   
   
   
   After the database is generated, we will develop a user-friendly website where anyone can search for their property and see if they can build an ADU. We will be able to reach out more people in less time and hopefully contribute to engage more homeowners in building ADUs.
   
   
   
   We will also create an awareness campaign targeting homeowners of South LA, Central LA and East LA.
   
   
   
   Our activation will eventually contribute to the addition of affordable units in communities impacting Housing Affordability Metric and Homelessness Metric. We also believe that it will impact the Resilient Communities Metric since it will boost much needed housing opportunities.
   
   
   
   LA will be the best place to LIVE when housing becomes more affordable, and homelessness is drastically reduced. We will activate Angelenos to participate in the affordable housing movement. We can all be a part of the affordable housing solution in LA!
