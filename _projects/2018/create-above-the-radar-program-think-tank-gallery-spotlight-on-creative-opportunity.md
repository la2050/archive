  Create Above the Radar Program – Think Tank Gallery Spotlight on Creative
  Opportunity
project_summary: |-
  Your art is better when you don't have to hide it. 
   
   
   
   #CreateAboveTheRadar makes permitting your production less daunting, & provides opportunities for your show, mural, or event to find a scene in LA

  Artists invent new ways to do things, & we all benefit from that exploration.
  Because most creatives buckle at bureaucracy, starting with ideas rather than
  legal feasibility, regulation tying up cultural opportunity acts as a hidden
  landmine that takes a big idea’s legs out before seeing the light of day. If
  more creatives could produce compliant work, they could empower their practice
  & employ collaborators more often; we believe collaboration is fuel for
  creation. We aim to pull such projects up from hiding spots below the radar,
  benefiting economic leadership in the process.
   
   
   
   Bringing underground & unregulated productions that we all know exist out of the shadows removes fear to advertise or engage with the community. It also provides local economic impact by tapping a wider audience, allowing for open dialog between artists’ audiences & the City, free of hiding their art from regulation.
   
   
   
   Weeks before Oakland’s Ghost Ship Fire, we submitted a similar LA2050 application, provided an honorable mention by judges. Since then, we’ve been offering free consultations to DIY productions coming to us after compliance speedbumps. We also co-directed Bringing Back Broadway’s annual festival spearheading use of nontraditional spaces for 3 years, with 90k+ attendees. Now we’ve been invited to join LEIA (below) to form a permitting committee with governing bodies that regulate safety for artistic creation in LA.
   
   
   
   With them, this project institutes a catch-all website, a repository for regulatory measures & how to smoothly work through them. This resource is assembled by our experts, with a large survey of problems from local creators & solutions to those problems. It will be sent to various governing bodies for feedback, but will exist as a standalone asset for creators to explore. While it will not automatically send users directly to agency inboxes or applications (using up limited government resources for such consultation), it will provide creators with a checkbox & drop down menu system that bounces them out to informative pages on how to create compliant events & artworks. The resource will culminate with hyperlinks to application forms & office contact information, once they reach the point that agency outreach is appropriate.
   
   
   
   LA is the epicenter for artistic creation. Our mayor called it “the most creative city in the history of the world,” but its permitting process has been convoluted, & many large projects have been chopped off at the knees. The vast sprawl & diverse creative industry of our city allows for boundary pushing work, matching our city’s constant flux of neighborhood boundaries, & we have witnessed a group of artists eager to know what the city wants from them. At the moment, the largest projects that these creators produce are fleeing to cities that have less intimidating processes (recently, the massive “Tension” show’s move to Vegas), & it's time to regain LA’s place as the most vibrant, immersive region for artistic monetization
