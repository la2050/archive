title: Students Engaging Los Angeles
project_summary: >-
  How do LA’s youth experience LA and how do they imagine LA’s future? LASA
  invites them to consider how they are problem-solvers and visionaries of both
  the LA of today and of tomorrow.

  LASA's definition of success is twofold. First, LASA seeks to introduce youth
  to the complexities of LA infrastructure. Second, LASA seeks to empower youth
  to become problem-solvers and agents of change.

   LASA measures success via:

   * Number of students participating and number applying;

   * Positive written feedback from students, teachers, and speakers.

   * Students' knowledge of the aspects of LA infrastructure and ability to frame issues they plan to address moving forward;

   * Further, by completing the alumni database, LASA will be able to track, foster, and celebrate the change LASA graduates bring to LA in concrete terms.

make_la_great: "LASA will make greater Los Angeles the best place to learn by providing an intensive introduction to the infrastructure and institutions of greater Los Angeles for high school juniors who have expressed an interest in public, civic, and civil service. As a supplement to their regular school year, LASA students learn from the very heart of the region's history and culture, and, in so doing, learn how best they can contribute to the region and our collective problem-solving obligations. LASA engages curiosity and the desire to create change in a diverse landscape of spaces from the Metropolitan Water District, the Port of Los Angeles, the business community, to the local arms of the judicial system.\r\n\r\nParticipants gain the experience and knowledge necessary to better understand the intricacies — infrastructural, historical, political, economic, and otherwise — of the region in which they live, and build lasting bonds of friendship, camaraderie, and work experience with a diverse group of peers.\r\n\r\nLASA speakers - in the dozens - including Jeff Kightlinger of the Metropolitan Water District, Raphael Sonenshein of the Pat Brown Institute at California State University-Los Angeles, and Belinda Waltman of Whole Person Care Los Angeles - help the students create a foundation of knowledge to inform their visions for the future.\r\n\r\nLASA contributes to LA as a space to learn by encouraging the students to learn by sharing their diverse experiences with each other and with the speakers. They listen to each other and define the issues in LA they want to address moving forward.\r\n\r\nNew this year, LASA partnered with Pasadena's Partnership for Success and Polytechnic School to launch the Mt. Wilson Project that engages student interest in STEAM and culminates in a nighttime trip to view the universe through the 60\" telescope. Further, LASA launched a summer research essay competition to sponsor and mentor two students pursuing research on Los Angeles after their LASA year.\r\n\r\nOur hope is that, over time, LASA will change the lives and career paths of hundreds of high school students in the region and will become an agent of change and community building throughout Los Angeles."

  LASA will make greater Los Angeles the best place to learn by providing an
  intensive introduction to the infrastructure and institutions of greater Los
  Angeles for high school juniors who have expressed an interest in public,
  civic, and civil service. As a supplement to their regular school year, LASA
  students learn from the very heart of the region's history and culture, and,
  in so doing, learn how best they can contribute to the region and our
  collective problem-solving obligations. LASA engages curiosity and the desire
  to create change in a diverse landscape of spaces from the Metropolitan Water
  District, the Port of Los Angeles, the business community, to the local arms
  of the judicial system.


  Participants gain the experience and knowledge necessary to better understand
  the intricacies — infrastructural, historical, political, economic, and
  otherwise — of the region in which they live, and build lasting bonds of
  friendship, camaraderie, and work experience with a diverse group of peers.


  LASA speakers - in the dozens - including Jeff Kightlinger of the Metropolitan
  Water District, Raphael Sonenshein of the Pat Brown Institute at California
  State University-Los Angeles, and Belinda Waltman of Whole Person Care Los
  Angeles - help the students create a foundation of knowledge to inform their
  visions for the future.


  LASA contributes to LA as a space to learn by encouraging the students to
  learn by sharing their diverse experiences with each other and with the
  speakers. They listen to each other and define the issues in LA they want to
  address moving forward.


  New this year, LASA partnered with Pasadena's Partnership for Success and
  Polytechnic School to launch the Mt. Wilson Project that engages student
  interest in STEAM and culminates in a nighttime trip to view the universe
  through the 60" telescope. Further, LASA launched a summer research essay
  competition to sponsor and mentor two students pursuing research on Los
  Angeles after their LASA year.


  Our hope is that, over time, LASA will change the lives and career paths of
  hundreds of high school students in the region and will become an agent of
  change and community building throughout Los Angeles.

  In the last five years, LASA students have come from Altadena, Baldwin Hills,
  Bel Air, Beverly Hills, Boyle Heights, Century City, Cheviot Hills, City
  Terrace, Commerce, Culver City, Eagle Rock, East Los Angeles, Hancock Park,
  Hawthorne, Highland Park, Hyde Park, Inglewood, Koreatown, Lawndale, Lennox,
  MacArthur Park, Montebello, North Hollywood, Pacific Palisades, Pacoima,
  Panorama City, Pasadena, Pomona, Santa Monica, Sherman Oaks, Silver
  Lake,Tarzana, and Venice and LASA hopes to expand.

  Students return to their communities with the skills and knowledge to mobilize
  Angelenos across the county. They share their new tools as well as their hopes
  for creating LA's future.
project_five_years: >-
  LASA hope that in five years it will be welcoming a new class of high school
  juniors to engage with Los Angeles as it grows and changes. And LASA believes
  it will be introducing those students to LASA-graduates as experts whose work
  is transforming learning, connecting, and creating in LA.
