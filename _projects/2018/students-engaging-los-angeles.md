  LASA will make greater Los Angeles the best place to learn by providing an
  intensive introduction to the infrastructure and institutions of greater Los
  Angeles for high school juniors who have expressed an interest in public,
  civic, and civil service. As a supplement to their regular school year, LASA
  students learn from the very heart of the region's history and culture, and,
  in so doing, learn how best they can contribute to the region and our
  collective problem-solving obligations. LASA engages curiosity and the desire
  to create change in a diverse landscape of spaces from the Metropolitan Water
  District, the Port of Los Angeles, the business community, to the local arms
  of the judicial system.


  Participants gain the experience and knowledge necessary to better understand
  the intricacies — infrastructural, historical, political, economic, and
  otherwise — of the region in which they live, and build lasting bonds of
  friendship, camaraderie, and work experience with a diverse group of peers.


  LASA speakers - in the dozens - including Jeff Kightlinger of the Metropolitan
  Water District, Raphael Sonenshein of the Pat Brown Institute at California
  State University-Los Angeles, and Belinda Waltman of Whole Person Care Los
  Angeles - help the students create a foundation of knowledge to inform their
  visions for the future.


  LASA contributes to LA as a space to learn by encouraging the students to
  learn by sharing their diverse experiences with each other and with the
  speakers. They listen to each other and define the issues in LA they want to
  address moving forward.


  New this year, LASA partnered with Pasadena's Partnership for Success and
  Polytechnic School to launch the Mt. Wilson Project that engages student
  interest in STEAM and culminates in a nighttime trip to view the universe
  through the 60" telescope. Further, LASA launched a summer research essay
  competition to sponsor and mentor two students pursuing research on Los
  Angeles after their LASA year.


  Our hope is that, over time, LASA will change the lives and career paths of
  hundreds of high school students in the region and will become an agent of
  change and community building throughout Los Angeles.
