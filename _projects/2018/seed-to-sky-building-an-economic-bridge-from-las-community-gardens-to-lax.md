  bridge to bring dollars back into neighborhoods.

  Seed To Sky is L.A. Kitchen’s latest effort to challenge existing business
  models and create powerful bridges for change. L.A. Kitchen is excited to
  launch a coalition to stand side-by-side with other organizations doing
  powerful work in a collaborative network. This activation will lay a strong
  foundation to build an economic bridge - from LA to LAX - from Seed to Sky.
  This isn't about making LA a better city to live in - LA already has powerful
  assets! Instead, it's about strategically leveraging assets to collaboratively
  build a more resilient, just and connected food community. We are developing
  an urban food system, in which we put communities at the center.
   
   
   
   This project builds on L.A. Kitchen’s existing social enterprise, Strong Food, which employs graduates from our culinary job training, and takes on contracts to manufacture food products for other businesses and L.A. Kitchen’s own brand. Strong Food will be partnering with a premier concessionaire at LAX to produce L.A. Kitchen sandwiches, salads and parfaits, creating a complete menu that offers traveling Angelenos and global visitors healthier food alternatives. This contract will bring L.A. Kitchen closer to realizing the power of a nonprofit that is self-sustainable - relying on consistent, earned income rather than the fluctuations of philanthropic funding. 
   
   
   
   What’s most exciting is that this contract with LAX is already helping L.A. Kitchen create more jobs and fight recidivism, food waste, and hunger through its community meal distribution program. When given the opportunity to share the wealth, L.A. Kitchen wants to squeeze every ounce of community impact we can. Funding from LA2050 will allow us to use our LAX contract to purchase produce from community-led gardens that are offering entrepreneurship training and job opportunities for residents in their neighborhoods, starting in South Los Angeles.
   
   
   
   Together with coalition partners, RootDown LA (RootDown) and Our Foods, we are building the first food production site, featuring hydroponic and aquaponic technology, that will serve as a training ground and provide jobs for youth. L.A. Kitchen will purchase the produce to enhance its existing supply channels, creating an economic bridge from LA gardens to LAX. This activation will include an invitation to other garden programs in South LA: We welcome partners who share our goals - not only to nourish LA gardens, but also engage LA’s youth, teaching them about supply and demand, profit and loss, reinvestment and philanthropy, empowering the next generation of change agents in our neighborhoods. 
   
   
   
   We will realize the power of everyday commerce as fuel for philanthropy and revolutionize the way communities support each other, creating a more economically viable future for Angelenos. At every touch point across this economic bridge, from planting seeds to distributing salads, every dollar made will be reinvested back into our communities. Who knew, the impact of a grab and go at LAX?
