title: HOLIGENT RECONSTRUCT EDUCATION
project_summary: ''
Please describe the activation your organization seeks to launch.: >-
  We are participating in festivities such as the LA Times Festival of Books. We
  will promote the concept on college campuses to students and faculty.
Describe in greater detail how your activation will make LA the best place?: "Holigent Reconstruct Education\r\n\r\nWhat to do\r\nRecruit students and instructors to introduce discussions in and out of classrooms about Holigent Reconstruct Education. The proposed discussions are aimed to explore the \"Why do it\" challenge and progress to discussing Societal Reconstruction to achieve peaceful systemic sustainability.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate goal of this discussion series is that by 2050 courses in the subject of Holigent Reconstruct America to achieve social, economic and environmental justice, quality and systemic sustainability will be offered in schools across the nation. Our proposal is to plant the seed of this innovation in education in Los Angeles campuses. We offer a puzzle-game to help start the discussion and a book to facilitate the learning. For metrics, we will be counting the number of discussion groups and classes that take up the subject.\r\n\r\nWhy do it\r\nBecause techno-industrial capitalist consumerism on a nuclear armed planet will not last but is heading to its catastrophic end. Yet higher educational institutions are turning out high-end consumers, on an industrial scale, credentialed to fuel economic growth and work the levers and gears of capitalism — an unsustainable concept on our planet.\r\n\r\nHow to do it\r\nIn time, years of discussion and courses should lead to universities turning out credentialed systemic solutioneers. Sometime before 2050 higher educational institutions will hopefully come to the conclusion that societal reconstruction to secure universal quality of life and peaceful systemic sustainability must be demonstrated beyond the classroom. Accordingly, they will construct experimental/ teaching campuses to demonstrate cellular, self-directed, all green, live/learn/work, pedestrian communities with hybrid economies and social contracts to secure enduring peaceful resilience. We aim to plant the seed and nurture the proposed education and societal innovation for peaceful systemic sustainability take root and develop in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: Holigent is coined from holistic and emergent, a concept of self-organization following the lead of natural evolutionary self-organization — the essence of which is doing the essential most with the least of resources without waste. Embedding this concept into human affairs, starting with education, may be a significant step toward peaceful and equitable systemic sustainability in creating thriving and enduring communities. \r\n"
How will your activation engage Angelenos to make LA the best place: >-
  We will stage portable exhibits on high school  and college campuses across
  Los Angeles about Holigent Reconstruct Education. Encouraging students to
  demand classes that prepare them to become Systemic Sustainability
  Solutioneers rather than consumers fueling (unsustainable) capitalist
  consumerism that is killing our planet.  
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your activation.: >-
  Will count the number of classes offering the proposed hybrid educational and
  societal reconstruction programs.
Where do you hope this activation or your organization will be in five years?: >-
  In five years we expect that a number of campuses will have ongoing
  discussions and or classes offered preparing students to become Systemic
  Sustainability Solutioneers.
