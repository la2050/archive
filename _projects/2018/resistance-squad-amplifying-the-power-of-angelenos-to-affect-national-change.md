  As goes California, so goes the nation. In Los Angeles, we are uniquely
  positioned to improve the lives of millions of our neighbors while leading our
  state, changing a nation, and inspiring the world. But, there are no days off
  in a democracy. The Los Angeles LGBT Center’s Resistance Squad will connect
  people from across Los Angeles’ diverse communities, giving them a place to
  channel frustration into action. From fighting back direct policy and
  legislative attacks on our collective well-being to doing the long-term work
  needed to move us towards a more perfect union, this expansion of the Center’s
  mobilization and resistance squad will connect people in the fight to protect,
  ensure, and advance equality.
   
   
   
   Soon after the 2016 presidential election, we learned several things very quickly. Attacks on our community would be rooted in fear and bigotry at a level not seen in decades (and that our youngest LGBT generation has not experienced in their lifetimes). Attacks leveled against other vulnerable populations, including immigrants and people needing to access affordable health care, would also touch LGBT people who were part of those communities. There was an immediate need to band together in solidarity. People wanted, and needed, to DO something.
   
   
   
   The Resistance Squad was formed to mobilize Angelenos in response to attacks by the new Administration. Now with LA2050, we will recruit and train 200 more volunteers in grassroots organizing to carry out effective phone banking, letter writing, social media and web-based mobilization campaigns, as well as demonstrations. Activations are designed to yield immediate results — ranging from a constituent in another state agreeing to call their congressional representative to affecting the outcome of a bill or policy. 
   
   
   
   As an organization and community rooted in activism and a decades-long battle for equality, fighting for justice and winning is what our community knows how to do. In fact, it’s one of the things we do best. Our goal is to build on this experience and empower Angelenos to lead social and political activations in their communities, and by so doing, amplify our collective voice so that politicians take notice. 
   
   
   
   Those who have joined the Resistance Squad come away feeling empowered:
   
   
   
    “You hear all these terrible things on the news about our government and what they are allowing to happen and you can feel so powerless. It’s been really great coming here doing the phone banking and writing the letters and knowing that you’re actually making a positive impact on people’s lives and putting your money where your mouth is. Rolling up your sleeves and not just yelling at your Facebook friends.” - Laura Wu
   
   
   
    “There was just this need I felt to do something other than crying into the wind. It’s been a very easy way to get involved and to feel like you’re doing something that benefits other people. You don’t feel like everyone’s got good intentions but nothing is really getting done.”
