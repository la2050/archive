  Creators in Los Angeles have never struggled in being creative. However, it
  has become increasingly hard for creators to derive wealth out of their
  creative value.



   There are many barriers for creators to economically succeed, especially creators from underprivileged communities. These barriers include financial resources, experience, business resources, marketing apparatuses, connections, and the increasing challenge of oligopolies monopolizing every industry.



   Creators find it difficult to sell the things they create, because there are startup costs, and it takes infrastructure. Generally one needs to have a facility, which means high rents, and this does not favor well for small businesses or non high earners looking to economically move up. It is increasingly hard for these mom and pop shops to compete with big businesses as well.



   Natch wants to remove many of these barriers by making the business industry more accessible for creators. Supporting local businesses is currently hard for both shoppers and sellers. By creating our online marketplace we create a network of local businesses, where shoppers can more easily find and receive locally made products. So we make it easier for these creators to market their products. But we also make it easier and cheaper for them to deliver their products too. By handling the fulfillment and delivery, sellers do not need to rent out retail space, nor hire expensive drivers to transport their goods. They also do not need to worry about developing their own website and driving traffic. We simplify many of the difficulties behind creators starting their own business, and we make it cheaper.



   By enabling sellers to sell directly to consumers we also ensure that they receive the financial value from most of what they produce. By removing middle men when it comes to manufacturing, distribution, and retail, the creator can once again become an owner of what they produce.



   Natch believes that by empowering creators, and giving anybody in LA a chance to compete with bigger businesses, local spending will be channeled away from the hands of bigger corporations and directly into the hands of the people in the city.



   This engages LA in multiple ways. It helps spread wealth across the city. It helps empower diverse communities of creators to play a part in the everyday lives of all Angelinos. And it gives access to people around Los Angeles to the different things creators produce. We aim to improve the quality of life for Angelinos by giving them the opportunity to connect directly with other Angelinos through the food they create.
