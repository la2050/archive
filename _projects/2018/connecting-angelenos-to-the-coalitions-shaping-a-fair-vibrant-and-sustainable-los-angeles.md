  We have amazing coalitions working on some of our biggest problems but people
  don’t know about their work, don’t know how to get involved, and there is not
  an easy entry point to participating. Without a sense of a viable path toward
  solving our problems and creating solutions, it’s no wonder that voting rates
  are low and government isn’t as responsive to residents’ needs as it should
  be. LA is incredibly fragmented and at this key junction, is grappling with
  how to deal its increasingly post-suburban reality. We need an intentional
  effort to publicly and civilly debate these challenges and bridge these
  divides so Angelenos can enjoy affordable housing, transit connectivity,
  economic opportunity, and a healthy environment in a region that is
  increasingly resilient.
   
   
   
   LA Forward’s approach to increasing voting rates is not premised on the common concept of exhorting people to vote based on civic spirit or any kind of gimmicks. Our theory is that people will vote when they understand what’s at stake in the decisions made by LOCAL elected officials. When they comprehend the region’s big picture challenges and how those relate to their own interests and values, Angelenos will be far more motivated to participate. That’s the purpose of our popular and growing civic media, e.g. ballot guides, the LA Forwards & Backwards podcast, essays, collateral like civic trading cards, digital live steams of events—which aims to reach more than 100,00 Angelenos by 2020.
   
   
   
   Second, the path to deeper and enduring involvement requires a transition from the less active form of engagement with media and digital actions like petition-signing to participating in the interactive experiences of events, especially connecting with other people face-to-face. On its own, media can increase government responsiveness by letting officials know their actions are being tracked, but media’s greatest power can be as a funnel to draw people into hands-on work. That’s the purpose of our growing number of live actions—election parties, podcast events, classes, trainings, “take action” fairs, and neighborhood hangouts in places like parks, bars, cafes, & co-working spaces.
   
   
   
   Third, as community organizing experts like Marshall Ganz have shown, the only way to sustain mass involvement is by building organizations that enable individuals to take on increasing leadership responsibilities toward common purposes. We know that people are satisfied by participating in different ways and that the best way to be involved is with a group small enough that they can form meaningful relationships with each other. LA Forward is cultivating volunteer-led teams specific to various issues and methods of engagement. The main job of LA Forward’s staff and top leadership will be to act as organizers—coaching volunteers to step up into leadership roles, providing guidance, and facilitating connections and trainings as necessary.
