  Literary Riot is a radically inclusive film program and content studio. We
  represent the true diversity of our society through working with young voices
  from throughout Los Angeles and developing their on-camera and
  behind-the-camera talents. The first of its kind, Literary Riot is not only a
  vehicle for training young artists, but also for featuring and sharing their
  voices. It is based on the belief that young people’s ideas and solutions
  matter, and that new platforms are needed to amplify their responses at a
  particularly challenging and divisive time. Launched in 2017, this in-house
  incubator and full-service production company is a collective of artists ages
  13-23 who have trained as poets and filmmakers with Get Lit. 
   
   
   
   For many of our Literary Riot youth, their first exposure to the power of poetic expression comes through Get Lit’s In-School Program. Eligible and interested young poets continue on as Get Lit Players. Students who are interested in film join our "Pilot" Program, a free 16-week course in independent filmmaking in which they learn and implement everything from development to distribution. Graduates are offered a 6 month Literary Riot Fellowship that includes additional classes and on-set experience. Young artists then move into the Literary Riot Content Studio where they receive advanced training and professional opportunities. The original content that they create builds their resumes, pays them, and promotes marginalized youth voices. 
   
    
   
   Literary Riot fosters artistic and professional prospects for these storytellers through continuing education and industry work, as well as training in professional etiquette, business skills, and other tools. It creates a bridge to success between high school and adulthood that is so often lacking in educational institutions, and has a meaningful impact on employment in L.A.’s creative industries, particularly for women and young people of color. 
   
   
   
   In its first year, Literary Riot has developed 5 original web series garnering over 3 million views, and our students’ work has screened at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, The Grammy Museum, and more. Current offerings include original content, in-house productions, manifestos commissioned by companies and organizations, and brand consulting that implements young voices into corporate social impact campaigns. In addition to building L.A.’s profile nationally, many of our Literary Riot filmmakers have become civic activists and gotten involved locally with the Women’s March, March for our Lives, and Rock the Vote, among others. In March 2018, our students were thrust into the epicenter of the national media campaign being supported directly by their youth peers across the country organizing the March For Our Lives. Our students produced the most watched and shared pieces of media for that campaign garnering 4 million views in 10 days.
