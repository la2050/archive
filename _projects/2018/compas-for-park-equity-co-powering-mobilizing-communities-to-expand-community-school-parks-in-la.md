  In LA’s most densely populated and socioeconomically disadvantaged
  neighborhoods, children and their families do not have access to safe parks
  and plays spaces that are critical to leading healthy lives and building
  stronger communities.
   
   
   
   PFP focuses on tackling park inequity through our Community School Parks program (CSPs), which opens school playgrounds to the public on Saturdays and provides youth and adult enrichment programming in partnership with the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD).
   
   
   
   CSP-goers experience the benefits of increased park access and play spaces with improvements in overall health, physical fitness, obesity rates, nutrition, academics, crime, and social connectedness neighborhood-wide.
   
   
   
   In order to expand these kinds of positive results and bring about systems change that advances park equity, PFP will mobilize community members and activate Angelenos to help make LA the best place PLAY. We will do so in the following ways:
   
   
   
   1) Operate three CSPs in dense,under-resourced LA neighborhoods, giving thousands of residents easy access to vibrant parks
   
   2) Foster residents’ sense of ownership of CSPs through our community engagement program, COMPAS
   
   3) Mobilize COMPAS members to advocate for shared-use policies
   
   4) Educate and engage decision-makers to advance shared-use policies
   
    
   
   COMPAS is a field-based community-organizing program and a movement of parents and neighbors with two shared goals:
   
   1. Supporting recreation hubs that are safe, welcoming, and responsive to each neighborhood’s unique interests, and
   
   2. Opening Community School Parks at every school in LA
   
   
   
   Through COMPAS, parents, neighbors, and friends come together to build relationships, assess recreation needs, create action plans, build skills, volunteer, and receive recognition for CSP related contributions and innovations.
   
   
   
   To complement PFP’s in-person relationship-building work, COMPAS will use digital activism to bring together Angelenos from different neighborhoods so that they can build a strong, collective voice supporting CSP expansion. As community members learn about the benefits of CSPs, they will become advocates for play, and galvanize their communities to move decision-makers towards city-wide shared-use policies.
   
   
   
   With LA2050’s support, PFP’s COMPAS will:
   
   * Activate 300 hundred parents per school at existing CSPs to become parent volunteers and vocal supporters of CSPs and shared-use
   
   * Activate 5,000 neighbors per school at existing CSP sites to build awareness of CSPs and shared-use.
   
   * Activate parents to recruit and engage their community members through COMPAS, with a goal to register supporters at 20 schools (total potentially activated: 100,000)
   
   * Advocate for LAUSD to authorize low-cost or no-cost shared-use options so that communities across LA can access school playgrounds during non-school hours.
   
   
   
   Through COMPAS we will activate parents’ & neighbors’ civic power to advance shared-use policies that can improve parks equity in LA.
