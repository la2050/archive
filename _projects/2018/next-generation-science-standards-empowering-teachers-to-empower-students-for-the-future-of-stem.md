  Next Generation Science Standards: Empowering Teachers to Empower Students for
  the Future of STEM
project_summary: >-
  We empower teachers to prepare and inspire students for the future of STEM
  through dynamic training and mentoring on the state adopted, industry
  recognized Next Generation Science Standards.

  In 2013, the California Board of Education adopted the Next Generation Science
  Standards (NGSS) for K-12 public schools. Those standards were developed by 26
  lead states in collaboration with key stakeholders in science, science
  education, higher education, and industry, based upon the new Framework for
  K-12 Science Education developed by the National Academy of Sciences. NGSS
  emphasizes “three-dimensional learning”: disciplinary core ideas, crosscutting
  concepts, and science and engineering practices. NGSS aligns with Common Core
  State Standards to prepare students for college and careers. 
   
   
   
   NGSS adoption in California was critical. It had been 15 years since standards were revised, despite numerous advances in the field of science and the innovation driven economy. However, implementation has been uneven with limited teacher training. LA simply cannot be the best place to learn if our science teachers are not given the skills to prepare our students for the future of STEM. Students will not be prepared for college, careers and citizenship unless teachers set the right expectations and goals. Improved science standards will inspire students to pursue STEM in higher education and prepare them for the rigors of college, lifting our higher education completion rates and time to completion. In turn, employers can hire workers with strong science-based skills—including specific content areas but also skills such as critical thinking and inquiry-based problem solving.
   
   
   
   To address the urgent need for training, our activation is an NGSS training that includes a dynamic combination of classroom training, real-time feedback, and group collaboration. It will be rolled out to teachers in LAUSD-Local District South (includes San Pedro, Lomita, Gardena, South LA, South Central LA) and Compton USD. We will train two cohorts of 50 teachers (100 total) in two years. The program will be rolled out according to the following timeline each year:
   
   _Months 1-2:_ Teacher Selection - CISE will collaborate with superintendents and STEM coordinators to identify which schools will most benefit from training. Principals at selected schools will recommend 2-3 K-9 teachers.
   
   _Months 3-4:_ 3 Days of NGSS Classroom Training - Teachers will be trained on the conceptual and instructional shifts from the current standards. They will learn the 3 dimensions of NGSS, analyze lesson plans, and break down the new performance expectations. 
   
   _Months 5-6:_ Classroom Observations - 1) An NGSS expert and teacher will meet in advance to agree on the observation focus and review the lesson plan; 2) The NGSS expert will observe and document evidence of good teaching practices; 3) Formal feedback will be provided.
   
   _Months 7-10:_ Lesson Study Cycles - Teams of teacher trainees will engage in collaborative planning-teaching-observation of learning, followed by lesson evaluation and refinement.
   
   _Months 1-12:_ Training Evaluation and Revision - Will occur on an ongoing basis (details in #12).
