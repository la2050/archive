  Success is defined by the impact participating teachers have on student
  learning. This will be measured based upon 1) Participant Surveys:
  Participating teachers will complete a survey at the end of each training day
  and at the end of each lesson study cycle assessing training effectiveness; 2)
  Expert Observations & Evidence: NGSS training team members (experts) will
  participate in lesson study cycle as observers and will gather evidence based
  upon an instrument used for teacher observations by the district to evaluate
  performance; 3) Expert Review of Developed NGSS Lessons: Training team experts
  will review lesson plans developed by participating teachers for the lesson
  study cycles to assess quality based upon NGSS standards; 4) Consistent
  Attendance: Tracking attendance for all components of the training (in-person
  training, lesson study cycles, etc.).

Improved science standards will inspire students to pursue STEM in higher education and prepare them for the rigors of college, lifting our higher education completion rates and time to completion.

  Our activation focuses on schools in LAUSD-Local District South and Compton
  USD. These districts were selected because implementation has been limited and
  because the largest achievement gaps in science among student groups are
  defined by race and income. LAUSD enrollment is 90% students of color and 80%
  are socioeconomically disadvantaged. Compton USD enrolls almost 100% students
  of color and 87% are socioeconomically disadvantaged. 
   
   
   
   We will engage directly with teacher trainees, totaling 100 over 2 years. In turn, these teachers will engage their students as they become more effective and inspiring teachers. CISE will also give our teacher trainees strategies and tools to engage parents. Examples include at a minimum keeping parents informed about the shift to NGSS and at most enlisting parents to volunteer in and outside of the classroom to help with NGSS-based science projects.
   
   
   
   CISE will enlist the 50 trainees in our current pilot and the 100 additional trainees to become NGSS experts at their schools that mentor fellow teachers. NGSS experts will provide guidance to these 150 teachers as they help their fellow teachers learn the new standards.
   
   
   
   The 150 trainees we engage will represent 50 schools averaging 1,000 students. With those trainees engaging their fellow teachers on the new standards, 50,000 students will be touched directly or indirectly by our effort. With our push to keep all parents informed at a minimum, we will touch well over 100,000 Angelenos.
project_five_years: >-
  Our goal is to train a minimum of 3-5 teachers from each school within our
  service area who will serve as the NGSS experts at their schools and
  districts, offering their students a more engaging and inspiring STEM
  instructional experience. We expect our effort to translate into stronger
  results on the National Assessment of Education Progress in science, a
  narrowing of the achievement gap among student groups defined by
  race/ethnicity and family income, and more students enrolling and persisting
  in postsecondary STEM programs.

  study cycles to assess quality based upon NGSS standards; 4) Consistent
  Attendance: Tracking attendance for all components of the training (in-person
  training, lesson study cycles, etc.).
Where do you hope this activation or your organization will be in five years?: >-
  Our goal is to train a minimum of 3-5 teachers from each school within our
  service area who will serve as the NGSS experts at their schools and
  districts, offering their students a more engaging and inspiring STEM
