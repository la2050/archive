  The homelessness crisis in Los Angeles is profound. In every neighborhood and
  every community, from the beaches to Riverside 55,000 of our fellow citizens
  sleep on the streets of our city. And as the political tide turns for the
  right, less and less resources are being made available to them. Through our
  social media, website and monthly Sock Sesh’ Community Meetups, we engage
  people all across Los Angeles. Sock sessions inspire kids and families to get
  involved and connect with their community. From Venice Beach to Skid Row, We
  motivate young families to ‘give back’ and make our city spectacular.
  Inspiring Angelinos to work together for the greater good of the city and
  their struggling neighbors living on the streets. The experiences our
  volunteers, young & old, have had is something we want to expand. We’ve had
  kids out at 8am on Venice Beach, barely awake and partially upset they have to
  be up so early on the weekend and by the end of our sock session everyone is
  laughing, having a great time and interacting with our homeless population,
  because they often are the ones who get overlooked and sometimes feel
  invisible. Angelenos of all economic backgrounds need to work together to make
  our communities thrive and we hope with Stella’s Socks that we can be that
  bridge.
