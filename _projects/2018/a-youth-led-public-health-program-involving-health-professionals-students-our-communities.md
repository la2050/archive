  A Healthier Community Starts with YOUth (HCSY) will make LA the best place to
  live because, it directly address health disparities faced by residents of
  South Los Angeles. HCSY is a public health education and career pipeline
  program exposing youth to a culture of upstream preventative thinking. The
  program model provides an opportunity for students to receive mentorship and
  experience within the public health field as they build and conduct community
  health programming with professionals. Students and professionals will be
  collaborating on three programs focused on improving skills around nutrition,
  fitness and mindfulness. 
   
   Participants of these youth led programs are patients that have been identified by their primary care physician as having barriers to nutrition and fitness. These patients receive a written prescription from their physicians that we call park prescriptions. A patient participating in the park prescription program will partake in a 10-week program that provides personalized fitness instruction, nutrition education via grocery store tours and a gardening and mindfulness workshop. 
   
   Undergraduate students leading the workshops will receive mentorship and public health career exposure from graduate students as well as professionals in the field. Undergraduate students will in-turn mentor high school students and expose them to the paths of higher education. 
   
   The final phase of the program will include a train-the-trainer component for representatives of Community Based Organizations to conduct this programming in their own communities, spreading and sharing the effectiveness of this program to communities beyond.
