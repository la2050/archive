project_proposal_description: >-
  In partnership with key City departments, we will engage unengaged 18-34 year
  olds in LA’s process for planning affordable housing and as candidates for
  Neighborhood Councils. Capitalizing on their love of eating and sharing, we
  will involve them in the creation of “A Recipe for A Great City: Home
  Cooking.” This “cookbook,” to be available at local libraries, will highlight
  our diverse city and solutions generated by millennials at restaurant
  dialogues and neighborhood food and culture events.

  Our project will increase the participation of millennials in voicing their
  concerns and participating in the conversation around the future of their city
  through a creative process that first gets them involved in city planning
  around housing issues, and ultimately, participating in their local
  Neighborhood Councils. Entitled “A Recipe for A Great City: Home Cooking” the
  project uses the popularity of food, music, art and digital tools among this
  group as the foundation for engagement. 
   
    
   
   The strategies for increasing participation will include: 
   
   
   
   Utilize New Tools for Greater Civic Engagement -
   
   We will create a digital survey and a digital toolkit targeted at millennials specifically for use with this activation.
   
    
   
   Influence Individual Behavior - 
   
   We will entice millennials to become civically engaged by leveraging their passion for eating, art and digital sharing.
   
    
   
   Policy Advocacy/Digital Organizing for Activism - 
   
   A digital survey will specifically enable participants to weigh in on the issues of homelessness and housing in the city and how they would like to get involved in addressing the problem. A digital toolkit will support the organizing effort by supporting participants in leading their own engagements or “kitchen table” conversations.
   
    
   
   In-Person Engagements -
   
   Digital toolkit will serve as the basis for people to engage their friends in “kitchen table conversations” focused on homelessness and housing in local restaurants and other popular gathering places. In addition, food, art and music happenings called “Our Neighborhood Cooks” hosted in conjunction with Neighborhood Councils (NC) and popular local artists and performers serve as platforms to weigh in on the best ideas coming out of the digital survey. Our Neighborhood Cooks will include a cooking/eating competition for the recipe that best represents the neighborhood. People would vote on the recipe that includes migration stories and oral histories about the recipes. The selected recipes are incorporated into the final recipe book along with a road map on replicating the activation in other communities and cities.
   
    
   
   Increase Participation in Political Process and Impactful Volunteer Opportunities -
   
   The ultimate goal is to recruit this youthful segment into the Neighborhood Council movement and motivate them to run for board seats in the Neighborhood Council elections slated for 2019 and 2021. Their voices will then continue the dialogue with the city on issues that affect their lives and ensure the Neighborhood Council system reflects LA.

project_measure: >-
  This activation is successful if, through our partnerships, millennials
  participate in the following over the course of the next 2 years:
   
   
   
   -100,000 take a digital survey to weigh in about affordable housing and homelessness issues in LA and how they would like to get involved in addressing the problem
   
   
   
   -2000 participate in person in 4 Neighborhood Cooks events and 50 Kitchen Table Conversations citywide 
   
   
   
   -1000 are further activated to run in Neighborhood Council elections
   
   
   
   Other measures include:
   
   
   
   By 2019 - Creation of a digital toolkit for millennials to host their own Kitchen Table Conversations and play a role in Neighborhood Cooks events.
   
   
   
   By 2020 - Creation of the “A Recipe for a Great City: Home Cooking” cookbook guide and incorporation by city departments of innovative civic engagement techniques used in their ongoing public participation efforts.
   
   
   
   By 2021 - 100% of Neighborhood Councils have millennial representation because of the foundation created by the activation.
project_five_years: >-
  Following the conclusion of the grant, we will still have one more year of the
  initiative as the goal is to end with the 2021 Neighborhood Council elections
  at which time we will have a cumulative number of 1,000 millennials running
  for office over the 2 years and 100% of the 97 NCs with some millennial
  representation by November 2021. As a result of the investment in this
  project, in five years, there will be much more active participation by
  millennials in city decisions not only in the Neighborhood Council system, but
  in serving on city commission and boards and in running for higher office.
