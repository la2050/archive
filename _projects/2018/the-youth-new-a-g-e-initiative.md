  The city of Los Angeles sends over 3 million tons of waste to landfills or
  incinerators annually. Much of this waste could be recycled or composted if
  residents had sufficient access to disposal systems. Many Angelenos however
  lack access to recycling services in their apartments or workplaces.
  Low-income neighborhoods and communities of color are disproportionately
  affected by the unequal distribution of municipal services. Hindered access to
  responsible disposal systems can increase exposure to environmental hazards
  and health problems that emanate from poor air and water quality. Lack of
  access to environmental education is another contributing factor. Only 10% of
  the students enrolled in our youth program for example, recalled receiving
  environmental education in their schools. The environmental impacts for
  marginalized communities and gaps in environmental education are causes for
  significant concern. These concerns are addressed by Mar Vista Family Center’s
  (MVFC) Youth New A.G.E. Initiative. The Initiative aims to create a more
  sustainable and conscious relationship between Angelenos and the environment
  while introducing creative strategies for community fundraising. 
   
   
   
   MVFC youth want Los Angeles to be an environmental justice leader--that is, a zero waste city that protects its low-income residents from environmental health hazards through community-driven initiatives. The Youth New A.G.E Initiative coaches low-income youth on how to Abate waste, Generate revenue, and Educate communities about waste management in order to engender environmental sustainability, creative fundraising, and social responsibility. The Youth’s Recycling Campaign and “Green-Giving” strategy has encouraged local residents to donate their recycling to MVFC leading to the collection of thousands of plastic bottles and aluminum cans that our youth will cash in. The campaign has raised significant awareness about plastic pollution in the community. 
   
   
   
   Our activation will support LA2050’s efforts to decrease the acres and miles of polluted waterways. Plastic trash from consumer goods makes up the majority of what becomes marine debris which significantly affects the environment, wildlife, and human health. The Initiative’s focus on waste reduction, environmental education, and community fundraising encourages Angelenos to mobilize in favor of cleaner waterways. By educating Angelenos on the benefits of waste reduction and by linking this advocacy to Green Giving, or community fundraising campaigns, we believe that we can clean up the city, protect our waterways, and provide children the environmental quality and sustainability they need to lead healthy and environmentally conscious lives thus decreasing adverse childhood experiences. Our activation also creates and supports resilient communities. Our enterprising approach to the Initiative empowers ecologically fragile communities to reclaim their space and develop financially sustainable models in the process.
