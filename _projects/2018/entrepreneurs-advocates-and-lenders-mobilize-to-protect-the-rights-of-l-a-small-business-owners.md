  Entrepreneurship is vital to a thriving Los Angeles, but access to the capital
  necessary to start and grow a small business continues to be a serious
  problem. Research from Small Business Majority finds that 91% of small
  business owners identify this as a top area of concern. When small business
  owners are denied a traditional loan, many turn to high-cost alternative
  financing sources. Opportunity Fund research has found Los Angeles business
  owners face APRs of an average of 94%. These high-cost products can jeopardize
  businesses, homes, and families and leave a vacuum in communities should these
  businesses fail. This is particularly true for women and minority
  entrepreneurs, who are less likely to be approved for traditional loans than
  their white male counterparts.
   
   
   
   To address this issue, the RBLC formed in 2015 to support responsible practices in the small business lending sector. We have created the Small Business Borrowers’ Bill of Rights (the Rights)—a set of practices lenders and brokers adhere to when financing small business owners—and are now planning an intensive LA-focused campaign to activate Angelenos around responsible lending through education and policy advocacy. By creating momentum among the county’s small business and entrepreneurial community, we can push for stronger protections against predatory lending and better support those most affected by discriminatory and predatory lending practices, in particular, women and minority entrepreneurs working to start and grow their firms.
   
   
   
   In our education campaign, we will create and disseminate materials to ensure that entrepreneurs know the following: 1) their rights when searching for a loan, 2) which responsible lenders operate in their area, and 3) which questions to ask to ensure they find a responsible loan. We will compile an LA-specific online toolkit with this information and share it with our networks and with local business organizations for distribution to their networks. We also will conduct in-person educational events for local entrepreneurs. These events will be open to all, but we will focus our outreach on engaging women and minority entrepreneurs to better support their ability to protect themselves from predatory lenders.
   
   
   
   We also will create and advance a policy agenda informed by feedback from LA entrepreneurs. To advocate for stronger legal protections, we will collect stories from small business owners who have been trapped by predatory lenders, and we will share these stories widely. We will train small business spokespeople to speak with the media and send opinion pieces to local outlets. We will meet with local government leaders to elevate the issue, and we will connect our spokespeople with their elected representatives to ensure that policymakers understand the detrimental impact of predatory lending on local business. These activities will raise public awareness about this issue and push for reforms to current lax lending laws.
