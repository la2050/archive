  Root down! Rise up! will seek to establish a model for resilient community
  development at the neighborhood scale by improving community connections and
  awareness. We will document the tools and methodology that will be developed
  to increase civic engagement and provide resources and services to equip
  community members to remain in place and help shape the future of planning in
  their community. Through a strategic media advocacy campaign we will share
  this model throughout Los Angeles and beyond. 
   
   
   
   In addition to eliminating the loss of life due to car collisions, we believe that equitable and just improvements to the community must also ensure that there is no loss of lives due to state violence, or loss of residents in the neighborhood due to displacement. An intersectional approach to improving the quality of life of residents will provide:
   
   
   
   - A platform for local artists and community members, to help shape the local landscape to reflect their identity;
   
   - Opportunities for creating open space through open streets and cultural events in park deficient communities so that residents can connect with one another in an intentionally intergenerational and cross cultural spaces;
   
   - Pop-up examples of built environment improvements to get feedback and support from the community to improve biking, walking, and accessing public transportation in the area;
   
   - The ability for residents to build resilience by shaping their own narratives to better be able to influence decision makers through storytelling documented in portraits and curated audio; 
   
   - Protection against displacement, gentrification, and state violence by connecting residents with local resources and providing popular education to help inform them of their tenant and legal rights.
   
   
   
   There will be in-person engagement at various scales with large “Street Beats” events and “Rise and Shine” mini-events. Street Beats is a community-led, collaborative effort to bring safety improvements and engaging activities at the intersections of Slauson/Broadway and Slauson/Western. “Street Beats” events will feature creative designs on the streetscape that educate the public on the importance of street safety and our need to claim public spaces. “Rise and Shine” events will use popular education to teach the community about the inequities they are facing and increase knowledge and awareness of tenant and legal rights for community members of color. Additionally, we will use storytelling as a tool for building resilience; we believe that the documentation of community images and stories is one way to honor current and past residents and combat displacement by ensuring that histories are not erased. All of these activities and events will be able to connect cross-cultural and intergenerational volunteers (particularly youth and elder volunteers) from the neighborhood. These volunteers will help design the events, conduct outreach, coordinate activities, and be active participants in the events.
