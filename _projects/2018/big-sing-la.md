  Los Angeles Master Chorale will provide the opportunity for thousands of
  Angelenos to express themselves and connect with others through a free, shared
  singing experience at parks throughout Los Angeles. It is the Master Chorale’s
  goal to inspire people to tap into a gift each person is born with, namely,
  the ability to sing in a safe, fun, non-competitive environment. Through Big
  Sing LA, we are reclaiming our public parks as a place where artistry and
  creativity can flourish and play music alongside the soccer fields, picnic
  tables, and baseball diamonds. 
   
   
   
   Participants will have the opportunity to learn and rehearse the pre-selected choral repertoire in advance of the event through online educational tutorials featuring our Artistic Director Grant Gershon and the Master Chorale’s Swan Artist-in-Residence and Grammy Winner Eric Whitacre. A Grammy-winning composer and conductor, Whitacre is very well-known among choral music enthusiasts. However, we are considering engaging conductors that reflective of the diverse communities we want to serve at the various parks.
   
   A dedicated website will be created for Big Sing LA and provide a central location where participants can access the video tutorials, connect with each other, and share their experiences. It will contain all the information participants will need to know to get involved, such as which parks will serve as hubs for the Big Sing LA events and how to create gatherings of their own should they wish to. After the event, the website will serve as a conduit for participant surveys, and tracking and evaluating data to determine impacts. However, no prior knowledge or registration are required, and people can simply just show up and sing along with the crowds.
   
   
   
   Taking part in Big Sing LA is truly a multi-generational endeavor that will significantly reduce barriers to involvement in singing by inviting people from all walks of life to join in at a location that is more convenient than traveling to Grand Park in Downtown LA. Anyone who loves to sing or enjoys live music will connect on a deeper level by experiencing a powerful and transcendent moment that only through singing together as an ensemble provides. We will work with local neighborhood councils and local organizations to determine the park that is geographically the most accessible and therefore, we will create more access points for increasing inter-generational play opportunities and making parks more vibrant. This event will also create indelible memories linked to their experience with Big Sing LA at their park.
