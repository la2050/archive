title: LA Power Plant
project_summary: ''
Please describe the activation your organization seeks to launch.: >-
  We plan to activate Angelos - to take back, to give back their city to
  nature.  The natural landscape is what draws people to Los Angeles. Our idea
  is to organize 100,000 people or more to each purchase 1-5 or more plants and
  in a day of Power Planting, reclaim the city and its relationship to people
  and nature. Paint the town Green!
Describe in greater detail how your activation will make LA the best place?: >-
  We will activate people to come together, understand and join nature
  together.  A mass protest and awareness of the impact we have on the earth and
  how we can create and connect people- ourselves to nature in a tangible way.
  1-5 plants is a small individual investment that has an aggregate power.
How will your activation engage Angelenos to make LA the best place: >-
  Bringing people together.  We will use social media, advertising and
  crowdsourcing to gather 100,000+ people to come together. We will work with
  the city for sites to plant- and hopefully a guerrilla planting movement
  emerges.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your activation.: >-
  participation and awareness of the role plants play in our health and
  well-being
Where do you hope this activation or your organization will be in five years?: a yearly event across cities
