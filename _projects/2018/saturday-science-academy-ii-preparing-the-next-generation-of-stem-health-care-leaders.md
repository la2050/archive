  Saturday Science Academy II (SSA II) is a Next Generation Science
  Standards-based program conducted in four programmatic phases throughout the
  academic school year. These phases are Human Physiology and Anatomy, Physical
  Science and Engineering, Marine Biology and Plant Life. A 4-week summer
  mathematics program is offered to students to encourage reinforcement and
  retention of academic knowledge gained throughout the academic year. Students
  are provided with two hours of tutoring each Saturday to increase Proficiency
  in English and Language Arts and Math. 
   
   
   
   SSA II incorporates Next Generation Science Standards as its base educational framework and is open to students in pre-kindergarten through 12th grade. Similar programs for students typically engage students at the high school level. In preparation for leadership and representation in STEM and health care careers, SSA II enrolls students early in their academic career to encourage early interest and involvement in STEM, increase college matriculation rates, connect youth with volunteer, mentorship, research opportunities, and increase proficiency, at or above grade level, in English and Language Arts, Math, and science.
   
   
   
   The program strategy also includes a College Readiness component where high school students are offered SAT preparation, test tasking skills, a critical thinking course, college application completion assistance and monitoring, inclusive of college readiness activities designed to improve students' academic profile and increase college matriculation rates. The academic agenda evolves from the Charles Drew University Mission Statement, "To conduct education, research, and clinical services in the context of community engagement to train health professionals who promote wellness, provide care with excellence and compassion, and transform the health of underserved communities." Students are engaged in their school communities through community service collaborative partnerships with local school districts/schools, teachers and parents/caregivers.
   
   
   
   SSA II follows best practice program models and incorporates three unique features: Parent Involvement, community engagement, and pre-kindergarten through 12th grade student participation. Research demonstrates parent involvement as a critical component of student academic success. Parents are actively engaged through coordinated program support activities as a way to increase program retention and support of student activities. Teachers for this program are local college students who volunteer their time to give back to the community. Students in the program connect with college students, learn about their experiences, and are motivated as they engage with demographically representative teachers on a weekly basis.
