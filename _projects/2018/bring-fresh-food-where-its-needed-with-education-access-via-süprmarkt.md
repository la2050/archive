  More healthy Angelenos makes LA the best place to live because people
  empowered to eat well are in an excellent position to take charge of their
  lives and communities in other ways. 
   
   
   
   LA is already esteemed as a health capital, and our initiatives present a great opportunity to spread that culture to people from all ethnicities and socio-economic backgrounds.
   
   
   
   Living in a food desert means there are no incredible places to eat and this limits an area's ability to attract restaurant revenue and the dollars of residents.
   
   
   
   The CHC states, “when healthy food options are not available in a community, residents must travel to buy the foods they need. To reach their preferred store, five times as many residents of South LA (16 percent of shoppers) have to travel at least 20 minutes compared with residents of West LA (3 percent of shoppers)... often divesting the area of much needed tax revenue, economic development."
   
   
   
   SÜPRMARKT will:
   
   
   
   Increase the amount of people we serve via a physical location which also provides needed meeting space and free wi-fi to an area which lacks it. 
   
   
   
   Improve the diets of up to 20,000 community members by providing natural foods and goods at a subsidized rate 6 days a week. 
   
   
   
   Generate $500,000 to underwrite program costs. 
   
   
   
   Help 24 vegan manufacturers become established to serve their community long term Generate revenue necessary to underwrite costs of physical location, and social impact costs.
   
   
   
   Use events, programs, and print materials will create infrastructure for a better future in food. 
   
   
   
   Lead 20 workshops, dinners, and screenings which share great vegan food and skills with the community will provide the one-one one support individuals need to change their lives.
   
   
   
   Produce 100 recipes + videos will show customers how to use the food they get and cards in the boxes will help children and adults identify potentially unknown food they are receiving.
   
   
   
   Create consistent content and branding across web, print, and social media platforms, with a body of 25+ materials which will serve as a baseline for influence, education, and outreach. 
   
   
   
   Reach 700,000 video viewers and 40,000 event attendees with exponential impacts to close network, family and friends.
   
   
   
   Leverage staff stipends will increase our ability to support and engage our volunteers who are critical for our ability to serve our mission and for growth.
   
   
   
   Forge vital partnerships with local and national business, schools, and churches the create a widely spread messaging campaign which inspires Angelenos to eat well.
