  Los Angeles is the largest center for manufacturing in the country, with half
  a million jobs—that’s nearly four times as many jobs as film and
  television—yet most Angelenos don’t fully appreciate its importance to our
  economy. More important than jobs, manufacturing is a critical piece of
  innovation infrastructure that, if activated, could better unleash Los
  Angeles’ creative potential. 
   
   
   
   Maker walk engages thought leaders and the creative public for a unique look behind manufacturing in the city. Our pilot run attracted more than 500 participants. They checked in for this free event at the Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator and received a map for a self-guided walking tour of the Arts District neighborhood. Participants enjoyed visits to a dozen different factories and businesses, including Hyperloop, Angel City Brewery, La La Land Production and Design, HIVE lighting, the LADWP substation, the Advanced Prototyping Center, Blue Bottle, Greenbar Distillery, and Oblong Industries. It ended with an after party, featuring mini maker workshops and locally crafted cocktails at locally made shoe brand, COMUNITY.

   Our attendees were impressed and surprised by the diversity of industries that are manufacturing in LA and they asked us for more. To build on Maker Walk’s success and expand its impact, we want to engage new neighborhoods and manufacturers and become a monthly event. We have yet to finalize the neighborhoods, but we have begun to scout venues in El Segundo, Pasadena, Vernon, in DTLA, and Long Beach.
   
   
   
   We have partnered with Artisanal LA and the LA Food Fest to bring a pop-up market aspect to enhance the event. The markets will raise awareness of consumers and inspire them to purchase locally made goods. 
   
   
   
   Because the tours are so visual, we expect many attendees to share on social media and we will add playful encouragements for sharing like photo stations. We will highlight many of the makers and manufacturers on social media and on our website to drive traffic and awareness. We will also implement an extensive PR campaign to attract media coverage.
   
   
   
   We anticipate repeating our Arts District Maker Walk in October 2018, and ramping up to a total of 18 events in the grant period. We expect to grow by 10% each month and attract more than 2,500 attendees per event by the second year, for a total of 25,000 attendees to date.
