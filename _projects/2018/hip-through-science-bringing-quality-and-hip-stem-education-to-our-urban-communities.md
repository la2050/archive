  HIP Through Science will make LA the best place to learn by bringing
  relatable, fun, science programs to youth in Watts, Compton, and South Los
  Angeles. Partnerships with local parks, housing projects, and auxiliary school
  programs allows the lab to travel to where the students are. Tapping into a
  network of local tech companies, entrepreneurs, engineers allows HIP Through
  Science to bring culturally relevant curriculum and connections to youth who
  would otherwise not have these opportunities. Youth in the HIP Through Science
  program are able to participate in year-round learning courses that expose
  them to [CA education standard] based projects. The lab increases exposure to
  STEM careers, provides one-on-one learning opportunities, and inspires the
  next generation of STEM leaders to grow in their local communities. The
  program provides an opportunity for local youth to start STEM learning in
  Kindergarten and stay with the program through high school at no cost and no
  travel obligation. Activities like the HIP Through Science, bowling
  fundraisers, the Annual HIP Through Science Fair, and Our Annual Galas are
  additional opportunities for community members, youth, to participate in the
  development of the HIP Through Science Program. HIP Through Science Kids
  interact with honor students, local leaders, and their peers outside of an
  academic setting. By doing these action items we are immersing students in
  Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math content. We are encouraging
  matriculation in to college and we are also hoping to improve proficiency in
  English and Language Arts and Math.
