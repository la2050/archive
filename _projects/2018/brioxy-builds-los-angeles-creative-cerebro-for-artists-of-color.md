  Brioxy will help make Los Angles the best place to create by supporting a
  generation of innovators of color to build creative spaces that drive
  community.
   
   
   
   We know that we are on the precipice of incredible change in this country. LA is leading the nation’s demographic shift as people of color become the majority of our nation. Yet as our community becomes increasingly diverse, leadership in the social entrepreneurship and nonprofit sectors have struggled to reflect that diversity. 
   
   
   
   Creative innovators drive transformative change in our communities. We believe by investing in artists and creatives of color we can help them to stay imbedded within their communities, combatting displacement, and giving communities the tools to create jobs, provide leadership and generate community wealth. 
   
   
   
   By cementing a commitment to LA’s Diverse creative scene we will not only ensure that LA remains the creative hub of California but we will do so in a way that all Angelenos see themselves reflected in our creative core. Our arts and culture sector cannot thrive if it is not equitable. 
   
   
   
   Our Cerebro Pipeline Program trains social entrepreneurs of color to build and scale solutions that increase opportunity and equity. Highly interactive, these programs give Angelenos space to practice what they are learning, build a powerful network and access critical skill building. Sessions on topics like leadership, management, governance, strategic planning, fundraising, financial management, marketing, grant writing, evaluation and more. With your vote we can help position Los Angeles to be an epicenter of creative activation for innovators of color. We see the creative industries as a core focus to building “possibility models” for our neighborhoods and communities. 
   
   
   
   These bootcamps are 4-day immersives that deliver the core tools and skills needed to run a nonprofit or startup business. Our Cerebro Pipeline centers wellness and self care—balancing that with hard skills like fundraising and financial management. We invite thought leaders and successful innovators to join each cohort for talks, meals and community as these local creatives map out how to grow their leadership and take LA’s creative industry to the next level.
