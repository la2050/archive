  During the summer months, students not enrolled in an academically enriching
  summer program can lose up to 80% of the knowledge from the previous school
  year. This phenomenon, known as the summer slide, is more likely in
  underserved community and further perpetuates academic and social gaps across
  the country. All-In provides a six -week program to prevent the summer slide.
  With a core group of teachers dedicated to the individual success of each
  student, All-In has successfully helped 100% of our students master a language
  and math skill that they were struggling with before camp. We plan to do that
  and more with this activation! There are currently 63,000 youth in Los Angeles
  that can be classified as homeless. During the summer months there are very
  few programs that offer support, even fewer that are free. Summer engagement
  is directly related to high school reading levels, school year attendance, and
  school year academic success. Being able to have a consistent measure of
  student progress (Using School on Wheels data from the school year), we will
  be able to track the success of students who have the support of All-In and
  SOW!
