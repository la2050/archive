  Global Green’s CRC is aiming to foster a shift in behavior towards the
  minimization of waste by repairing and reusing items that would otherwise go
  to landfill. This program will activate residents in educational, creative
  reuse workshops and create stronger, more connected, and resilient
  communities. In cooperation with local businesses, such as breweries and
  repair shops, as well as local artists and eco-gurus, Global Green will host
  6-8 free, hands-on workshops on the art of upcycling and conserving household
  items by offering repair and repurposing strategies for commonly discarded
  items such as textiles, electronics, and bicycles. We aim to educate up to 240
  Angelenos in these workshops to empower them to “upcycle”, creating a cycle of
  reusing and repairing items that would otherwise go to landfill. During the
  workshops, residents will learn how to transform their unwanted, worn out, or
  damaged items into “new” or improved materials, creating a space for creative
  reuse and waste prevention in the City of LA. Each workshop will focus on a
  specific need (i.e. textile mending) based on pre-surveys provided by Global
  Green to participants, and will include the tools and resources required for
  residents to reinvent ‘wasted’ items to create greener, more resilient
  communities. In addition to providing its own expertise for these workshops,
  Global Green will invite local, relevant experts to lead each workshop and
  provide one-on-one assistance to attendees.
   
    
   
   The CRC workshops will create more resilient communities by giving residents the ability to become more self-sufficient, resource-efficient, and cost-effective as they are enabled to utilize available resources to their fullest potential. Workshops will also give participants the opportunity to connect and engage with other community members, creating stronger communities that will be more resilient in the face of external issues. The goal is for residents to utilize the skills gained from the workshops in order to persistently upcycle and repair their commonly discarded items after the program; thus continuing to reuse the City’s existing resources and enforcing resilience within their communities. Residents will also be able to use the skills acquired in these workshops, combined with follow-up digital tutorial videos and blogs created by Global Green, to engage in peer-to-peer education with their family, friends, and neighbors, engaging the broader community in the activation and enabling more Angelenos to contribute to and benefit from a more sustainable LA. To this end, the long-term outcomes of increased reuse and repair of commonly worn out, broken, and discarded items in the City of LA will include increased waste prevention and diversion, reduced environmental health hazards, reduced stress on landfills, reduced costs for residents, and more, enabling residents to benefit from a more sustainable environment and making LA the best place to live.
