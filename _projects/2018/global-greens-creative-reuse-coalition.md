title: 'Global Green’s Creative Reuse Coalition '
project_summary: >-
  Through community upcycling workshops and digital tutorials, Angelenos will
  learn how to creatively reuse, repair, and repurpose their damaged or worn out
  items, making LA the best place to live!
Please describe the activation your organization seeks to launch.: >-
  Global Green’s Creative Reuse Coalition (CRC) will activate Angelenos in
  educational, creative reuse workshops. In cooperation with local businesses,
  artists, and eco-gurus, we will host 6-8 free, hands-on workshops on the art
  of upcycling by offering repair and repurposing strategies for commonly wasted
  items such as textiles and electronics. We hope to foster a behavior shift
  towards the minimization of waste by repairing and reusing items that would
  otherwise be landfilled. 
Describe in greater detail how your activation will make LA the best place?: "Global Green’s CRC is aiming to foster a shift in behavior towards the minimization of waste by repairing and reusing items that would otherwise go to landfill. This program will activate residents in educational, creative reuse workshops and create stronger, more connected, and resilient communities. In cooperation with local businesses, such as breweries and repair shops, as well as local artists and eco-gurus, Global Green will host 6-8 free, hands-on workshops on the art of upcycling and conserving household items by offering repair and repurposing strategies for commonly discarded items such as textiles, electronics, and bicycles. We aim to educate up to 240 Angelenos in these workshops to empower them to “upcycle”, creating a cycle of reusing and repairing items that would otherwise go to landfill. During the workshops, residents will learn how to transform their unwanted, worn out, or damaged items into “new” or improved materials, creating a space for creative reuse and waste prevention in the City of LA.  Each workshop will focus on a specific need (i.e. textile mending) based on pre-surveys provided by Global Green to participants, and will include the tools and resources required for residents to reinvent ‘wasted’ items to create greener, more resilient communities. In addition to providing its own expertise for these workshops, Global Green will invite local, relevant experts to lead each workshop and provide one-on-one assistance to attendees.\r\n \r\nThe CRC workshops will create more resilient communities by giving residents the ability to become more self-sufficient, resource-efficient, and cost-effective as they are enabled to utilize available resources to their fullest potential. Workshops will also give participants the opportunity to connect and engage with other community members, creating stronger communities that will be more resilient in the face of external issues. The goal is for residents to utilize the skills gained from the workshops in order to persistently upcycle and repair their commonly discarded items after the program; thus continuing to reuse the City’s existing resources and enforcing resilience within their communities. Residents will also be able to use the skills acquired in these workshops, combined with follow-up digital tutorial videos and blogs created by Global Green, to engage in peer-to-peer education with their family, friends, and neighbors, engaging the broader community in the activation and enabling more Angelenos to contribute to and benefit from a more sustainable LA. To this end, the long-term outcomes of increased reuse and repair of commonly worn out, broken, and discarded items in the City of LA will include increased waste prevention and diversion, reduced environmental health hazards, reduced stress on landfills, reduced costs for residents, and more, enabling residents to benefit from a more sustainable environment and making LA the best place to live.\r\n"
How will your activation engage Angelenos to make LA the best place: >-
  Creative Reuse Coalition workshops will be open to the public and will take
  place in 6-8 different locations across LA to attract a variety of
  participants. Workshop locations will be chosen based on the following
  criteria to ensure accessibility and diversity: 1) proximity to public
  transit; 2) location in or near highly frequented centers; 3) location near
  diverse communities to ensure participants of various backgrounds and
  financial means. The activation will engage up to 240 Los Angeles residents
  through free public workshops featuring local artists, artisans, technicians,
  chefs, celebrities, social influencers, makers, menders, etc. The workshops
  will give attendees a hands-on experience and the skills/knowledge that they
  need to repair items in their everyday lives. In addition, Global Green will
  engage community members after the workshop by developing and posting video
  guides and blogs following each workshop to educate those who could not attend
  workshops and to further educate/increase skill levels for participants. The
  ease of accessing and sharing these free videos and guides will increase
  program accessibility for all and provide an opportunity to engage more
  Angelenos. Based on current levels of viewership on Global Green’s Youtube
  channel, we anticipate 1200-1600 people will watch these videos. Post-workshop
  surveys will be administered, so that participants can provide feedback to
  ensure that we are progressing towards making LA the best place to live.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your activation.: "Outputs\r\n1) 1 press release drafted/published to raise awareness \r\n2) 6-8 workshops hosted\r\n3) 90-240 Angelenos attended workshops (15-30 attendees per workshop)\r\n4) 6-8 local artists, fixers, chefs, etc. acted as mentors\r\n5) 90-240 follow-up surveys administered with the following feedback: 80% of attendees thought the workshop was useful; 60% of people used their skills or would; 60% of people feel that they reduced their waste from attending the workshop\r\n6) 6-8 videos, guides, and blogs produced to educate other Angelenos about how to upcycle their broken or old materials and provide follow-up assistance for participants\r\n\r\nOutcomes\r\n1) Participants engage in peer-to-peer education on skills gained through workshop training; an estimated 225 - 600 people reached based on average of 2.5 people per household in California\r\n2) 1200-1600 views of the workshop videos, reaching individuals who did not attend the workshop and individuals who did attend but would like a reminder of what they learned\r\n3) Decrease in commonly discarded items and food waste in the landfill in LA\r\n4) Increased awareness about strategies for reusing broken or worn-out items among residents\r\n5) Metrics collected for lbs diverted from landfill (items repaired/ repurposed)\r\n6) More resilient communities in LA because of increased number of opportunities for individuals to engage with one another, be self-sufficient, and keep valuable resources out of the landfill\r\n"
Where do you hope this activation or your organization will be in five years?: >-
  Global Green’s Creative Reuse Coalition is aiming to foster a shift in
  behavior towards the minimization of waste by activating communities with the
  skills and knowledge to repair, repurpose, and reuse items that would
  otherwise go to landfill. Therefore, in five years, we hope that our workshops
  inspire Angelenos in every neighborhood to repair and reuse their broken, worn
  out, or damaged belongings rather than throwing them out, and to share those
  lessons with others, making reuse the first instinct before disposal. We hope
  that our model workshops may inspire regular repair cafes in a variety of
  areas around the city, as well as increase the frequency of events, focus,
  education, and policies on repair and reuse strategies for waste prevention.
  In time, we hope that with more interest and enthusiasm for reusing and
  repairing old items, the City of LA will be a model city for waste diversion,
  with the incorporation of strategies encouraging repair and reuse as key
  approaches to meet diversion goals in its updates to the City’s Sustainability
  Plan.
