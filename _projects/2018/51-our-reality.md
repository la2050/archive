  51%: Our Reality will explore the diverse perspectives, experiences and trials
  of women in LA through three virtual reality narratives, allowing participants
  to “walk” in different women’s shoes. Our goal is to showcase the true, the
  challenging, the positive, the subtle & hidden—stories from which men, women,
  boys girls and those who are gender-fluid can learn. Our strategies for
  implementation will target key LA2050 metrics, including providing emotional
  support, expanding access to cultural events and increasing local social media
  connections. 
   
   
   
   Here’s how:
   
   
   
   1) We will activate our Advisory Council, a group of local experts in gender, LGBTQ and race-related issues, to help us responsibly curate a variety of real experiences in our VR narratives. We will conduct a cross-sectional survey to collect data on the current social and emotional needs of women in LA across all demographics, and use these stories to impact our content. 
   
   
   
   2) The National Endowment for the Arts has cited location as a major barrier to arts attendance. (When Going Gets Tough: Barriers and Motivations Affecting Arts Attendance) The 51% exhibit will capitalize on VR’s transportability, hosting traveling exhibits throughout the LA metropolitan area in order to provide more communities with access to cultural events—particularly focusing on transportation-deserts and low-mobility populations such as retirement homes. The exhibit will also be free to all and a shortened experience will be available online.
   
   
   
   3) Guests at the exhibit can share their experiences via social media, using the hashtag #51percentLA, which will be collated on a dedicated website for the exhibit. Additionally, citizens can visit the website and add their own experiences, photos, stories and strategies to make LA a better place for all women. All of these submissions will be collated into a time capsule for future Angelenos to explore LA’s current gender climate. Through this we will connect our city’s future and present.
