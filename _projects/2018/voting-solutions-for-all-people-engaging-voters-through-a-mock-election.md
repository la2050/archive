  The County’s current voting system has served the voters of Los Angeles County
  with accuracy and integrity since 1968, the design of the systems and the age
  of their technology do not offer the technical and functional elasticity
  necessary to continue to accommodate our growing and increasingly diverse
  electorate. Additionally, the existing voting systems market is limited and
  inadequate to meet the needs of our region. We are overdue for solutions that
  are transparent, publicly owned and that ensure the security and integrity of
  our elections. In 2020, the Los Angeles County will introduce a new voting
  experience that will address many of these concerns. To prepare Angelenos for
  this change, we will conduct a mock election in September 2019 at 50-100
  locations throughout the County. 
   
   
   
    
   
   
   
   By providing Angelenos the opportunity to become civically engaged through this mock election, the Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk (RR/CC) will get voters excited to try a new and improved voting model that addresses their needs. We also hope that this activation will increase the rates of voting in Los Angeles County. This new voting model, and the mock election, will support LA2050’s goal to make “Los Angeles the most civically engaged region in the U.S. During the Presidential Primary Election in 2016, only roughly 42% of registered voters cast a ballot. For the Presidential General Election on November 2016, 69% of Los Angeles County voters turned out to vote. LA County sees much lower turnout rates for off-cycle election. As is the case of the CA 34th District Representative election; turnout for the Primary Election in April, 2017 as well as the General Election in June, 2017 was just 14% of registered voters. With the mock election, we hope to activate Angelenos to vote in all elections, not just Presidential Elections. We also want to increase the number of registered voters, and make voting easier and more accessible to those voters. This mock election will provide eligible voters who are not yet registered the opportunity to register on-site the day of the mock election. 
   
   
   
    
   
   
   
   The mock election will serve as a way for the RR/CC to gather feedback from voters about their thoughts on the new modernized voting system. This will ensure that the RR/CC, a government entity, is responsive to the needs of LA residents when it comes to exercising their right to vote. An increased responsiveness to the voting needs of Angelenos will in turn make Los Angeles a hub for innovation, policy changes, and government transparency. 
   
   
   
    
   
   
   
   Like the efforts of LA2050 to “#PartyatthePolls,” the mock election is a county wide event that is all about voter engagement, activation, and education. At the various mock election sites, the RR/CC will ensure that the changes to the voting experience and the new voting system are perceived as fun and exciting.
