title: 'LOLA: Demystifying local politics for young, busy residents in LA'
project_summary: >-
  LA politics is dry, boring, and confusing AF, but it doesn’t have to be. LOLA
  empowers young residents by explaining local issues and elections in a
  concise, nonpartisan way.

  Would the average Los Angeles resident be able to explain the role of an LA
  superior court judge or county assessor? Unfortunately, the answer is probably
  not. It’s not surprising that civic participation and voter turnout is low.
  Local politics is designed for insiders. LOLA’s mission is to change that. 
   
   
   
   LOLA is a website where young, busy Los Angelenos can quickly and easily learn how their city works. In a midterm election year, we’ll demystify everything from LA city councils to ballot initiatives. So if residents are voting on who should be the next county assessor, LOLA will explain what they do and why they matter. LOLA is the first step for residents to engage in local politics. As they become more familiar with local issues, we’ll have a moderated community forum for people to discuss ideas, candidates, and propositions. We want to replace comment sections with conversations. We believe this is how we start to build momentum for connecting Los Angelenos and empowering them to contribute to civic life.
   
   
   
   Beyond local election coverage, LOLA will have ways for residents to discover people and organizations tackling important issues like homelessness, housing, and public transit. There are hundreds of incredible local initiatives seeking support and volunteers. LOLA will be the place where people can learn about their work and sign up to help. We believe collaborations create communities. Similar to our local political information, we’ll apply human-centered design to design a place that makes it easy for people to trust, discover, and get involved in local projects.
