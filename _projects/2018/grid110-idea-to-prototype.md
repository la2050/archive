title: 'Grid110: Idea to Prototype'
project_summary: >-
  Grid110 aims to educate 100,000 entrepreneurs in Los Angeles through free
  digital curriculum. We plan to adapt our in-person Idea to Prototype
  curriculum so that it can be delivered widely online.
Please describe the activation your organization seeks to launch.: >-
  Grid110 provides support for early stage entrepreneurs through cohort based,
  accelerator style programs. This is currently limited to an application
  process due to physical bandwidth and resources. We aim to repurpose the
  curriculum we've developed in our Idea to Prototype program so that it can be
  delivered online and widely, possibly through video or chat bot experience.
  The goal is to provide the tools, framework, and structure to expand an idea
  and to acquire the validation you need.
Describe in greater detail how your activation will make LA the best place?: "Grid110 will make LA the best place to CREATE  by growing new companies through community. \r\n\r\nWe’re building a community of entrepreneurs, doers, movers shakers, and business makers, and we’re currently stimulating the economy in Downtown LA by supporting the growth of startup companies, and ultimately creating jobs. \r\n\r\nGrid110 supports early stage businesses and innovative companies by providing a free workspace, mentoring and access to resources. It’s our aim that startups participating in our program will be able to scale with a stable trajectory, thus stimulating economic development in LA. \r\n\r\nNow in our 4th year of programming, we have shown a track record for supporting early stage entrepreneurs through critical challenges, who have gone on to create jobs, lease office space and scale their businesses. Creating jobs and keeping talent in LA is a hugely important byproduct of our programing, and major part of why we’re doing what we’re doing.\r\n\r\nWe want to take our 4 years of learnings and utilize existing platforms that can enable us to adapt and deliver our curriculum to anyone, anywhere. We want to specifically focus marketing to underrepresented minority communities and social enterprises to provide access to education, tools and resources"
