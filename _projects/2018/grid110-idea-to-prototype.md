  Grid110 will make LA the best place to CREATE by growing new companies through
  community. 
   
   
   
   We’re building a community of entrepreneurs, doers, movers shakers, and business makers, and we’re currently stimulating the economy in Downtown LA by supporting the growth of startup companies, and ultimately creating jobs. 
   
   
   
   Grid110 supports early stage businesses and innovative companies by providing a free workspace, mentoring and access to resources. It’s our aim that startups participating in our program will be able to scale with a stable trajectory, thus stimulating economic development in LA. 
   
   
   
   Now in our 4th year of programming, we have shown a track record for supporting early stage entrepreneurs through critical challenges, who have gone on to create jobs, lease office space and scale their businesses. Creating jobs and keeping talent in LA is a hugely important byproduct of our programing, and major part of why we’re doing what we’re doing.
   
   
   
   We want to take our 4 years of learnings and utilize existing platforms that can enable us to adapt and deliver our curriculum to anyone, anywhere. We want to specifically focus marketing to underrepresented minority communities and social enterprises to provide access to education, tools and resources
