  We aim to strengthen the social fabric of LA by connecting Angelenos to their
  vibrant and diverse ecosystems. We’re challenging the people of Los Angeles to
  experience the world as a holistic, interdependent living exchange of energy
  that exist through people and the soil we live on . Compost is the process of
  returning nature’s materials to the earth through decomposition, turning what
  was once discarded into a valuable resource.

   LA Compost hubs are spaces where kitchen scraps are turned into the ammendment needed for healthy soils. All hubs exist in partnerships with incredible organizations to support their thriving communities - from Monrovia to Elysian Valley, DTLA, to Venice. These compost hubs are established in shared spaces-places where we coexist. The hubs create a space for people to connect to the natural world existing within our urban landscape. Angelenos will have the opportunity to participate in various ways: learning food waste awareness and methods of composting, correctly sorting household food scraps, “deposit” food scraps at their community hub, join a workshop to learn about soil health, turn a compost pile at an urban farm, learn about vermicompost, interact intergenerationally, and create social connections to support healthy neighborhoods. We see these shared spaces as a bridge to connect individuals to their surrounding community. We live in a society full of disconnection, within communities there is isolation, between age groups it difficult for people to relate. This issue of disconnection has contributed to the increasing rates of mental suffering, lack of social support, lack of intergenerational activities, low rates of volunteerism, and less time spent interacting with the vibrant natural world and all of its wonders. Each of the LA Compost hubs is a space to reconnect, a platform to begin building these social bridges for us to nourish our environments. It is a space to share, volunteer, and engage in our civil society, broadening our horizons to meet outside of a coffee shop or board room, or our computer screens.

   There are significant environmental benefits to both reducing food waste and using finished compost- ultimately completing the story of food from farm to table to compost and back to the soil. The environmental benefits of compost include increased water retention, reduce erosion, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and increase nutritional value of food. These environmental benefits help stabilize and protect our changing climate, making LA more resilient. Our goal is to strengthen the social fabric of LA by amplifying shared spaces for connections, with each other, our food system and the vibrant ecosystems of LA- while diverting food waste from landfill, generating healthy compost to nourish LA’s landscapes, protecting LA from drought and erosion, and celebrating diversity within soil and people.
