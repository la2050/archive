  Here in LA, 460,000 women will experience severe domestic violence in their
  lifetimes. The current domestic violence movement focuses on emergency
  services, but not on the long-term financial security needed to ensure
  permanent safety of survivors and their families. FreeFrom is changing this
  paradigm. Through our compensation, credit repair and small business
  entrepreneurship programs, we work with survivors to create the financial
  security needed to rebuild their lives free from abuse. 
   
   
   
   Financial insecurity is the number one reason survivors stay in and/or return to abusive relationships. Survivors who leave often do so without the financial means to rebuild their lives (e.g., securing housing, childcare, transportation, etc.), making domestic violence the leading cause of homelessness among women and children nationwide. The 2017 Point in Time Homeless Count found that 50% of homeless women in LA have experienced domestic violence, and the number of homeless individuals with histories of domestic abuse has more than doubled since 2016. If we are to end domestic violence in LA, we must help survivors rebuild financially. Only then can we achieve long-term change.
   
   
   
   In 2017, FreeFrom piloted our Small Business and Financial Repair program through partnerships with more than a dozen domestic violence organizations in Los Angeles as well as the Mayor’s Fund for Los Angeles and the Housing and Community Investment Department of Los Angeles. 
   
   
   
   Through this pilot, we worked with 24 survivors to launch their own small businesses. Of those businesses, 100% yielded a profit within their first month of sales. Ten months later, not one of our clients has returned to the abuse. Instead, they are securing safe housing, building their credit, investing in healing services for themselves and their children and saving for their futures. Ventures started by our clients include seamstress services, catering, jewelry design, cleaning services, hair styling, and handcrafted bath and body products, among others. 
   
   
   
   Tailored to the unique needs of survivors, our services cover the following topics: protecting, repairing and building credit; entrepreneurship as a source of income; business planning; finance and accounting; sales and marketing training; logo design and branding; mentorship; counseling; childcare and self-care; confidence-building and access to seed funding. 
   
   
   
   With the support of LA2050, FreeFrom wants to expand our program to serve survivors in every domestic violence shelter in LA County and build a city in which shelters are not the only solution but rather a stepping stone to safe lives centered around abundance, community and healing. This the Los Angeles we could be. This is a Los Angeles that everyone can live in.
