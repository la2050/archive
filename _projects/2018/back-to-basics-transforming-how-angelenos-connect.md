  Eayikes builds bridges within, and between, people - connecting participants
  more deeply with themselves and creating moments of empathy-building with each
  other. Whether it’s a field trip, community service project, workshop, weekend
  camp, or social event, what we create is an uninhibited space. It’s within
  this environment of wonder we begin the work of building belief in self and
  the road to empowerment. The next layer is utilizing the powerful diversity
  within our city, the richness of the human experience, and bringing
  participants from all walks of life together.
   
   Our current community of youth and adults is far-reaching. Eayikes programs serve teens of Hollywood movie producers to Skid Row residents. It’s through the power of this diversity that we begin to plant seeds of compassion and a care for the “other” through the recognition of shared humanity. Ultimately we believe for someone to take action, to actually take time out of their day-to-day lives to engage with the world around them (and the issues affecting their neighbor), he/she must either feel an emotional connection to that affected person(s) or to the people engaging in the activity together. This is how we build community and, at the very core, relationships between people becoming empowered.
   
   For the young people we work with, role-modeling is the most powerful tool in creating a safe space to connect and explore. Our programming always starts with play, such as improv games and partner introduction activities, which teach the practice of stepping into one’s authentic self. We break down the fear of judgement and this process is transformational. From this place of empowerment we then create opportunities for youth to reflect and share about their life experiences - celebrating differences and embracing commonalities. Whether it’s young people from low-income and high-income communities camping together or young people realizing their personal greatness and belief in themselves, it’s the micro breakdowns of barriers that, over time, lead to macro breakthroughs. And as much as youth are in-need, over the course of 5 years of experimentation and programming, we’ve found adults to be equally in-need of this barrier breaking work. 
   
   We’ve learned how as we grow older adults lose touch of their childlike-wonder; becoming hardened and jaded by the ways of the world. As guides, we reconnect adults back to themselves by providing respites from the hustle of life and opportunities to engage in fulfilling enrichment. We are seeing our adult participants growing in their capacity to see themselves as agents of change, and finding immense emotional support in our uninhibited spaces of self-reflection and sharing. We utilize the power of paying-it-forward and the fun within our community-building programming to draw more adults into this social and emotional support system.
