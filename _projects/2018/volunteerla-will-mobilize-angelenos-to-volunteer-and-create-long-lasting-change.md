  Mayor Garcetti, in partnership with the Mayor’s Fund, formed the Mayor’s
  Office of Volunteer Engagement (MOVE) in late 2017 to lift and strengthen
  volunteerism in the city and region. MOVE’s mission is to strengthen L.A.’s
  culture of service by making volunteer opportunities accessible and
  meaningful, by building collaborations that inspire citizen engagement, and by
  creating long-lasting change around issues that Angelenos care about.
   
    
   
   Benefits of volunteering can include higher overall civic engagement, improved health, skills development, and lower criminal activity. Volunteering makes our communities stronger and more resilient. Corporate-based volunteerism builds employee culture and is a key component to corporate social responsibility efforts. 
   
   
   
   In May, MOVE will launch the VolunteerLA platform, an online resource that includes a curated list of volunteer opportunities in order to easily connect Angelenos to opportunities that are available in local communities across the region and that build on a diverse collection of skills. The volunteer opportunities featured on the site will represent the best of Los Angeles with MOVE’s vetted nonprofit partners posting opportunities as they become available. The platform will be powered by Golden, the leading volunteer mobile app. The Golden app features technical capabilities that will allow MOVE to capture valuable data to best inform how to grow volunteerism in the city and the region. Golden aims to solve one key challenge of volunteering — recruiting and converting volunteers — by making signing up easy and fun with clear, engaging descriptions and real-time logistics (like automated sign-in). In addition, Golden includes a backend dashboard that tracks key metrics and analytics, including economic value of volunteer time logged, percentage of new versus returning volunteers, interests and search terms, and a zip code heat map. 
   
   
   
   The platform will also serve as a place to tell the story of the great work being done by volunteers from nonprofits, corporations and institutions across the city and region, and will provide space to acknowledge and thank partners. 
   
   
   
   MOVE has also convened a Nonprofit Council and Corporate Council of leading nonprofit organizations and companies from across the city to come together to support VolunteerLA. These groups serve as key advisors and give input on how MOVE can best support corporate programs and the needs of nonprofits in the region. Going forward, the Nonprofit Council and Corporate Council will partner with MOVE to launch other programs to strengthen the city’s culture of volunteerism.
   
   
   
   Through VolunteerLA, we can establish Los Angeles as the national example of how government, nonprofits, foundations, and companies can partner to productively address our local issues together.
