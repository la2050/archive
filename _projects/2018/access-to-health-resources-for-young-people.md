  Our vision is that we, with our partners, will advance health equity and
  improve health outcomes for young people. By providing students with in-person
  health clinic tours at local community clinics, students will be able to
  familiarize themselves with the knowledge of health resources available in
  their communities. Young Angelenos will learn that by visiting a community
  health center, they can: get a free physical, free STI testing, free pregnancy
  test, free vaccines, receive counseling for drug and alcohol use, and speak to
  someone about mental health. These essential takeaways can help young people
  be prepared with the knowledge, skills, and resources to make healthy
  decisions, and lead healthier lives. 
   
   
   
   Studies show that young people navigate difficult decisions on a daily basis, many of which pose serious consequences to their health and well-being. In particular, young people in under-resourced communities are often faced with emotional distress and trauma without knowing how to seek help. Preventable health issues, such as mental illness or teen pregnancy contribute to the staggering reality that over one million high school students drop out of school each year. Together with local community clinics, we plan to increase health literacy and appropriate utilization of care by young people.
