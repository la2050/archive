  LA County is home to 10 million people with unique stories and circumstances,
  each of whom strives to make their communities the very best version of what
  they can be. Neighborhood Data for Social Change (NDSC) will make LA the best
  place to connect by equipping civic actors with information needed to
  contribute meaningfully in civic processes. 
   
   
   
   NDSC serves neighborhoods throughout LA County with high-quality and policy relevant data at the neighborhood level. It enables local nonprofits, government agencies, neighborhood councils, advocacy groups, and civic institutions to make data-informed decisions to improve the quality of life within their neighborhood. NDSC directly impacts the LA2050 metrics that help measure and support efforts to make LA the best place to Connect. In fact, multiple metrics for the Connect goal exist as distinct indicators within the platform, including: travel time to work, number of public transit riders, social connectedness, and voter registration. NDSC allows users to understand, measure, and track these indicators across the entire County, or by specific neighborhoods. Data can be viewed down to the census tract level, making NDSC a powerful tool to understand how connectedness varies across different neighborhoods. Users can even create their own custom neighborhoods by joining census tracts and tracking aggregated data.
   
   
   
   However, NDSC is not only about producing data. The platform empowers civic actors to better tell their stories, voice their opinions, and influence key decision-makers through the production of bi-weekly data stories produced in partnership with community based organizations and published by NDSC’s official media partner, KCETLink. Data stories incorporate maps, visualizations, photos, and rich narrative that highlight trends, opportunities, and challenges facing communities in the LA region. These data stories offer a powerful vehicle to advance additional Connect metrics, offering a platform to advocate for a number of key policies and investments that will make Los Angeles the most civically engaged region in the U.S. by 2050. 
   
   
   
   Lastly, NDSC activates Angelenos to make LA the best place to CONNECT through its ongoing series of community trainings, which are held monthly at USC and in the community. NDSC has launched a partnership with the Department of Neighborhood Empowerment, which supports the City’s 97 neighborhood councils in promoting public participation in government and improving government responsiveness to local concerns. Together, NDSC and Empower LA provide ongoing community workshops to train Angelenos on how to use data to activate change within their neighborhood. This partnership directly supports participation in neighborhood councils — a specific metric within the Connect goal. 
   
   
   
   Through these activities, NDSC helps the region work to become a place where every resident has the opportunity to engage, interact, and contribute to the region’s civic vitality.
