  NDSC has a number of built-in metrics that help define and measure success.
  Increased visibility and community engagement will be the primary metrics that
  we use throughout the two-year year. Monitoring visibility will include an
  ongoing analysis of online traffic to the platform, an analysis of media
  coverage and social media engagement, and engagement with the bi-weekly data
  stories published through KCETLink. By 2019, we plan to have 50,000 Angelenos
  using the platform. By 2020, we anticipate that number climbing to 100,000
  users. Increased community engagement will be measured by analyzing the number
  of individuals who are registering for, attending, and being waitlisted for
  our community training workshops. By 2019, we plan to reach 1,000 Angelenos
  through these trainings. By 2020, we plan to reach 2,000 participants. We will
  also record how much platform-related feedback we receive from the community,
  and how often individuals are downloading data and/or creating a login with
  the platform. Additionally, we will track inquiries from community groups
  requesting collaborations on data stories, as well the number of community
  partnerships to support NDSC training workshops. At all community trainings,
  we will gather user testimonials on how NDSC is helping to activate change in
  their community. Testimonials will be shared via social media, in our
  newsletter, and on the platform itself.

Neighborhood Data for Social Change (NDSC) will make LA the best place to connect by equipping civic actors with information needed to contribute meaningfully in civic processes. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n NDSC serves neighborhoods throughout LA County with high-quality and policy relevant data at the neighborhood level. It enables local nonprofits, government agencies, neighborhood councils, advocacy groups, and civic institutions to make data-informed decisions to improve the quality of life within their neighborhood. NDSC directly impacts the LA2050 metrics that help measure and support efforts to make LA the best place to Connect. In fact, multiple metrics for the Connect goal exist as distinct indicators within the platform, including: travel time to work, number of public transit riders, social connectedness, and voter registration. NDSC allows users to understand, measure, and track these indicators across the entire County, or by specific neighborhoods. Data can be viewed down to the census tract level, making NDSC a powerful tool to understand how connectedness varies across different neighborhoods. Users can even create their own custom neighborhoods by joining census tracts and tracking aggregated data.\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n However, NDSC is not only about producing data. The platform empowers civic actors to better tell their stories, voice their opinions, and influence key decision-makers through the production of bi-weekly data stories produced in partnership with community based organizations and published by NDSC’s official media partner, KCETLink. Data stories incorporate maps, visualizations, photos, and rich narrative that highlight trends, opportunities, and challenges facing communities in the LA region. These data stories offer a powerful vehicle to advance additional Connect metrics, offering a platform to advocate for a number of key policies and investments that will make Los Angeles the most civically engaged region in the U.S. by 2050. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n Lastly, NDSC activates Angelenos to make LA the best place to CONNECT through its ongoing series of community trainings, which are held monthly at USC and in the community.

Together, NDSC and Empower LA provide ongoing community workshops to train Angelenos on how to use data to activate change within their neighborhood. This partnership directly supports participation in neighborhood councils — a specific metric within the Connect goal. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n Through these activities, NDSC helps the region work to become a place where every resident has the opportunity to engage, interact, and contribute to the region’s civic vitality."

project_proposal_engage: >-
  NDSC activates nonprofits, government agencies, neighborhood councils,
  businesses, and other civic actors to make LA the best place to CONNECT
  through storytelling and trainings that help people use data to advocate for
  their community’s needs. Since the platform launched in October 2017, the
  platform has been viewed over 30,000 times. NDSC will scale up current
  activities to reach a total of 100,000 Angelenos over the next two years.
  Working with a range of community organizations, we will increase the number
  of trainings within LA County neighborhoods, to ensure that all Angelenos are
  able to locate the neighborhood data needed to activate change within their
  communities. NDSC will strategically partner with Neighborhood Councils,
  ensuring that we reach the full diversity of neighborhoods across the region —
  big and small, urban and rural, wealthy and under-resourced. A webinar will
  also be created to reach people that cannot attend a training. Training
  content will be promoted on the NDSC platform, in a monthly newsletter, and on
  the NDSC Twitter handle, which shares training schedules, new datasets and new
  data stories. Lastly, additional outreach will be conducted to engage more
  community partners in co-developing biweekly data stories published in
  partnership with KCETLink. Through these strategies, NDSC will provide a
  ladder of local data engagement for all Angelenos — from attending a single
  community training to participating as a full partner on new data stories.
project_five_years: >-
  In five years, Angelenos from all neighborhoods, with different backgrounds,
  goals, and aspirations for their neighborhoods, will use NDSC to activate
  change within their community. Civic actors will recognize NDSC as the go-to
  resource for accurate, timely, and policy relevant information about the
  challenges, opportunities, and trends facing local neighborhoods. Civic actors
  will have the information needed to generate informed and evidence-based
  policies and programs that address the unique needs of their communities. And,
  they will have a platform to share stories relevant to their community, using
  NDSC data stories to voice their opinions, influence policymakers, and
  advocate for their needs. NDSC will remain free to all users retaining its
  commitment to democratizing data; NDSC is the byproduct of a community-owned
  vision for accessible, transparent neighborhood data, and it is the community
  that will continue to shape the evolution of the platform. By working directly
  in partnership with nonprofit organizations, businesses, advocacy groups,
  neighborhood councils, and other civic actors, NDSC will activate a new era of
  civic engagement in Los Angeles, helping Angelenos build and track progress
  toward a shared vision for the future of Los Angeles.
