  Our mobile application (app) helps users find and secure parking quickly by
  utilizing intelligent software to read parking signs and determine if users
  can park in a specific location on a residential or commercial street. 
   
   
   
   The benefits of this application are numerous. Firstly, it has the potential to drastically reduce the amount of time users need to spend on finding parking, which can in turn reduce traffic in a city already known for it's abundant traffic problems. 
   
   
   
   In addition, it will reduce the number of parking tickets issued to people throughout the city. This has the potential to make residents and commuters happier in their daily lives, and allow tourists and visitors to enjoy their visit in the city to a greater capacity. Time not spent looking for parking is time spent in local stores, restaurants and businesses. These effects have positive economic implications, but will also benefit the city of Los Angeles beyond monetary reasons. Our app's image recognition and text analysis will make life easier for non english speakers so they can park, knowing they will not suffer the burden of a ticket. Simply stated, it will make the notorious parking problems rampant throughout the city more manageable, thereby making the city a happier and more productive place to live.
