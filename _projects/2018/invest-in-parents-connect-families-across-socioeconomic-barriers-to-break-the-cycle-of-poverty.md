  The cycle of poverty is perpetuated by stereotypes and stigma. Everyone has
  experienced the need to reach out for help. Imagine if, when you do so, you
  are constantly turned away because you don’t have the right documents, you
  don’t speak the right language, you don’t qualify for services. Your situation
  is desperate and you know your children are being adversely affected every
  day. This is the grim reality for millions of hard-working Angelenos.
   
   
   
   Los Angeles County ranks seventh in income inequality out of the nation’s 150 largest metro regions. While Los Angeles County has the highest number of millionaire residents in the country, 21.5% of our city’s residents are living in poverty. LIFT-LA actively builds bridges and provides opportunities for people within these communities — the top 5% and the bottom 21.5% - to connect. This is an intentional and radical approach as part of our four-year strategic plan to build bridged social capital between communities, and to allow our members and supporters to be in relationships with one another. We know from experience that the power of social networks can make or break our ability to achieve goals. LIFT-LA not only shines the light on the achievements of our members, we shine the light on the value of networks, compassion and the ability that the philanthropic community has to directly affect the well-being of others. 
   
   
   
   Through this activation, LIFT-LA will break down the barriers that divide us, and show Angelenos the real faces of people living in poverty: the faces of fierce and determined parents who are working hard to create opportunities for themselves and their children. LIFT-LA offers so many ways for people from different communities to connect. Through our Member2Member (M2M) network we facilitate direct transfers of cash and resources between supporters and members in times of crisis. Through our Holiday Fiesta, LIFT-LA connects supporter and member families during the holidays to be in relationships with one another that span the course of the year. This facilitation of bridged social capital not only has direct impacts for the member and supporter families involved, it helps to change the narrative of division and separation between communities.
   
   This innovative model of social capital is like no other work taking place in Los Angeles, and it is making our city a better place to live for everyone. We are directly impacting families by reducing adverse childhood experiences and lifting up families to reach a place of self-sufficiency.
   
   
   
   Due to the wealth disparity, what we have accomplished at LIFT-LA is a microcosm of what is possible for the rest of the nation. If bridged social capital is possible in LA, it is possible anywhere and LIFT is leading the way in creating resilient communities.
