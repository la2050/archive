  826LA is part of an ecosystem of services that help young people break out of
  poverty, by helping students improve their grades, apply to college, and
  develop the skills and confidence to express themselves fully. 826LA was
  founded in 2005 to address the need for academic and literacy support for Los
  Angeles students. Since that time, 826LA has served more than 74,000 students.
  More than 240 public school teachers each year benefit from 826LA’s support,
  and, in fiscal year 2017, over 1,230 trained, individual volunteers
  contributed over 21,000 hours of their time at 826LA. 
   
   
   
   Since its founding, 826LA has enlisted evidence-based practices to give students the tools they need for academic success and positive self-regard. In the 2018 fiscal year, 826LA anticipates serving 9,365 students. By offering its services for free, 826LA presents a sustainable way to provide educational programs to students from underserved communities. We believe that creativity is key for young people to develop critical thinking skills. At 826LA, students are transported to a world where writing is a form of magic, their voices are celebrated, and anything is possible. 
   
   
   
   826LA’s work is only possible with the help of volunteers. 826LA focuses on providing consistent, individualized attention from community volunteers, and in many programs, offers multiple sessions per week. This kind of educational support, from caring adults outside young people’s own families, has been shown to play a significant role in providing a number of developmental assets for students. A study by the Afterschool Alliance found that programs like 826LA’s, which are “staffed by community members, may be viewed by parents as more approachable than schools.” This accessibility “makes [these programs] an ideal partner to help schools break down barriers between parents and schools and increase parental engagement.” Not only does this engagement help parents feel more connected to their community, but it can also embolden them to seek out sufficient social and emotional support in other aspects of their lives. 
   
   
   
   To expand the reach of our programs and recruit more volunteers in our mission to reduce educational inequities, 826LA must connect with a wider and more diverse group of Angelenos. By connecting 100,000 people with the stories, essays, poems, and dreams of young Angelenos, along with a call to volunteer, 826LA’s volunteer base will grow and diversify and the rate of volunteerism in the city will increase. Support from LA2050 will enable us to focus on access and increased distribution of the over 300 student-written books and newspapers 826LA publishes each year. 
   
   
   
   The more often Angelenos hear our students speak—in their own words—about their hopes and challenges, the more often those same Angelenos will volunteer their time, donate funds, share stories with others, and advocate on behalf of LA students at the ballot box and beyond.
