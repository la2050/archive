  According to the Nature of Americans, the connection to nature is not a
  dispensable amenity but, rather, is essential to the health, economic
  prosperity, quality of life, and social well-being of all Americans. EverWild
  combines this with 21st Century Skills (collaboration, teamwork, creativity,
  imagination, critical thinking, and problem solving).
   
   
   
   Family Adventures is a weekly opportunity for families to connect with the outdoors in a supportive environment at local nature destinations. Community partners will provide space for EverWild and highlight events and activities offered at the local destination. Every adventure, following a similar framework, offers child and family-led decision making, open play, and connection to nature. Family members will choose from activities and will have free time to explore and play on their own. Experts in various fields or from the destination will be a resource and meet with families to provide information and/or an interactive activity. Family Adventure allows both the child and parent/guardian to explore and learn, grow in confidence and knowledge, and build community-growth values with other families. Each adventure is followed by a survey to provide feedback, suggestions for locations and activities, and opportunities for families to take the lead in upcoming events. 
   
   
   
   The Environmental Conservancy Program (ECP) is an after school program that works with youth ages 11-17. ECP combines environmental stewardship, positive youth development practices such as involving and engaging youth as equal partners (youth.gov), implementing evidence-based standards to conduct meaningful service learning (National Youth Leadership Council), and open play. Led by qualified staff, youth work together to develop a long-term project to create a positive impact and meaningful change. EverWild will offer cohorts throughout the year at community gardens and the Santa Monica Mountain Range. Based on youth interest, the group will design their own project. ECP offers a high staff to youth ratio to allow seamless integration if youth want to participate after the initial start date. Projects include composting, engaging businesses in green practices, and sustainable trail maintenance techniques. 
   
   
   
   To increase access, EverWild will continue to develop partnerships with open space and park facilities to host activities and to present events, programs, internships, summer employment, and volunteer opportunities they offer. EverWild will offer client support for public transportation and van rentals to bring young people and families to and from program, as needed. EverWild will document partnerships with memorandums of understanding, letters of agreement, and written communication with open spaces. EverWild will obtain feedback from children and families on quality of space and overall experience. For reporting outcomes on after school participation,EverWild will require sign-in and attendance logs.
