  Our expected outcomes will make a vital difference for families and small
  businesses looking to increase access to neighborhood resources in South Los
  Angeles County. Annual goals include:
   
   - Providing financial education and affordable housing services to 750 residents;
   
   -Building 300 affordable homes and providing affordable mortgage opportunities; 
   
   - Expanding Neighborhood Revitalization Institute programming to engage 150 residents with community leadership training; 
   
   - Improving job readiness by 20% among 100 youth through PCR and METRO CDC job training programs; 
   
   - Expanding small business growth by 25% and creating incubator programs to serve 10 entrepreneurs/businesses, while lending to 20 small businesses;
   
   - Enhancing healthy food options and outcomes by building 5 gardens and providing 300 residents with healthy living education;
   
   - Providing job training to 60 residents;
   
   - Hosting 8 farmer's markets to provide fresh nutritious food.
   
   
   
   Gauging the success and impact of the project will require tracking data among partners and service providers that utilize the facility. NHS will work with partners to consolidate and filter impact data. Affiliated groups working through the Center will share all relevant statistics and deliverables data with NHS. NHS will serve as the central filter for evaluating the impacts and status of job training, homeowner education, financial education, and small business education programs.

  Utilizing the model of 'What Makes A Community?' as our focus, NHS is working
  with the City of Compton, Pacific Coast Regional, and METRO CDC to create a
  central hub where community members can connect. The Center will help

  The residents of Compton are primarily made up of low to moderate income
  families and individuals; the per capita income is $13,847, which is less than
  50% of both the state average of $29,906 and the national average of $28,555.
  The city's poverty rate is double the state average. Rents and home prices
  have risen to the point that lower-skilled and lower-wage earners must live
  further away from their jobs. As a result, the lack of affordable housing has
  closed off the access to health and wellness, education and other benefits
  associated with a strong workforce.
   
   
   
   NHS intends to continue to engage the community through the CSC by increasing the programs offered and the depth of those programs. Specific strategies include: building more affordable homes, hosting farmer's markets to support community wellness; workforce training and placement in agriculture, construction, and culinary jobs; and hosting financial empowerment workshops.
project_five_years: >-
  With an activation from LA2050, NHS positions itself to create strong
  neighborhoods over the next five years. Our hope is that every community we
  serve will have access to healthy, affordable food; financial literacy and
  economic opportunities; and affordable housing. Our Sustainable Communities
  Initiative will host 40 farmer's markets, develop 3.7 acres of agricultural
  space across five developments, train 750 community members in various trades
  with a 50% placement rate, train 1,250 residents in healthy living, and
  encourage financial literacy with our ongoing poverty prevention programs. 
   
   
   
   The vision driving our Initiative involves addressing a broad spectrum of issues. At the center of this focus is our commitment to promote strategies that create systemic, trans-formative change in under-served neighborhoods. This initiative will serve as a catalyst for broader goals to help low-to-moderate income families achieve economic prosperity, secure affordable housing, broaden access to resources, and incorporate green living.
