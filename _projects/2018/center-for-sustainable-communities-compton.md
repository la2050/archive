  NHS' Center for Sustainable Communities serves hundreds of low income families
  annually in a region that has endured many of the worst impacts of the
  economic downturn. Of primary concern is how to deal with the growing
  challenges among these neighborhoods regarding chronic
  unemployment/underemployment, reduced capital access for small business
  development, the ongoing threat of food insecurity, substandard transit
  options, skyrocketing housing costs, educational disparities, and youth
  disengagement. 
   
   
   
   In response, the Center for Sustainable Communities provides the people of Compton and South Los Angeles County a facility that serves as a hub to build a solid foundation for creating neighborhood sustainability over the next decade. Specific impacts include: 1) Improving the job readiness and overall skills base of local workforce; 2) Providing healthy living resources,health and vision clinic services to residents; 3) Reaching and training residents through the CSC Neighborhood Revitalization Institute; 4) Increasing access to business incubator services and originating loans for small business owners; 5) Engaging youth in on-site workforce and mentoring programs; 6) Assisting families through our Financial Empowerment Center; 7) Establishing community garden projects on the property and urban gardens in surrounding neighborhoods; 8) Sharing educational resources through an on-site library and technology center; 9) Providing green education and conservation programs; 10) Promoting community safety with a Public Safety Drop In Site - Fire, Paramedic, Building & Safety; and 11) Building 300 units of affordable housing and increasing home-ownership. In addition to meeting crucial resource access needs for families, the Center will allow its partners to share sustainability concepts that drive planning approaches in other impacted communities throughout South Los Angeles and LA County.
   
   
   
   As the facility grows, the Center will expand to help hundreds of small business owners, neighborhood non-profit groups, and residents through on-site services and regional partnerships with community service groups, faith-based organizations, green organizations, health providers, technology professionals, schools, and municipalities. At least 50% of our tenants will be service-driven.
