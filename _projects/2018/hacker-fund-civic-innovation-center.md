  In order to create a better Los Angeles and activate 100,000 Angelenos by
  2050, Hacker Fund is launching a Civic Innovation Center (CIC) in Downtown Los
  Angeles. The CIC will make Los Angeles the best place to CREATE by offering to
  the general public state-of-the-art prototyping tools, vocational education
  and job-training, a framework to receive funding to patent innovations, and
  exposure to hackathons that bring thousands of community members together. 
   
   
   
   Our first CIC will occupy up to 5,000 square feet for the purpose of managing a makerspace, mixed-reality lab, a classroom, private offices, and collaborative event space. The first CIC is set to open in Q2 of 2019. Membership will be sold to the general public at discounted rate of $200-$250 per month. The CIC will be able to house on average 100 people throughout the day as it operates from 8:30AM to 10:30 PM, with the first 6 hours dedicated to collaborative coworking and manufacturing activity, and then using the next 8 hours to optimize for educational workshops, job fairs, and hackathons to serve up to approximately 250 members of the public. 
   
   
   
   Members of the CIC will be able to learn design, software engineering, hardware development, data science, and rapid-prototyping from industry mentors from Hacker Fund’s existing network of 250+ technology volunteers, including professionals from SpaceX, IBM, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon. The availability of 3D printers, laser-cutters, and soldering tools will make manufacturing more accessible thanks to our corporate sponsors. The use of this new knowledge through tools and mentorship will allow members to develop civic innovations that increase the number of potential patents per capita in Los Angeles. Once members develop their prototypes, they will be able to access Hacker Fund’s fiscal sponsorship services in order to raise additional funding for additional manufacturing and hiring employees. The increase in social impact projects developed by Angelenos will also increase the availability of volunteer opportunities and jobs per capita.
   
   
   
   The CIC will be funded through a combination of grant funding (including LA2050 and $50,000 that we have already received from the Craig Newmark Philanthropic Fund), membership fees, corporate sponsorship, and in-kind donations.
