  Climate change is worsening air pollution by altering regional weather
  patterns and impacting the location of pollutants, quantity of pollutants
  (such as ozone, NOx, VOCs), and formation of smog. The physical geography of
  California plays a large role in the rising smog levels. Increasing
  temperatures and higher quantities of pollutants combined with wind patterns
  and physical barriers such as mountains result in areas with high quantities
  of trapped air pollutants. One clear example of this is the city of Los
  Angeles which is surrounded by the San Gabriel and San Bernardino mountains.
  Los Angeles is home to some of the worst air quality in the country (number
  one for ozone and fifth for year-round particle pollution).
   
    
   
   Changing regional weather patterns are causing heat waves or extreme heat events to become more common, which is increasing the risk of heat-related mortality. Specifically, in urban areas, large quantities of asphalt, tall buildings, and limited trees cause an effect known as an urban heat island. This is a phenomenon when cities are substantially warmer than the surrounding areas. Climate change is intensifying urban heat islands and increasing the risk of mortality in certain communities from circulatory and respiratory diseases. Risk factors for heat-related illnesses and deaths include age, gender, health status, location, and income status. Communities of color experience a large proportion of these risk factors, and they are the most common victims of heat waves. Climate change is predicted to increase heat deaths in Black communities.
   
    
   
   Through blending media, popular education, and policy, our goal is to engage communities of color as well as key stakeholders and elected officials in the climate justice fight with the intention of advancing meaningful institutional change at the state and local level. Using an intersectional lens, we will raise awareness about how climate change can impact Los Angelenos of color both globally and locally, as well as promote solutions that center on the most vulnerable populations. This includes linking how affordable and safe quality housing, transportation, oil drilling, fossil fuel reduction, water and food policies can help prevent further global warming in addition to creating healthier and more sustainable communities for all. Furthermore, by engaging communities of color directly, we can apply more pressure to local and state elected officials to support and champion true climate justice legislation.
