  “Welcome, Neighbor,” a collaboration of Miry’s List and the LA Department of
  Neighborhood Empowerment (DONE) with support from other city departments, will
  activate 100,000 Angelenos over the next two years to work through their
  Neighborhood Councils to help resettling refugees. Designed to bring people
  together in neighborhoods across the city, the program will provide simple,
  meaningful, and impactful ways to support our newest neighbors while promoting
  volunteerism and Neighborhood Council participation. 
   
   
   
   The program will have four stages:
   
   
   
   1. LEARN: In June 2018 (prior to the grant period), we will kick off with a New Arrival Festival at Grand Park in Downtown LA cosponsored by Miry’s List, DONE, and other city departments and elected officials. This free, public event celebrating the city’s designation of June as New Arrival Month will feature educational panels, music, and food from around the world. Speakers will include representatives from the refugee community, experts, advocates, and city elected officials. 
   
   
   
   2. RESOLVE: Neighborhood Councils across the city will vote on and adopt the Neighborhood Welcoming Resolution written by Miry’s List founder Miry Whitehill and adopted by the Eagle Rock Neighborhood Council and the City of Los Angeles in 2017. You can read the resolution at www.miryslist.org/neighborhood-welcoming-resolution 
   
   
   
   3. COMMIT: Each participating Council will form a Welcoming Committee to foster refugee and immigrant inclusivity. The Welcoming Committee will oversee and lead the Welcoming Actions detailed below. 
   
   
   
   4. ACTIVATE: Led by the Welcoming Committee, each participating Council will take Welcoming Actions -- tangible steps, curated by Miry’s List, to support resettling individuals and families. Each council can choose actions that align with its goals and capabilities. In addition to supporting resettling refugees, these Welcome Actions will help increase participation in the Neighborhood Councils. The menu of possible Welcoming Actions includes:
   
   
   
   --Make Council board meetings a drop-off zone for donations 
   
   --Invite someone experiencing resettlement to a meeting to share their experiences
   
   --Host a town hall on refugee resettlement to educate neighbors 
   
   --Host a community dinner party to introduce community members to the incredible foods and cultures of our newest neighbors
   
   --Adopt a resettling family’s wishlist of needed items and activate neighbors to send them welcome gifts and notes 
   
   --Assign a Welcoming Committee chairperson to provide regular, monthly board meeting updates about immigrants and resettling neighbors in the community
   
   
   
   Through these stages and actions, “Welcome, Neighbor” will provide resettling individuals and families with social and emotional support, promote participation in Neighborhood Councils, and boost volunteerism. Ultimately, we believe that an LA where neighbors come together to welcome refugees will be a better, more compassionate, and more engaged city for all its residents.
