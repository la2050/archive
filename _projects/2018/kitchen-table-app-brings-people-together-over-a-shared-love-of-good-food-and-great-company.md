  Los Angeles is an amazing city. It’s my hometown and I feel very lucky to be
  an Angeleno. Los Angeles is also where we conceptualized and created Kitchen
  Table App and so it’s our organization’s hometown too.
   
   
   
   But, Los Angeles is a difficult place to meet new people, make new friends, and build authentic community in your neighborhood. The social behaviors and social norms that Angelenos have come to adopt limit engagement with people that live in your building or on your block, restrict the ability to meet your neighbors when buildings don’t offer common or outdoor spaces, and reduce the instinct to say hello to people in your community that you’ve never met before because they are strangers and you don’t know if they are interested in meeting you.
   
   
   
   Kitchen Table App’s mission is to bring people together to share dining experiences, make meals accessible, easy, and memorable, and redefine what it means to eat local. We are all familiar the popular “eat local” movement, originally kicked off in the 1970s by environmentalists advocating that people buy food that was local to them. Farmers markets, grocery stores, restaurants, and individual brands soon followed and #eatlocal #buylocal #supportlocal trended on social. Kitchen Table App is redefining “eat local” to mean sharing dining experiences with friends, neighbors, and newcomers that you may have never met before. Our “eat local” is about connection: human connection with those around us, over the universal language that all speak, food.
   
   
   
   Kitchen Table App provides individuals with the ability to host a meal or gathering in their home or space and the opportunity to join a meal or gathering at a host's home or space with a table full of others including neighbors, friends, parents, colleagues, classmates, advocates, activists, networking circles, and people in the community that they may have never met before. Our mobile app allows individuals to connect with neighborhood hosts in an open marketplace to meet each other, make new friends, learn more about and volunteer for non profit organizations that matters to them, discuss how city and local policies affect their neighborhood, apartment building, grocery store, education, and employment opportunities, and influence behavior whether that’s getting more young people to register to vote, encouraging more people to conserve, recycle, and support local businesses. 
   
   
   
   Kitchen Table App is an expert in facilitating communal dining and gathering experiences and creating the opportunity to easily connect with others by participating in both hosting meals and get-togethers for others or joining meals and get-togethers with others. Kitchen Table App is rooted in connecting. It’s our core value. And we invite you and your community to join in and take a seat at the table with us.
