  As an immigrant enclave, LA Chinatown has had historic gaps in civic
  engagement—in part due to linguistic isolation, as more than half of residents
  are Low English Proficiency. As the neighborhood experiences rapid
  redevelopment and urban planning, such as the Downtown LA 2040 Community Plan
  Update, it is urgent now more than ever to educate and engage local residents,
  small businesses and organizations on how to interact with and be part of
  positive changes.
   
   
   
   WAPOW is a grassroots community multimedia project in the historic cultural urban neighborhood of LA Chinatown that uses narrative arts to advance various objectives including: 
   
   
   
   - storytelling to promote community building
   
   - civic engagement by raising awareness of urban planning and public services 
   
   - providing diverse volunteer opportunities that draw on people’s varied skills in art, translation, writing, event planning, etc.
   
   - promote community building and immigrant integration;
   
   - youth development;
   
   - cultural sharing and stewardship; and
   
   - local small business promotion/economic development. 
   
   
   
   We achieve objectives by engaging partners in a series of interrelated activities: 
   
   
   
   WAPOW Magazine - A bilingual quarterly publication, produced by volunteer community contributors, focused on community news and cultural highlights, that also lead conversations on civic issues otherwise not covered in mainstream and ethnic media.
   
   
   
   Small Business Outreach and Business Directory: As part of the publication, small businesses may access free or low-cost graphic design or translation services to help broaden their community reach.They will also be able to place advertisements, with ad spaces prioritized for local small businesses. Currently, older legacy businesses struggle to reach newer generations, and newer businesses struggle to reach older generations, in part due to branding or linguistic barriers. Conversations with businesses may also include counseling on how to increase reach—whether by adding translation or trying online marketing. Concurrently, we will be developing a small business directory that will feature older and new businesses to capture the different types of businesses in Chinatown. 
   
   
   
   Community Engagement Events - in person events at local venues to engage the public in meaningful interactions and dialogues. Opportunities include movie screenings, housing rights workshops, community panels on local issues, and cultural activities. 
   
   The project’s new storytelling platform is a vehicle for community building around important issues of shared interest. It also provides new ways to access community resources, and opportunities for people to activate and connect—either actively as volunteers or event-goers, or passively as readers. The focus on storytelling helps build empathy and mutual understanding across different generations, experiences, histories and perspectives, toward building community cohesion and resilience.
