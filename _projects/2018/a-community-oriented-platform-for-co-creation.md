title: A Community-Oriented Platform for Co-Creation
project_summary: ''
Please describe the activation your organization seeks to launch.: "Current social media platforms employ a business model in which the user is the product and the advertiser is the customer, which in turn has led to spread of polarization, misinformation, passivity and fear.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to bring the average back up and improve social media by delivering value through real life interaction and collaboration.  Our focus is to help communities organize, volunteer, fund raise, and participate in politics and we strongly believe we have the most efficient formula. "
Describe in greater detail how your activation will make LA the best place?: "As humans our need for connection is as fundamental as our need for food and water. Over 30% of the global population now uses some type of social media platform to connect and share information, in the US this number is at an astonishing 81%.\r\n\r\nOur goal at inUnity is to guide this need for connection and turn it into an opportunity for collaboration. We use a simple formula to notify users of activities that they might be interested in that go beyond entertainment and tap into other interests such as political activism, volunteer opportunities and others.\r\n\r\nHow?\r\n\r\nAs new users log in they are taken to a screen that lets them select the type of of activities they are interested in being notified about.\r\n\r\nCurrently projects are done in private silos where needs and roadblocks are only known to a small amount of people immediately involved in the project. On our platform we open source the project creation process to crowdsource every type of person that can possibly help the project move forward faster.  \r\n\r\nAs a project is created on the platform the user selects the needs and metrics of the project which include, but are not limited to, funding dollars, team members, volunteers, or any other customizable metric.\r\n\r\nOnce the project goes live, the users on the network are notified of the project or opportunity based on their pre-selected preferences and can see the progress being made on it and if there is a need for their help in any way.\r\n\r\nIf this were to be applied to a rally for example, a starting user would create the project on the app and create a blueprint to what he or she is trying to accomplish and any other valuable information that could help communicate the idea.\r\n\r\nUsers are then notified of the rally and can communicate through the group chat to stay updated on the project.  Once the project is completed it can then be deleted or maintained as an open portal to communicate with those involved for further opportunities.\r\n\r\nThis formula can be applied to any kind of project in the platform and would help angelenos make meaningful connections with their fellow neighbors. "
How will your activation engage Angelenos to make LA the best place: "We have community managers to onboard users that would create projects within the following initial verticals.\r\n\r\nLocal Political Activism to include Neighborhood Councils\r\nMusic Events\r\nComedy Events\r\nFilm & Television\r\nSmall Business\r\n\r\nThe reason for multiple verticals instead of just one is to give users a reason to use the platform for more than one type of interactive opportunity.\r\n\r\nOnce the initial round of users are on-boarded and we can guarantee content for other users to see we will start reaching out to the general population to create awareness of the platform and get the gears turning on activating the city.\r\n\r\n"
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your activation.: "Number of downloads, activation rate, and monthly active users.\r\n\r\nGiven that this platform's purpose is collaboration and co-creation we can measure the success of the activation with these metrics."
Where do you hope this activation or your organization will be in five years?: >-
  We hope that in 5 years we can be a widely used action platform to help propel
  communities forward.  We intend in introducing other features that can further
  help individuals connect as we grow and helping organizations that advocate
  change get the exposure they need to reach their desire goals.  Our goal is to
  be at 100 million users by this time.
