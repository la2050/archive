  In the first three years of a child’s life, foundational brain architecture is
  established, making children’s earliest experiences the most important. The
  creation of healthy brain architecture is dependent on good health, positive
  and nurturing relationships with adults, exposure to enriching learning
  opportunities, and safe neighborhoods. Yet, many of LA’s babies don’t receive
  the supports they need for a health start. 
   
   
   
   Children Now is committed to supporting and connecting the incredible constituency power that exists in LA to influence state and local policymaking in favor of our youngest kids. Policymakers are paying too little attention and allocating too few resources to those formative early years. We will execute a multi-faceted communications plan to raise awareness, build public support, and activate Angelenos behind a social media campaign in support of quality care, education and experiences for all of LA’s babies. 
   
   
   
   Children Now will leverage its reach to hundreds of organizations and businesses in LA County through The Children’s Movement, a network of more than 470 direct service, business, parent, civil rights, faith-based and community-based organizations dedicated to improving the lives of kids, as well as use social media analytics to identify key organizations and businesses to promote messaging on early brain and social emotional development. Among this group, we will select key organizations and businesses that have a strong social media presence in LA to partner on social media content distribution. By coordinating the social media reach of hundreds of organizations behind one campaign, we will increase social media connections among Angelenos.
   
   
   
   Once our influencer network is established, Children Now will develop and disseminate weekly content and toolkits for social media influencers to share online and to educate reporters on infant and toddler issues. This content will include:
   
   
   
   * Infographics highlighting key data and statistics on the need for strong supports for early brain development and social emotional development; 
   
   * Video blog posts on early brain development and social emotional development for young children;
   
   * Shareable memes and photos with data points highlighting the need for better supports for infants and toddlers; 
   
   * Links to partners’ and researchers’ reports and materials that highlight infant and toddler issues; and
   
   * Social media posts targeted at key state and LA County candidates of the 2018 election.
   
   
   
   Our social media push will target window of opportunity for Angelenos to help push California’s gubernatorial and other state and local candidates to prioritize young children and, further, to stick to his or her campaign promise to support young children and to develop a plan to move forward on a comprehensive system of support for babies.
