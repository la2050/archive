  One of the most difficult realities of a dementia diagnosis is that there are
  no effective treatments for the disease, nor is there a cure. We do, however,
  have the opportunity to mitigate the difficulties of its decline. As the rates
  of this disease double in the next twelve years, effectively bankrupting our
  healthcare system, cities that implement avant-garde solutions to address its
  care will be ones that stand out in the international challenge to solve what
  is likely to be the greatest public health crisis of modern history. 
   
   Traditionally, the effort to seek solutions for this disease has been limited to the elderly generation, but we are rapidly bringing the realities out of the shadows and injecting intergenerational innovation.
   
   The Youth Movement Against Alzheimer’s (YMAA) offers a novel, inexpensive solution to provide respite care services to the Los Angeles Community: YouthCare. YouthCare is an intergenerational respite-care program that partners trained college student volunteers and older adults with early-stage dementia in a community-based setting. For three hours, twice a week, they play games, participate in artistic activities, and deliver the research-backed Brain Boot Camp, developed by the UCLA Longevity Center to help people compensate for age-related cognitive decline. Students and seniors are paired based on similar interests and hobbies, creating a unique mentor-mentee relationship.
   
   YouthCare has been recognized by MIT, UCLA, and the Clinton Global Initiative. Most recently this model won openIDEO’s care for dementia challenge, which received 250 applications from around the world, and Social Venture Partners LA Fast Pitch 2018.
   
   YouthCare is built on a 2 year pilot with UCLA Geriatrics. Our caregiver waitlist was at more than four times capacity, with more applying to volunteer than we could accept, and most importantly, three-quarters of caregivers said this program alone was all the break they needed - a key finding in our efforts to reduce caregiver depression rates. One hundred percent of students reported that they would recommend this program to a friend, and many seniors with Alzheimer’s provided anecdotal evidence that they had found purpose once again in their lives. With just six hours a week, we found a win—win—win for older adults with dementia, their caregivers, and students, who now have a skill development opportunity to work with our growing aging population. 
   
   YouthCare is the least-expensive respite-care option. Research shows that respite is critical to keeping loved ones at home longer. In fact, 2-4 years of YouthCare costs are comparable to just one month of nursing home costs. If YouthCare reaches 17% of Angelenos with dementia and allows them to age at home for just two more months, we will save the healthcare system five-billion dollars. YouthCare has launched our pilot program at USC. With an investment from LA2050, we can bring this model to several other colleges and communities in LA county.
