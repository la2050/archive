  Our program to eliminate distracted driving will reduce the numbers of
  premature deaths by car accidents. The County of Los Angeles Public Health
  lists premature deaths from car accidents as the third leading cause
  countywide. The Hispanic population is the ONLY racial group among four that
  includes premature death by car accidents as one of the four principal causes
  of premature deaths. The bike score will be improved by mobilizing the LA
  community through a digital and bilingual strategy (the ProTextMe app) that
  will prevent drivers from using their phones while driving (or biking).
  Realtime outcomes data will provide an unprecedented dataset that will
  document distracted driving activity and program impact. HCP principals
  routinely publish scholarly papers on the outcomes for programs in which we
  are involved. ProTextMe has sponsored scholarly publications on their European
  program outcomes. We will work with our media partners and LA2050 to publicize
  the program and its outcomes on social media. LA will become the model for its
  program to eliminate distracted driving, especially among diverse communities
  for which we are famous. This approach that uses mass media and academia
  provides exposure in two important communities: public awareness and the
  highest standards of scrutiny.
