  Los Angeles has a history of trucks rolling down the street to deliver value.
  From the Helms bakery trucks and their baked goods-announcing whistle to the
  iconic twang jingle of an ice cream truck drew families from their homes on
  summer nights and weekends to join together for a cool treat, trucks called
  people from their homes to meet on the street. In the 21st century, Angelenos
  continue to expect mobile delivery of what they want from the Kogi-launched
  gourmet food truck industry to Amazon’s on-demand packages. Yes, people are
  more connected than ever to the world but less so to their neighbors. Learning
  from the past, The BlockMobile models home-delivery of treats and goods and
  applies that to civic engagement and neighborhood leadership.
   
   
   
   The BlockMobile is an innovative design to make civic and community engagement a good that can too be brought to the front doors of Angelenos. Connecting in LA must be achieved at the most local level: on the streets. Too often, civic engagement is pushed from the top down, and The BlockMobile seeks to engage traditionally tough-to-engage Angelenos living in apartments where they live: on their block. And by doing so, we will create a fun space for neighbors to connect, micro issues to be identified, and for local leaders to emerge. 
   
   
   
   The BlockMobile concept is simple: pack a food truck-style vehicle with community engagement tools and resources, promote the trucks visit in advance to a block, park the truck on a block for 2 hours, and draw neighbors to connect with each other with food, games, and conversations about living on their block. Partnering with local agencies like LAPD, LAFD, local non-profits and larger community groups, this localized engagement will also provide resources to participants and offer them the opportunity to talk specifically about their local concerns. The BlockMobile and partners will be trained to support individuals in understanding they can address their local issues, and offer those interested the opportunity to be supported in their effort to continue the dialogue and create a small neighborhood action plan (SNAP) for the issue of concern. These hyperlocal leaders will be offered monthly support and connected to a network of other local leaders as well as given support to continue conversation with their own neighbors on their block.
   
   
   
   This local activation will see at least five events per week in the evenings and weekends (when people are home) on as many blocks, with the intention of identifying at least one new, hyperlocal leader to volunteer to tackle a local concern, whether its hosting more block gatherings or as simple as learning how to request a sidewalk repair or pothole to be filled. By supporting local leaders to emerge and become caretakers for their block, The BlockMobile initiative will leave behind connectors who make that block more livable, transforming high density areas of isolation into thriving, interconnected communities.
