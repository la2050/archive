  Low-income families spend as many as 20 hours per week researching, finding,
  and traveling to multiple agencies to get the services they need. Families
  often use more than 12 different agencies a year in their quest to meet basic
  needs.



   We believe that poverty in L.A. County does not have to be a life sentence. We want to make it easier for more of L.A. County’s low-income families to navigate the safety net of services without the need for gatekeepers, and put the power to improve those systems in their hands.



   The One Degree platform makes the search for emergency food, shelter, or health services as easy as ordering a book on Amazon. Angelenos deserve an efficient, effective safety net of services. Low-income people and families have agency, and everyone should be able to access the support they need to prosper and reach their full potential. Every resident in the Los Angeles region should have the economic means and cultural capital to lead active, healthy lives.





   The platform at www.1degree.org is a powerful connects low-income and at-risk families directly to more than 6,500 critical social services in L.A. County, including:



   -- Urgent needs (crisis hotlines to overnight shelters)

   -- Food (food pantries to nutrition education)

   -- Housing (affordable housing to deposit and rental assistance)

   -- Education (after school programs to life skills classes)

   -- Health (prenatal care to mental health care and counseling)

   -- Household (baby supplies to cash for utilities)

   -- Employment (job training to resume help)



   Users can find, manage, save, and track the services they are using. One Degree shows people resources that they are eligible for and the next steps to utilize them. Users can add ratings and reviews, and share opportunities with friends or family by email and text. This resource is live and available in L.A. County, but we want to launch a full campaign to grow usage and reliance on this powerful tool to improve lives. There are many of the LIVE metrics this activation will improve, but the three selected include:



   √ Number of households below the self-sufficiency standard

   One Degree gives families the tools to find social services that will help them close the gap to self sufficiency. For many families, these crucial services are the safety net they need in order to build a path out of poverty.



   √ Resilient communities

   One Degree’s platform is always available, no matter the neighborhood and on whatever device they might rely upon. The One Degree platform is intended to serve a broad spectrum of people who are seeking social services or help — even those who may be at-risk of falling into poverty for the first time in their lives.



   √ Residents receiving coordinated healthcare services

   One Degree’s tools give residents and clinicians tools to address social determinants of health such as homelessness, food insecurity, child care resources, job training, and more.
