  Attending CicLAvia open streets events remind us that we are connected in more
  ways than we can possibly count. The tens of thousands of people gathered
  along miles of streets connecting our communities come from all parts of the
  city and region, and represent the diversity of our population. They
  voluntarily travel, sometimes as far away as San Diego or Ventura counties, to
  explore, rediscover, and interact with both the neighborhoods and each other.
  While CicLAvia has become a tradition in LA with 24 events since 2010,
  CicLAvia continues to resonate as a place to connect, where about one-third of
  the attendees are first-time participants who are drawn to the experience of
  connection, and where more than 60% of the participants arrive in groups of 3
  or more — which represent a high family-oriented experience.
   
   
   
   The activation, called “When LA Listens” will serve as the vehicle to document and curate, for the first-time, the real-time stories, perspectives, and experiences of attendees at CicLAvia open streets events. The stories will be captured through:
   
   1. Key locations along the route will be transformed into video listening stations where people will have an opportunity to share experiences. 
   
   2. Roaming video interviewers along the route who will directly capture people’s experiences.
   
   
   
   CicLAvia will develop and promote a dedicated and curated website to serve as the online space to showcase the stories. A video library will be established to insure that all stories will have a permanent home.
   
   
   
   The 2019-2020 CicLAvia season will see no less than 8 CicLAvia open streets events throughout the city and region. We anticipate creating new routes and experiences in South LA, Central LA Downtown LA East LA, Northeast LA, San Fernando Valley, Westside, San Gabriel Valley, Glendale, and Culver City.
   
   
   
   Since the first CicLAvia in 2010, LA has transformed in many ways. Former LA Times writer Christopher Hawthorne stated that: “CicLAvia hasn't only allowed Angelenos to see the city and its architecture with fresh eyes. It has allowed us to see ourselves with fresh eyes.”
   
   
   
   When more than 100,000 people continue to come to a single CicLAvia event after 24 events, it tells us that Angelenos have a strong desire to belong to a larger community. CicLAvia helps create a space and place for the larger community to come together. There are no windshields to block out the ambient noise of the car’s engine. Instead, it is replaced by the ambient noise of conversations and story-telling along the route. CicLAvia’s activation - ”When LA Listens” will capture those stories, amplify them, and ensure that they will not be lost.
