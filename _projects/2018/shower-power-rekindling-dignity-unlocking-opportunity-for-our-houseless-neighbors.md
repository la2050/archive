  “Lava Mae saved my life. I feel like a million bucks after one of their
  showers, and I can walk down the streets with my head held high. They’ve
  become my Tuesday family." 
   
   ~ Luis, Lava Mae guest
   
   
   
   “Providing mobile showers to those in need has been inspiring. I’ve made long lasting connections with our shower guests and consider them my friends. I have a much better understanding of why people are homeless, and I have so much love and compassion for them. Seeing the impact on the people of the LA neighborhood where I volunteer is a blessing, and it’s given me much more of a sense of connection to my community.” 
   
   ~ Jennifer, Lava Mae volunteer
   
   
   
   While Lava Mae provides critical access to showers and toilets for people experiencing homelessness, our work is about much more. It’s about connection. We reconnect our guests with their sense of self-worth and dignity, and with staff and volunteers who treat them with the utmost care and attention. 
   
   
   
   Through our volunteer program, we engage individuals from all walks of life to deliver our service. In doing so, we give them the opportunity to connect with our guests and acknowledge and honor their shared humanity. Since launching our service in 2014, we’ve created transformative connections for thousands of guests and volunteers alike. 
   
   
   
   Lava Mae’s vision for LA2050 is to mobilize 100,000 Angelenos to dramatically expand mobile hygiene across Los Angeles to restore hygiene, dignity and hope to our unhoused neighbors. Here’s how we’ll do it:
   
   
   
   1. Replication. We’ll begin by helping individuals and organizations across LA replicate our service by providing the resources, guidance, and hands-on help they need to launch mobile showers in their communities. The best and strongest services come from the communities where the need exists.
   
   
   
   2. Education. Lava Mae will execute a robust campaign to educate neighborhood groups, schools and universities, businesses, nonprofits, social entrepreneurs, philanthropic organizations, faith-based groups, and other organizations/networks about access to hygiene and its link to dignity/opportunity, with the goal of mobilizing a volunteer force of 100k Angelenos.
   
   
   
   3. Transformation. We’ll also launch a visibility raising campaign to inspire citizens to consider what a shower really means, what it means when you cannot shower, and what they can do to help provide hygiene, dignity, hope and opportunity for their unhoused neighbors. 
   
   
   
   For example…
   
   
   
   The Power of a Shower. Did you shower today? If you’re living on the streets, you probably didn’t. Lava Mae delivers mobile showers to help people experiencing homelessness rekindle dignity and maintain hygiene so they can seek employment and housing. If you can take a shower, you can help give a shower to a neighbor in need. Visit lavamae.org and learn how you can give a shower and the dignity + opportunity that come with being clean.
