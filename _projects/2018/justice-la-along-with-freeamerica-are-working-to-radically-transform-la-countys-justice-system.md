  Justice LA is committed to making Los Angeles safe, connected and equitable. A
  huge barrier to creating this environment is the exorbitant rates of
  incarceration and state violence perpetrated against Black, Latino, immigrant
  and poor communities throughout LA County. For too long, LA County has viewed
  safety exclusively through a policing and incarceration lens and poured
  billions of limited public resources into failing solutions. Over the past 20
  years, LA County has dramatically increased the budgets of its Sheriff’s
  Department and Probation Department. These decisions were made despite
  evidence that policing and incarceration does not significantly impact crime
  rates and a mandate from the majority of Californians to decrease reliance on
  incarceration to public health and safety issues.



   Ending mass incarceration is a growing movement. For this effort to continue to gain momentum and to garner additional support, we must work to change narratives, shift culture, and engage communities most affected — many of whom do not know or believe that they can be advocates for positive change or recognize their place and power within the democratic process. We must educate residents about initiatives that bring us closer to our goal and will have an immediate impact on their quality of life. Two such initiatives include: stopping LA County’s $3.5 billion project to build two new jails and reinvesting those funds into much needed community services and reforming the money bail system to increase the number of people able to return home after arrest, thereby reducing LA’s jail population.



   Justice LA will produce:



   Public art exhibits are unique opportunities to gather large and diverse groups of people, introduce residents to the arts and encourage people to visit other arts and cultural institutions. The art installations will be created by local artists and feature actual jail beds. These activations will help LA2050 reach its targets for 50 percent of households participating in the arts by engaging with at least one arts and cultural institution, and increased attendance at public/open streets gatherings.



   People with common interests and concerns need spaces like Town Halls to learn from, converse and stay in touch with one another. Our activations create the chance for residents to meet and exchange social media contact information. This environment will help facilitate LA2050’s work to increase the total number of local social media friends and connections Angelenos have and for 95% of adults receive social and emotional support.



   Potential voters are likely to register when they understand how democracy should work and envision themselves participating. The voter registration/education component of these activations align with LA2050’s work to increase participation in the political process, and will help it reach its target of 75% of Angelenos voting often in local elections, as well as impact government responsiveness to residents’ needs.
