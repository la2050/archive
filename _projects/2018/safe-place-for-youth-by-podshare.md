  Currently, there are thousands of young people on the streets of LA fighting
  to survive. They are creative, resilient, generous, powerful and represent
  immeasurable untapped talent. County-wide efforts to address homelessness are
  critical to systemic shift, yet community level interventions have tangible
  impact on neighborhood culture, connectedness, safety and health. By taking a
  local approach to addressing youth homelessness and leveraging key
  organizational skill sets, Podshare and Safe Place for Youth (SPY) are poised
  to take on youth homelessness in West LA, improving the lives of housed and
  unhoused Angelenos alike.
   
   
   
   The vast majority of homeless adults, first experience homelessness in their teens and early 20’s. If stabilized early, time spent on the streets can be brief and non-recurring. However, without intervention, today’s homeless youth go on to become tomorrow’s chronically homeless adults, with deeply exacerbated medical, mental health and emotional scars due to extended trauma of life on the streets. This activation seeks to break that pipeline to chronic homelessness by meaningfully engaging young people in safe, youth- friendly, easily- accessible temporary housing. In doing so, we will show impact along the following metrics:
   
   
   
   Homelessness. With enough pods to shelter 20 young people each night, “SPY by Podshare” will move 50-250 individuals off the streets each year. This provides immediate safety and respite while significantly decreasing the likelihood that those individuals will become chronically homeless adults, impacting ~1,600 to ~8,000 people by the year 2050.
   
   
   
   Mental Illness. Youth experiencing homelessness deal with complex mental health concerns related to disconnection from family, histories of abuse and neglect, grief, isolation, and criminalization. Yet less than 6% of SPY youth report mental health concerns as a contributing factor to their homelessness. With onsite staffing and services available, guests will receive the care they need, preventing them from becoming part of the nearly 30% of chronically homeless adults with serious mental illness in LA County. 
   
   
   
   Resilient Communities. Engaging the housed community in local responses to homelessness allows for deeper social connectedness, greater feelings of community pride and ownership, and humanization and empathy-building for those living outside. We will measure community resilience year over year through the number of volunteers participating in our programs and pre and post questionnaires regarding measures of connectedness for both guests and volunteers.
   
   
   
   Youth unemployment/underemployment. After housing, connection to jobs is the most requested service from youth at SPY. With a strong track record of engaging hundreds of youth in employment programming each year, this activation will ensure that guests are provided ample opportunity to find meaningful work and are offered metro passes and bus tokens to increase work transit accessibility.
