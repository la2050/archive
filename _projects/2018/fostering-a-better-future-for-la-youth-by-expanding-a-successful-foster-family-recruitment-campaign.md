  With state-level reforms taking place, the need for foster parents in Los
  Angeles County is at crisis level. With this in mind, our team of
  communications experts conducted research and focus groups to develop a
  winning, digital campaign to recruit foster parents and mentors, while at the
  same time reintroducing viewers to the potential of foster youth.
   
   In a new approach for the field, FosterMore uses21st century techniques to engage people in the lives of youth in care. This kind of specific targeting works at two levels—at best we have recruited a new person to actively support foster youth, while at the same time we have promoted the larger mission of FosterMore, to change hearts and minds, reducing stigmas for foster youth. 
   
   In 2016, we ran a pilot campaign which produced 133 leads for local agencies at a cost of roughly $68 per lead. To build upon that success, the online media buy began employing predictive analytics and big data to provide accuracy and effectiveness. In 2017, armed with the latest in digital targeting and additional creative content, we produced over 1,800 leads and referred 260 prospective foster parents for just $26,000 (or $14/lead). 
   
   The campaign messaging features uplifting stories of individuals and families whose lives were positively impacted by foster care. Set to the One Direction hit song “The Story of My Life” with voiceover provided by Emmy winning actor Ty Burrell, the moving ads received a prestigious Cynopsis Social Good Award for best ad over 30 seconds and earned FosterMore a commendation from the County Board of Supervisors.
   
   The funds from the LA2050 grant will enable us to continue this campaign for two additional years, reaching and connecting with 500,000 Angelenos, who will view the content during the run of the campaign. Using a conservative estimate, the funding will also generate interest in foster parent opportunities from over 10,000 County residents.
