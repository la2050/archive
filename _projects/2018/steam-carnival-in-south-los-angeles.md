  Our STEAM Carnival opens the door to students understanding that the games
  they play every day are filled by a variety of careers. Coders, narrative
  writers, musicians, and film-makers all take part in the creation. We engage
  students in hands-on play and 'making' without letting them know the purpose
  is to learn. 
   
   If we tell students we are going to teach them how sound is created, and we supply a lecture with all the correct information, they will take notes and remember some of what was said. If we have them take apart a speaker, and then make a working headset, they will remember forever how they made sound come out of that headset. 
   
   We supply the games, the opportunity to code, and prototype. We supply tons of random materials and give prompts to what they might make, but we don't supply directions. By doing this we build critical and creative problem solvers.
   
   Most of the children in school today, (65% according to government statistics) will work in jobs that don't yet exist. The only way to prepare them for those jobs is to make sure they can think their way out of a problem, have confidence that they can solve those problems, and in this way, build their self-image as creative problem solvers ready to take on whatever is thrown their way.
   
   Every child who attends the STEAM Carnival will leave with an understanding of their future potential through the act of play.
