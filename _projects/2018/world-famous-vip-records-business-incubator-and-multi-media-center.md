  In 1978 World Famous VIP Records was opened in Long Beach , CA. In the 90s,

   For 40 year, a sign called the VIP sign sat on top of the store and most recently that sign became a Historic Landmark, making the only one of its kind in the world but the sign has been put in storage until we secure a home to open a museum.



   This has been a major loss for Long beach and tourist from around the world to came to see the sign.



   In the meantime, to keep the brand alive and to help create economic opportunities, we have secured a building on long beach blvd. which we currently need assistance in activating



    The space is about 5000 sq feet and another 2000 in the back of open space.



   Our plan is to open a business incubator and multi media center , music recording radio station and retail store in the front.

   Outside Design



   A replica VIP sign, from snoop doggs, first video will anchor the building, as seen in the attached image.



   Although the sign is no longer that color, the replica represents the ara that the young artists got their start in the 90s and gives the center a unique draw.



   We will be working to also assist entrepreneurs with financing through programs like Kiva and a partnership with the City of Long Beach.



   Community Engagement



   On going music, small business and other creative contests will be launched from the center to engage the community and to continue to foster engagement.



   Our open space, will be made available to non profits in our communities for meeting and event space to allow them the ability to collaborate and serve the health and well being of our communities.
