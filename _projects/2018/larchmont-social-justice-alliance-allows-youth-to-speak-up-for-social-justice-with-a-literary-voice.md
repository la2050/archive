  As the world has seen, high school students in Parkland, Florida, have made
  their community, and the world, a better place. Florida is notoriously
  gun-friendly place, yet the students were able to lead common-sense gun law
  reform when their voices were raised and heard. Larchmont Charter School
  believes student voices need to be raised and heard on social justice issues
  in Los Angeles. Our student population is 40% low income, and we serve
  students from all over the city. They KNOW what poverty is, and are confronted
  by its confines every day. Larchmont Charter School, a grades K- 12 school,
  has established itself as one of the top performing public schools in Los
  Angeles. Unique among public charter networks in our focus on racial, ethnic,
  and socio-economic diversity, Larchmont Charter School aims to provide a
  richly diverse community of students with a high quality public education.
  Social justice is woven into the mission of our school, and who better to
  rally youthful members of the community to fight injustice but our students?
  The Larchmont Social Justice Alliance will pivot from this deeply held value
  system into an activist platform. Joining student voices toward social
  justice, our Poetry Slam Competition (already a prominent feature in our
  curriculum and in student life in the upper grades) will support a new level
  of community activism. Our students can reach more students through guided use
  of social media, events, civic-minded field trips, and historical perspective
  on the importance of politics. We want to empower young members of the
  community with literary avenues for their voices, as well as rallies, service
  learning, and spoken word. This alliance seeks to use the power of student
  voices for social change. Homelessness, environmental degradation, and
  immigration are 3 issues that affect our population. Those are 3 among many
  our students want to improve. We plan to measure how many new students are
  reached with a pro-change message, how many new members of the community join
  us, and what impact we have in the community through social media analytics
  and surveys. We are happy to join the initiatives of My LA2050 to drive a
  strong, united, youth-driven message for social justice.
