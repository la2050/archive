  Brady’s strategic campaign to stop “bad apple” gun dealers engages local
  residents, local Brady chapter members, and community-based organizations to
  take meaningful action to end gun violence in Los Angeles. 
   
   
   
   Chronic gun violence has a devastating impact on community health. There were 470 gun homicides in Los Angeles County over the past 12 months, according to the Los Angeles Times. Such tragedies are often the result of guns getting into the hands of people who should not have them, such as gun traffickers, convicted felons, domestic abusers, and people with a dangerous mental illness. Though these prohibited purchasers are not able to pass a Brady background check as required by law at federally licensed firearm dealers, they may obtain guns through “bad apple” gun dealers. These gun dealers knowingly ignore the law and engage in irresponsible business practices just to make a profit. The most recent Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) data shows that nationally, 90 percent of crime guns are sold by only 5 percent of gun dealers. These “bad apples” supply nearly the entire U.S. criminal gun market. 
   
   
   
   While California has some of the strongest gun laws in the U.S., the safety of Californians is dramatically compromised by the impact of “bad apple” gun dealers. Most California crime guns come from “bad apple” dealers in-state. Out of the 39,034 crime guns recovered in California in 2016, for which the source was identified, 67 percent were traced to California dealers. 
   
   
   
   “Bad apple” gun dealers facilitate the flow of crime guns into vulnerable communities. These dealers knowingly or negligently skirt the law and endanger communities. For example, they may allow someone to “straw purchase” a gun on behalf of another person, typically someone who cannot pass a Brady background check. Or they may sell dozens or hundreds of the same type of gun to the same person in a short time. These purchasers are often trafficking guns to criminals. “Bad apple” gun dealers may also sell guns “off the books” that they then claim were lost or stolen. These purchasers are often people who could not pass a Brady background check or do not want a record of the sale. 
   
   
   
   We take a city-based, supply-side approach in stemming the flow of crime guns into vulnerable Los Angeles communities by reforming or shutting down the “bad apple” gun dealers who knowingly or negligently sell guns to prohibited purchasers. Brady convenes and coordinates a wide array of partners including law enforcement, the legal community, researchers, the media, and community-based organizations to: 1) identify and name “bad apple” gun dealers, 2) wage public, legal, and economic pressure to shut down or reform “bad apple” gun dealers, and 3) encourage sensible practices by responsible gun dealers.
   
   
   
   Ultimately this work will reduce gun violence and increase public safety by reducing access to guns by those who would use them in crime.
