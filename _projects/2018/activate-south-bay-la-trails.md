  Trails can transform areas, bringing diverse populations together from
  neighboring communities, and promote and support healthier lifestyles. Trails
  make regional assets available to populations that otherwise might not derive
  benefit. Physical activity becomes accessible to the widest range of people,
  including persons with disabilities and others who are known to be less
  physically active. Trails provides an amenity open to residents of every age.


  Walking, Running and Biking are fun and green, curbing our carbon footprints,
  reducing air pollution and our reliance on fossil fuels. The momentum for
  active transportation is building, thanks in no small part to completion of
  the South Bay Bicycle Master Plan. Active transportation is perceived by more
  and more as a safe way to get outdoors and have fun!


  For example, if by answering the call to join in on the fun ACTIVATE SOUTH BAY
  LA TRAILS! residents begin to support City infrastructure that supports
  pedestrian and cycling activities, then when an issue comes up in a City
  related to that, they are empowered to speak out in the public forum.


  Expanding uses of linear paths will help us meet our primary goal of
  augmenting access to space to PLAY in the our urban environment. Since we
  suffer from a low ratio of park acres per thousand residents (critically
  underserved in some South Bay Cities), trails are a component of the solution.
  Seniors, adults, families and children need the benefit of playtime. Having
  greater access to trails will expand available play spaces, regardless of age.
  The importance of intergenerational connections is generally acknowledged.
  Although not defined as park space, trails will help to increase the
  opportunities for residents of all ages to meet in their pedestrian and
  cycling activities.


  Activating the trail system will bolster the walk/bike/transit scores for
  every neighborhood along the way. The Walk Score offers an answer to two
  important questions. "What can I do to improve my personal health?" and "What
  can I do to improve the health of the planet?" Furthermore, living a walkable
  or bikable lifestyle means rush hour traffic becomes less relevant. It is well
  documented that real estate values are higher in neighborhoods with higher
  scores.


  ACTIVATE SOUTH BAY LA TRAILS! Impacts positively on CONNECT and LIVE
  activation through communication on the project website, newsletter, twitter,
  Instagram and other social media platforms this project will expand residentsâ€™
  social media contacts and connections around something that is valuable to
  all: PLAY! Social interaction can start when they join in for scheduled
  volunteer efforts. Activating the public for various events can start the
  development of social interaction among the residents of five South Cities.
  Activating the Trails for gatherings will strengthen the social fabric of the
  area.
