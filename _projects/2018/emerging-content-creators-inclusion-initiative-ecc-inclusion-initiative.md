  Minorities and women have registered gains in several key areas of television
  but remained disproportionately represented in most areas of the entertainment
  industry, according to the 2018 Hollywood Diversity Report by UCLA. This year,
  there has been an impact of diverse representation as seen through films like
  Coco, Black Panther & Ava Duvernay’s A Wrinkle in Time in the box office
  figures and viewer ratings. America’s audience demand for inclusivity has
  resonated throughout the entertainment industry and we’re seeing the shift in
  the growing need for content creators to create more of these inclusive
  stories. By the year 2050, minorities will become the majority and for Los
  Angeles’ biggest industries, the need not only for diverse stories in
  entertainment but a more inclusive workforce, is imminent. Since it’s
  inception, NALIP’s mission is to advance Latinx content creators and their
  careers by providing resources and guidance in order to provide more accurate
  representation behind the camera, from producers to directors to even those
  just starting their career. With the Emerging Content Creator Inclusion
  Initiative, NALIP aims to support ALL creators from diverse backgrounds in
  preparing them to enter the media workforce. The Emerging Content Creators
  Inclusion Initiative will help make a LA the best place to create by providing
  access to college ready youth and those interested in media opportunities to
  learn and prepare for the entertainment industry workforce. It is intended to
  be an informative step by step guide for young content creators to
  successfully transition into the industry through forums, networking,
  mentoring, summer programs, workshops, and funding college-entry projects. Top
  industry professionals will share their insights and experience, along with
  some of their biggest challenges. Through the physical, and digital platforms
  NALIP will provide, the ECC Inclusion Initiative will reach over 100,000
  Angelenos and promote the advancement of emerging talent, reach youth and
  create awareness. With the support from LA2050, the Emerging Content Creators
  Inclusion Initiative will be able to stand as its own program by funding
  additional staff, supporting the production of workshops, digital team,
  funding production of projects as well as aid in leveraging NALIP’s industry
  partners such as CAA, Youtube, CBS, Google, and more by providing participants
  access to mentorship/job opportunities after undergoing the program. The
  initiative will aid in bridging the gap between diverse content creators and
  the media companies that need them, creating more opportunities for
  underrepresented communities as well as providing more representation in the
  media landscape. As a result of the ECC Inclusion Initiative, college ready
  youth will be able to gain access to resources in regards to both film/media
  universities and serve as a pipeline to the entertainment job market in Los
  Angeles to give a more diverse, equitable, and creative Los Angeles.
