  Minorities and women have registered gains in several key areas of television
  but remained disproportionately represented in most areas of the entertainment
  industry, according to the 2018 Hollywood Diversity Report by UCLA. This year,
  there has been an impact of diverse representation as seen through films like
  Coco, Black Panther & Ava Duvernay’s A Wrinkle in Time in the box office
  figures and viewer ratings. America’s audience demand for inclusivity has
  resonated throughout the entertainment industry and we’re seeing the shift in
  the growing need for content creators to create more of these inclusive
  stories. By the year 2050, minorities will become the majority and for Los
  Angeles’ biggest industries, the need not only for diverse stories in
  entertainment but a more inclusive workforce, is imminent. Since it’s
  inception, NALIP’s mission is to advance Latinx content creators and their
  careers by providing resources and guidance in order to provide more accurate
  representation behind the camera, from producers to directors to even those
  just starting their career. With the Emerging Content Creator Inclusion
  Initiative, NALIP aims to support ALL creators from diverse backgrounds in
  preparing them to enter the media workforce. The Emerging Content Creators
  Inclusion Initiative will help make a LA the best place to create by providing
  access to college ready youth and those interested in media opportunities to
  learn and prepare for the entertainment industry workforce. It is intended to
  be an informative step by step guide for young content creators to
  successfully transition into the industry through forums, networking,
  mentoring, summer programs, workshops, and funding college-entry projects. Top
  industry professionals will share their insights and experience, along with
  some of their biggest challenges. Through the physical, and digital platforms
  NALIP will provide, the ECC Inclusion Initiative will reach over 100,000
  Angelenos and promote the advancement of emerging talent, reach youth and
  create awareness. With the support from LA2050, the Emerging Content Creators
  Inclusion Initiative will be able to stand as its own program by funding
  additional staff, supporting the production of workshops, digital team,
  funding production of projects as well as aid in leveraging NALIP’s industry
  partners such as CAA, Youtube, CBS, Google, and more by providing participants
  access to mentorship/job opportunities after undergoing the program. The
  initiative will aid in bridging the gap between diverse content creators and
  the media companies that need them, creating more opportunities for
  underrepresented communities as well as providing more representation in the
  media landscape. As a result of the ECC Inclusion Initiative, college ready
  youth will be able to gain access to resources in regards to both film/media
  universities and serve as a pipeline to the entertainment job market in Los
  Angeles to give a more diverse, equitable, and creative Los Angeles.

  This past year has seen not only impactful changes in the entertainment
  industry but a strong push for a more inclusive and diverse media ecosystem.
  Recognizing this need for a more diverse media workforce, the Emerging Content
  Creators Inclusion Initiative aims to provide a bridge in the gap between
  college ready youth/graduates and available jobs for them. Our goal is to
  train, develop, and offer additional resources in order to be able to provide
  a pipeline of talent to companies & studios.

  The Emerging Content Creator Inclusion Initiative seeks to provide
  opportunities to youth from underrepresented communities to explore a career
  that they would not have considered because of the lack of exposure in their
  communities. NALIP aims to provide support through:
   
   
   
   Forums
   
   Networking
   
   Mentoring
   
   Summer programs
   
   Workshops
   
   Funding college-entry projects
   
   
   
   This activation targets urban youth that have limited access to knowledge of the entertainment industry. The workshops will be offered not only where the entertainment hub of LA but also offered in South LA, East LA, and extremities as well. 
   
   The Initiative does not only engage college ready youth/graduates in being creative but also engages Angelenos already in the industry to provide additional support and help pave the way for those to come. We’ve had great success from our Latino Lens Workshop Series in bringing professionals in digital producing, VR/AR experience, writing for both tv/film, & showrunning with positive impact on our members from which we wish to extend to those wanting to pursue a career in media through this Initiative. Through our interaction and digital platforms over 100,000 Angelenos will be exposed to our Initiative and engage with us. The ECC Inclusion Initiative will be highlighted and enforced within NALIP’s annual events, Social Media, Newsletter and beyond, including collaborating and partnering with organizations to enhance, engage and advance the mission of the initiative.
project_five_years: >-
  We hope this activation is a continuous program in ensuring a pipeline of
  talent from diverse talent into the media workforce. In five years NALIP looks
  to advance and grow the program to reach additional youth across high schools,
  colleges and a resource for recent graduates to continue with their
  development. We look for these type of resources to be implemented as part of
  school, summer school and after school program curriculums in order to grow
  the numbers of ready college students interested in being part of the
  entertainment industry and becoming the next generation of storytellers with
  diverse voices.
