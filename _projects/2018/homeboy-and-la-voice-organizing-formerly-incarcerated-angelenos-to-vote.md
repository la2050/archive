  In the state of California, individuals with a criminal record have the right
  to vote if they are not currently in a state or federal prison or on parole
  for a felony conviction. Not every state has the same voting rights, leading
  to a lot of confusion or misinformation when it comes to voting rights. As a
  result, far too many eligible voters who are deeply impacted by the policies
  passed by our elected officials are not being represented in our elections.
  Homeboy Industries, with thousands of formerly gang-involved and previously
  incarcerated individuals coming through their doors annually, and LA Voice,
  with their experience turning out tens of thousands of underrepresented voters
  to the polls, are ideally situated to address this problem. 
   
   
   
   Voter turnout among the formerly incarcerated population is generally very low due in large part to a lack of information and misinformation about voting rights, socioeconomic factors, and community narratives of voting being worthless. Yet Homeboy Industries and LA Voice have seen through previous collaborations that when this segment of the community organizes, change happens. 
   
   
   
   Our idea for the LA2050 activation grant was sparked by this question: How much more could we achieve for Los Angeles if every formerly incarcerated Angeleno were civically engaged?
   
   
   
   With nearly 50 years of combined experience, Homeboy Industries and LA Voice’s models are complementary in serving the reentry population and organizing for civic engagement and voting. In 1986 when Homeboy’s founder Father Greg Boyle began serving in Boyle Heights, Los Angeles was regarded as the gang capital of the world. At the time, law enforcement tactics of suppression and criminal justice policies of mass incarceration were the prevailing means to deal with gang violence leading to hundreds of thousands of individuals serving time in California correctional institutions. Today, Homeboy is the largest gang intervention, rehab and reentry program in the world. The Homeboy model emphasizes true transformation combining therapeutic and support services with the goal that no one would recidivate and that everyone would have improved social connectedness. 
   
   
   
   For the last three elections, LA Voice has organized voter engagement efforts led and staffed by formerly incarcerated leaders who educated their own communities on ballot measures and encouraged their communities to vote. If our idea is funded, Homeboy and LA Voice together will turn these efforts into a year-round movement of formerly incarcerated leaders who educate their community in a non-partisan way to impact their communities, change the criminal justice system, and engage with other poverty-related policies by increasing their collective voice in the halls of power.
