  Nuestros Murales Unidos will paint five neighborhoods in Central Los Angeles
  with public art, fostering connection through a collective process and
  depictions of community pride in public space. We will work in Pico-Union and
  Westlake, bringing the community together to choose five areas to turn into a
  “museum mile,” each featuring 2-4 murals. YPI’s Community Engagement
  Coordinator will work closely with local artists, including YPI’s partner Juan
  Reyes, to activate residents and work together towards designs that showcase
  community identity and resilience. We will distribute a community feedback
  form through local schools, YPI afterschool programs, and door-to-door
  canvassing to get widespread input. Reyes will use this input to make an
  initial design, which will be available for public review. Parents who are
  active on YPI’s Safe Routes to School Task Forces will be engaged to give
  input and activate their friends and family to participate in the mural
  process. Once a design is finalized, volunteers will work with Reyes at a
  community event to prepare the wall and paint the mural. The Museum Miles will
  activate community members at every stage of the process, offering volunteer
  opportunities and culminating in a large community cultural event in a public
  space.
   
   Nuestros Murales Unidos will also create a summer program for local students to participate in beautification. The program will be run by the Community Engagement Coordinator and held each weekday for an hour. Students will work with local businesses to talk about the appearance of their storefront, offering to repaint shabby exterior walls with simple designs or place decorated potted plants outside. The summer program will activate the next generation of community leaders, empowering students with a sense of responsibility to their community and the tools to take action. Parents and community members will be encouraged to help with designing and creating these smaller works.
   
   Throughout the process, we will work with community members and partner organizations to kick off a social media campaign using the artworks as a focal point for community pride. #MuralesUnidos and #OurMurals will give this project a unified online presence, and carry connections created through the design process online. Angelenos across the city will be connected to the art through Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, and encouraged to start similar projects in their own communities. By offering meaningful volunteer opportunities and cultural events in community spaces, YPI hopes to provide resources for these communities to come together and create something that truly represents them. The collaborative murals will serve as a visual representation of the community’s pride and resilience, as well as the power of collective action. These works—chosen, designed, and painted by locals—will reclaim streets as a collaborative public space, a canvas for public engagement led by a new generation of community leaders.
