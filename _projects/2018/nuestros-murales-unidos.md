project_proposal_description: >-
  Nuestros Murales Unidos will activate communities in Pico-Union and Westlake
  to beautify neighborhoods and unite people through public art, working with
  local residents and artists to design and paint murals. A summer youth program
  will work with local businesses to revitalize storefronts, while motivating
  the next generation of leaders. These works—designed and painted by
  locals—will connect the community in a collective process and reclaim streets
  as a collaborative public space.

  Nuestros Murales Unidos will paint five neighborhoods in Central Los Angeles
  with public art, fostering connection through a collective process and
  depictions of community pride in public space. We will work in Pico-Union and
  Westlake, bringing the community together to choose five areas to turn into a
  “museum mile,” each featuring 2-4 murals. YPI’s Community Engagement
  Coordinator will work closely with local artists, including YPI’s partner Juan
  Reyes, to activate residents and work together towards designs that showcase
  community identity and resilience. We will distribute a community feedback
  form through local schools, YPI afterschool programs, and door-to-door
  canvassing to get widespread input. Reyes will use this input to make an
  initial design, which will be available for public review. Parents who are
  active on YPI’s Safe Routes to School Task Forces will be engaged to give
  input and activate their friends and family to participate in the mural
  process. Once a design is finalized, volunteers will work with Reyes at a
  community event to prepare the wall and paint the mural. The Museum Miles will
  activate community members at every stage of the process, offering volunteer
  opportunities and culminating in a large community cultural event in a public
  space.
   
   Nuestros Murales Unidos will also create a summer program for local students to participate in beautification. The program will be run by the Community Engagement Coordinator and held each weekday for an hour. Students will work with local businesses to talk about the appearance of their storefront, offering to repaint shabby exterior walls with simple designs or place decorated potted plants outside. The summer program will activate the next generation of community leaders, empowering students with a sense of responsibility to their community and the tools to take action. Parents and community members will be encouraged to help with designing and creating these smaller works.
   
   Throughout the process, we will work with community members and partner organizations to kick off a social media campaign using the artworks as a focal point for community pride. #MuralesUnidos and #OurMurals will give this project a unified online presence, and carry connections created through the design process online. Angelenos across the city will be connected to the art through Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, and encouraged to start similar projects in their own communities. By offering meaningful volunteer opportunities and cultural events in community spaces, YPI hopes to provide resources for these communities to come together and create something that truly represents them. The collaborative murals will serve as a visual representation of the community’s pride and resilience, as well as the power of collective action. These works—chosen, designed, and painted by locals—will reclaim streets as a collaborative public space, a canvas for public engagement led by a new generation of community leaders.
project_proposal_engage: >-
  Nuestros Murales Unidos will create a clear path of engagement, moving from
  social media interaction to campaigning for change at neighborhood council
  meetings. The first step will be activating people online, targeting Angelenos
  countywide to like or share social media posts about the art. The project will
  activate the local community to post original content about the artworks,
  including pictures and descriptions of how the art represents them.
  #MuralesUnidos and #OurMurals will unite content in an online community, and
  all promotional materials will use the hashtag.
   
   
   
   The summer program will activate students, administrators, and local business owners, creating partnerships for neighborhood beautification. Business owners will be key stakeholders, and encouraged to engage in other aspects of the project.
   
   
   
   Local residents will be activated to participate in designing and painting the murals. Bilingual forms will be sent out to students and families, and staff will canvas to widen the project’s reach. This process will emphasize community ownership of the project, and lead to large volunteer turnout at mural creation events.
   
   
   
   In each neighborhood, we will encourage those who are most passionate to join together in a Task Force that will canvas for community input, rally friends and family to attend events, and campaign for any needed City approval. The Task Force will receive capacity-building training to attend neighborhood council meetings and lead the charge for change.

  Activation will be tracked at each level of engagement to reach the goal of
  involving 100,000 Angelenos. Social media impressions for posts by YPI, as
  well as all related content with #MuralesUnidos and #OurMurals will be tracked
  weekly, and compiled into Excel sheets that will be analyzed quarterly to
  determine progress.
   
   YPI will track the number of completed community feedback surveys, flyers given to students and families, and community members volunteering at mural events. These numbers will be analyzed in quarterly STAT Reports that track progress towards annual outcomes. Nuestros Murales Unidos will aim to reach 100 community members through canvassing, give flyers to 400 students, and engage 100 volunteers in each area.
   
   Additionally, YPI will track the number of student participants in Nuestros Murales Unidos summer program through enrollment forms, with a goal of enrolling 100 students over two years. Students will activate business owners, whose activation will be tracked by the Community Engagement Coordinator. The Community Engagement Coordinator will also be responsible for tracking the number of community members activated in each Task Force, with a goal of 20 community members in total.
   
   
   
   Successful activation will be defined by a community-driven process and murals made by and for local residents. Our vision of success also includes a widespread social media campaign that will activate Angelenos across the county to reach the goal of engaging 100,000 people.
project_five_years: >-
  Nuestros Murales Unidos is only the beginning: in five years, we hope this
  project will inspire communities across Los Angeles to come together and
  revitalize their neighborhoods. We envision collaborative public art as a
  gateway to more community campaigns, led by engaged community leaders who
  received capacity-building training from Nuestros Murales Unidos. Students
  activated through our summer program will grow up with a sense of
  responsibility for their community and lead the drive for change. We hope that
  murals in Pico-Union and Westlake will make the neighborhoods as visually
  vibrant as the communities that live there. Residents will take pride in where
  they live and work together towards a shared vision of the future.
