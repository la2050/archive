  Play LA! is a three-day participatory event focused on activating LA County
  residents of all races, incomes, and neighborhoods to play and be engaged and
  informed in advancing LA’s park equity issues. Without addressing our park and
  open space inequities, we cannot make LA the best place to play by 2050.
   
   
   
   The first two days of the event will bring together between 500-700 community residents, designers, educators, innovators and policy-makers representing a range of multi-disciplinary issue areas including parks and open space, health, housing, transportation, and design to create a Play! Vision for LA County that ensures everyone has access to free and safe places to play by 2050. The event will conclude with a county-wide play day that includes opportunities for residents from around the region to get outside and play in our parks, streets and open spaces! 
   
   
   
   The event will start with a Park Equity Summit led by community members highlighting the racial and environmental injustices that have led to LA’s inequitable park access. Inequalities in the allocation of park and recreation resources will be shared through the perspectives of community leaders’ lived experiences. Elected officials, CBOs, academics, and school districts, including LAUSD and agency staff, will be on hand to hear community members outline problems and define solutions for park equity. Day one will conclude with a community vision for a healthy and equitable LA County and offer ideas to inform discussions on day two.
   
   
   
   The second day of workshop sessions will engage leaders from cities around the globe in participatory conversations with local stakeholders. These sessions will draw on successful park equity solutions, with participants working across sectors, backgrounds, and experience to generate new solutions to advance park equity and help inform the conversation and shape best practices for LA County. Participants in these sessions will be accountable to community-identified problems developed in day one. 
   
   
   
   The final day of the event is a countywide celebration of the power of play, including hundreds of play-based events throughout greater LA County. The three lead partners will work with agencies, institutions, businesses, and CBOs to inspire and organize play-based events in parks and public spaces around the region, transforming greater LA into a veritable playground. Residents will be welcomed and encouraged to participate in guided activities in local parks, and will experience the reimagination of public spaces into vibrant and safe informal spaces for play (street closures, sidewalk events, activities in plazas, etc.). Park access will be highlighted throughout the day as our team arranges and encourages alternate modes of transportation, including transit to trails programs that provide free transportation from park poor areas to open spaces.
