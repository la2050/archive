  Entrepreneurs are a crucial component of a vibrant and thriving California;
  they employ nearly half the private sector workforce and create two-thirds of
  all new jobs. As anchors of their communities, they create opportunity in
  disadvantaged communities, strengthen local economies and revitalize
  neighborhoods. They are critical partners in the work to reduce inequality and
  expand opportunity for all.

   To make LA the best place to create, we will support local entrepreneurs through our Entrepreneurship Program, which delivers education and resources that small business owners need to launch and run a successful business. Focused on supporting women, minority and other underserved entrepreneurs, the program has quickly expanded throughout the LA area, accompanied by national webinars and educational websites. The program includes seminars and resources in English and Spanish on topics such as access to capital, healthcare, retirement security and asset-building.

   Key elements include:

   * Access to capital: One of the biggest challenges facing entrepreneurs and small business owners continues to be the inability to access credit and capital. We provide education on how to find responsible lenders, avoid predatory lending traps, improve a credit score and access capital through non-traditional methods like crowdfunding. This education is particularly important for women and minority entrepreneurs, who are more likely to be denied a traditional loan than their white male counterparts.

   * Access to healthcare: We believe that every person has the right to quality, affordable and equitable healthcare. We help small employers explore their options to access affordable healthcare coverage for themselves and their employees.

   * Women entrepreneurs: Despite many gains, gender inequality continues to heavily impact women entrepreneurs. LA is the pilot city for our new Women’s Entrepreneurship program, specifically designed to educate women business owners about their networking, mentorship and procurement options. We educate women on obtaining certification as a woman-owned business, resources to meet their childcare needs and accessing the capital necessary to start and grow their businesses.

   * Venturize.org: This online platform provides education and resources for small business owners seeking loans, while also offering more in-depth resources such as business planning and financial management tools. We are expanding this platform to LA, engaging partner organizations to share its resources, and developing a feature to connect entrepreneurs with local, in-person support to help them grow their businesses and create good jobs in their communities.

   * Ecosystem mapping: A small business ecosystem comprises the local organizations that offer low- or no-cost assistance to small businesses. Our in-depth mapping of LA-area lenders and business assistance organizations allows us to easily refer small business owners to trusted partners for in-person assistance.
