  LA's inner-city vulnerable youth connecting them to STEM education and The
  Arts. LA historically reflects the cultural diversity of all people and
  because of generations of its residents, LA has remained the best place to
  connect, learn, play, create and live. 
   
   
   
   BGCV will connect vulnerable youth, peers, families, educators, to intergenerational volunteers and mentors to become more integrated in shared values collaboratively. 
   
   
   
   STEM and The Arts ingratiates the need for BGCV to engage youth and intergenerational volunteers and mentors through five core areas of focus: Education & Career Development; Character & Leadership; Health & Life Skills; The Arts & Music; and Sports, Recreation & Fitness.

BGCV will interweave the historical nuances of all communities throughout Los Angeles connecting the grace of differences as the foundation to elevate the bridge of generations by connecting values for sustainable voices to resonate.
   
   
   
   Vulnerable youth have inherent desires to gain access to skills or support necessary to break the cycle of poverty. STEM and The Arts are two paths that offer opportunity to increase transformation of youth and their families providing the tools required and opportunity become educated and skilled to perform better in these areas. additionally, matriculation through the educational system will denote measurable outcomes to direct youth toward greater futures in LA. BGCV project will contribute to closing the gap of programs or access of vulnerable youth so they can confidently express that LA is the best place to gain STEM education, live and work. 
   
   
   
   Youth empowerment and intergenerational mentoring will have an elevated educational, cultural, and sustained generational significance for LA beyond 2050. Learning, Creating, Playing, Connecting and Living require layers of educators, community and business professionals, LA government and philanthropic personal and professional investment.
