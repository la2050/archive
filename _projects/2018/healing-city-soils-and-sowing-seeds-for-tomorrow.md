  We intend to co-create with our partners learning environments that transform
  people, place, and community through collaborative efforts directed to healing
  our city soils, growing good food, and designing educational experiences that
  lead to meaningful work, career exploration, and entrepreneur empowerment. 
   
   
   
   DISTRICT-WIDE GRADUATION RATES improve when students and families feel connected to their school, teachers, and other personnel. Our school-based healing gardens and compost hubs connect young people and their families with the earth and her bounty, providing almost immediate tangible rewards for their physical effort, routine attendance, and mindful presence. The collective effort required to manage a school builds social cohesion and acts as the glue that holds together a community of learners together that support and care for one another as they support and care for their plants. Gardening and compost curriculum aligned to academic content in science, technology, engineering, art and math creates "Aha!" moments with promising potential to the bridge learning gap, motivate learners, and promote success in school. In sum, academic success, meaningful connections to school and peers, and strong community of learners can drive up school graduation rates.
   
   
   
   PROFICIENCY IN ENGLISH, LANGUAGE ARTS, AND MATH are supported by Proyecto Jardin's gardening and composting curriculum. Participants maintain garden journals and compost logs to track inputs, outputs, record observations, and summarize outcomes. They measure, weigh, illustrate, and write to describe, reflect, analyze, synthesize, report, and share. Proyecto Jardin works closely with a school site teacher(s) to align the organization's garden/compost education program to the specific needs of participating classroom(s) and school-wide goals and objectives. Our outdoor garden/compost "classrooms" at schools sites and in public parks rely on hands-on, experiential learning, adding a tangible quality to abstract academic concepts. 
   
   
   
   YOUTH EMPLOYMENT & UNDEREMPLOYMENT are addressed through meaningful education that can lead to meaningful work as a Certified Compost Maker or a community/school garden coordinator. Our Compost Academy is a comprehensive 8-week course that prepares individuals for entry-level employment as a compost hub manager, compost associate, or vermi-culture (worm farm) practitioner. 
   
   
   
   In addition, classes and workshops offered at Grand Park in collaboration with the Grand Park Foundation in conjunction with their Grand Park Rangers program provide a gateway to stewardship of the earth and promote individual commitment to care for, protect, and engage more deeply with their urban parks, green spaces, and nature.
