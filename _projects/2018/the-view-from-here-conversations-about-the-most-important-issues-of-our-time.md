  There are so many people who don’t know their neighbor’s views on immigration,
  and they are immigrants themselves. There are many couples who simply do not
  discuss gender equity. We have let ourselves become a society in which we
  avoid the difficult conversations in person for fear of intimacy and offense.
  Meanwhile, ignoring these problems only makes them worse. Members of
  marginalized groups suffer alone and silos of thought only grow more divided
  while the news reports half-truths that support biased thinking. Citizens Of
  Culture is an organization that uses art to develop critical thinking and
  emotional intelligence. With the support of LA2050 we will make LA the best
  place to CONNECT by pushing against these silos of cultural perspective with a
  multipart symposium to connect diverse groups.
   
   
   
   The project is presented in multiple phases over 2 years.
   
   Year 1: CALL: Conversation, outreach, and engagement. 
   
   Citizens of Culture will host 10-100person events bringing together Angelenos for intentional conversation. This means that 1,000 people in total will gather to discuss Racial Justice, Net Neutrality, Gender Equity, Technological Unemployment, Housing& Homelessness, Immigration, Religion/Spirituality, Economic Inequality, Climate Change, and Fake News/ Political Polarization.
   
   
   
   Each event will feature small groups of 10 to share stories, humanize each discussion , center individual impact on the larger topic, which is often missing from political debate. The stories and experiences shared here will be highlighted to the groups of 100 to speak on how these human stories may have hit home or shifted perspective. Recap videos of the events will model how face to face conversation can be used to build shared values and bring the discussions to larger audiences. Each clip will end with local organizations working on solutions that are accepting donations and volunteers.
   
   
   
   Year 2: RESPONSE: Collaboration, research and, practice.
   
   Another issue we see is that voting and calling are one of the only ways individuals can speak to institutions but both are individual pursuits. We need to draft consensus based suggestions that express public concerns to our schools, businesses, government, and cultural institutions, that answer 'What can be put into practice?" from our conversations. In the second year we will focus on 4 topics that were most engaged in from Year 1 and speak Truth to Power. The selected topics will comprise 4 cohorts to will convene in LA’s 4 corners North (NorthEast LA) South (South Los Angeles) East, (Hollywood, & Silverlake) and West ( Santa Monica, Venice). Each of these cohorts will reflect on the discussions from Year 1 and identify agreements or best practices that support modern etiquette and best practices for how the public would like to engage with institutions like government and business. These sessions will result in public letters as white papers and testimonial videos to be distributed directly to these institutions.
