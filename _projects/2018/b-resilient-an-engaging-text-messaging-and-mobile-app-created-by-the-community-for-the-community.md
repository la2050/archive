  UCLA Center for Health Services and Society collaborated with Healthy African
  American Families to develop B-RESILIENT, a resiliency-based mobile
  intervention for depression self-management using the Community-Partnered
  Participatory Approach to enhance mental health quality of life and to help
  improve patient engagement and outcomes for individuals living with mild to
  moderate depression. The B-RESILIENT texting intervention was born out of
  community and patient partnersâ€™ requests to increase the availability of
  coping resources used in Building Resiliency in Communities for Health
  (B-RICH)--a manualized, 7-week class led by lay health workers to introduce
  CBT concepts--that emerged as a key innovation in Community Partners in Care
  (CPIC). Consistent with tracking and building on community input and
  engagement in interventions, the present study uses the same community
  engagement approach to expand access and availability to core coping and
  symptom self-management resources as well as information on and encouragement
  to receive needed services, through a mobile platform (Chorus). Our
  B-RESILIENT intervention introduces and reinforces principles of
  Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) in order to support personal resiliency and
  reduce the risk for and impact of depressive symptoms and promote symptom
  self-management in response to multiple stressors in under-resourced
  communities of color. This app is a 30 day program where users will receive
  daily affirmations to start off their day and education on how to improve
  their mood ("boost"), reward themselves/enjoy activities ("break") and how to
  ask for support ("buddy") through interactive texts. After the 30 days, a user
  can convert to the mobile app to refer to as a guide if still needed. We then
  created a mobile web application in which participants followed-up on their
  experience with B-RESILIENT through surveys and also monitored their
  depression over one month to see the impact the B-RESILIENT app had. For this
  new iteration, we would like to expand the app to include content 7 days a
  week for one month instead of just doing the week. We would also like to make
  this app accessible to more populations in Los Angeles, especially
  under-resourced communities (ages 18 and over), in improving the mental health
  of more communities and how a person can better manage depressive symptoms. We
  would also like to add more features, such as creating professional videos to
  complement the text messages and provide more encouragement. We plan to add
  interactive features, such as fun games as a way to provide "breaks" and a
  simple distraction, daily mood ratings and tips for boosting low moods, and
  activity schedules. The previous piloting of the app made a positive impact on
  users, especially the daily affirmations and our biggest feedback was that
  users wanted more content.
