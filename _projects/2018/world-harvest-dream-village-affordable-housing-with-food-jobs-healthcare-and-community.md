  We all dream of living the village life, but we love our big city, too. The
  World Harvest Dream Village is a place where you can have it all: Affordable
  housing, groceries and restaurants, healthcare on site, jobs and job training,
  a maker space and small business incubator, a credit union with microloans,
  free bikes and Wi-Fi, multigenerational housing, artists-in-residence,
  community gardens, participatory budgeting projects, and other elements of a
  healthy, thriving, authentic village community — located in the big city. 
   
   
   
   We are not reinventing any wheels. These elements all pre-exist. Our innovation is to bring them together with affordable housing, which is made possible by the passage of County Measure H and City Proposition HHH, which provide funds to build affordable housing. We’ll stretch these dollars by bringing in additional partners to fund the build. Activating Angelenos to help plan this project will raise awareness that there is a better way to live, that we can live our dreams, and that it’s up to us to build it for ourselves. We can do it!
   
   
   
   Food, housing, and healthcare are the top three metrics addressed by the proposed project. Over a third of households in Central L.A. experience food insecurity, and a sixth experience hunger — among the highest rates in L.A. County. A combination of rising rents, barriers to building affordable housing, and stagnant wages has resulted in a humanitarian crisis of homelessness and housing insecurity. L.A.’s poorest residents pay more than half of their income to stay housed. Universal access to healthcare remains out of reach. The proposed project addresses these issues through a replicable, modular Dream Village model.
   
   
   
   Operating almost entirely without grant funding for nearly ten years, World Harvest social supermarket has a proven capacity for managing complex projects. In addition to serving 50,000 clients annually on a self-sustaining budget, we provide many tons a week of high-quality diverted waste food on demand to clients like the L.A. Zoo and reentry transitional housing agencies. 
   
   
   
   With the award of LA2050 Activation Challenge funding, the World Harvest Dream Village will lead a two-year activation in collaboration with the city, the county, our neighborhood council, neighborhood residents, and future residents of our dream village. AltaMed will help plan the Dream Village health clinic design. ADX will help plan the maker space and small business incubator. Participation in the planning process will activate Angelenos around a vision for wholeness beyond mere housing. 
   
   
   
   Now is the time to make affordable dream villages a reality. The World Harvest Dream Village is more than a housing project; we’re building a community. Join us in building a road out of homelessness and hunger to a better future for Los Angeles.
