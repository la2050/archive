  The creation of Lola evolved from the urgent need to give K-16 students, with
  learning differences, tools that he/she needs in order to perform tasks
  necessary to everyday functioning and learning, in/out of the classroom,
  regardless of demographics. Users include: school Districts, service provider
  agencies and behavior interventionists, parents and adults who self-assign
  utilize Lola software to best provide support that fosters not only growth in
  learners but independence as well.
   
    
   
   As this is the fundamental purpose of Lola, when guides such as teachers/support personnel/parents utilize all that Lola offers, classrooms and other settings see an increase in ALL student engagement, in promotion of students with below proficient and/or higher skills, along with an increase of teacher effectiveness on classroom management and delivery of instruction in general and access to rigorous curriculum, no matter where the teacher is in his/her career or school address.
   
   When Lola software helps leaners with learning differences access rigorous curriculum and stay focused by: breaking routines into manageable tasks, providing visual timers, and enabling a messaging system for support, community realizes the value because the learning environment becomes more efficient/effective. 
   
   Executive functioning, commonly thought of as organizational skills, are something that typically developing students acquire over time, but students with various types of learning differences find especially difficult to overcome when reaching for academic success. Approximately 13% of the 55 million preK-12 students in the United States are diagnosed as needing special education services; 64% of these students are categorically labeled as having a Learning Disability or Specific Learning Disability (NCES, 2015). Learning Disabilities and/or Specific Learning Disability can include Dyslexia, Dyscalculia, Auditory and Visual Processing Disorders, and Dysgraphia. Additionally, students with Traumatic Brain Injuries, Other Health Impairments, Attention Deficit Disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, and Autism Spectrum Disorder also struggle with executive functioning. Since 2000, categorical areas such as Other Health Impairments and Autism Spectrum Disorders have seen more than 400% increase in diagnosis (NCES, 2015). Supporting the executive functioning of students diagnosed with Learning Disabilities, Traumatic Brain Injuries, Other Health Impairments, and Autism Spectrum Disorders has plagued educators and families alike. Arguably, the most frustrating situations for educators and parents alike include: not being able to support children by giving each child the tools he/she needs to navigate through his or her day with confidence and independence.
