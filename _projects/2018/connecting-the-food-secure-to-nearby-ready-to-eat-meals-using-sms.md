Please describe the activation your organization seeks to launch.: >-
  NIF seeks to launch Hunger: Not Impossible, a SMS and also soon-to-be
  app-based platform that connects food secure individuals to hot, ready-to-eat
  meals. The geo-location pinpoints the most convenient partner restaurants then
  leads the individual through a series of SMS responses to place a food order.
  Ensuring dignity for all, the anonymous aspect of the program breaks down
  traditional stigmas around hunger, while disrupting the system of charitable
  food provision.
Which metrics will your activation impact?​:
  - Access to healthy food
How will your activation mobilize Angelenos?:
  - Digital organizing or activism
  - >-
    Influence individual behavior (e.g. change consumer spending or increase
    conservation activity)
  - Connect Angelenos with impactful volunteer opportunities
Describe in greater detail how your activation will make LA the best place?: |-
  HNI activation includes:

   Partnering with local organizations to pinpoint the individuals who can most benefit from the program.

   Onboard participants into the program

   Participants will text "hungry" whenever they would like to order a meal (the number of meals / days will depend on budget and scale)

   Participants will be directed through a series of SMS prompts that will build a food order at a participating restaurant that is nearby (geo-location technology selects the nearest locations)

   Participants will pick up their meal and eat!



   The simple solution to providing ready-to-eat and healthy meals to those struggling with food insecurity proves that Angelenos are concerned about their local communities and strive to discover innovative solutions for them. This program is human-centered and intends to work with a breadth of local organizations in order to provide a comprehensive program of self-development. Rather than be a "hand out" initiative, it is a hand-up approach to creating self-sufficiency in each and every Angeleno.



   LA is thus proving that it is a welcoming and solutions-driven community where each individual is valued and supported in his/her ambitions to lead a healthier, more fulfilling life that allows him/her to become a higher contributing member of the community.
How will your activation engage Angelenos to make LA the best place?: >-
  Los Angeles struggles with homelessness. Homelessness is compounded by the
  fact that millions of homeless individuals go hungry. But food insecurity can
  also have surprising faces: single, working mothers; veterans; students;
  seniors. HNI supports LA's efforts to eradicate food insecurity and its
  foundational causes.



   Hunger: Not Impossible will feed millions of food insecure Americans by leveraging a ubiquitous technology and mode of communication — cell phones and texting.



   With convenient and regular access to food, H:NI participants are able to reinvest their time into strengthening the foundation of their lives, which ultimately disrupts the perpetual cycle of hunger.



   This initiative will work collaboratively with other LA-based organizations working to end poverty and hunger in LA. Together, they will improve LA's reputation as being the homeless capital of the United States. It will show that Angelenos care about their communities and are actively discovering and utilizing breakthrough approaches to improving everyone's situation.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your activation.​: >-
  Initially success is measured by individuals impacted. How many food insecure
  individuals register for the program and how often do they access meals via
  the platform? Partnering with local organizations provides additional
  resources for individuals who can also access skills development, education,
  life coaching, health services and other necessary forms of support in order
  to comprehensively improve each individual's situation now that regularly
  accessing food is no longer a concern and distraction.



   In order to measure this success, it is a months-long process of data tracking--via the ordering platform--of individuals to understand increase in qualitative life components. Surveys provided to all participants at the beginning and end of the program will inform the success of the program.
Where do you hope this activation or your organization will be in five years?: >-
  HNI's longterm goals include becoming part of a comprehensive system that
  supports individuals in their journeys to improve their living situation.
  Without food, a person is incapable of achieving anything else as it becomes
  an obsessive thought: where will I find my next meal? HNI can take this
  distraction out of the equation by providing this basic need via accessible,
  healthy, ready-to-eat meals. This creates space in the individual's live to
  pursue other means of self-improvement including employment opportunities,
  skill development, education, health services, etc.



   If HNI can partner with organizations around the country, it will revolutionize the ability of NGOs and their communities to dramatically escalate and accelerate the work of each organization.
