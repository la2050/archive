  HNI activation includes:

   Partnering with local organizations to pinpoint the individuals who can most benefit from the program.

   Onboard participants into the program

   Participants will text "hungry" whenever they would like to order a meal (the number of meals / days will depend on budget and scale)

   Participants will be directed through a series of SMS prompts that will build a food order at a participating restaurant that is nearby (geo-location technology selects the nearest locations)

   Participants will pick up their meal and eat!



   The simple solution to providing ready-to-eat and healthy meals to those struggling with food insecurity proves that Angelenos are concerned about their local communities and strive to discover innovative solutions for them. This program is human-centered and intends to work with a breadth of local organizations in order to provide a comprehensive program of self-development. Rather than be a "hand out" initiative, it is a hand-up approach to creating self-sufficiency in each and every Angeleno.



   LA is thus proving that it is a welcoming and solutions-driven community where each individual is valued and supported in his/her ambitions to lead a healthier, more fulfilling life that allows him/her to become a higher contributing member of the community.
