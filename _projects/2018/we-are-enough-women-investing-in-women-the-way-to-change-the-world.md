  Women-led businesses are significantly underfinanced. They receive less than
  3% of venture capital, 17% of angel investment, and 4% of commercial loans.
  Yet, women are starting businesses at 1.5 times the rate of men... even faster
  for women of color. Companies led by women, that have more women on their
  boards, or women as decision-makers outperform their competitors on EVERY
  measure of profitability...by 63%!



   We Are Enough's activation will create measures of cultural and global economic influence by changing women's mindsets. Women do not consider themselves investors and are passive with their investments BUT women control or influence 75% of consumer discretionary spending around the globe. After four sold-out and successful pilot events (which included surveys) in LA proved women were eager to learn how to activate their economic power, we concluded that we could reach all women in LA County. Where LA goes, so goes the country and the world... so it's the perfect place to launch and pilot our new global campaign.



   Why will this "make LA the best place to create"? LA is the most economically unequal place in the country. Women reinvest more of their capital back into their communities than men... by 50% more. If we really want our region to be the best place to create, we need to remove the inequities. This is what women will do if they have more wealth and their businesses more financial support. Our campaign will build wealth for all women and teach our girls to do the same.
