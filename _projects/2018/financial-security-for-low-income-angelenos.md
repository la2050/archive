  Golden State Opportunity strives to bring economic security and improve the
  lives of working Californians through a program of research, analysis, public
  information, outreach and education. Our primary program is CalEITC4Me, a
  public-private partnership with the Governor’s office and State to conduct
  outreach and education about the California Earned Income Tax Credit
  (CalEITC). 
   
   
   
   As inequality grows in California, work is simply not paying enough to keep up with rising cost of living and a changing economy. The CalEITC is a cash back tax refund that makes work pay better, and provides much needed assistance in an economy that grows more and more imbalanced every year. In the program’s first two years, it has helped put nearly $2 billion directly into the pockets of almost 800,000 low-income working California families between the state and federal EITC.
   
   
   
   The EITC advances social and economic equity throughout low-income communities by providing financial security and helping reduce short and long term poverty. CalEITC4Me’s aggressive outreach efforts ensure available CalEITC and federal EITC money reach under-resourced communities, bringing economic security in the near term and increased opportunity over time to those in poverty, especially women and children. Research shows children whose families receive an EITC income boost perform better in school, are healthier, and earn more as adults.
   
   
   
   As a result of our advocacy efforts in 2017 to expand access to the CalEITC, where workers making up to $22,300 a year and ALL self-employed people (not just W2) are now covered, over 1.6 million Californians will now be eligible for the CalEITC in 2018. This is triple the eligible population of the last two years, and CalEITC4Me is now responsible for ensuring this population benefits from the economic opportunity created by the CalEITC. We hope to take the success of last year and expand our best practices and organizing model to more of Southern California. 
   
   
   
   Our ultimate goal is to help low-income Californians not only collect thousands of dollars in EITC refunds now, but ultimately achieve life-long sustainable financial security and economic equality. We hope to turn our EITC outreach efforts into a year-round organizing model to further improve EITC uptake, connect EITC filers to other economic benefits, and help provide a platform for the working poor to be heard on issues important to their lives.
