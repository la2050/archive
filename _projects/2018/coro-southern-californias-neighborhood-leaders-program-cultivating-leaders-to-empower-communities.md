  Coro’s mission is to strengthen the democratic process by preparing emerging
  leaders for effective and ethical leadership in public affairs. For over 60
  years, Coro Southern California has used the city as its classroom to teach
  rising leaders from across sectors how Southern California works so they can
  make it better. Today, Coro’s multiple leadership development programs
  continue to strengthen the region’s leadership pipeline by cultivating a
  community of alumni who are shaping the future of Los Angeles.
   
   
   
   NLP will bring Coro’s proven training methodology to South LA community leaders and equip them with the skills they need to understand complex policy issues and effectively enact impactful change in their communities. Program participants will also gain an in-depth understanding of city and county government, political campaigns, and large-scale community organizing efforts.
   
   
   
   Through the program components outlined below, participants will gain the knowledge, skills and network to directly impact three metrics outlined under LA2050’s CONNECT goal: (1) government responsiveness to residents’ needs; (2) increased participation in neighborhood councils; (3) and increased rates of volunteerism.
   
   
   
   1) Interviews: Through inquiry-based exploration, NLP participants will interview leaders across the public, private, and nonprofit sectors in South LA, helping participants to build key relationships and expand their social capital, learn important subject matter from experts, and build strategies to advocate for their communities.
   
   2) Issue Days: Each cohort will travel the region to explore policy issues and complex community challenges. Participants will come away with in-depth knowledge of the issues persistent in their neighborhoods, and the resolve to enact change.
   
   3) Group Projects: NLP cohorts will engage in group projects, immediately applying the program tools and knowledge gained to navigating complex challenges with high levels of ambiguity. This includes a Neighborhood Logic Study, where the cohort will collectively study and present on the “logic” of their community.
   
   4) Seminar Training: Participants will engage in leadership development, reflective practice, and hard skills training through a variety of analytical tools and frameworks used to train civic leaders for over 60 years.
   
   5) Community Change Projects: NLP participants will apply their program learnings and newly expanded networks to launch community change projects addressing the salient challenges they’ve identified and explored throughout their experience.
   
   
   
   NLP’s core goal is to connect community leaders in South LA to each other and to the civic network in the region. Through this cohort-based, experiential learning, participants will not only be more inclined to run for Neighborhood Council seats, engage their elected officials to respond to their needs, and increase the rate of volunteerism; they will have the skills to activate and guide thousands more to do the same.
