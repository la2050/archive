  Council is a tradition of bringing people together in a circle to listen
  non-judgmentally to one anotherâ€™s stories and to speak authentically.
  Combining elements of storytelling and mindfulness, the practice provides a
  tool for diffusing bias and misunderstanding, fostering more respectful
  relationships, and supporting the emergence of compassionate and resilient
  communities.



   Center for Council has worked with over 50 social justice organizations through its Social Justice Council Project. The Social Justice Council Project provides LA nonprofits with training in Council to more effectively listen to and engage with their constituents, and to create more cooperative and supportive internal work environments, mitigating staff stress and burnout. Program evaluation has shown that implementing Council helps participants improve their communication skills, empathy, connectedness, and mindfulness both within and outside the workplace, as well as reduces social anxiety when having to speak in group settings.



   If selected as an LA2050 Activation Challenge winner, Center for Council will employ the Social Justice Council Project model to help strengthen the internal work cultures and programmatic impact of the other five winning organizations and six semi-finalists.



   In order for organizations to positively impact the community at-large, there is a critical need to be able to listen deeply to the populations they serve. Organizational staff must develop a capacity to understand both the context of underlying issues embedded within these populations and the history that lives in the stories of community members and their families. By learning to incorporate Council into their work, participants will experience a deeper connection and enhanced engagement in the in-person interactions they have with the community members they serve, as well as with one another, creating a cultural shift both within the workplace and in Los Angeles at-large. The practice of Council is carried from the workplace to the home, from the home back out into the world, and has the potential to impact every interaction an individual has.



   By integrating deeper listening and compassion-based communication into the LA community, the project will mobilize Angelinos and impact the following LA2050 CONNECT metrics: adults getting sufficient social & emotional support; participation in neighborhood councils; rates of volunteerism; trainings and in-person engagements; encouraging (nonprofit) businesses to change practices; and influencing individual behavior. Participating organizations will both experience and deliver significant positive shifts in personal health (lower stress, less stress-related disease), group health (better communication, more cooperation) and community health (more pro-social, compassion-centered engagement).
