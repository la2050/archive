  Youth Voice 2020 is a joint initiative between Action Civic LA and ProCon.org.
  We will give Angelenos an easy way to encourage, motivate and facilitate youth
  activism in Los Angeles county, inspiring them to take action in their
  communities, participate in local government, and vote on local issues, making
  LA the best place to connect.
   
    
   
   By training Los Angeles teachers and students to translate their passion into action, highlighting the civic action of youth, and connecting youth to local government, we will show Angelenos how to be active in their communities. Youth Voice 2020 will increase the percentage of young people who are registered to vote; regularly volunteer; and involved in local government. Our focus on action will also increase government responsiveness to local issues. Our ability to amplify youth voices through public events and websites will increase adult participation in local issues, voting rates, volunteerism.
   
    
   
   Youth Voice 2020 has 3 components:
   
   1.Youth training
   
   Teachers work with Action Civics LA to engage their students to identify the most pressing issues in their communities and take action to address these issues. Students learn how to SPEAK OUT, ADVOCATE for change, COLLABORATE with peers and community organizations, RESEARCH issues, DEVELOP action plans to affect change, and SHOWCASE their year-long activism efforts.
   
    
   
   Past projects include:
   
   * South Central HS students advocated for the rights of undocumented immigrants and DREAMers in their school and community bringing in the assistance of immigration lawyers and representatives from Congresswoman Karen Bass’ office; Hancock Park Elementary students researched homelessness rates in their neighborhood and presented their findings to Councilmember Ryu in City Hall; Boyle Heights 9th graders started a school-wide “Unplug Monday” during free periods where students detach from all electronics and focus on interpersonal connections and mental health care. 
   
   2. Public events:
   
   * 2 showcase events where students will present their Action Civics projects and receive feedback from community leaders.
   
   * 6-8 large open community events hosted by Pro/Con where local issues are debated (proposed locations include the Santa Monica Pier, USC, and others). Student projects will be featured and event participants will be asked to take action to support them. 
   
   3. Digital amplification and action:
   
   We will highlight select student speeches and projects on the ProCon.org website for the 500,000 annual users from Los Angeles. We will focus on the following four areas: Water and the environment; Community and School safety; Civic Participation; and Education.
   
    
   
   The projects will be linked to pro and con research on these issues on ProCon.org, a website use by 25 million people per year, including more than 500,000 Angelenos. Web visitors will be able to view the projects, replicate them in their own neighborhood, contact their local representatives, and share with their own social networks.
