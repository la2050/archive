project_proposal_description: >-
  A 25-foot art installation of the words PERIODS and #HAPPYPERIOD set in five
  locations within Los Angeles county. The letters will be made of ply-wood with
  bins built in back, to be covered in packages of period products. The public
  will be encouraged to take photos with the installation and donate their
  unwanted disposable or reusable products for a homeless passer-by to take for
  themselves or someone else in need. #HappyPeriod will be able to refurbish and
  collect donations for shelters.

  In a 2011 Feeding America survey, people of all income listed menstrual
  hygiene products as a basic essential or an item “that cannot be forgone or
  easily substituted.” Yet homeless women have to find substitutions every month
  such as plastic bags, old rags, newspaper, socks, and tissue. In Los Angeles
  County, 57,794 people experienced homelessness on a given night in 2017. Of
  this number, over 17,000 are women and nearly 500 are transgender. The average
  homeless female in Los Angeles County is a woman of color and is of
  reproductive age. Most of these women and girls will menstruate each month,
  which is a natural part of the reproductive system, yet it remains taboo. As a
  result, the challenges of menstrual hygiene are heightened due to the
  socioeconomic status of these women. A 3 foot high, 25-foot art installation
  of the words PERIODS and #HAPPYPERIOD set in five locations within Los Angeles
  county. The letters will be made of recycled materials with bins built in the
  back of each letter. The front of the letters will to be filled with packages
  of period products. The back bins will be made to also be filled with
  donations. The public will be encouraged to take photos with the installation
  and donate their unwanted disposable or reusable products for a homeless
  passer-by to take for themselves or someone else in need. #HappyPeriod will be
  able to refurbish and collect donations for shelters. With this activation, an
  individual in need would have a new resource from which to obtain period
  products at any time. This activation will ideally be installed in five
  locations across Los Angeles in communities with a high walk score, for
  example Hollywood, Downtown, Mid-city, Venice, and Santa Monica. The goal is
  to present an interactive way of giving and encourage digital activism.

  This activation will ideally be installed in five locations across Los Angeles
  in communities with a high walk score, for example Hollywood, Downtown,
  Mid-city, Venice, and Santa Monica. The goal is to present an interactive way
  of giving back and encourage digital activism. Artists can get involved with
  the project and tackle the unique challenge of having to incorporate a way for
  period products to be housed on the structure. The installation could be made
  using environmentally safe supplies, and recycled materials that are similar
  to ply-wood or better. Signage will also be required for informing the viewers
  about the installation. The signage will include #HappyPeriod's mission, a
  sign-up sheet for volunteering, a petition to remove the tampon tax in the
  state, statistics on homeless community in Los Angeles, and instructions on
  how to directly participate in the activation. From selfies to donating, it
  will be a straight forward opportunity for engagement. The public will be
  encouraged to use social media to spread awareness on the activation and
  cause.
project_measure: >-
  Success of the activation will be defined by a number of key factors: 1) The
  number of products donated, 2) products that are taken by an homeless
  individual, 3) Analytics and insights, 4)Impressions on social media. Data
  science will be our biggest tool for measuring the impact of the activation.
  We will take a daily count of products donated and received, and this will be
  assisted with the help of volunteers. Since the public will be encouraged to
  use social media to spread awareness about the activation, hashtags will be
  key in measuring our success online. Hiring a data scientist or analyst will
  be definite in monitoring all of this victoriously.

  After going global, I hope to turn my organization into a B corporation or
  social enterprise.
