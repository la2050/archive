  In a 2011 Feeding America survey, people of all income listed menstrual
  hygiene products as a basic essential or an item “that cannot be forgone or
  easily substituted.” Yet homeless women have to find substitutions every month
  such as plastic bags, old rags, newspaper, socks, and tissue. In Los Angeles
  County, 57,794 people experienced homelessness on a given night in 2017. Of
  this number, over 17,000 are women and nearly 500 are transgender. The average
  homeless female in Los Angeles County is a woman of color and is of
  reproductive age. Most of these women and girls will menstruate each month,
  which is a natural part of the reproductive system, yet it remains taboo. As a
  result, the challenges of menstrual hygiene are heightened due to the
  socioeconomic status of these women. A 3 foot high, 25-foot art installation
  of the words PERIODS and #HAPPYPERIOD set in five locations within Los Angeles
  county. The letters will be made of recycled materials with bins built in the
  back of each letter. The front of the letters will to be filled with packages
  of period products. The back bins will be made to also be filled with
  donations. The public will be encouraged to take photos with the installation
  and donate their unwanted disposable or reusable products for a homeless
  passer-by to take for themselves or someone else in need. #HappyPeriod will be
  able to refurbish and collect donations for shelters. With this activation, an
  individual in need would have a new resource from which to obtain period
  products at any time. This activation will ideally be installed in five
  locations across Los Angeles in communities with a high walk score, for
  example Hollywood, Downtown, Mid-city, Venice, and Santa Monica. The goal is
  to present an interactive way of giving and encourage digital activism.
