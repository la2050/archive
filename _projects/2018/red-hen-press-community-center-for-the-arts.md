  Through the LA2050 Activation Challenge, Red Hen Press will make capital
  purchases in preparation for the launch of the Hen House Workshop Series in
  its new community arts center. The workshop series will provide low-income
  youth with free arts education in the fields of literature, music, and dance,
  as well as offer writing master classes taught by renowned Los Angeles poets
  and writers. 
   
   
   
   Funds will support the purchase of equipment, including laptops, desks, chairs, instruments, music stands, audience seating, sound system equipment, lights, and other staging equipment. Red Hen has much of the infrastructure for this project already in place, including a performance and workshop space and a rotating team of about 20 volunteers to perform programming and administrative duties. The press also has a strong relationship with local artists who will be hired to instruct workshops.
   
   
   
   The purchase of basic workstations will allow Red Hen Press to host 20 free one-hour youth arts workshops per category (writing, music, and dance) for a total of 60 workshops annually. The press will conduct 60 workshops; serve 1,000 elementary, middle, and high school students; and employ 6 teaching artists. Through the program, students will be encouraged not only to emulate great art, but create and share original works, thus building improved artistic skills, deepening appreciation for the diverse landscape of art, and increasing confidence in peer-to-peer sharing and public presentation. The series will also provide low-income students a safe space to spend time after school.
   
   
   
   Additionally, Red Hen will program a writing master class workshop series for adults. Workshops will be offered in a range of prices and durations (one-off workshops and multi-week series) to increase accessibility for aspiring writers. The press anticipates hosting 30 master class workshops annually, to be instructed by lauded Los Angeles poets and writers. 
   
   
   
   The purchase of staging equipment and audience seating will also enable Red Hen Press to host its own events. Currently, the press primarily programs literary events at arts venues, museums, art galleries, and theaters throughout Los Angeles, and such events often incur space rental costs. By programming literary events at our own performance space, the press will eliminate venue rental costs, allowing for free entry for audience members and higher honoraria for performing artists. Support for this project will also support Red Henâ€™s efforts to increase attendance from low-income populations by providing free tickets to students, their families, and faculty at Title I schools in Los Angeles.
