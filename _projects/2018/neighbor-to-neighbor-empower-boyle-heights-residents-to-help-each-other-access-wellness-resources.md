  The success of the promotores (1) training, and (2) support will be defined by
  the growth of the promotores themselves. This will be measured by their:
   
   o Leadership development
   
   o Confidence
   
   o Connection to each other
   
   o Employability.
   
   
   
   The success of the promotores (3) community-level work will be defined by the increase in families’ awareness of health and wellness resources, and families’ increased connectedness to those resources. This will be measured by the following indicators:
   
   * Number of resident contacts made by promotores
   
   * Number of referrals made by promotores and percentage of referrals completed
   
   * Number of residents who receive a referral and percentage who follow through on the referral and connect to health services
   
   * Number of presentations and workshops given by promotores and number of residents attending 
   
   * Percentage of presentation/workshop participants reporting increased knowledge.

project_proposal_description: >-
  We seek to train and empower 25 Boyle Heights residents to become promotores
  to improve physical and emotional health outcomes in the community. Once
  trained, the promotores will conduct community outreach and education to help
  their fellow neighbors access much-needed health and wellness resources,
  reaching 4,500+ residents. By being truly resident-led, the promotora model
  will not only improve health outcomes, but also increase community empowerment
  and social connectedness.

project_proposal_engage: >-
  The activation will engage the community of Boyle Heights, which is in the top
  10% of LA County’s 272 communities with high income and educational risk
  factors. The community is at high risk of not receiving sufficient social and
  emotional support as shown by two factors:
   
   o Race: 94% of Boyle Heights residents are Latino — the least likely race to receive sufficient social and emotional support, when compared with White, African-American or Asian. 
   
   o Education: 54% of Boyle Heights residents over the age of 25 do not have a high school diploma — the least likely to receive sufficient social and emotional support when compared to those with a high school, college or post-graduate degree. 
   
   In addition, 1 in 3 families live below the federal poverty line, and more than half of residents are foreign-born, and for the majority, Spanish is their primary language. 
   
   
   
   Promesa’s core approach underlying all our strategies for change is to foster local leadership and civic engagement so that residents become agents of change in their own lives and community. The promotora model will involve extensive training and support for 25 residents to become agents of change in their community. Once we have developed their leadership and capacity, the promotores will reach out to over 4,500 fellow residents to help them access health and wellness resources. The residents themselves will lead the transformation process to reach the LA2050 goal of 95% of adults receiving social and emotional support
project_five_years: >-
  Within Boyle Heights, we plan to scale up the number of promotores
  year-on-year in order to expand reach to residents over time. Moreover, we see
  our model being replicated by other low-income communities within Los Angeles
  that, though each facing their own unique issues, share a common need to raise
  the voices of local residents.We are building a model in which we catalyze
  “everyday” peoples’ passions, lived-experiences, and creativity to support
  comprehensive solutions that build on one another’s assets. Promesa Boyle
  Heights’ mission and reason for being is not simply to transform Boyle
  Heights. Rather, it is to “scale up” our successes so that by 2050, Los
  Angeles is a city in which ALL residents are empowered to work with schools,
  elected officials, and business leaders in order to collectively shape the
  future of the city.
