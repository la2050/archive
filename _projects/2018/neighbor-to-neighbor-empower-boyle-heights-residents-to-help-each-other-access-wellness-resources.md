  We will make LA a better place to CONNECT by ensuring that the community of
  Boyle Heights gets sufficient social and emotional support. We will do this by
  improving the health and social connectedness of families by training and
  supporting 25 promotores from within the community to reach out to over 4,500
  residents over two years to:
   
   o Increase families’ awareness of health and wellness resources, and
   
   o Help families connect to and navigate health and wellness services. 
   
   
   
   Below are details of the activities to achieve this goal:
   
   1. Promotores Training — increase participation in community problem-solving by training promotores in the community. Trainings will include:
   
   o Foundation-building training sessions — for the promotores to developing skills in areas such as listening, connecting with others, and public speaking. We will conduct four sessions up to three hours each. 
   
   o Content-specific training — in areas such as understanding and navigating wellness resources, trauma needs/issues, community wellness needs, and impact and coping tools for community and individual stress. 
   
   
   
   2. Promotores Support — ensure continual participation in community problem-solving by offering ongoing support to promotores. Promesa Boyle Heights will offer in-person engagements to support and coordinate promotores as they begin their work in the community through:
   
   o Monthly promotores meetings 
   
   o Building a strong peer-to-peer support system, including “Lead Promotores”. 
   
   
   
   3. Promotores community-level work once trained will include: 
   
   o Influencing individual behavior in the community around health and social connectedness through:
   
   * Resident outreach
   
   * Wellness referrals 
   
   o Conducting in-person engagements with community members through presentations and workshops 
   
   o Increasing participation of the residents in community problem-solving by offering residents volunteer opportunities to get involved in community organizing efforts to advocate for policy e.g. connecting them to the Comite de Lideres and other organizing and system-level efforts.
   
   
   
   The improved health outcomes and increased social connectedness will ultimately contribute to enhanced educational and life outcomes for the families served.
