  Child360 (formerly Los Angeles Universal Preschool) works in partnership with
  families, local residents and community groups to build, support, and improve
  early education in Los Angeles County. Our activation will be a transparent
  process that allows community members in East LA, South LA, and Antelope
  Valley to identify, develop, and implement community-driven strategies that
  maximize engagement and empower Angelenos to create communities that truly
  give children the best start. 
   
   
   
   Child360’s Community Engagement team will facilitate community meetings to ensure collaboration between local agencies and their stakeholders that include families, residents, business-owners, neighborhood councils, and volunteers. Child360 will collaborate with partner groups to assess the capacities and gaps of the community partnerships and to develop plans to build capacity in areas where assistance is needed. Types of assistance could include:
   
   
   
   * Trainings for local trainers on the Center for the Study of Social Policy’s Strengthening Families™ Protective Factors (SFPF) Framework, which focuses on five factors of parental resilience, social connections, concrete support in times of need, knowledge of parenting and child development, and socioemotional competence of children
   
   * Trainings on advocacy strategies and tactics and provision of tools to increase constituents’ capacity to improve government responsiveness (past examples include a Community Ambassador Toolkit and an online Voter Voice platform that helps local constituents understand and flex their power in local, state, and national politics)
   
   * Trainings to help community partnerships develop skills to identify and apply for funding at the local level
   
   * Organizing of annual community festivals that convene local service providers, families, residents, and volunteers
   
   * Volunteer mobilization community partnership activities
   
   * Media engagement and promotion of community partnerships
   
   * Other support activities identified by the local community partnerships
   
   
   
   Child360 will also oversee data collection and assessment of the activation, and provide regular reports to the community partnerships to learn from and develop plans to improve their work. Child360 will document community partnership participant information and attendance and will work with the community partnerships to identify performance measures, which include metrics that are most meaningful to the communities.
