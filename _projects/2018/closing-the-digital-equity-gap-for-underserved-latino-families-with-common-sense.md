  Common Sense is uniquely positioned to address the needs of Latino families in
  Los Angeles. Over the last year, Common Sense began efforts to broaden our
  reach to low-income Latino families in Los Angeles. We launched a new
  destination for Spanish-speaking families, Common Sense Latino, which features
  all of our Spanish-language resources including blog posts, reviews, and
  advice content. This content development is led by specialists in
  Latino-focused communications and parent advice experts. We’ve also formed a
  Latino Advisory Council to help forge new partnerships with grassroots LA
  organizations serving Latino families. To date, we’ve established partnerships
  with key organizations such as Abriendo Puertas and EveryoneOn/ConnectHome, as
  well as with several school districts, such as Compton Unified, that are
  interested in educating Latino families about media and technology. 
   
   
   
   With support from LA 2050, we will strengthen our partnerships with these organizations as well as build relationships with additional nonprofits working with Latino families. These partnerships allow us to bring the content we are creating at the national level directly to parents locally. Specifically, we will engage in the following activities: 
   
   
   
   Facilitate parent workshops to help families understand the impact of media and how to best guide their kids - a unique opportunity for families who are not tech savvy to understand better the digital world, identify tools to support their kids goals, feel safe so they can learn. 
   
   
   
   Create new and culturally-relevant content (English and Spanish) for families, including tip sheets, recommended lists, and other parent-facing resources covering a wide range of topics including:
   
   *Helping families discover and use quality and age-appropriate media with their kids
   
   *Establishing a healthy media diet, using technology to bond with kids, and media that brings family together
   
   *Using media to support academic goals
   
   *Supporting kids in being good digital citizens and discovering new ways that technology can empower kids’ learning at home and in school
   
   
   
   Establish more partnerships with community organizations ( i.e. Para Los Ninos, First 5 LA) to disseminate our content with the families they serve.
   
   
   
   Provide in-person training to community-based educators, who will then provide workshops to families on media and technology issues
   
   
   
   Through these efforts, we will help kids build the skills they need to harness technology for learning and life - from using the internet safely and responsibly to using media and technology to optimize learning. Our award-winning Digital Citizenship program covers media balance and well being, digital footprint and identity, privacy and safety, relationships and communication, digital drama, cyberbullying and hate speech, and news and media literacy. This comprehensive work will be executed by a team of people in our LA office, supported by our national staff who are creating the programmatic resources.
