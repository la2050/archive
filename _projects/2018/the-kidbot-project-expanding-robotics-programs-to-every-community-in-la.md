  Through the proposed project, LA’s BEST will expand KidBot, an afterschool
  robotics program for Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) elementary
  school students--at no cost to parents. Created in 2013, KidBot offers
  children the opportunity to engage with computer science and engineering
  through hands-on learning experiences that introduce them to the basic
  components of robot technology and elements of robot design. 
   
   
   
   LA’s BEST KidBot is hosted on elementary school sites during the afterschool hours in the school’s computer lab. The KidBot program currently serves 320 students in 16 schools. Through the LA2050 activation, we can reach all 25,000 students in close to 200 elementary schools across LA!
   
   
   
   LA’s BEST provides high-quality training to program staff — young adults with deep connections to the communities we serve — to facilitate KidBot effectively, while also supporting the development of skills coveted by today’s workforce. “KidBot coaches” guide students through the process of utilizing LEGO Mindstorms kits to work in teams to design and program their own robot.
   
   
   
   Over the course of a 12-week period, KidBot participants explore the three areas of STEM learning--mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and computer science--increasing their knowledge of robotics engineering and robot functions. This process takes place as students practice collaboration skills when building and designing their team’s robots and problem-solving skills when programming robots. As students begin interacting with the robot parts, coaches encourage participants through the process of engaging with their work as “engineers” in a robotics laboratory or workshop. With support from i.am.angel foundation, each KidBot site participate in regional competitions with other robotics clubs from surrounding schools. These competitions offer children the opportunity to learn how friendly competition and mutual gain are not separate goals; helping each other is the foundation of teamwork.
   
   
   
   A key value of organization is student choice, so children select the activities or clubs in which they take part. With all activities offered at no cost to parents, children who would otherwise not have opportunities for quality out-of-school time learning experiences are afforded important, often life-changing computer science and engineering education through KidBot.
   
   
   
   In fostering critical thinking skills, KidBot empowers students to flourish creatively and view competition as another way to learn from and teach others. Further, the integration of social and emotional learning in programming encourages students to cultivate higher-thinking skills such as responsibility, empathy, teamwork, problem solving, emotion management and initiative. These components empower students as they develop strong, positive relationships with peers and adults through their journey to becoming young leaders in the STEM field.
