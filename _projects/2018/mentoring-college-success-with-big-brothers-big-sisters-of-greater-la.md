  We live in an increasingly segregated Los Angeles where youth of color are not
  benefitting from the advantages of our growing economy. Measure of America’s
  “Portrait of Los Angeles” estimated that life expectancy would increase by 1.5
  years, murder rates would fall by 9%, and the voting rate would increase by
  10% if every Angeleno graduated from high school. LA is now a majority Latino
  community- yet more than three in ten young Latino immigrants aren’t enrolled
  in school of any kind.



   Our College PAC program launched as a pilot in the Fall of 2016 with a focus on 150 Juniors and Seniors in high school and 55 first year college students. Our pilot was particularly directed at first generation college bound youth of color, including many undocumented students. The core of the pilot program provides professionally supported mentorships to assist students with graduating high school, applying for college, and in persisting through the first year of postsecondary education. By facilitating a positive relationship that provides social, emotional, and academic support for youth, we can help them overcome the significant barriers holding them back from a college success.



   For high school students preparing to attend college, the College PAC program team also provides supplementary workshops and materials to address common gaps in knowledge and skills of underserved youth, their families, and mentors. The College PAC program produced extremely promising results: 100% of the Littles receiving support from the program graduated high school and matriculated to a 2 or 4 year college and 100% of the mentees enrolled in college persisted through their first year of school. College PAC students in high school also improved their SAT scores by 119 points on average. In partnership with the LA Mayor’s Office, starting in 2018 all college youth in the program will also be eligible for paid internships at major entertainment corporations in fields such as tech, business development, and production as part of Mayor Eric Garcetti’s efforts to diversify the industry.



   With a LA2050 partnership, we will have the staff resources to support college and career preparation and training for one-to-one mentoring of youth as early as 2nd grade that continues through college completion. This will directly impact 6000+ youth/mentors/families in our programs. Our current College PAC Coordinator will focus on developing the curriculum to support all mentors, mentees, and families. She will also focus on building upon our partnerships with the Mayor’s Office and the California Community Foundation’s Young Men of Color (YMOC) Initiative to share our resources and promote mentorship as a crucial component of college and career prep across the region.
