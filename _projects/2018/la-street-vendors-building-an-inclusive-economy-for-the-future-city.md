  Street vending is an iconic part of LA culture, and a clear pathway to
  economic opportunity for 50,000 micro-entrepreneurs who sell food and goods on
  the sidewalks of LA. Approximately 80% are women of color who contribute to
  the rich, diverse street food landscape through the informal economy. They
  bring healthy, affordable, culturally diverse food to Angelenos, and when
  allowed to do their work legally and safely, contribute to the economic
  vitality of their neighborhoods and our city as a whole.
   
   
   
   The LA Street Vendor Campaign organizes and advocates for rights for street vendors as an important part of an inclusive and equitable LA economy. Through this activation we seek to mobilize a broad base of Angelenos to learn about and get involved in this important economic justice issue. We will also engage street vendors, businesses and manufacturers to work together to safeguard street vending as a viable and valuable asset to neighborhood-based economies in LA. 
   
   
   
   Our activation has multiple pathways to engagement for Angelenos and includes: 1) Information: a dynamic public outreach campaign on social media that will activate over 100,000 Angelenos by tapping into the extensive membership base of our 65 coalition member organizations; 2) Participation: concrete opportunities for a diverse cross-sector of Angelenos to make their voices heard in the new policy formation by participating in public hearings and engaging their representatives; 3) Action: a #isupportLAstreetvendors “buycott” will be part of a digital activism strategy to activate Angelenos around the campaign. 
   
   
   
   Our activation will also include vital capacity building for street vendors to succeed and thrive, with training on how to navigate permitting, business development, and relationship building with manufacturers for supplies and equipment. And, through outreach and organizing we will work to get small business owners, manufacturers, policy makers, and street vendors working together to make the LA economy equitable and inclusive for micro-entrepreneurs, recognizing the economic benefits they bring to their communities. 
   
   
   
   This activation will impact the CREATE metrics by: fostering entrepreneurship and increasing secure employment in the culinary arts, among the most vibrant creative industries in our city; making the local economy more inclusive and diverse, increasing both jobs for and businesses owned by women and people of color; impacting the GINI coefficient by allowing low-income entrepreneurs to generate more wealth; and engaging the manufacturing industry to supply critical equipment and supplies to street vendors at prices scaled to their small enterprise. Los Angeles is and has always been a hub for creativity and innovation. We hope to build the movement for economic opportunity for thousands of Angelenos by activating local engagement and civic participation to build an equitable, inclusive economic future for our communities.
