  SmartAirLA deploys “Smart” Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to empower
  communities to reduce the effects and prevalence of asthma in Los Angeles
  County
Please describe the activation your organization seeks to launch.: "Our targeted outcome is to improve health equity of underserved children.  SmartAirLA will establish a Citizen Science Data Repository that includes a real-time dashboard that tracks the location, frequency, and environmental conditions of the asthma attacks.  This will:\r\n* enable undeserved asthmatic children to control and improve their condition.\r\n* equip government agencies and community organizations with actionable data to implement targeted mitigations that reduce the risks of asthma."
Describe in greater detail how your activation will make LA the best place?: "SmartAirLA seeks to:\r\n*\tImprove asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) outcomes among residents by providing actionable information to support self management\r\n*\tIdentify hotspots of respiratory disease in the community, better understand how environmental drivers are influencing these patterns.\r\n\r\nSmartAirLA is modeled after Air Louisville, in which the city of Louisville and a coalition of private, community health, and philanthropic organizations provided more than 1,100 smart inhalers to asthma sufferers. \r\n\r\nWithin 12 months of the smart inhaler deployment, AIR Louisville participants reported:\r\n*\tAverage of 82% reduction in asthma rescue inhaler use\r\n*\tDoubled their symptom-free days\r\n*\tBetter sleep, with an average of 19% increase in symptom-free nights\r\n*\t29% of uncontrolled participants gained control of their asthma\r\n\r\nThe data collected by the smart inhalers empowered Louisville City to:\r\n*\tIdentify buffer zones around pollution emitters and set pollution limits\r\n*\tBuild greenbelts to reduce particulate matter pollution by 60% in high asthmatic neighborhoods\r\n*\tReroute freight routes from high asthmatic neighborhoods\r\n\r\nTo achieve our outcomes, SmartAirLA will deploy smart inhalers through partnerships with local environmental health organizations and health care providers to educate patients on the health benefits of the smart inhalers.\r\n\r\nSmartAirLA will design and execute a pilot project to deploy the smart inhalers to underserved asthmatic children (age 5 to 17) in the Wilmington neighborhood of Los Angeles County.    \r\n\r\nThe targeted outcomes from the SmartAirLA Pilot include:\r\n*\tImprove quality outcomes for patients\r\n*\tReduce health care costs \r\n*\tIdentify potential hotspot locations where increased asthmatic events may occur \r\n*\tProvide the collected data to public and nongovernment organizations to implement preventive actions.\r\n"
How will your activation engage Angelenos to make LA the best place: "SmartAirLA seeks to be a sustainable smart Intenet of Things (IoT) platform that improves health equity for underserved communities by focusing on preventive care and wellness.  To achieve this, SmartAirLA:\r\n*\tBrings together technology, environment, health, and community experts from the academic, private, and public sectors to develop and implement innovative approaches.\r\n*\tEngages stakeholders early in the development process to ensure feedback and buy-in.   SmartAirLA is guided by an Advisory Committee of our partners and will establish Health Care, Data and Pilot Community Working Groups to provide strategic direction to achieve our pilot project objectives.\r\n*\t“Learns by doing” by designing the pilot scope through the “Minimum Viable Product” approach.   The pilot is focused within the catchment area to achieve two outcomes: 1) measure health care benefits; and 2) identify environmental factors that cause asthma. These learnings will be applied to scale-up deployment.\r\n\r\nThe SmartAirLA data repository will serve as the connective tissue between asthma patients, health care providers, community organizations, and government agencies to adopt preventive measures to reduce exposure risks to asthma incidence and exacerbation in community populations.   \r\n\r\nKey features of the SmartAirLA Data Repository are:\r\n*\tOpen platform to maximize outcomes  \r\n*\tTargeted to stakeholders who take action\r\n*\tUser-Centric\r\n"
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your activation.: "SmartAirLA will measure success based on whether the community we serve has ownership in our work.   SmartAirLA believes that the successful deployment of the smart inhalers requires community stakeholders, such as community leaders, parents, and teachers, to actively contribute to the design and execution of the smart inhaler deployment.   By mobilizing community support, SmartAirLA can effectively deploy the smart inhalers to the asthmatic children with the most need.  Community ownership will be measured by the frequency and number of community members participating in SmartAirLA events and the actions taken by SmartAirLA based on the recommendations of the Pilot Advisory Group. \r\n\r\nSmartAirLA’s has already gained enthusiastic stakeholder support.   \r\n*\tWilmington community representatives have recommended three schools as catchment areas and that the pilot initiation begins as soon as possible.\r\n*\tCity of Los Angeles Information Technology Agency has coordinated intra-agency cooperation to use the SmartAirLA data to identify measures to reduce asthma risk exposure.\r\n*\tLos Angeles County Department of Public Health’s Chief Science Officer, Director of the Division of Assessment, Planning, and Quality and Director of the Maternal, Child, and Adolescent Health Division, will mobilize health care providers to participate in the pilot.\r\n"
Where do you hope this activation or your organization will be in five years?: "SmartAirLA’s vision is to become the smart IoT technology platform to improve health equity for underserved communities.   In five years, our objective is to deploy 5,000 smart inhalers to underserved asthmatic children throughout Los Angeles County through multiple partnerships with community and health care organizations.  This deployment will be financially sustainable through health care shared savings from the significant decrease in asthma hospitalizations (target of 50% reductions) as a result of improved patient care and reduction of asthma risks exposure.\r\n\r\nBased on the data collected by the smart inhalers, the SmartAirLA Citizen Science Data Repository provides real-time forecasts of asthma hotspots throughout Los Angeles county through interactive social media platforms.  As a result, \r\n*\tGovernment agencies take policy and enforcement actions to reduce the exposure risks of asthma.  For example, Los Angeles regional air quality agencies utilize the SmartAirLA asthma hotspots data to assess potential pollution hotspots and identify possible locations for closer inspection, monitoring, and mitigation action; the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health could fine-tune/re-focus elements of its health outreach and education programs in identified areas.\r\n*\tCommunity organizations that advocate initiatives reduce the exposure risks that could lead to asthma events, including education campaigns among community residents, preferential walking or exercise routes to reduce exposure risks in hotspot areas, or local campaigns for greenspace in the areas of identified hotspots. \r\n*\tLocal health organizations work with asthma patients in the identified areas to integrate possible personal protection and avoidance patterns of behavior to reduce the likelihood of triggering events, through the referral of patients to community-specific education programs that help manage asthma in the local neighborhood.\r\n*\tBusinesses use the asthmatic hotspot data to target the environmental mitigation measures. For example, freight companies from the Port of Los Angeles combine the asthmatic hotspot data with WAZE mapping data to time and reroute deliveries from the high risks asthmatic neighborhoods or use electric vehicles when traveling in those areas.  Utilities and businesses use the data to deploy clean energy technologies, such as solar and wind energy to reduce air pollution emissions.\r\n"
