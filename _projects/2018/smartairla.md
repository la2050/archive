  SmartAirLA seeks to:

   * Improve asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) outcomes among residents by providing actionable information to support self management

   * Identify hotspots of respiratory disease in the community, better understand how environmental drivers are influencing these patterns.



   SmartAirLA is modeled after Air Louisville, in which the city of Louisville and a coalition of private, community health, and philanthropic organizations provided more than 1,100 smart inhalers to asthma sufferers.



   Within 12 months of the smart inhaler deployment, AIR Louisville participants reported:

   * Average of 82% reduction in asthma rescue inhaler use

   * Doubled their symptom-free days

   * Better sleep, with an average of 19% increase in symptom-free nights

   * 29% of uncontrolled participants gained control of their asthma



   The data collected by the smart inhalers empowered Louisville City to:

   * Identify buffer zones around pollution emitters and set pollution limits

   * Build greenbelts to reduce particulate matter pollution by 60% in high asthmatic neighborhoods

   * Reroute freight routes from high asthmatic neighborhoods



   To achieve our outcomes, SmartAirLA will deploy smart inhalers through partnerships with local environmental health organizations and health care providers to educate patients on the health benefits of the smart inhalers.



   SmartAirLA will design and execute a pilot project to deploy the smart inhalers to underserved asthmatic children (age 5 to 17) in the Wilmington neighborhood of Los Angeles County.



   The targeted outcomes from the SmartAirLA Pilot include:

   * Improve quality outcomes for patients

   * Reduce health care costs

   * Identify potential hotspot locations where increased asthmatic events may occur

   * Provide the collected data to public and nongovernment organizations to implement preventive actions.
