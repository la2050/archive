  Los Angeles has the the most rapidly rising rents in America, the highest
  rates of homelessness, and the fourth highest rate of income inequality among
  the country’s largest metropolitan areas. These issues hit low-income
  communities of color the hardest. But while 84% of the county’s eligible
  voters are registered, turnout in the city’s municipal elections is
  notoriously low, resulting in measures getting passed with fewer than 200,000
  votes in a city with a population of almost four million.
   
   
   
   Democracy grants power to individuals. It affords every American the opportunity to be heard and to hold elected officials accountable. But democracy only has power when it’s active. Many Americans, particularly those Americans who have historically been ignored or marginalized, are disengaged from the political process, their power to improve their lives and their communities untapped. UPAS seeks to address the glaring inequity apparent in the city’s civic life and engagement.
   
   
   
   Too often, grassroots advocacy groups approach organizing as a part-time or volunteer endeavour; built on a belief that if you can get enough people out onto the streets then things will change. But that’s not how power transitions. Organizing individuals with little personal history of civic engagement is a full-time job that requires professional experience and knowledge of the formal skills necessary to mobilize diverse groups of people around a common cause. It then requires that those same professionals relinquish their own power, step aside, and allow the individual to take the reins and lead. 
   
   
   
   United Parents and Students (UPAS) fundamentally believes that in order to secure long-lasting community progress and revitalization, community organizing must be recognized as a profession requiring vital and identifiable knowledge and strategic skills. UPAS uses a training model successfully used by the Industrial Areas Foundation since the 1970s, built on the iron rule of organizing: “Never do for others what they can do for themselves.” Nowhere is this mindset more important than in activism; UPAS organizers ground training on an understanding that systemic change must be pursued by the community itself rather than through the efforts of others.
   
   
   
   UPAS builds the capacity of grassroots coalitions by fostering vibrant community hubs in many of Los Angeles’s traditionally politically silent neighborhoods. In these hubs, individuals identify the root causes and socio-political context of the challenges they face, persuasively communicate on a wide range of issues, and organize friends and neighbors to take collaborative action. Schools are a natural partner for such work; they are multi-generational centers of learning with a built-in, responsive audience of families acutely aware of community challenges. UPAS is a 501(c)(3) non-profit that partners with existing organizations to leverage their communities to civic action.
