  STIPES is a partnership between the Downtown Long Beach Alliance (DLBA), the
  Long Beach Downtown Development Corporation, and the Institute for Innovation
  & Entrepreneurship (IIE) at California State University Long Beach. The series
  is focused on providing the tools and skills needed to identify and file
  patents and other intellectual property protections related to
  green/sustainable technologies, launching scalable businesses promoting
  entrepreneurship with California State University Long Beach’s Institute for
  Innovation & Entrepreneurship. This program complements the DLBA’s ongoing
  Entrepreneurship Education Series, Woman Owned Business Accelerator, 1 Million
  Cups, Google workshop, and Small Business Grant programs. The IIE will provide
  educational content and a certificate of completion to those who complete the
  entire program as we organically identify and support minority and women-owned
  business innovation in Long Beach. The STIPES initiative provides multiple
  week training workshops in partnership with IIE that focus on identifying the
  requirements to file patents, protect copyrights and trademarks and launching
  successful entrepreneurial businesses in Long Beach.
