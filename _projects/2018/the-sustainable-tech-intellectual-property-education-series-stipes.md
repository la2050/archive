  technology businesses, file patents & other intellectual property protections
  to scale businesses. This activation focuses on minority & women-owned firms,
  startups with the goals of generating IP filings, driving venture capital

Describe in greater detail how your activation will make LA the best place?: "STIPES is a partnership between the Downtown Long Beach Alliance (DLBA), the Long Beach Downtown Development Corporation, and the Institute for Innovation & Entrepreneurship (IIE) at California State University Long Beach. The series is focused on providing the tools and skills needed to identify and file patents and other intellectual property protections related to green/sustainable technologies, launching scalable businesses promoting entrepreneurship with California State University Long Beach’s Institute for Innovation & Entrepreneurship. This program complements the DLBA’s ongoing Entrepreneurship Education Series, Woman Owned Business Accelerator, 1 Million Cups, Google workshop, and Small Business Grant programs. The IIE will provide educational content and a certificate of completion to those who complete the entire program as we organically identify and support minority and women-owned business innovation in Long Beach. The STIPES initiative provides multiple week training workshops in partnership with IIE that focus on identifying the requirements to file patents, protect copyrights and trademarks and launching successful entrepreneurial businesses in Long Beach.\r\n\r\nTypical program outline:\r\n\r\nCost to Attend: FREE \r\n\r\nCurriculum schedule:\r\n\r\nWeek 1: Idea to Patent, Copyright or Trademark Filing for Entrepreneurs Part 1\r\n\r\nWeek 2: Idea to Patent, Copyright or Trademark Filing for Entrepreneurs Part 2\r\n\r\nWeek 3: The Value of a Business Plan \r\n\r\nWeek 4: Your Marketing Plan \r\n\r\nWeek 5: Financial Aspects of Your Business: Accounting & Financing \r\n\r\nWeek 6: Where to Locate Your Business \r\n\r\nWeek 7: Legal and HR Questions \r\n\r\nWeek 8: May 12, *PitchFest, Small Business Grant Awards,and a certificate ceremony\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the STIPES series, we’ll host a Pitch competition to promote applications from STIPES attendees competing for Small Business Grants that are targeted to support the leasing of office space, reducing barriers of entry to open a business within the City of Long Beach, with awards supporting Women and Minority Owned businesses.  This effort will support the City of Long Beach 10-year Economic Development Blueprint that encourages inclusion and diversity in growing the Long Beach economy."
How will your activation engage Angelenos to make LA the best place: >-
  Downtown Long Beach (in the shadows of LA) is the only waterfront downtown
  between San Diego and San Francisco. As the creative class jobs continue to
  expand from Santa Monica South to downtown LB we need to continue to support
  and expand our organic entrepreneurial business ecosystem.  The Ports of LA
  and Long Beach have recently committed over $14 billion in green technology
  investment  and CSULB has made substantial investments in Sustainable Energy &
  Environmental research in partnerships with The Port of Long Beach. As
  consumer and business efficiency requires sustainability, our goal is that
  Long Beach leads the way as a sustainable city. The IIE will build the bridge
  with the intellectual and human resources from CSULB and the expertise from
  local institutions. This will lead to a strong partnership to grow the green
  tech sector in the community, enhancing Long Beach's status as the premier
  sustainable city and a global model for others to follow.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your activation.: "Our focus is on creative industries such as developing new green technologies, creating platforms and apps to generate efficiencies in energy and resource use, expanding the design sector, all of which are linked to the three pillars of sustainability - people, planet and profit. Examples of measures of success include the following:\r\n\r\n# Businesses attended by the creative industries\r\n\r\n# of new creative class businesses created\r\n\r\n# of jobs created through the program\r\n\r\n# of Minority- and women-owned firms created \r\n\r\n# of Patents created through the workshop\r\n\r\n# of copyrights and trademarks generated\r\n\r\n# of CSULB Students attending programs\r\n\r\n# of CSULB graduates remaining in LA county after graduation\r\n\r\nHow much matching venture capital investment is awarded\r\n\r\n"
Where do you hope this activation or your organization will be in five years?: "When a college graduate/student/entrepreneur thinks about where they can find support to launch their idea our expectation is they think about Long Beach first, due to the resources and success of prior entrepreneurial launches supported through our business expansion, attraction, and retention programming.  Expanding the creative community to support the development of a truly sustainable city that focuses on the people, planet and profit!\r\n"
