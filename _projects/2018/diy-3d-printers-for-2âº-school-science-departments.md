title: DIY 3D Printers for 2รยบ School Science Departments
project_summary: ''
Please describe the activation your organization seeks to launch.: >-
  3D printers will likely rival the microscope as an iconic fixture in a working
  science lab.  This project aims to introduce science teachers to 3D printing
  by guiding them through the assembly of one self replicating 3D printer over
  the course of one professional development day.
Describe in greater detail how your activation will make LA the best place?: >-
  An obstacle faced by teachers in delivering new technology to students is lack
  of teaching training.  This project will allow members of a science department
  to learn about 3d printers by assembling a printer for the department over the
  course of one professional development day.
How will your activation engage Angelenos to make LA the best place: >-
  Teach the teachers, and the teachers can teach not only their students, but
  also the community.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your activation.: >-
  Success will equal one assembled 3d printer for every science department that
  would like one.
Where do you hope this activation or your organization will be in five years?: One printer for every science department in the county.
