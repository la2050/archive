  Technology has changed the way we do business, pursue education, find jobs,
  and communicate. Yet in the country that invented the Internet, nearly one in
  five Americans (64 million), disproportionately from low-income and minority
  communities, are not connected to the Internet at home, forcing them to use
  inconvenient public sources to access basic services. The global impact of the
  digital divide lies in how it compounds and deepens other social inequalities.
  For example, 80% of K-12 students need Internet to do homework, 90% of college
  applications are filled out online, and 90% of job applications are hosted
  online. An unemployed person who has Internet at home will be employed over
  seven weeks faster, due to availability of online job search platforms and
  advice, which translates into over $5,000 in additional income over a year.
  Across the realms of education, employment, and beyond, the means of
  advancement are digital in this day and age. 
   
   
   
   EveryoneOn is committed to eliminating the digital divide by making high-speed, low-cost internet, computers/tablets, and free digital literacy training accessible to all unconnected people in the U.S. By employing a dynamic strategy through the Digital Equity Champion Initiative, we plan to connect low-income households throughout the county, a population that is dramatically underserved and the least likely to be connected. If we can eliminate the digital divide within low-income communities with this initiative, we can use connectivity to create social mobility for all. 
   
   
   
   Connecting people to the internet creates opportunities for an abundance of connections. Internet connectivity is imperative in providing all Los Angeles students with access to early education programs, the capability to graduate from high school and be college and career ready, and acts as a key tool in parents ability to be engaged and empowered to direct their childrenâ€™s learning. Connecting through social media, technological products and an increasingly interconnected society allows residents to feel like the world is their backyard. Today, the ultimate vehicle for opportunity is through the internet.
