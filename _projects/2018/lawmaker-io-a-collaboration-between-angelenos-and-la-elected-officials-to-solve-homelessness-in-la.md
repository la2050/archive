  Homelessness is the most pressing issue afflicting Los Angeles today. Over
  57,000 people are without a home each night — 5,000 are children, and 4,000
  are senior citizens. There is public consensus that something must be done,
  but a plurality of us has yet to agree on solutions, so little progress has
  been made. With the passage of Prop. HHH and Measure H to fund homeless
  housing and services, LA has an opportunity. How do we build the political
  will for tangible policies that lift the homeless, and Los Angeles, out of
  this crisis? Political will is entirely rooted in unity, consensus, and
  collaboration — in a word, connection. 
   
   
   
   LawMaker proposes building this connection with a 1-year public activation that brings LA residents, homelessness leaders, and elected officials together to answer one question: “What programs to help the homeless can you support in your neighborhood?” The public dialogue will focus on increasing awareness of key levers impacting homelessness and building support for tangible policies to help individuals and families off the streets. 
   
   
   
   LawMaker is an online platform, but not everyone has equal access to technology. To ensure broad participation, LawMaker will work with the City’s neighborhood councils to hold public events in each of LA’s city council districts. These meetings will be advertised well in advance, shared through LawMaker's partners and the NCs, and will be streamed/transcribed online at LawMaker.io. In collaboration with the City, LawMaker will publicize these neighborhood council events as a way to truly connect and constructively discuss issues around homelessness. 
   
   
   
   To guide this public conversation toward a productive and tangible resolution, LawMaker will convene a Leadership Board of six elected officials, six leaders from the homeless service sector, and six civic leaders. This board will guide the various phases of the conversation and provide feedback to stakeholders at regular intervals. For example, problems identified in Phase 1’s open call for problem statements, will then be segmented by the Board into distinct verticals to be addressed in Phase 2, for example: affordable housing, homelessness prevention, mental health services, drug rehabilitation services, veterans programs, and safe parking zones. The elected officials and other board members will also be responsible for consolidating community feedback into draft proposals to help the homeless with programs distributed across the city. See the budget for an outline of the phased process.
   
   
   
   The policies developed will be presented to LA residents for review and comment via public government meetings, neighborhood council meetings, and via the online voting/discussion platform at LawMaker.io. The public nature of these discussions, and the commitment made by the participating elected officials, are designed to build public support and pressure for concrete legislative action based on stakeholder input in the following legislative cycle.
