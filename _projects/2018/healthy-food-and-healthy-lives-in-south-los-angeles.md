  “Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.” Martin Luther King. 
   
   
   
   Affecting all indirectly applies to access to fresh healthy food for all Angelenos. How can we all live happily when some of our neighbors are hungry? How can we all live happily when some of our neighbors live only on fast food burgers, beans and rice, and canned food? 
   
   
   
   Everyone want to help. Everyone is okay bringing in some cans for the food drive at work. Everyone is okay buying a sandwich for a homeless person. Everyone is okay with giving a extra dollar or five dollars at the supermarket checkout to support hunger programs. These are limited, short term solutions Most people will feel conflicted by these actions. 
   
   
   
   Our Activation will give Angelenos the opportunity to take unique action to support My Friends House, an organization with is making a long term impact to nutrition and a health in South Los Angeles.
   
   
   
   The world is now based on connections between people at every level. When Angelenos think about a restaurant, our activativation project will have given them the opportunity to connect that restaurant with My Friends House to provide it with fresh food.

project_measure: >-
  Our primary goal is the distribution of food to families every week. We
  currently supply 150 families each week. Our targets is to expand to 200
  families in 12 months and 300 families in 24 months.
   
   
   
   To Support Our Food Distribution, we want to do three things. First, grow our gardening programs to 1000 actively producing square feet. Second, expand the number of restaurants contributing food to My Friends Place from 5 to 30. Third, incrase the amount of free produce that is directly donated by people, mostly during their own supermarket visits.
