  Our primary goal is the distribution of food to families every week. We
  currently supply 150 families each week. Our targets is to expand to 200
  families in 12 months and 300 families in 24 months.
   
   
   
   To Support Our Food Distribution, we want to do three things. First, grow our gardening programs to 1000 actively producing square feet. Second, expand the number of restaurants contributing food to My Friends Place from 5 to 30. Third, incrase the amount of free produce that is directly donated by people, mostly during their own supermarket visits.

Please describe the activation your organization seeks to launch.: >-
  Los Angeles has an amazing number of restaurants, farmer’s markets, and
  supermarkets in some areas.  We need volunteers to connect to those
  organizations and individuals who can provide healthy food and skills to those
  who do not have access to them.
Describe in greater detail how your activation will make LA the best place?: "“Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.”  Martin Luther King.  \r\n\r\nAffecting all indirectly applies to access to fresh healthy food for all Angelenos.  How can we all live happily when some of our neighbors are hungry?

When Angelenos think about a restaurant, our activativation project will have given them the opportunity to connect that restaurant with My Friends House to provide it with fresh food.  "
How will your activation engage Angelenos to make LA the best place: "--Have Angelenos donate fresh food during their supermarket visits.  Food banks do it for canned food and dry food. Will they do it for fresh produce?\r\n\r\n--Have Angelenos canvas restaurants and give out flyers about MFH and our restaurant collection program.  Let the restaurant management know about My Friends House and our Food Pantry needs.\r\n\r\n--Have Angelenos expand the gardening program at My Friends House.  We current have one garden that needs renovation and want to expand quickly to two other gardens.\r\n\r\n--Have people help with food collection and distribution\r\n\r\n--Have people do a social media campaign promoting MFH and issues of hunger, poor nutrition, and poor access to fresh produce.\r\n"
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your activation.: "Our primary goal is the distribution of food to families every week.  We currently supply 150 families each week.

Where do you hope this activation or your organization will be in five years?: "My Friends House in 2023\r\n--Providing healthy food to 1,500 families per week, a ten-fold increase.\r\n--Expansive network of collaborators:  restaurants, supermarkets, farms, food manufacturers\r\n--Numerous gardens throughout Los Angeles\r\n"
