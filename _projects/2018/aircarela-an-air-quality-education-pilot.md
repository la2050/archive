title: 'AirCareLA, an Air Quality Education Pilot'
project_summary: >-
  Deploy 150 air quality sensors on streetlights Citywide to provide
  environmental data at a local level in order to evaluate the disparity of air
  quality among communities & impacting factors.

  The program will measure success by completion of the following metrics: 
   
   
   
   * The completed deployment of the air quality sensors and transmission of data. 
   
    
   
   * The establishment of a public education program based on the air quality data which is accumulated 
   
   and the development of new community-based programs with the goal of mitigating the harmful effects of air pollution.

make_la_great: "Los Angeles has some of the most polluted air in the nation. The trend over the last 25 years has shown significant improvements in smog and pollutants until recently. In the last couple of years this trend has shown an increase in the pollutants. Air quality information from the California Environmental Protection Agency’s Air Resources Board has been invaluable to identify the most highly-impacted communities statewide — many of which are found in Los Angeles — and thus provide a warning for those that are particularly sensitive to the health hazards of air pollution such as asthmatics, young children, the elderly, pregnant women and people with compromised immune systems but does not provide this information at a community level. \r\n \r\n  \r\n \r\n This proposal will provide local air quality information directly to the City policy makers, as we are currently reliant on information provided to us by the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD). SCAQMD inspectors are spread far and wide, and required to cover the entire Southland. It would be a tremendous advantage to have access to our own air quality data within the 500 square miles that constitutes the City of Los Angeles. This could lead to development of our own air quality polices, and ultimately programs designed to mitigate the harmful effects of our residents.\r\n \r\n  \r\n \r\n Additionally, this will give residents a sense of ownership and responsibility for their communities and their destiny. Air quality is impacted by large issues such as car emissions, but can also be impacted at a local level due to traffic patterns, zoning, industrial uses, and the number of vegetation and trees that are present. This information will allow the City and those communities that partner with this proposal to observe the disparities in communities and attempt to link them to specific contributing factors. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n The data gathered will become available on the City’s open data portal so the public is informed. In addition, this project has the potential to develop and place air quality sensors “beacons” that will provide an instantaneous visual indication of the current air quality in the local area."
project_proposal_description: >-
  The City of LA seeks to use its streetlights to initiate discussions about air
  quality at local community level. Funding will enable the City to manage an
  Air Quality Data Collection Pilot that will provide valuable information
  regarding local air quality. The data can inform communities about impacts
  that may be contributing to their livability & health. This will incentivize
  communities to become engaged in policy decisions: reducing traffic,
  encouraging walking/biking, zoning decisions.

  Los Angeles has some of the most polluted air in the nation. The trend over
  the last 25 years has shown significant improvements in smog and pollutants
  until recently. In the last couple of years this trend has shown an increase
  in the pollutants. Air quality information from the California Environmental
  Protection Agency’s Air Resources Board has been invaluable to identify the
  most highly-impacted communities statewide — many of which are found in Los
  Angeles — and thus provide a warning for those that are particularly sensitive
  to the health hazards of air pollution such as asthmatics, young children, the
  elderly, pregnant women and people with compromised immune systems but does
  not provide this information at a community level. 
   
    
   
   This proposal will provide local air quality information directly to the City policy makers, as we are currently reliant on information provided to us by the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD).

project_proposal_engage: >-
  Local air quality data will enable City policy makers to engage residents in
  an effort to make differences at the municipal level by developing programs
  that will mitigate air quality impacts. Current air quality sensors are not
  locally based, so communities do not feel they have the power or control to
  impact air quality.
project_five_years: >-
  We hope that as Smart City technology evolves, the use of sensors on
  streetlights will grow and enable data collection regarding various interests.
  This will provide real time data to the community and public officials,
  enabling policy direction and the enhancements to improve the livability for
  all residents in the City of Los Angeles.

  an effort to make differences at the municipal level by developing programs
  that will mitigate air quality impacts.  Current air quality sensors are not
  locally based, so communities do not feel they have the power or control to
