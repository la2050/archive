title: "Hip Hop & Walls For All\r\nWhere paint, beats, words & moves, collide with pride!"
project_summary: ''
Please describe the activation your organization seeks to launch.: >-
  We want to build a plaza where mural making, percussion and performance all
  happen in the same public place. We see this open to everyone to work out
  their skills, showcase their work or just hang out together in an environment
  that is conducive to creating live. We know that this will draw young "risk
  taking" brains, like teenagers, just like roaming the streets do but this will
  harness that energy and elevate it in ways that has them left feeling great
  about themselves.
Describe in greater detail how your activation will make LA the best place?: "This first plaza will break ground on Los Angeles being the first city in the country to embrace a public problem with a solution that is daring and dynamic in the same way that the city actually is underneath it's Hollywood veneer. This concept will give rise to unbridled social networking, happenings will occur to unite friends in ways that parks are supposed to do but seldom give support to the arts. The kicker though is that it will also help shift the paradigm of understanding that the ARTS are so tightly choreographed inside of SPORTS, that mastery and muscle memory and practice are at the core of all their greatness. The paradigm will assist Los Angeles in shifting it's already stellar Recs and Parks inclusion for sport toward the one thing that it's so well known for - the visual and performing arts. Our idea is not just for parks it's for open spaces, which happen to be plentiful in parks but we can also see these in public transportation hubs and civic centers throughout the city. The message of inclusion for art, dance, poetry, percussion, and more to happen openly will hug the kids who we know are feeling alienated by the \"pay to play\" type of locations for this kind of working out.\r\n\r\nWe will know that it's effective because we will ask them to check in on social media, but nothing that will track them, just count. While our focus behaviorally is on young people 10-25, we know that this is a very young at heart city and we thoroughly expect that these plazas will be used by anyone who wants to spin on a stage or tap out a beat. Anyone who wants to propose with a mural behind them which was painted that day only for that day... with their friends playing drums on the percussion instruments. \r\n\r\nWe have seen how much money the city spends in graffiti abatement and we will closely watch our 311 phone calls to note if they go up or go down in neighborhoods where there are these walls and plazas exist. \r\n\r\nWe know that LA wants to give this money to 5 ideas and that you might even be looking for something in particular, or have a notion of what LA needs. We have studied this specific solution to graffiti and young people's need to connect to this city in positive ways for over eight years. We know that there are zero solutions which touch on their friend groups, their affinity for being outdoors, their social structure which has them wanting to be seen, heard and shared as well as their unmonitored home life. \r\n\r\nThis city has a chance to hug them in ways that it never has, by opening it's arms to their form of self-expression, knowing fully that if they have a chance to express the first layer of how they are feeling, freely, that they will be open to positive influence and education after it. If we keep shutting them down, saying they can't be seen, heard or that they don't have what it takes, because money isn't in their hands to practice, then they will continue to own the city in their own way. \r\n\r\nThis project will change their course."
How will your activation engage Angelenos to make LA the best place: "We will use high schools where we teach M2ART & DESIGN and sites where we have M2ART4ALL implemented to tell people where these plazas are and what they could do there. We will engage other organizations, like GetLit, and TheGR818ers and other musical orgs which focus on this demographic and self expression to plan events and to tell their audiences. \r\n\r\nWe know that there are many other influences to hit other demographics, like Frances Anderton at KCRW who love design and urban development. We know that students and teachers could use it to showcase their lessons. \r\n\r\nWe know that the Olympics will soon be swirling around us and this is a dynamic place for public interaction and engagement. Nothing like this has ever been done permanently in Los Angeles nor have we seen it in any other city in the U.S. or Western Europe. It's truly groundbreaking in theory and concept.\r\n\r\nWe know that there are tools like geo-cashing and games like Pokemon Go that look for areas like this, we already have been tagged at our sites in NOHO for our mural making. \r\n\r\nThis is truly an \"If we build it they will come\" concept. What a better place to showcase such a thing. New York doesn't even do it yet and that is the home to Broadway and the MOMA... the home of graffiti and hip hop. They don't have it yet, but they will because our co-founder is already at work with his home town, talking to the parks department there. Imagine this in Central Park, too. \r\n\r\nAs LA goes, so goes the nation."
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your activation.: "Success is a perceptive measure when you are building something that no one is asking for directly. It's like eating well. The measure is in how you feel and less like what your blood count is. \r\n\r\nWe will know if this works if it is being used. If we note and count how many times the artwork changes or how often we see a collection of people at the site.\r\n\r\nOur friends in organizations will aide us by noting their participation as well. We will survey people through volunteer weekends where the specific engagement will be to document how people are using the site and with what regularity. We will do this once every six weeks until we feel that it has a pattern of use that is deemed equal to park statistics for a field or court.\r\n\r\nWe will also measure it times 1000 if other areas ask for more of them. Should we multiply by only one, that will be an exponential shift in the cities participation in the arts and live art component to self-expression.\r\n\r\nIf we see four new pieces of art or murals worked on per month, that is success. If we see people tapping on the drums, even idylly, and if someone stands on the stage to mime a gesture... those are the beginnings of success for this project and it's impact on others.\r\n\r\nReal success will be when we can teach at these sites and bring art education to them, just like AYSO brings coaches to a soccer field."
Where do you hope this activation or your organization will be in five years?: "We hope that we have multiplied this in every major city in the country and that we have teachers in those same cities teaching our curriculums in high schools and in public spaces. We hope that we begin to have competitions at these sites instilling a desire to win and better one's self. We hope that we are an organization that is so fully funded that we can't find enough teachers to teach where the need is and that our students have to hurry to graduate college so they can return to teach.\r\n\r\nAnd that workout walls in all parks are a norm... as normal as skateparks."
