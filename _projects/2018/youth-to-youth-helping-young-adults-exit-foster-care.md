  Exiting out of foster care can be a terrifying experience. For many young
  adults who have elected to stay in extended foster care, it will be their
  first time living on their own. Most of these young people have no support
  network, and no one to help them adjust to an ever complicated world. But they
  can have a CASA. It's our job to recruit more Court Appointed Special
  Advocates to support these youth, and it's our community's opportunity to show
  up for them and say, "You are not alone."
   
   
   
   There are over 2,500 youth in Extended Foster Care in Los Angeles. In the next year or two, they will exit the system, and without help, their futures are challenging. According to a 2011 study, of the youth who age out of foster care in Los Angeles County, one third experienced extreme poverty, 20% received outpatient mental health services, 25% spent time in jail, only 25% were consistently employed, and nearly 40% become homeless. Only 4% will graduate from college. Additionally, young men and women of color are particularly over-represented in this system, and frequently struggle to access and maintain services available to them to help them successfully gain independence. 
   
   
   
   CASA volunteers are critical in helping these young adults negotiate the gauntlet of paperwork, meetings, and phone calls needed in order to access critical social and victim services. CASA of Los Angeles currently serves 100 of these young adults with intensive advocacy, and is launching programming to serve significantly more. This is an opportunity to support young adults in taking charge of their lives and futures â€” working with them on relationships, problem solving, personal responsibility and skill building to ensure they will thrive. As the students in the Cal State systems reflect the diversity of LA, this program will not only help to better support young men and women of color in the dependency care system, but will target recruitment of more culturally diverse volunteers. Through this project, CASA will recruit youth to serve youth. By training graduate level college students to help young adults exit out of foster care, we will be activating more young Los Angelenos in life-changing volunteer work. But most importantly, we will be helping to change the lives of young people who just need one person to help them succeed.
