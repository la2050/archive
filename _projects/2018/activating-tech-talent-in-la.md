   HISTORY OF FRESHSTART BOOTCAMP

   Freshstart Bootcamp was a creation of the Mayor's Office of Economic Opportunity and with key feedback from Ms. Jan Perry. We are excited about the expansion of the program and look forward to collaborating with each of your WorkSource centers more deeply.



   Freshstart Bootcamp helps candidates from non-traditional backgrounds learn computer science fundamentals and develop careers in the technology industry with major corporations. Trainees — ages 16 to 60 — learn about computational thinking, algorithms, functions, conditionals, abstraction, relay programming and the internet.



   Nonprofit partners ensure that candidates are job ready for internships in companies. We are passionate and committed to providing sustainable and long-term economic opportunities for those in Los Angeles in technology using the best of technology.



   Freshstart Bootcamp is one of the many Fair Chance Hiring initiatives sponsored by the Mayor’s Office of Economic Opportunity that create employment opportunities for historically disadvantaged communities in Los Angeles.
