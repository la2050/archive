  Dependent on people, place, policy, and culture, community resilience is a
  vital component of a healthy and thriving Los Angeles. However, top-down
  resilience-building initiatives marginalize the voices of the most vulnerable
  among us, and inclusive resilience-building initiatives bank on the
  participation of people who are already overwhelmed and under-resourced. The
  organizations that provide the services, education, and support to these
  vulnerable populations are the backbone of LA’s human safety care net. These
  are the groups that do gang prevention/intervention, wraparound services to
  youth in foster care and probation systems, legal and educational services for
  undocumented immigrants, primary health and dental care to low-income people,
  and supportive housing for those without homes. Their front-line staff,
  organizers, and volunteers often share some of the same vulnerabilities of the
  people they serve, and the work itself is challenging and draining. Although
  it is well known that vicarious trauma and significant burnout are
  commonplace, funding challenges prevent organizations from providing the
  support their people need to make programs and initiatives effective and
  sustainable. If the people supporting the community are stumbling under the
  weight of their work, the community itself suffers and does not have the
  bandwidth to engage with large-scale change efforts. To activate community
  level resilience, we need to take a foundational step; we need to grow the
  resilience of the people on the front lines of the safety net. By resourcing
  and connecting the professionals, peer specialists, and community members, the
  people who are needed to make systems change will have the needed
  social-emotional support and actually be change-ready. 
   
   Our project begins by bringing committed partner organizations together into two regional community focus groups (South Bay/South LA and Antelope Valley), where we will learn more about their specific challenges and strengths. Based on this information, we will develop and deliver 30 compassion fatigue and resilience-building workshops using a curriculum based on The Resilience Toolkit, a holistic evidence-informed practice and process with a demonstrated track record in the LA area. Trauma-informed and culturally competent perspectives will be woven into the entire program. We will certify 24 key community partner representatives and provide technical assistance to organizations to develop ongoing programming for staff and volunteers. As the organizations’ worker capacity and internal resources increase, we will mentor them in establishing similar programming for their clients, students, or members. We will conduct a comprehensive program evaluation. The program will culminate in a series of regional convenings of partner organizations, other community stakeholders, and funders to discuss how the outcomes of the program can leverage their increased personal/organizational resilience to the community level.
