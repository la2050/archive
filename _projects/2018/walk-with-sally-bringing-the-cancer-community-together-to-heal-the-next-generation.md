  Our goal is to activate 200 new volunteers throughout this cancer community
  and beyond that will help support every child facing the trauma of a parent,
  guardian or sibling’s cancer journey in whatever stage their journey with one
  on one mentoring over the course of their school life and create a circle of
  community around not only each child but each child within a family and
  ultimately around every family facing this crisis today, tomorrow and until we
  eradicate it all together.

  Within the FTK Social Club, WWS intends to engage young professionals within a
  multifaceted array of other networking events. WWS will use the same bylaws
  and board structure to create the FTK Social Club North Branch. This will
  engage adults 25 - 40 to think about civic engagement and what it can look
  like. We will thereby connect hundreds of like minded young citizens
  throughout the city.
   
   
   
   Through our Junior Mentor program we will be engaging youth between the ages of 14-17 impacted by a parent, guardian or sibling's cancer not only through their own one on one mentoring but also through a series of volunteer activities. In addition, we will be exposing them to opportunities, bonding them closer to each other, and training them to be leaders within our city.
   
   
   
   And finally through new recruitment avenues and a healthy engagement system we will be connecting volunteers of all ages and paths of life with each other and with the children who need them, in every corner of LA!
