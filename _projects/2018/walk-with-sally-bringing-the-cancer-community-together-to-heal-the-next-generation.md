  Walk With Sally is LA’s premier voice on connecting volunteers to the most
  impactful opportunities as well as to each other.
   
   
   
   We propose three pillars of engagement and asks for your help to see them grow across the city!
   
   
   
   Engaging Young Professionals
   
   Creating Young Leaders Who Give Back
   
   Recruitment & Engagement Management
   
   
   
   We have long been the hub for young professionals to find a place to give back while connecting to a network of like-minded individuals. With the new FTK Social Club or our For The Kids Young and Young at heart professionals group that was recently formalized, we have created a community service platform in which these young volunteers can give of themselves and become a resource for other young professionals as well as the organization as a whole. Membership in FTK requires a minimum of 15 hours of volunteer service to WWS within the year and in exchange they receive networking events and speaker series aimed at the issues they care most about. They have their own governing board and create their own content and events! It is a unique formula that crosses all ages and creates a regular stream of volunteers for the organization. With this working model, we aim to replicate FTK in another part of the city.
   
   
   
   With so many youth that we are investing in long term, many of them find are looking for something that can help guide them into secondary education and civic engagement. WWS heard the call and created our Junior Mentors Program, Mentees ages 14 — 17 that are ready to begin their path towards volunteerism and leadership. This group also agrees to a certain amount of minimum volunteer hours at WWS’s Friendship Activities or Fundraisers and in return they receive curated content from Advisory Board, FTK and other resources as well as special opportunities and a chance at not only WWS’s Fred’ Future Young Leaders Scholarship but also other community scholarships within our Hub of resources.
   
   
   
   For the first time since our inception, Walk With Sally has hired a Volunteer Recruitment and Manager to specifically create the pathways to engagement for prospective volunteers through Walk With Sally. While the pathway to find our beneficiaries is predominantly and clearly 85% through our schools, the one to find the many mentors we need to fulfill the need in the city is not. Therefore, this person’s responsibilities include searching for opportunities to find and recruit not only WWS mentors but also WWS Ambassadors that can help WWS leverage growth much faster than we can relying solely on our own internal resources by attending Outreach events when a staff person cannot, or volunteering for one of our special events committees, or Friendship Activities where they are able to interact directly with our Mentees.
   
   
   
   And lastly, we will hire a 5th Program Coordinator to work remotely and along side our current Program Dept. in order to expand these as well as our mentoring program throughout DTLA, East LA, The Valley, Pasadena and beyond
