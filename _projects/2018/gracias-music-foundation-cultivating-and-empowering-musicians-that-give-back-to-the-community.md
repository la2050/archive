  Concerts:
   
   GMF has been holding a series of small community concerts in which it brings the music to the people, such as in hospitals and senior living facilities. GMF believes that music can heal the soul and that no one should be excluded.
   
   
   
   After School Programs:
   
   The tremendous number of musical instruments and equipment left behind at many school without adequate funding or people to teach them, has created a void. GMF aims to fill the void by bringing these instruments back to life. In addition to their musical skills, GMF hopes to greater music appreciation, amplify itâ€™s history, and bolster the heart behind the music.
