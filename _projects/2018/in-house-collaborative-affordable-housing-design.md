  IN House is a collaborative affordable housing design initiative between City
  Fabrick, affordable housing providers, community partners, and local residents
  to site, program, and design a collection of 5-7 affordable housing
  developments in Long Beach and surrounding communities in South Los Angeles
  County. The intention will be to assist affordable housing developers —
  seeking to leverage the expansion of resources and legislation, to expand the
  availability of affordable housing. This will be done while educating and
  empowering residents to be participate and guide these developments to serve
  these new residents, as well as those already living in these communities.
   
   
   
   Working with students and faculty of California State University Long Beach’s Geography Department, City Fabrick along with affordable housing providers and community partners will map and define optimum areas within South Los Angeles County to consider developing new affordable housing. This will be based on a variety of factors including access to transportation, community amenities and services, funding sources, and availability of developable opportunities. Within these opportunity areas, focus areas will be identified for City Fabrick and community partners to engage.
   
   
   
   City Fabrick and community partners will initiate contact with core constituents to determine the landscape of needs and opportunities for affordable housing and community development within these focus areas, determining the most well suited development partner for each area. This can include target populations for housing — like senior living, families, or those with special needs, as well as amenities, services, and assets that can be leveraged to best serve these communities. Residents and community partners will begin to learn about the development process, so they are empowered to constructively participate in defining these and future developments.
   
   
   
   City Fabrick will collaborate with these affordable housing developers and community partners in each of these focus area, reaching out to the broader community to further define and refine those needs while collectively identifying opportunities for affordable housing in those communities. This will balance optimum development opportunities with the ability to maximize the future public-private investment for community development. This will also consider the capacity to leverage existing assets and proposed future investments to maximize their collective impact.
   
   
   
   A series engaging workshops with residents and community partners will facilitate collaboration for each proposal through conceptual design. This process will continue through until initial submittal to the approving jurisdiction, where the local government will likely lead the design’s refinement for their approval. With the substantial groundwork of participation, the intention will be for community partners and local residents to remain actively engaged along with the design and development team.
