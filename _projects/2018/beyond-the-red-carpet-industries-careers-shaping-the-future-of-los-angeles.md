  There are a lot of career opportunities in the LA area that many Angelenos are
  unaware of and lack access to. At Roadtrip Nation, we want to change that. Our
  goal is to give everyone access to the same information and opportunities. 
   
    
   
   Roadtrip Nation’s Beyond the Red Carpet Roadtrip will make LA the best place to CREATE by sharing with Angelenos the inspiring stories of individuals who have overcome obstacles and are thriving in careers in high-growth industries seeking a skilled and diverse workforce right here in our own backyard. The stories will be gathered by three Angelenos who hit the road in a green RV to interview a diverse group of professionals in the high-tech startup, manufacturing, and creative industries. Highlights will be featured in a documentary special on PBS SoCal and the content will be incorporated into Roadtrip Nation’s educational resources for middle school, high school, and college students.
   
   
   
   High-tech Startups
   
   LA has become a leading destination for high-tech startups. Silicon Beach, located in the Westside region of metropolitan LA, is home to more than 500 tech startup companies and is considered to be one of the hottest tech hubs in the world. Venture capital in the billions is flowing into the city, thanks in part to efforts by Mayor Garcetti and a council of entrepreneurs, venture capitalists and community leaders which introduce investors with local tech funds. 
   
   
   
   Manufacturing
   
   From aerospace and medical supplies to food and furniture, the Los Angeles area is the biggest manufacturing hub in the country with more than half a million jobs here. There is space to build factories and runways, the weather is ideal for testing planes year-round, the huge ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles let companies quickly ship products to a global market, and a massive logistics region east of Los Angeles is the first stop before products get on trucks to go across the country. Skilled workers are in high-demand, and business are working with local educational institutions to help students obtain training and skills for these jobs, many of which do not require a four-year college degree.
   
   
   
   Creative Industries
   
   Los Angeles is one of the most diverse cities in the world, but the entertainment industry remains a very small, largely white, male “club”. This year offered hope that the industry may have reached a tipping point. With the Grammy’s long overdue recognition of hip hop as the dominant genre in music, and with the critical and box office success of films like The Shape of Water, Get Out, and Black Panther, the hope is that the industry is finally changing to better reflect the diversity of our country and the world at large. The challenge ahead is to build from these successes. Beyond the Red Carpet will highlight writers, directors, producers and other creative talents who are forging new ground so that the entertainment industry continues to nurture and attract the best creative talent from all cultures and walks of life.
