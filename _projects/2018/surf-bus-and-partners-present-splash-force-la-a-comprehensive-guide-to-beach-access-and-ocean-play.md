  “The sea, once it casts its spell, holds one in its net of wonder forever.”
  -J. Cousteau
   
   
   
   LA is home to over 2.2 million children. We have so much space to play--mountainous wilderness, vast desert/prairie plains, over 200 park & rec. depts., and 57 miles of coastline. Yet, there is a legacy of segregation of swimming pools and ocean spaces in LA that has led to what we term a "crisis of blue culture." Our children are not learning how to swim (in 2017 64% of African American children, 45% of Latino children, and 40% of caucasian children cannot swim) and they are not visiting their beaches to play (50% of middle school aged children in LA Co. have never seen the beach). For young Angelenos to realize their full potential, we have to transform our legacy. Like the ocean, we must afford our youth equal opportunity by bridging gaps in access to swim lessons, ocean safety and surf lessons, and a fun and interactive marine science curriculum to buttress their physical experience. We must focus on involving entire families/communities in the solution. We seek to measure the quantum impact of their inclusion and support on the whole of Los Angeles.
   
   
   
   Surf Bus and partners have created a multi-level plan to activate 100,000 Angelenos to claim coastal spaces through play. Our program, “Splash Force LA” is a collaboration with AltaSea and Los Angeles Maritime Institute. Together, our focus is on measuring the following three LA2050 metrics: 
   
   
   
   1. Number and quality of informal spaces for play: Where do water lovers hang out between sessions, how come, what is happening there? Beach parking lots, pool decks, port hangars…
   
   2. Number of parks with intergenerational play opportunities: pools and beaches provide open and creative play opportunities for all generations. Our program integrates entire families into various levels of "play" and we have a plan to encourage and measure family involvement.
   
   3. Number of residents with easy access to a “vibrant” park: "Vibrancy" to us means amount, quality, and creativity of use. Beaches provide tons of open space--both structured and unstructured. Vibrancy is impacted by the ability to travel with ease, the confidence to start the trip, a feeling of support, and a sense of belonging upon arrival.
   
   
   
   Our plan combines our reach to achieve the following:
   
   
   
   1. Teach 3rd graders (100,000+) in LAUSD how to swim as part of their in-school pe experience. 
   
   2. 40 field trips a school year for elem/middle/high school LAUSD students that include a Surf Bus lesson in Santa Monica, lunch, a visit to AltaSea/Cabrillo Aquarium, and a sail on a LAMI tall ship. 
   
   3. We will host two urban luaus a month at LA Park and Rec facilities to build relationships with families and community.
   
   4. Each partner will host a quarterly “ohana day:" visits to the beach/altasea/lami for family/friends. 
   
   5. Perfect attendance earns eligibility for end-of-year trips: 2 voyages to Catalina for 30 people on each ship and/or 1 surf camping trip for 20 groms.
