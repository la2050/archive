  High School for Recording Arts is looking to replicate their highly successful
  model (20 years in St. Paul,MN) in downtown LA and they have selected the
  MAPPS leadership team as their partner. MAPPS is powered by the Implicit
  Career Search (ICS http://www.theimplicitcareersearch.com) which has served
  over 100,000 participants globally from a variety of age ranges. Coupled with
  The Human Element (https://thehumanelement.com) this program would not
  otherwise be accessible to this population due to the prohibitive costs. As a
  certified practitioner in both practices, Leili Eghbal along with the MAPPS
  team will be responsible for the delivery of these trainings not only at HSRA
  but at other partner organizations such as the YWCAGLA, The Anti Recidivism
  Coalition, and Dignity Health among others. We believe we can affect district
  wide graduation rates because HSRA's current model attracts drop-outs, meaning
  that all those kids now have a real shot at a high school diploma. We want the
  kids that no one else wants. HSRA boasts a 100% college acceptance for
  graduates. In addition, MAPPS which will be part of the curriculum, is a
  choice-based approach to career exploration and planning unlike any these kids
  will ever be exposed to. Organizations across the globe have used this
  methodology with impressive results among various populations. The underlying
  assumption throughout MAPPS is that not only do we each have a unique
  contribution to deliver during our lives, we also implicitly and deeply desire
  to make this contribution. This is our "work".
   
   
   
   Some stats:
   
   
   
   Camby Group 70 participants: results 4 months after program
   
   Total employed or doing productive work
   
   Standard Job Services 31% ICS 78%
   
   Off income assistance due to employment
   
   Standard Job Services 4%. ICS 13%
   
   
   
   Burger Chain
   
   % of trainers becoming managers
   
   Pre-ICS 50% Post ICS 85%
   
   % of managers remaining with chain
   
   Pre-ICS 20% Post ICS 70%
   
   Average training time to become a manager
   
   Pre-ICS 2 years Post ICS 1 year
   
   
   
   Brentwood Bay Resort
   
   Staff engagement
   
   Pre-ICS 62% Post ICS 87%
   
   Staff turnover (industry average 66%)
   
   Pre-ICS 52% Post ICS 7%
   
   
   
   In addition, 70 participants were polled as to their beliefs about themselves in five different areas at the beginning and end of a 10 day workshop. The results showed a 35% increase in Self-Efficacy (greater independence, stronger belief in planning, less reliance on others); 30% increase in Self-Esteem; 30% increase in Self-Determination; 25% increase in Resiliency (increased flexibility in personal life, clearer understanding of today's job market and the role of education in it) and 18% increase in Self-Awareness.
   
   
   
   We hope to create a fully-supported leaning environment where students not only receive a high school diploma, but are once again engaged with increased awareness regarding past behaviors, greater focus, confidence and organizational skills to support achievement of activities towards their Employment goal.
