title: 'MoonBus is a traveling art installation and research lab hybrid '
project_summary: ''
Please describe the activation your organization seeks to launch.: >-
  Driven by unbound imagination, MoonBus is a lab facility and cultural venue
  that, powered by its own functional artistic adoptions of exclusive,
  industrial technologies, creates an accessible and mobile experience. MoonBus
  will integrate technologies capable of conserving our biosphere, as it
  supports the curiosity that instigates a culture of positive and generous
  integration with each other, our planet, its inhabitants and our cosmos
  through captivativating, awe-inspiring interactive art.
Describe in greater detail how your activation will make LA the best place?: "Like LA, MoonBus is a frontier for the exploration of our world and beyond, capable of harnessing and bridging unreached boundaries through creative, all-ages entertainment and engagement. With its pertinent messages, utopian aspirations, achievable goals and useful outputs, MoonBus redefines PLAY as a mechanism for solving the most pressing ‘Glocal’ issues through fun and curiosity. MoonBus is itself a product of the unique hybrid LA offers geographically and culturally, whilst it forges new pathways into LA’s potential as a clean, prosperous, equanimous and balanced city. MoonBus can build the future of LA through its fundamental playfulness, thus it is resonant with its envisioned future. \r\n\r\nMoonBus’ ability to achieve its PLAY agenda lies partly in its configuration as both research facility and art installation within the same space; prototypes can be used and/or integrate with art programming and other facets of the bus and its services directly from the test bench making it fun and accessible to create otherwise seemingly inaccessible devices and systems.\r\n\r\nWith an eye on fun for all ages, MoonBus events will be held as workshops, lectures, art shows, live experiments, screenings, meditations, sound baths, deep listening sessions, camping expeditions and informal gatherings facilitated by MoonBus and special guests and collaborators from a wide variety of fields at the new and full moon. Selected events will be ticketed at a variety of prices reflecting the anticipated audience and cost of showing, others will be free, or charge a nominal fee. When MoonBus is out of city quarters, events will include camping activities. Annual and bi-annual memberships will be offered, providing reduced fee access to certain events. Schools may participate in learning-exchanges where students help with archiving and MoonBus’ general maintenance in exchange for workshops, lectures and other curriculums. Institutions in association with MoonBus may schedule their own events. MoonBus will offer visits to venues, festivals, institutions, or private establishments,schools, libraries and other venues in underprivileged areas for specially prepared workshops, learning-exchanges or any of the above mentioned categories of events. Any member of the public can apply to become a MoonBus facilitator or collaborator. MoonBus will collect and disseminate VR experiences of its research trips to be portrayed as immersive experiences, or simply as documentary material for world-wide access to its activities. MoonMusic will stream live internet and radio broadcasts. MoonBus’ interactive immersive art installation will provide an ongoing and evolving experience of its innovations and developments. A nominal subscription service to MoonBus’ data outputs for non-commercial purposes will be available. Prototypes and demonstrations will be available on parr with their development. MoonBus events may take place in the field, or city. \r\n"
How will your activation engage Angelenos to make LA the best place: "MoonBus is open to the public and intends to become a resource as an open educational lab facility and cultural venue that, powered by its own functional artistic adoptions of exclusive, industrial technologies, creates an accessible and tangible glimpse into conserving a pre-apocalyptic biosphere in a post-apocalyptic world through captivativating, awe-inspiring interactive art. \r\n\r\nMoonBus events may take place in the field, or city. It can be one of a fleet of such vehicles in the creation of a networked, mobile, global archiving, innovation and implementation vessel for art, technology and ecology. MoonBus travels to educate and instigate locally-driven community enterprises by way of providing long-term financial strategies, manufacturing know-how and technology transfer. \r\n\r\nArts and conservation organisations amongst other institutions and facilities, may be offered free access, discounts or may enter in to learning-exchange partnerships with MoonBus to facilitate participation and mutual support. Schools may participate in learning-exchanges where students help with archiving and MoonBus’ general maintenance in exchange for workshops, lectures and other curriculums. \r\n\r\nMoonBus will visit schools, libraries and other venues in underprivileged areas for specially prepared workshops, learning-exchanges or any of the above mentioned categories of events. Any member of the public can apply to become a MoonBus facilitator or collaborator.  "
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your activation.: "Attendance, participant response, data, technical successes, other activities spurred as a result of MoonBus influence, public engagement, rate of return, membership applications, volunteer numbers, event and curriculum participation requests, local community involvement.\r\n"
Where do you hope this activation or your organization will be in five years?: "In five years, we anticipate advancements in the technologies, art programming, and social notions that MoonBus will host. We envision the success of MoonBus generating the financial and public support to create a networked mini-fleet of MoonBusses. Operating in different parts of the world, connected to each other and the rest of the globe via the internet and expeditions, the MoonBus fleet would serve to forge entryways into more permanent and significant community engagements. These engagements, initially directed by Children of Wild collaborative initiatives, serve educate and instantiate community enterprises. An example would be the launching of local, collaborative manufacturing enterprises where communities receive training, technology transfer and other guidance for the installation and maintenance of MoonCell energy systems. Such systems provide clean, cheap electricity from municipal waste and are able to integrate with renewable technologies so as to benefit the local environment. \r\n\r\nMoonBus aims to leave in its wake, the implementation of other Children of Wild projects and services, such as ORBS Hybrid Interactive Wilderness Domes, which, run on MoonCell and other such urban life support systems, offer integrated initiation hubs whilst offering its other benefits, such as safe play areas and ecological connection sanctuaries. \r\n"
