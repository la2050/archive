  From our golden beaches to our parks and mountains, Los Angeles has a natural
  beauty that is unrivalled, and it is one of the best aspects of living and
  working here. However, air pollution was once so bad that people were forced
  inside. Our oceans were unsafe to swim in. Through the tireless work of
  environmental nonprofit organizations Los Angeles we overcame these
  challenges, and while we have come a long way, there is a lot more that needs
  to be done. We need a sustainable energy infrastructure, oceans free of
  plastic pollution and clean air to breathe. We rely on organizations like the
  Coalition for Clean Air, the Surfrider Foundation and the US Green Building
  Council to advance these changes. Yet while we rely on the nonprofit
  environmental sector for transformative change, they operate in an extremely
  resource-limited field. Only 3% of charitable giving in 2015 went towards
  environmental issues. That is where we come in.



   SeedLA is an innovative solution to empower the environmental nonprofits working towards a healthier more sustainable Los Angeles. We started from the realization that there is a large untapped resource in LA — our very own Angelenos. Our city is home to many highly skilled, motivated and sustainably minded people who want to make a positive impact. By recruiting LA’s brightest young minds we facilitate their ability for real, tangible impacts accelerating the work of environmental nonprofits. We build and train project teams specifically tailored to needs of a particular organization and help them work solve critical issues. Whether it be air quality, water pollution public transportation or energy efficiency, we provide free skilled resources to tackle the major issues facing LA by working with the most influential organizations in Los Angeles.



   Ultimately, SeedLA will make Los Angeles the best place to LIVE not only by enhancing the impact of organizations already pioneering a healthier and more sustainable Los Angeles, but also by fostering the next generation of environmental leaders.
