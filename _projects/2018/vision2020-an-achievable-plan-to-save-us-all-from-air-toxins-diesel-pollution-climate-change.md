  In 2007, LA County Metro had no money to address its soul-crushing traffic.
  Move LA was created to build a broad coalition to support a grand bargain on
  transformative change: Measures R and M will now fund the largest public
  infrastructure investment in the country. 
   
   
   
   We now face an even greater threat from exposure to air toxins, diesel pollution and climate change. Transportation accounts for 90% of our NOx emissions, 80% from heavy-duty vehicles, most powered by diesel engines, resulting in the dirtiest air in the country. The heaviest exposure to diesel exhaust is experienced by low-income communities of color who live along the goods movement corridors of Southern California. It is a public health and an environmental justice imperative that we seek to replace diesel with clean technologies.
   
   
   
   In addition, transportation sources in Southern California account for 50% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions known to cause climate change. Rising seas and worsening droughts threaten our community and our world, today and for future generations. 
   
   
   
   But we now have a chance to save the world from climate change and clean our air because of decades of California leadership, leadership which has resulted in a growing array of zero-emission and advanced hybrid light-duty vehicles and the imminent deployment of zero and near-zero emission trucks. We are now poised to play a powerful role in the worldwide efforts to abate climate change while helping free our region from exposure to air toxins; all we must do is find the strategies to accelerate the deployment of these clean vehicles significantly.
   
   
   
   Move LA has a plan: “Vision 2020: A Plan to Clean Southern California's Air and Abate Climate Change,” and we have launched a regional dialogue to build a coalition capable of addressing these two most significant challenges.
   
   
   
   Move LA will activate 100,000 Angelenos and Southern Californians to finish our clean air and climate change mission, utilizing our innovative and successful civic engagement model to build the coalition and develop the strategy to do it. 
   
   
   
   Help us fund a two-year public outreach and coalition building effort that will: 
   
   
   
   - Identify and champion a grand bargain to win the funding needed to implement the South Coast Air Quality Management District’s mobile sources plan, which would dramatically accelerate the deployment of zero and near-zero emission light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicles to abate climate change and end air pollution in fifteen years.
   
   
   
   - Implement an all-electric regional Metrolink commuter rail system and create a much more efficient goods movement system.
   
   
   
   This effort will, we hope, culminate in legislative or ballot initiative action in 2020 (hence "Vision 2020"); when joined with the efforts of the State of California, it could create the economies of scale needed for clean transportation to be cost and performance competitive with gasoline and diesel vehicles in markets around the world.
