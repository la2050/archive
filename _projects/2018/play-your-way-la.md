  If you’re one of the 51% of Angelenos living more than a half mile from the
  nearest park and you want to play in your neighborhood, you don’t have many
  options. You can twiddle your thumbs until the someone builds a park near you,
  or form an advocacy group with your neighbors, but it’s pretty hard to make
  anything happen.
   
   
   
   KDI wants to change this. We want to give you an easy way to bring outdoor play to your neighborhood, NOW!
   
   
   
   Let’s say your neighborhood has tons of space but nowhere to play. You want to play basketball in the street, but it’s always full of traffic. Or you’re next to a vacant lot that would be a great park, if only you could access it. Or the sunny sidewalk on the corner would be the perfect spot to enjoy street food, but there’s no seating.
   
   
   
   What if you could turn those spaces into areas for play?
   
   
   
   Our activation will make this quick, easy, and fun! We’ll take care of all the forms and phone calls needed to make it happen. All you have to do to get started is geotag the spot you think should be used for play on social media. Tag it with #PlayYourWayLA!
   
   
   
   Get 10 people to tag it, and we’ll come and make sure the space is public and safe to use. We’ll put up a sign letting people know play is on the way, if they keep tagging. You tell your friends and family to tag the spot. Hit 100 tags and we’ll set a date to bring our Park-in-a-Box to that very place. Simple!
   
   
   
   Then, we’ll hold a community workshop so you and your neighborhood can make the activation YOURS. Maybe you have lots of young kids in the neighborhood, or you want a space for your knitting group. Our Park-in-a-Box can transform into almost anything — a toddler’s play zone, a craft corner — whatever you want! Every activation will be unique to its neighborhood and the people in it.
   
   
   
   Once you’ve planned your activation, we’ll drive our Park-in-a-Box to your neighborhood and PLAY!
   
   
   
   There’s no limit to how you can play, or how much you get involved. Maybe you just want to show up and enjoy the activation. Maybe you want to lead the community workshop. Maybe you want a permanent park in your area. If so, we’ll set you up with the networks and know-how to make it happen.
   
   
   
   So how are we meeting those LA2050 play metrics?
   
   
   
   * There will be more spaces for play. You’ll enjoy the benefits of open space in your neighborhood, almost immediately, without having to wait for permanent parks to arrive.
   
   * You’ll have access to unique, vibrant and intergenerational play spaces to suit everyone — because YOU made it happen!
   
   * You’ll feel safer and more connected to your neighborhood.
   
   * You’ll create visual data and community interest to show the City where permanent parks are needed and desired.
   
   * You’ll pave the way for permanent improvements and be able to get involved in making them happen.
   
   
   
   You can see that we’re also hitting lots of “Connect” metrics, like rates of volunteerism and public gatherings. Together, we can make LA the best place to play — now, and in the future.
