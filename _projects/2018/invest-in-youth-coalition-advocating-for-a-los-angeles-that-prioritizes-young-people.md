  Over 800,000 youth between 10 to 24 years of age live in the City of Los
  Angeles. A majority of this population, 81% are youth of color, and creating
  opportunities for this population will help them reach their full potential
  and make the City more prepared for the future. 
   
   
   
   Opportunities for youth to engage as decision-makers and community leaders becomes a driving force in their likelihood of being publicly engaged and creates a life-long dedication to the wellbeing of their neighborhoods. Youth who have limited opportunities are at higher risk of developing personal, social, and behavioral problems. Youth who have access to civic engagement, educational opportunities, vocational programs, and health services have higher rates of psychological and emotional stability, positive self-esteem, and greater risk management capacities. Access to these programs and services makes it less likely for young people to engage in unhealthy behaviors such as smoking, alcohol and substance abuse, crime and violence, and unsafe sex. Positive youth development has also been found to have a positive relationship to life satisfaction.
   
   
   
   An emphasis on preventing risky behaviors, preparation for the workforce, after school services, and raising academic achievement are all increasing the demand for youth programs. Los Angeles faces significant challenges in this area since policymakers have not adequately funded and successfully coordinated effective services. In fact, LA is only spending $75 per youth, while San Francisco and New York are spending $1,909 and $541 apiece on their young people. The City’s current youth development effort is a piecemeal approach with multiple agencies managing various programs. We believe is it critical that one coordinating body be responsible for identifying strategies that increase positive outcomes and opportunities for young people.
   
   
   
   Our activation will make LA the best place to live by demanding a greater investment in our city’s youth. This investment supports the healthy development of young people across various sectors, such as leadership development and workforce training, recognizes youth of color as one of our greatest assets in an increasingly globalized economy, and is a critical component of citywide efforts to combat poverty, reduce violence, and decrease homelessness.
   
   
   
   The City of Los Angeles should recognize how critical young people are to its economy, culture, and civic discourse — both today and in the future. Nonetheless, the City minimally invests in programs that benefit youth. The future of our City depends on the next generation of young Angelenos becoming ready for the transition into the workforce and/or higher education. It is time to ensure that all youth have access to high-quality programs—no matter where they live—with public investment to support a Youth Development Department.
