  Gather, Collect. Activate, Connect. 
   
   
   
   The Art Barge is a traveling, interactive, living archive. It is, in itself, an activation. Its unique design and dual function as an archive will attract people of all ages and backgrounds. The activities around the barge 'dockings' will invite people to connect to each other and to their community. 
   
   
   
   As a living artifact for the collection of diverse stories that weave together to form a multi-faceted public place identity, these stories of public art and culture will contribute to the meaning of the River’s communities, reconstituting “communities of memory” that bridge and preserve historical with contemporary public art and cultural projects. 
   
   
   
   The LA River Public Art Project can serve as a facilitator; the communities will lead, explore, and add their stories and recollections of art events along the River. Arts and cultural activities will be presented, discussed, reviewed, and selected in conjunction with individual site partners. 
   
   
   
   Each of the proposed 12 docking sites will consider how to best tailor events, programs, and coordinate with neighborhood community organizations, businesses and residents. 
   
   
   
   Our team's art historian and curator will bring additional perspective to the art installations, events, speaker/music series, and educational activities. While the barge will draw its county-wide audiences, local dockings will provide local residents unique access cultural events and volunteer opportunities.
   
   
   
   The Art Barge will be designed to increase awareness of the cultural history of the River, entice people to go a park they may have never visited before, have a picnic along the River, engage with neighbors and community members at events and activities, encourage local and neighborhood organizations to develop associate events to coincide with Art Barge dockings, and enhance awareness of the cultural history of the LA River.
