  The Burg is the community's platform, a digital public square that funnels
  local representatives and local news directly to verified voters. By building
  a Burg for each district and hosting unique features such as online town
  halls, we're lowering the barriers to give people access to the city of LA in
  a brand new way, and it is out now for iOS and Android. Download links on our
  website! 
   
   
   
   We operate on 3 pillars: 1. Connect the community 2. Properly inform the community 3. Make it easier for representatives to actually represent the community.
   
   
   
   1. We have built our own voter verification infrastructure working with the CA Sec. of State’s office that verifies voters and places them in their correct city or city council district (depending on the size of the city). All we need is a user’s name and birthdate, and we can cross reference to check their voter status and place them within their city/district. Verified voters are given unique access and an “I Vote” sticker that acts as a badge that indicates their status in the community (slightly similar to a Twitter checkmark).
   
   
   
   2. As Pew Research Group and Mark Zuckerberg have stressed, local news is directly correlated with local civic engagement. If we can better inform communities with relevant local news, they will be more likely to civically engage. Our answer: we pick up RSS Feeds of Local Newsrooms (e.g. here in LA we use the local section of the LA Times and Daily News, Curbed.LA, etc.) and streamline them to Burgs across the city. We optimize this for every Burg depending on their area. 
   
   
   
   3. Local Representatives now have a never before seen direct tap into the pulse of their community, and not just to a data file but real access to their constituents. They can interact with verified voters directly in real-time and can host Online Town Halls (combo of a Reddit AMA/Quora Session) where voters can submit and upvote questions in a democratic system for reps to answer. 
   
   
   
   We started The Burg is because of the clear need and the widespread lack of technology and innovation in this space. Simply put, there is no purpose driven platform that solves this problem.
