  While we have proven we know how to end homelessness through permanent housing
  and services, we haven’t made a significant impact on the flow of people into
  homelessness. By some estimates, monthly in LA County more than 10,000 people
  fall into homelessness but less than 20% ends their homelessness. 
   
   
   
   We will activate 100,000 Angelenos to advance short-term prevention- the need to make sure vulnerable residents stay housed- and longer-term prevention that increases the supply of housing to make more housing affordable to low-income Angelenos. We will inform and mobilize residents to:
   
   
   
   UNDERSTAND THAT OUR HOMELESSNESS CRISIS IS A HOUSING CRISIS. According to recent focus group research, most people don't understand that the cost of housing is the number one driver of our homelessness crisis. People especially don't understand that if we make housing more affordable, we can solve homelessness for most people. In fact, 2/3 of homeless people don’t need supportive housing, they just need housing they can afford. Lifting this issue up will be a core focus of this partnership.
   
   
   
   SUPPORT TENANTS AT RISK OF EVICTION TO STAY IN THEIR CURRENT HOMES. Historically low vacancy rates have created an environment where landlords often force families out of their homes, by legal and illegal means, so they can rent to higher income tenants. Displaced families must quickly find replacement housing or risk becoming homeless. But without enough affordable housing, and with an eviction on their record, it is an uphill battle. 
   
   
   
   Inner City Law Center established a pilot program for keeping families in their homes. Lawyers help tenants resolve differences with landlords, and if necessary, fight evictions. In addition, short-term rent subsidies are available to keep tenants current on rent. Social workers help tenants resolve underlying issues that have placed them at risk. We will spread the word about these programs and advocate for doing more.
   
   
   
   But the work these programs can do is limited by existing legal frameworks that make it too easy to put tenants on the street. We will activate Angelenos to support meaningful tenant rights reforms. For instance, more cities in LA County could pass rules for just-cause evictions, meaning families can only be evicted if they violate the lease. 
   
   
   
   SAY YES TO MORE HOMES AND BETTER RULES. Building more housing that is affordable is critical to helping people avoid homelessness. We will activate Angelenos to support new housing in their communities. Elected officials who decide whether to approve new homes are very attuned to input from local residents. People who turn out for hearings on these projects have traditionally been opposed to new housing, often when it's for lower income and homeless people. Supportive messages and in-person testimony from residents who believe we need to address LA’s homelessness and housing crisis can make a huge difference in allowing more homes of all types to be permitted and built.
