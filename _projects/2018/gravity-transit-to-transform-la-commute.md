title: 'Gravity transit to transform LA commute '
project_summary: ''
Please describe the activation your organization seeks to launch.: >-
  We would like to validate Gravity Transit in a public way! Itâ€™s benefits have
  been proven but it has yet to be experienced by the customer.  We would like
  to build a public demonstration. 
Describe in greater detail how your activation will make LA the best place?: >-
  Answers to The first/last mile problem in public transit have failed to
  produce results. Only 6% of people commute using available mass transit and at
  a heafty price tag 4 billion per year.  New technology using behavioral data
  shows it can be done better and cheaper than all existing mass transit
  systems 
How will your activation engage Angelenos to make LA the best place: 'Commuters. '
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your activation.: Ridership
Where do you hope this activation or your organization will be in five years?: >-
  I would like to cover a large area both 5 miles north and 5 miles south of the
  Wiltshire corridor from Hollywood to the 10 fwy from downtown to Santa
  Monica.
