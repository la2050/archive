  RaiseAChild’s pioneering multi-media recruitment campaigns have been steadily
  growing. With last year’s state-of-the-art events generating well over
  1,750,000 impressions and directly reaching thousands of people, we anticipate
  successfully connecting with more than 100,000 Angelenos over the next two
  years and mobilizing them for the greater good of children in foster care.
  Through Activate L.A., we plan to expand by 50% the scope of these events and
  continue to create, produce, and manage unique outreach campaigns that promote
  family building to a broad spectrum of prospective families. Using radio,
  television, digital media, social media, and street-light banners, campaigns
  will be scheduled twice a year throughout Los Angeles. The spring campaign
  will coincide with National Foster Care Month, Mother's Day, Father's Day, and
  Gay Pride Month and the fall/winter campaign will take place during National
  Adoption Month and the holiday season. Each will prominently feature the
  LA2050 name on all related materials and its logo on 100 % of the street-light
  banners. Our innovative Parent Advocate Program, which combines the attention
  of a mentor with the technological support of a cloud-based case management
  system, will also expand to track and facilitate the progress of all
  identified prospective parents. Inspired by our participation in the 2017
  #HackFosterCareLA event (to engage the technology sector in improving the
  lives of children and families involved with the foster care system), we will
  also embark on a unique retention collaboration designed to improved methods
  of communication and support services to thousands of prospective and current
  parents. By simultaneously developing and implementing this technology, we
  will have the capacity to incorporate this additional flow of prospective
  parents into our database, and also more effectively and efficiently meet
  their needs to assure their retention.
