  Young people of color deserve a right to free access to the arts as a social
  justice issue. For 17 years our program has proven that a diverse band with
  at-risk youth can also be world-class and record with Jazz masters. We do not
  cream the best musical talent, exactly the opposite. Our band acts as a social
  incubator in which the entire community is represented and they bond over the
  love of Jazz and love of performing. We are free and not believe in
  competitive auditions. Over 17 years 95% of our graduates have gone on to
  college, many focusing on music school. Young Jazz lions such as Natalie
  Cressman, Zamora Pinderhughes and Elena Pinderhughes are graduates of our
  group. For the first time, we are partnering with a non-profit to act as
  fiscal agent and allow us to launch the band as a performance ensemble for all
  of Los Angeles, representing the diversity and musical talent of LA.
