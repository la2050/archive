  Outside the Box - open-sourced solutions for the world's most evasive
  problems.  
project_summary: ''
Please describe the activation your organization seeks to launch.: >-
  Problems in our city are solved at tables far from the citizens they affect,
  and the decision-makers are often limited by their own experiences. OTB aims
  to activate our communities through direct democracy. For each problem that
  our citizens seek solutions to, we bring together a cross-sectoral group of
  minds to lend their expertise. The solutions they derive are published,
  iterated upon, and voted on by the public - thus, vetting ideas in the greater
  community before breaking ground on them.
Describe in greater detail how your activation will make LA the best place?: "Outside the Box hosts and facilitates in-person community problem solving sessions focused on specific issues the community is facing. Over the course of a few impactful hours, the participants are led through a Design Thinking exercise catered for civic/community problem solving. The host creates a safe space for idea generation, and encourages participants not to just think outside the box, but to “create as if the box never existed”. Creativity is made easier by the makeup of the group. The Table Sessions are curated to include individuals from different professional sectors and walks of life with limited exposure to the problem and its historical limitations. An issue “expert” is available to which the group can ask clarifying questions and gain any critical context needed to generate solutions. These in-person engagements are facilitated in a way that draws out ideas and connects the participants to a common cause. Sessions are held bi-weekly and include 10-15 people - thus directly engaging atleast 260-390 Angelenos per year in community problem-solving. Once a solution is generated at a “Table Session”, it is uploaded to a digital community forum - offering the larger community a chance to connect with each other and engage in solution-making. Citizens in the greater community can comment on, add to, and iterate upon any idea generated during the session.  After the solution is refined and vetted by the people it will eventually impact, it is shared with government officials and/or private citizens to implement - thus activating citizen entrepreneurs and making government officials more aware and responsive to the will of the people. As citizens see their ideas rise to the top of government agendas, they will have a stronger sense of responsibility in their local democracy, and when they see their ideas on the ballot, they will be more likely to turn out to vote.\r\n\r\nSigning up for the OTB community online is easier than voting, and it is a great civic entry point. An individual can engage in various ways - by joining a “Table Session” in person, contributing to the iteration of solutions online, digitally voting on proposed solutions, or sharing the solutions with their larger social network. This process gives citizens a seat at the table that may otherwise feel exclusionary. It engages them in the democratic process and gives them a sense of ownership in what happens in their city. OTB generates creative and innovative ideas for the civic space. Most importantly, it allows our government and other decision-makers to get real-time feedback from ALL of its citizens - testing policies and interventions in the public before spending time and money implementing them. It allows the city to hear the voices and leverage the gifts of ALL of its people to solve its most evasive problems."
How will your activation engage Angelenos to make LA the best place: >-
  OTB engages a diverse population in solution-making and it is designed to be
  radically inclusive. The OTB community crosses generational, racial,
  educational, professional, and economic lines. It aims to engage ALL
  Angelenos, and eventually, ALL citizens in direct democracy. OTB employs
  Design Thinking in its community problem solving sessions, and it leverages an
  online community forum with digital voting to vet and refine generated
  solutions. It also employs social media as an educational and engagement tool
  to spread awareness about issues and increase engagement in solutions.
Please explain how you will define and measure success for your activation.: "Success for Outside the Box will be measured in multiple ways. The primary reason for its existence is to bring diverse citizens to the solution-making table. We define success first by the number of citizens that take part in our community via live events, digital interactions on our platform, and social media engagement. Second, we measure the effectiveness of our model by the number of solutions that are vetted and refined by the community.\r\n\r\nSpecifically in our first year, we will 1) launch the OTB online platform, 2) host bi-weekly Table Sessions, and 3) see Angeleno engagement reach 5% of the population. Engagement is defined as the sum # of people that attend live sessions, # of digital engagements in online platform, # social media likes, shares and interactions, # of unique solutions generated, and # of people directly influenced by solution implementation. \r\n\r\nIn our second year, we will refine and expand our reach based on year-one learnings. We will explore expansion to a B2B model, directly engaging civic organizations to help them solve in-house problems preventing them from achieving greater impact. We would like to see Angeleno engagement in OTB reach 10% of the population by the end of year two."
Where do you hope this activation or your organization will be in five years?: >-
  In five years, I hope that Outside the Box has engaged at least 75% Angelenos
  in some part of the community problem-solving process. I hope that it has
  generated visible and meaningful solutions in the civic space, and I hope that
  it is seen as a valuable resource for government officials and entrepreneurs
  alike to hear from the public. It is my dream that Angelenos set the tone for
  a new radically inclusive and innovative democracy that can be scaled to other
  cities across the nation and even across the world. I see Outside the Box
  creating a cultural current of active citizenship and inclusive community
  problem solving.
