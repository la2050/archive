title: 'Intersections: The power of our common stories.'
project_summary: >-
  It all begins with sharing stories. Imagine LA and L.A. Works are joining to
  empower 150,000+ Angelenos to share their own life experiences to help
  alleviate homelessness in our city.

  People are more likely to trust and fully engage with one another when they
  share common experiences and interests. Knowing this, Imagine LA created a
  unique onboarding process, which we use when matching volunteer mentors with
  families who’ve experienced homelessness. Our professional staff trains and
  guides the mentor/mentee pairs as they share life timelines, family genograms,
  personal values, and views on money management. These exercises evoke
  laughter, “a ha!” moments and sometimes tears. Shortly, they discover they
  have more in common than they would ever have thought. 
   
   
   
   Often used as a therapeutic intervention, the timeline project creates an intimate connection between participants as they explore their history, attitudes, circumstances, and decision-making. “It’s been said that a picture is worth a thousand words. If so, then capturing your life on paper with a timeline exercise may be worth millions.“ (Staik, 2013)
   
   
   
   Modeling this deep and barrier-busting experience, the "Intersections" campaign will significantly increase the number of mentors in the Imagine LA program. Potential volunteers need to see the foundation we create for success and be empowered with the realization that they too have what it takes to be a life-changing mentor for families emerging from homelessness — simply the ability to share. What begins with a connection ends with breaking the cycle of homelessness.
   
    
   
   Partnering with L.A. Works, the largest volunteer network in Los Angeles, Imagine LA will create a public awareness and outreach campaign, pairing social media marketing, community outreach, and events to educate and empower 150,000+ Angelenos. Ultimately, this will influence individual behavior, CONNECT 1,000 new mentors with vulnerable families in the Imagine LA program, and increase rates of volunteerism — not only as mentors, but with shorter-term volunteer roles. 
   
   
   
   A key component of our campaign is events-based. At L.A. Works’ large-scale days of service, which draw volunteers from around the county who are primed to make a deeper connection in service, we’ll lead trust-building activities like those we use during our mentor/mentee on-boarding process, educate participants, post on socials and ultimately sign up new volunteers to become mentors. 
   
   
   
   Mentorship promotes community and develops meaningful relationships full of mutual respect, love, and laughter. Showcasing this, and CONNECTing Angelenos to each other through their stories, will bring this campaign to life. Our shareable videos (live and animated), photos, and tactics like a mentor taking over our Instagram feed for a day will help increase the total number of local social media friends and connections Angelenos have. We anticipate the campaign to CONNECT Angelenos way beyond our goal of signing up mentors. It will empower them to volunteer in other ways and LEARN about those with disparate backgrounds and circumstances. It will break the cycle of homelessness for hundreds of families.
