  Pop-Up Sites for Overnight Temporary Shelter: Serving our homeless neighbors
  with dignity first
project_summary: >-
  We will deploy architecturally designed, low-impact shelters made of treated
  cardboard at managed sites around LA nightly to transform conceptions of what
  emergency homeless shelter can be.

project_proposal_description: >-
  Cardborigami will establish safe, managed, temporary shelter sites on secured
  premises of private property hosts, where our shelter structures will be set
  up in an open-space area for assigned use by homeless clients. Each client
  will be registered or continued in individualized case management by the local
  homeless services organization with whom we are partnering. These pop-ups
  around the City of LA will demonstrate a practical, neighborhood-based
  solution to a widely distributed crisis.

  We need to rethink what an emergency homeless shelter can look like, where it
  can be located, and how it can better serve and maintain dignity for those
  experiencing homelessness. LA has the highest numbers in the country of
  homeless who are without access to shelter, and we also top the percentage of
  unsheltered homeless (78%) amongst US urban areas. That means over 45,000
  people do not have a sanctioned place to sleep as of the Jan 2017 count; the
  number will likely be higher once the 2018 count is reported in May, given the
  26% rise in homelessness between 2016 to 2017.
   
   Emergency shelters are typically conceived of as physical buildings within which people are aggregated into open sleeping arrangements. Two main problems of this approach are: traditional brick-and-mortar facilities cannot be built or converted fast enough to meet the urgent need, and grouping strangers into such an environment can elevate anxieties. Instead of limiting the format of such shelter to permanent structures, our activation reimagines what we can do with existing outdoor lots that can serve multiple purposes, including for very temporary and quickly deployable shelter. The Cardborigamis will also give clients a sense of private space that will reinforce their well-being while a part of the collective site.
   
   Our homeless neighbors belong to all geographies of LA, and they find places to sleep wherever they can, often in areas that are familiar to them. Itâ€™s crucial for us to recognize that the need for emergency shelter is dispersed, and concentrating services or resources in a few spots that are hard to reach or require transportation to is not the answer. As reliable access to shelter is top priority for someone to transition off the streets, locating shelter pop-ups closer to where the homeless already are, rather than moving them to far, unfamiliar places, ensures a higher likelihood of them progressing with services. With our no-lasting-trace footprint, Cardborigami will empower neighborhoods with our shelters and joint planning to show that creating a shelter site does not need to be a long-term capital commitment for a what should be a temporary state. This approach also allows for siting that is much more responsive and flexible to changes in demand.
   
   The lack of emergency shelter is an acute bottleneck preventing more homeless from being connected with needed services. Further, what legal shelter is available often has preset limits for who they can accept and how many, based on gender, life stage and official funding allocations of beds for various sub-populations. This type of planning is heavily weighted in infrastructure and cannot adjust to the dynamic conditions or demographics of homelessness. Our activation will increase the efficient use of outreach workers by creating new locations where they can do intakes & assessments for the countywide Coordinated Entry System, while reducing disruptions that unsheltered folks experience with street sweeps.
project_proposal_engage: >-
  Many Angelenos are looking for ways to effect change in our homelessness
  crisis beyond just approving ballot measures; others want to see more
  immediate results now. We intend to activate a broad swath of folks who are
  interested in taking action to enact a local, near-term solution. They will be
  involved in helping to make emergency shelter pop-up sites successful in their
  own unique communities. Our project will empower them in local decision-making
  around siting, operating characteristics and, most importantly, how to realize
  a common goal by using creative resources. By working through the Neighborhood
  Councils, we will also link those who have not participated there in the past
  to get more involved in other issues affecting their neighborhood. 
   
   
   
   Our activation will engage:
   
   - Residents & other stakeholders to call on their local councilmembers and relevant public agencies, such as Planning and Fire, to voice support for policy changes that would allow the implementation of outdoor solutions
   
   - Residents & their family members to volunteer onsite as greeters; monitors; intake assistants; storage helpers and other light functions
   
   - Those who have volunteered onsite to share their first-hand experiences interfacing with homeless guests to educate fellow community members about their stories, and create support for long-term solutions
   
   - At-risk youth who are participating in community-based programs to work in paid internships assembling the Cardborigamis for shelter site use
project_measure: >-
  The primary success of our activation will be defined by the intended impacts
  on the Homelessness metric that were described in Q9, and will be measured in
  the following ways:
   
   Increasing access to shelter for unsheltered homeless - distinct number of individuals who did not have a regular, sanctioned place to sleep before coming to a pop-up
   
   Changing the paradigm on what emergency shelter looks like - amending the applicable municipal standards to account for outdoor solutions, and proving our site operations are compliant
   
   Promoting a distributed geography of where such a resource can exist - our ability to create pop-ups in places where emergency shelter did not exist, especially locations that are prohibitive to easy transit
   
   Expanding the capacity of homeless services outreach efforts - increases in new intakes and rates of follow-up for those already enrolled in system
   
   
   
   Secondary success will be all about how we are able to engage Angelenos in the 2-yr activation. We will document and measure how effective we have been at mobilizing folks to:
   
   Advocate for policy, via both digital and in-person means
   
   Help us organize and plan pop-up sites
   
   Volunteer onsite, and the number of unique volunteer roles we create at each site
   
   Change their perspective regarding the issue of homelessness
   
   Get involved with their Neighborhood Council (first-time)
   
   Donate to our nonprofit to sustain our broader programming
   
   Support other organizations working along the spectrum of housing for the homeless
project_five_years: >-
  It is our sincere hope that this activation will become a very self-generating
  tool / coordination plan for local communities and widely replicated in 5
  years, not just in LA but across the state and hopefully other regions in the
  US. We want to contribute meaningfully towards increased buy-in by a large and
  diverse cross-section of the public towards new ways of drastically reducing
  homelessness, including support for the most important preventative, more
  affordable housing. We hope that the activation will have shown all
  stakeholders, regardless of their present views on how this crisis should be
  solved, that those who are homeless can be better connected to services when
  consistent shelter is provided, and that it takes localized situating of that
  shelter in order to engage local homeless individuals who have an attachment
  to place.
