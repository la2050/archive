  Pop-Up Sites for Overnight Temporary Shelter: Serving our homeless neighbors
  with dignity first
project_summary: >-
  We will deploy architecturally designed, low-impact shelters made of treated
  cardboard at managed sites around LA nightly to transform conceptions of what
  emergency homeless shelter can be.

  We need to rethink what an emergency homeless shelter can look like, where it
  can be located, and how it can better serve and maintain dignity for those
  experiencing homelessness. LA has the highest numbers in the country of
  homeless who are without access to shelter, and we also top the percentage of
  unsheltered homeless (78%) amongst US urban areas. That means over 45,000
  people do not have a sanctioned place to sleep as of the Jan 2017 count; the
  number will likely be higher once the 2018 count is reported in May, given the
  26% rise in homelessness between 2016 to 2017.
   
   Emergency shelters are typically conceived of as physical buildings within which people are aggregated into open sleeping arrangements. Two main problems of this approach are: traditional brick-and-mortar facilities cannot be built or converted fast enough to meet the urgent need, and grouping strangers into such an environment can elevate anxieties. Instead of limiting the format of such shelter to permanent structures, our activation reimagines what we can do with existing outdoor lots that can serve multiple purposes, including for very temporary and quickly deployable shelter. The Cardborigamis will also give clients a sense of private space that will reinforce their well-being while a part of the collective site.
   
   Our homeless neighbors belong to all geographies of LA, and they find places to sleep wherever they can, often in areas that are familiar to them. Itâ€™s crucial for us to recognize that the need for emergency shelter is dispersed, and concentrating services or resources in a few spots that are hard to reach or require transportation to is not the answer. As reliable access to shelter is top priority for someone to transition off the streets, locating shelter pop-ups closer to where the homeless already are, rather than moving them to far, unfamiliar places, ensures a higher likelihood of them progressing with services. With our no-lasting-trace footprint, Cardborigami will empower neighborhoods with our shelters and joint planning to show that creating a shelter site does not need to be a long-term capital commitment for a what should be a temporary state. This approach also allows for siting that is much more responsive and flexible to changes in demand.
   
   The lack of emergency shelter is an acute bottleneck preventing more homeless from being connected with needed services. Further, what legal shelter is available often has preset limits for who they can accept and how many, based on gender, life stage and official funding allocations of beds for various sub-populations. This type of planning is heavily weighted in infrastructure and cannot adjust to the dynamic conditions or demographics of homelessness. Our activation will increase the efficient use of outreach workers by creating new locations where they can do intakes & assessments for the countywide Coordinated Entry System, while reducing disruptions that unsheltered folks experience with street sweeps.
