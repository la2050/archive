  Since its launch nearly five years ago, #HashtagLunchbag takes advantage of
  the power of social media to to digitally organize Angelenos to come together
  and bring about meaningful change to the most vulnerable of our communities.
  What makes #HashtagLunchbag so unique, successful and incredibly popular is
  our belief that in person connections will yield greater results and greater
  overall impact. When nearly 200 volunteers come out each month to prepare,
  decorate, inspire, and serve meals to those in need, we not only feed the
  recipients of our lunch bags but also feed our souls by making a difference
  through our actions, through our volunteerism, and through our belief that we
  can solve large and complex problems when we work together.
   
   We work with our local business communities and leaders in a myriad of fields to bring awareness of the important work we perform. We provide businesses with a number of opportunities to engage in #HashtagLunchbag activations and encourage them to promote our efforts in alignment with their corporate social responsibilities. Such efforts are typically tied into two major elements:
   
   Increase volunteerism within their business and local offices
   
   Increase financial contributions in order to broaden and enhance our impact
   
   Through our activations we provide deeply meaningful and moving opportunities for volunteers to tackle large scale challenges like food insecurity. 
   
   One of the newest programs #HashtagLunchbag is poised to launch is a voter registration component to increase voter turnout and participation within our volunteer groups. We believe that civic engagement is directly tied to an informed citizenry that is crucial in bringing about change to large scale and complex programs within our city and communities.
