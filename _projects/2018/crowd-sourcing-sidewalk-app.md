title: Crowd-Sourcing Sidewalk App
project_summary: >-
  Let's build an open-source app that collects crowd-sourced data on sidewalk
  condition to create accessible walking routes and identify which sidewalks
  need TLC.

  Using a schema called OpenSidewalk in partnership with The University of
  Washington’s Taskar Center for Accessible Technology, The Glue proposes
  developing an app for LA residents to crowdsource data on the location and
  condition of sidewalks during “mapathon” events as well as every day. This
  data will include accessibility concerns (width, incline, barriers, etc),
  general attributes (cleanliness, potholes, weeds, etc) as well as add
  local-specific attributes, shade hours for example. With enough data, we can
  help users plan a trip that produces the best way forward for pedestrians of
  all types.
   
   
   
   We currently have a proprietary interactive prototype that we will use to build out into a fully functional initial app. In collaboration with the University of Washington we will establish a baseline pedestrian network, and then invite participants to validate and adjust individual areas. Functionality will include GPS tracking of data including barriers, incline, curbs, lighting, ramps, tactile paving, wheelchair access, amenities such as water fountains, benches, shelter, toilets and others. Additionally, we may implement camera width measurement and exact incline measurement by gyroscope. 
   
   
   
   Using this initial product, after thorough testing, we will design and hold ‘mapathon’ events centered around high density transit areas to gather data in initial large bursts. Using those learnings, we will refine the app if needed, as well as our incentivisation approach, and hold more mapathon events, as well as release the app for use in people’s everyday lives. 
   
   
   
   The data we generate will serve two important purposes. It will allow citizens to plan the best routes, end to end. It will also allow us to collect open-source information to add to LA’s on the condition of pedestrian access in and around the most dense and trafficked transit areas. This will help both public and private organizations to prioritize issues that may keep citizens from walking and using transit to its fullest. 
   
   
   
   The end result will have benefits that tie directly to improving LA’s walk, bike and transit score. If physical access to transit is easier to understand, as well as in better repair, that will increase transit use and ridership. Allowing citizens to find the most accessible route for them, especially for those in wheelchairs, with limited mobility, or simply pushing a stroller will enhance overall safety, making people feel better about getting outside and enjoying Los Angeles. Finally, simply the knowledge that “someone is listening” when citizens report problems goes a long way to instill faith and trust in civic organizations. These all contribute to our shared goal of a more livable and sustainable city.
