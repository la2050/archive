title: 'Equal Footing LA: Providing New Shoes For Kids In Need'
project_summary: >-
  Too many kids in LA are missing school because they don’t have shoes—or being
  bullied because they are wearing inappropriate shoes. We will provide brand
  new athletic shoes to LAUSD school children.

  The children in our community need to know that they are important and we
  believe in them. For too long in LA, we have ignored these children’s needs
  and neglected to send this message. Funding from LA2050 will provide a direct
  investment in the children of Los Angeles—the future of LA—and make the city a
  better place to LIVE by dramatically improve the lives of these children, many
  of whom have never owned a new pair of shoes. 
   
   
   
   Shoes are so much more than shoes. The gift of new shoes can be a transformative experience for young children, many of whom have never received a new box of anything before, certainly not expensive shoes. With the support of their community, children grow to be better citizens—better Angelinos. This sentiment is best captured in the following thank you note: “Thank you so much for the shoes you are giving me. This is amazing what you are doing... You are going to make a lot of kids happy and you are showing me what kind of person I want to be when I grow up.” 
   
   
   
   Our program provides a meaningful, concrete way for individuals, businesses, and community organizations to make a real difference in what can often seem an overwhelming problem—child poverty. We believe that most people want to make a difference but feel overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the problems we face. Shoes That Fit offers a solution by connecting people to schools in their own backyards; we operate wherever we have people who want to make a difference. Year after year, our volunteers return to help schools in their own neighborhoods, often increasing their support and buying more shoes for more kids. Helping children empowers our volunteers, provides a sense of pride in their community, and empowers them to make a real impact on the daily life of children in need. Ultimately, it creates a more engaged community, and a better LA. 
   
   
   
   Unfortunately, the inner city of LA is so large and has such high poverty rates that it does not have the number of local support groups we find in other communities. Yet Southern California has an enormous concentration of wealth and social conscience. Being based in Southern California, our number one goal is to increase the number of children we reach in Los Angeles so that we create a more thriving community now and for future generations. Together, we can inspire the next generation of Angelinos through the simple gift of a new pair of shoes.
