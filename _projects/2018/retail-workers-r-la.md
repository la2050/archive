title: Retail Workers “R” LA
project_summary: >-
  The project will enable LA’s 150,000 retail workers to connect with each other
  across LA’s vast size, learn their rights, register to vote, and become
  effective, civically engaged advocates.

  The nearly 150,000 retail workers in LA are subject to erratic and
  unpredictable scheduling and lack of access to full time work. Based on a
  survey of over 800 workers led by the Fair Workweek team and volunteers, and a
  UCLA study based on that survey and other research, 80% of retail workers lack
  a set schedule each week, 72% work different days every week, 77% receive one
  week or less notice of their schedules, and 62% of workers are expected to
  have “open availability.”
   
   This practice creates insurmountable obstacles to planning for childcare, attending classes, obtaining a second job, or being active in their communities. To overcome this problem, workers need to connect with each other and advocate for themselves.
   
   Retail workers are discouraged from civic engagement due to the difficulty of connecting with each other in a city the size of LA. Through use of social media including Facebook and Twitter, we will enable workers to connect on line from Sylmar to Wilmington.
   
   We are enhancing on line connectivity by designing a customized app accessible to all retail workers in the city through which they can learn about their rights, enforcement of wage and hour rules, and the problems they share with other workers.
   
   The Retail Workers App, in addition to enabling connection among workers, will ask workers to enter their work schedules so that the Fair Workweek team can collect data and determine if those schedules violate any rules. They will be able to share their problems and, by connecting with each other, become activated to work on solutions by joining the campaign to win a policy that will regulate scheduling practices. Retail workers can also engage with each other to share strategies to manage their lives and join together to advocate for a better city and job quality. 
   
   Through advocacy for a policy, workers will become civically engaged and can learn how to push the city government to be responsive to their needs. This will provide an opening to promote voter registration and turnout.
   
   Based on face to face meetings with workers and connecting on line, we can identify potential leaders who will be trained in leadership skills and can volunteer to take leadership roles in the campaign.
   
   Once the policy is adopted, workers will be better able to connect with each other through scheduled meetings and events and to participate more actively in civic life. Their lives will be fuller as they are able to spend more time with their children, attend school, and other activities that require having a predictable schedule.
   
   We will also test which platforms and apps are most effective in connecting and activating workers.
