  Technology has changed the way we live and interact with each other and how we
  access services that aid our daily living. Not having online access to
  services or understanding how to participate in an online/always connected
  world can leave a community behind and drastically expand the digital divide.
  To address the needs of Angelenos who may be experiencing this gap in
  technology adoption, the City of Los Angeles’ Information Technology Agency
  (ITA) plans to provide Digital Literacy programming to under-connected
  residents to ensure all Angelenos have access to opportunities and services.
  This builds upon the current ITA OurCycleLA Digital Inclusion programming and
  the Digital Literacy education provided by LA Public Library System (LAPL). 
   
   
   
   As the City of Los Angeles is working to be a premier Smart City of the future there is continuous innovation to improve City services from traffic congestion to clean streets to air quality monitoring. Thus City is embarking on how to work smarter using technology and data. With this comes the challenge of ensuring that all Angelenos are digitally connected to their communities and to the City at large. Digital connectivity, or internet connectivity, is not only important for accessing City services, it is also a major component for educational advancement, job opportunity identification, healthcare services and remaining connected to friends and family. 
   
   As the City looks to a future where everyone has equitable broadband access in their homes or places of school or work, this GoDigital! LA’s Digital Literacy Program proposal will provide an interactive learning program for currently ‘under-connected’ families in South LA to understand the benefits on going online as well as how to do so in a safe manner. For those who are not currently active in the Digital economy, there may be a fear of going online, a lack of trust as well as a lack of understanding as to how it applies to their everyday lives. This population may not be connected for a variety of reasons - lack of interest, lack of access to affordable services, lack of access to technology. However through the City of LA’s Libraries and Community Based Organizations, there’s an opportunity for this population to gain the skills and grow the confidence needed to use online services to improve livability.
   
   
   
   This project will engage parents, grandparents, students, etc. as a way of erasing the Digital Divide. The program will specifically teach safe tasks such as creating a secure login, as well as provide education on how to use computers, mobile phones and tablets to engage in activities from paying bills, helping children with homework, to engaging in activities as streaming faith-based programming or one’s favorite music.
   
   
   
   The pace of technological changes is fast, this project will make sure no Angeleno is left behind and that they are prepared to actively participate in a mobile, digital economy.
