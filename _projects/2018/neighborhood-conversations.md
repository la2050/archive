  In 2016 25,571 Angelinos voted in their neighborhood council elections. That's
  less than 1%. Nothing will happen.
   
   
   
   People see their government as disconnected from them.
   
   
   
   People feel progress is stymied by politics and polarization.
   
   
   
   People fear politics on social media is making things worse.
   
   
   
   Angelinos - CONNECT in Civil Pursuit of making your world awesome! 
   
   
   
   It seems impossible, it seems like nothing will happen, BUT with new tools for connecting, your participation, and a big LA2050 campaign to welcome everyone, LA is going to be awesome! 
   
   
   
   There are new tools for connecting online. They are not like social media, they are based on time tested best practices of face to face deliberative discussion. 
   
   
   
   "Deliberative discussion" is a structured conversation allowing a group of people to receive and exchange information, to critically examine an issue, and voice their conclusions in a way which will inform decision making. 
   
   
   
   These new tools are designed to enable deliberative discussion on line, like a professional facilitator would in person. They make it possible for people, who may disagree, to collaborate in investigation of the issues they confront, to understand the many concerns involved, to be heard and counted, and once in a while to find a new idea that no one had thought of before. And online, very large numbers of people can participate. 
   
   
   
   With everyone CONNECTED and engaging with each other, their neighborhood council, their city council, their state and US representatives, LA is going to be the best place to connect, and it's going to be awesome!
   
   
   
   Now a council (or rep.) can hear from constituents their answers to questions like:
   
   
   
   "What are the biggest concerns you have for your neighborhood"
   
   or 
   
   "How can we all make our neighborhood an even better community together?"
   
    
   
   And instead of getting overwhelmed with individual comments, they will receive a prioritized list of answers, as rated by the community, with their most important reasons why and why not, again rated by the community. And these aren't just the top of mind "answers" like from a poll, these are thoughtful answers the community has discussed and reconsidered.
   
   
   
   And then the top answers can be turned around into new questions for the community to discuss. Thus the engagement can continue and become a norm.
   
   
   
   The community and council will see the numbers, understand the competing viewpoints, and find affinity for those who have them, and 'politics' will evolve into working toward solutions that work for the community as a whole. The polarization will reverse.
   
   
   
   This form of problem solving is what face to face deliberative discussion is good at - but it has always been constrained by space, cost and time. Now, online, we do not have those constraints!
   
   
   
   Our metric is voter turn out, and deliberative engagement has been shown to increase that. And with everyone in LA connecting and working together deliberatively, awesome, impossible things - will happen.
