  Across Los Angeles, young women, particularly women of color are
  underrepresented in math, science, and technology. Girls typically are not
  found in high level math and science classes, having been discouraged early on
  in their educational journey. The Girls Academic Leadership Academy (GALA)
  aims to break this pattern by providing girls with a STEM-centered college
  prep curriculum in a learning environment that strongly supports girls to be
  smart, self confident, and successful. GALA provides leadership training and
  the skills necessary to persist in STEM fields. The GALA Launch Her Future
  focus is a project based medical and biomedical program which will focus on
  the intersection of medicine and technology, allowing our girls to become true
  leaders and innovators in this burgeoning new field. Supporting the LA2050
  LEARN metric of students’ immersion in science, technology, engineering, and
  math content, GALA is requesting support not just in STEM but in the newest
  field within STEM, including project based medical and technological
  innovation. GALA aims to encouraging learning and growth in this field by
  investigating medical mysteries, and using technology to solve them, which
  will advance the goal of 100% graduation and 100% college matriculation. In
  studying medical inventions, technological and biomedical innovation, students
  will work with the same equipment and tools used by professionals in the
  field. GALA students will be empowered to explore and find solutions to some
  of today’s most pressing medical challenges. Through activities that connect
  learning to life, students will step into the roles of biomedical science
  professionals investigating such topics as use of technology in medicine,
  genetics and issues in public health. Students will work together in teams to
  explore problems and find unique solutions, learning in-demand, transferable
  skills. One of the student inspired goals is health care advocacy and
  accessibility for Los Angelenos in need especially focusing in on homeless
  women. Our students hope to one day create an app or digital website that
  could be used to connect these women to health resources. This connects to the
  LA is the Healthiest place to LIVE part of LA2050 in that the girls long term
  goal is to affect greater change through access to medicine in the city. With
  access to the curriculum and resources, GALA students can explore public
  health issues such as how to detect and fight infection; screen and evaluate
  for disease and treatment options; and develop technology to support their
  findings. Through real-world cases, students will be exposed to a range of
  interventions, diagnostics, and devices related to immunology, surgery,
  genetics, and pharmacology. GALA’s mission is to provide its diverse community
  of young women with an excellent STEM education that prepares them for success
  in both university studies and their careers. The Launch Her Future biomedical
  technology project will do just that.
