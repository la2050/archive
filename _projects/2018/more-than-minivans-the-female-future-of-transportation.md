make_la_great: "Everyone needs to get somewhere. We need to get to work, to school, to soccer games, to get food, everyday. In Los Angeles this is often easier said than done, particularly if your trips are invisible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Only 16 percent of daily trips are for work, yet nearly all of Los Angeles’ transportation efforts go into improving travel for commuters. So what is happening for the other 84 percent of trips?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n While we increasingly see women in the workforce, we still see traditional gender splits in different-sex parental households. Women tend to remain the primary caregivers, including making trips for school/child care, appointments, activities, and household errands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Our LA2050 activation will daylight these trips, faces, and voices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Transportation connects Angelenos with opportunity. But at its worst can prevent them from accessing resources and networks. Our activation will employ a multi-pronged strategy to ensure that women and mothers are not forgotten as we look to expand how our transportation network connects us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Data and groundtruthing: Analyze national and regional travel data to analyze patterns we see in women workers, caregivers, and mothers. Preliminary findings will be shared with community organizations and members to identify alignment with their lived experiences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Storytelling: Work with community organizations and local media to develop and distribute multilingual, multimedia stories of women’s daily needs and how transportation impacts them. This process will also teach women how to utilize film and photo to tell their own stories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Education and advocacy: Host online and in-person advocacy trainings to co-power community members to advocate for their own transportation needs. Groundtruthed data and stories from the first two strategies will be used to message the unaddressed needs of women with transportation policymakers at these trainings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n We propose to utilize metrics recommended by LA2050 and our own suggested metrics we believe will measure successful impact of our activation:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Government responsiveness to residents’ needs (LA2050): Data-driven advocacy and humanizing stories will be used to influence regional transportation policy and funding decisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Transit-accessible housing and employment (LA2050): Transit improvements that serve both work and non-work trips will increase the connection between public transportation and daily origins and destinations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Advocacy capacity (suggested): Individuals exposed to technical assistance in advocacy tactics and storytelling development, through both online and offline platforms. Includes, but not limited to, neighborhood councils (LA2050).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Transportation funding allocated based on non-work trip data (suggested): Formulas or metrics adopted in Metro countywide policy and funding frameworks that account for both work and non-work trips based on our data analysis and advocacy."
