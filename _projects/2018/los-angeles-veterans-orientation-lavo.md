project_measure: |-
  With the LA2050 support, we will measure our success in 3 ways. 
   
   
   
   1) The LAVO will have the ability to fund four (4) events annually, each with the capacity to host 100 veterans. 
   
   2) The LAVO will receive the capability to develop a Veteran Mentorship Program, providing direct support and assistance to 50 veterans annually.
   
   3) The LAVO will be able to expand its outreach and marketing into the San Gabriel Valley, East LA and South Bay. Veterans feel most comfortable talking to other veterans, and the LAVO will ensure that every LA Veteran is welcomed into the LA's vibrant veteran community.

  Angeles County. The LAVO provides a casual, informal community for veterans to
  discuss their needs, obtain information about available resources, and access

  Angeles County, the quarterly orientations maintain a friendly, "small
  community" approach with attendance ranging from 50-70 veterans each month.

  LAVO will partner with student veteran populations, local veterans services
  orgnaizations/providers as well as LA city and county officials to primarily
  engage veterans who have recently arrived to LA (1 year or less). 
   
   
   
   Our value is that we make events fun and entertaining first thus allowing veterans to have low pressure and friendly environment to discuss resources/benefits. 
   
   
   
   LAVO will host speakers and representatives who provide various resources for employment, education, VA benefits (medical), family services, housing, and more. Past speakers have included former NFL players, county officials, city representatives, and various industry leaders. 
   
   
   
   LAVO provides an atmosphere of camaraderie and social interaction in a location that is unique to Los Angeles so that veterans can discover their resources and city at the same time. Past event locations include LACMA, Disney Studios, Fox Studios, Deloitte's downtown office and many other veteran friendly locations.
project_five_years: >-
  In less than 2 years, LAVO has become the model for other communities in the
  Southern Califonia to replicate in support of their veterans. In 5 years, we
  plan for LAVO to be the national model for veterans outreach and that Los
  Angeles will be the most veteran friendly city in the nation.
