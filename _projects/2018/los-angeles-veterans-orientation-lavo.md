  Founded by veterans for veterans, LAVO is a monthly event for veterans who
  have recently transitioned to LA county where they can come to be introduced
  to a myriad of benefits, services, and local opportunities. It is a one stop
  shop for the resources and networks veterans need for a successful transition
  into the LA veteran community and to Los Angeles overall. 
   
   
   
   According to a University of Southern California School of Social Work report, nearly 12,000 veterans return to Los Angeles every year, largely unprepared for civilian life. The study found that six in 10 post-9/11 veterans identified assistance needed for employment, education and Veterans Affairs benefits. LAVO can be a preventative measure ensuring veterans find the resources they need before it’s too late. 
   
   
   
   LAVO will host speakers and representatives who provide various resources for employment, education, VA benefits (medical), family services, housing, and more. 
   
   
   
   LAVO will provide an atmosphere of camaraderie and social interaction. Every veteran will have an opportunity to introduce themselves and there will be a social atmosphere for veterans to meet one another including veterans who are well connected to the veteran community in LA. Veterans will also be introduced to volunteer and civic opportunities should they want to get involved in their communities. Our goal is to make the most veteran friendly city in the country!
