  Beyond fostering a sense of collaborative innovation, our events culminate
  with specific deliverables that ensuring the content and prototyped concepts
  produced live beyond a 72-hour period.



   ProduceAthon participants are divided up into teams during the event. Storytelling Teams and Tech Teams. While some team members develop actual content, videos, and prototype new technologies, other team members will be focused on strategy and growth pertaining to their projects.



   Storytelling Teams are responsible for delivering a Content Strategy Plan to ensure the cause they've worked on can use the content to (1) generate awareness (2) increase volunteerism (3) increase donations



   Tech Teams are responsible for delivering a business plan on how to fund, scale, and implement their proposed technology to address the social or city challenge they worked on.



   The best ideas are presented to a panel of judges and investors at event culmination -- during a Release Party.



   From there, the top two pitches will receive funding to implement their content strategy and business plan as well as access to resources, mentors, co-working spaces, and city officials for guidance that monitors progress and ensures sustainable and systemic growth.



   The more events we're able to host in a given year will increase and attract higher caliber participants and result in more innovative ideas and concepts.



   This, in turn, will generate greater interest among higher caliber investors and VCs.



   This is how we ultimately affect and increase the Patents per Capita, # of high growth startups, and VC investment.
