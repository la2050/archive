  Team Rubicon utilizes technology to effectively provide relief to the most
  vulnerable populations during a disaster. A recent review of studies on the
  relationship between poverty and disasters in the U.S. by Fothergill & Peek
  revealed that socio-economic status is a significant predictor of the physical
  and psychological impacts in the pre- and post- disaster stages. Using a
  platform developed by Palantir, Team Rubicon maps neighborhoods that are most
  vulnerable from a socio-economic standpoint by overlaying tax records,
  insurance information, and census data. In many cases these communities lack
  the tax-base to provide professional, community based disaster services, or
  are overshadowed by wealthier areas impacted by the same disaster. Within
  urban areas, Team Rubicon’s focus is often on communities of color and
  non-native English speakers. These communities are disproportionately impacted
  by disasters, lack the personal or community-based resources to fend for
  themselves, and cannot agitate for government support as effectively as their
  affluent neighbors. 
   
   
   
   Team Rubicon’s Resilient City Initiative will create greater volunteer density in Los Angeles, training local residents to provide disaster relief. Our initiative tackles three pressing issues: Los Angeles' preparedness for and ability to respond to disasters; the challenges of veterans reintegrating into our communities; and the lack of civic engagement in local communities today. The recently released Veterans Civic Health Index reveals veterans consistently outperform civilians in volunteer hours contributed and are more apt to work with neighbors to fix community problems. 
   
   
   
   Leveraging the power of the military’s diversity can help our country and city heal and respond in new (yet proven) ways, bringing a new sense of social cohesion to Los Angeles. The military is one of the most diverse institutions on the planet today. However, most veterans return to their less-diverse origins upon discharge and the value of inclusion and understanding dissipates over time. Yet, if inspired to come together once again in service, engaging and empowering veterans builds bridges across the divides that are tearing at the fabric of our country. 
   
   
   
   Team Rubicon believes that Los Angeles County's veterans can and should be a force of change to help those most vulnerable. According to the USC School of Social Work: Los Angeles County Veterans Study, California is home to over 1.8 million former service members, with approximately 12,000 military veterans settling in Los Angeles County every year, joining the 325,000 veterans who currently reside here. One in five veterans suffer from post-traumatic stress and over two-thirds report difficulties adjusting to civilian life. Team Rubicon seeks to merge veterans’ military identity with civilian life by establishing a community network of volunteers supporting communities affected by disaster in Southern California.
