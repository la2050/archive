  RideLA. Rewarding Impact and Driving Engagement on LA’s Metro via a Blockchain
  based Mobile App.
project_summary: >-
  The RideLA app will incentivize use of public transportation by offering a
  Blockchain based game system through which riders earn credits to exchange for
  goods and services across LA.

  Our app will make LA the best place to CONNECT because it will be fun and it
  will have clearly measurable impacts on four mobilization paths.
   
    
   
   The app will influence individual behavior by incentivizing use of public transportation. Angelinos know that public transportation is better for the environment, but they aren’t rewarded for using it. Our app will give riders points in three ways: for ‘checking in’ to a bus (or train), for submitting ridership density data and for distance travelled. Those points will be stored in the Blockchain and through partnerships with local businesses riders will be able to exchange their points for goods and services (ex. meals, event tickets, etc…). This will be measured by rider check-ins and density reporting.
   
    
   
   Our app will encourage businesses to change practices through a Blockchain exchange. Businesses that join the exchange will gain positive PR for being supporters of public transportation and for being part of LA’s innovation economy. This will be measured by the number of business that join the exchange and by the number of rider points exchanged.
   
    
   
   Our app will also create a new tool for greater civic engagement. Public transportation projects are expensive and take a long time to complete. Incentivized, rewarded riders are more likely to support transportation projects, be patient with timelines and with possible tax increases for funding. This will be measured by suggesting pro-public transportation social media postings and user response rate.
   
    
   
   Our app will use digital tools, specifically games and Blockchain, to engage and activate Angelinos to care more about our city’s transportation infrastructure. Our generation is media-savvy, digitally literate and politically active. We know what can be accomplished through social networks. #MarchForOurLives is a recent, important example of what we can accomplish. While public transportation is not as urgent an issue as gun control, it is one that we need to tackle now so that we can have a beautiful, healthy city to live in when we are adults in 2050. Change needs to be faster and start now! This will be measured by the number of rider check-ins and the number of pro-public transportation social media postings using RideLA specific hashtags.
   
    
   
   The CONNECT metrics we target are: number of public transit riders, travel time to work, and attendance at cultural events. We will measure riders and travel time by app usage data. We will measure attendance at cultural events by the number of social media postings about events that include the RideLA hashtags.
