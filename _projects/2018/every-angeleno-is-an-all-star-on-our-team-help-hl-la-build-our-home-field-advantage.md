  The Harlem Lacrosse model embeds Program Directors in the schools that host
  our program, which allows for daily mentorship, leadership and enrichment
  activities, tutoring, study hall, test prep as well as lacrosse instruction
  and competition. Our purpose is to teach the children of South LA, Compton and
  Inglewood the skills that will lead to their success as students, athletes and
  citizens. Skills like self-control, resilience, teamwork and a growth mindset
  have particular importance for kids that grow up in low-income urban
  communities. We believe that with intentional program design and talented
  coaches, the sport itself and its complementary academic support provide the
  perfect context to teach these skills. This model transcends a typical
  after-school sports program by providing wrap-around programming in a safe,
  structured, year-round environment that is centered on immersive academic and
  sport-based learning. We know that the sport is naturally engaging for all
  kids and we are hopeful that together, with LA2050, Harlem Lacrosse — Los
  Angeles can continue to deepen our impact and provide the kinds of experiences
  that are truly life-changing to even more young people in our community,
  intergenerational families, and the community at large.
   
   
   
   On HL-LA “playdays,” Enterprise Park transforms into a recreational oasis. As the buses deliver eager players ready to take part in the day’s events, parents, guardians, grandparents and siblings of all ages begin to gather in the prime shady locations on the sidelines. Volunteers from area high schools and colleges start organizing the players into age groups and teams; while the lacrosse training begins, coaches, tutors, police officers, teachers and mentors from corporate partners chat with parents about their child’s experiences, academic improvement, school choice or tutoring questions, goals, and much more. Harlem Lacrosse-LA is not just affecting its student-athletes’ lives, its impact is felt across generations and across the community. Many HL-LA parents and guardians did not attend college and rely on the advice and counseling of the HL-LA program directors, tutors and career advisors to help create an academic path to college preparedness for their children. Aside from the direct impact, HL-LA is growing alongside its members, expanding to high school programs as many students advanced to ninth grade. Many coaches and staff are themselves “graduates” of Harlem Lacrosse-LA (and its predecessor City Lacrosse), and these valuable work opportunities empower the older students to stay involved and give back. 
   
   Providing opportunities like these helps to keep HL-LA students and their families engaged in the program; these students are encouraged to improve attendance and grades, and stay in school, in order to remain as active members of the HL-LA community.
