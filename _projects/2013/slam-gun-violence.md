    At risk youth who are survivors of gun violence -- either shot themselves or
    lost someone to gun violence -- will be given an opportunity to channel
    their anger and grief into a medium, Slam Poetry, instead of channeling
    their anger into more violence.  At the same time, Los Angeles will benefit
    from the artistic contributions of its youth and can become a national model
    for gun violence intervention.
  collaborators: "We are hopeful that Nikki Blak, the recipient of the 2005 World Stage/UCLA Literary Scholarship, will be our Artistic Director.  Nikki has been a member of the 2006 Los Angeles, 2007 Hollywood, and 2008 San Diego Slam Teams. In 2010, she earned the title of Los Angeles Grand Slam Champion and was a member of the LA Slam Team, which she also co-slam mastered and coached. Last year, she revisited her role as co-slam master, coach, and member of the 2011 LA and member of the 2011 LA Slam team.\r\n\r\nWe are also in discussions with Santa Monica Sam, a rapper who has rapped about gun violence, to oversee the production of performances."

    Women Against Gun Violence has been around since 1993 working to prevent gun
    violence in Los Angeles City and County.  We have done this work through
    storytelling.  Our Speakers Bureau members, gun violence survivors
    themselves, share their stories with students throughout Los Angeles Unified
    School District  so that youth can see the actual tragedy of gun violence. 
    Our Speakers Bureau members also share their stories  with policymakers to
    encourage change in our gun regulations.  We were included in Vice President
    Biden's meetings in January 2013 where our Speakers Bureau format was
    considered part of a national solution.

    Women Against Gun Violence believes that we are all in this together.  We
    believe in coalition building and are members of many anti-gun violence
    coalitions both in Los Angeles, in our State of California, and nationwide. 
    Preventing gun violence is a multi-pronged approach and we applaud those who
    offer up ideas that attack one of the many underlying factors of gun
    violence.  We work closely with the Violence Prevention Coalition, Mayors
    Against Illegal Guns, Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, and the Brady Campaign
    ... to name just a few of our partners in fighting this epidemic.
  vision: >-
    Youth would be participating in the cultural experience of Slam Poetry and
    the continuing program of SLAM GUN VIOLENCE instead of resorting to gun
    violence to express their feelings of anger and isolation.  Youth would be
    staying in school, improving their grades, encouraging others to do the
    same.  Gun violence would continue to decrease.  And SLAM GUN VIOLENCE would
    become a national model!
