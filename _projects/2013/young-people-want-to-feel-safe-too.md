title: Young people want to feel safe too
indicator: ' Public Safety'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >+
  "Fear is very real in the lives of children from hard places. In fact, fear
  often ‘bullies’ our children into much of their misbehavior. As a result, it
  is critical that parents of children from hard places approach fear and
  feardriven behaviors with compassion, insight and wisdom."   Dr. Karyn
  Purvis   http://empoweredtoconnect.org/theimpactoffear/



  Youth do not feel safe anymore in the streets or anywhere outside of their
  community.  Often times they do not feel safe in their community.  One of the
  key issues is the distrust between youth and law enforcement.  The contacts
  between the two entities are often negative or for enforcement purposes only
  leaving our youth feeling disfranchised not just by gangs, bullies, or
  antagonists, but by the very system designed to protect them.  



  Oftentimes, this negative interaction stays with youth and they lose faith in
  law enforcement.  Whether the reasoning is correct or not, a greater trust
  must be forged by youth and public safety and that includes increased
  education for both entities.  Youth must be empowered, educated, and
  entertained as they seek to learn about law enforcement and the role it can
  and should play in their lives.  Furthermore, a bridge must be established
  with law enforcement where they embrace the youth of Los Angeles as a
  resource.  



  Our program will seek to educate the youth through education and the use of
  interactive software designed empower youth on their rights, as well promote
  discourse with law enforcement agencies.  This program will encourage youth to
  become involved in youth advisory councils that are in place in their
  communities and help in the design of a community youth program that LA CAUSA
  is designing to encourage peer leadership to reduce crime, increase
  accountability, increase communication between the public and law enforcement
  entities including parents, peers, community, police, sheriffs, city and
  district attorneys, and the courts.  



  The program will teach youth the law and increase their understanding of its
  role in their lives, how to react to law enforcement contacts, the criminal
  justice system process so that the youth understands how it can help them, and
  finally to become vocal members of the community to increase community
  participation in a restorative justice program that LA CAUSA YouthBuild is
  creating.  It has been proven through many different studies that a
  restorative justice model will work in any community it is instituted.

  This program sets the foundation of young leaders as being active not passive
  participants in this program and allows them to work with leadership at all
  levels of promotion and become the stakeholders themselves in this process. 
  The outcomes should lead to lower recidivism rates for all violators who
  participate in a rj program, but in this cycle show lower negative contacts
  with law enforcement for all serviced youth and increased participation in the
  development of a rj program.  This would have the youth as stakeholders go to
  these entities and serve as cosponsors of program development and
  implementation.



  The outcome is reduced crime, increased trust between our youth and law
  enforcement, and increased youth participation in crime reduction strategies.


What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >+
  LA CAUSA YouthBuild is regarded as the organization that transformed the
  perception that the lives of the  youth it serves from a deficit based
  perspective (identifying the things they lack such as income, healthy food,
  education, employment) to an asset based population (passionate, conceptual
  thinkers, willing, and determined) that can overcome the challenges of life. 
  It's asset based thinking model has been adopted nationally by YouthBuild USA
  and many other programs. 



  LA CAUSA has empowered young leaders since 2005, allowing them the opportunity
  to go to post secondary education, start their own nonprofits, and become
  gainfully employed in a variety of jobs whereas, as new students in LA CAUSA
  they were young adults with no high school diplomas and limited job skills. 
  We have served thousands of youth over a very limited time.



  The organization was recognized by former Secretary of Labor of the Western
  United States opening of the United We Serve initiative of volunteerism by
  President Obama in 2010.  LA CAUSA has long focused on empowering our youth to
  volunteer as an AmeriCorps designated site and countless projects to "green"
  East LA and build gardens and healthy eating and living opportunities.  With
  that our organization continues to be progressive and promote challenging
  learning models including a mental toughness curriculum designed to prepare
  our youth for the world outside of our walls.



  Recognized as one of unincorporated East Los Angeles's only youth services
  group.  The opportunities and resources in the community are relatively
  limited while showing significant positive outcomes.


Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  This program will initially seek to involve the youth of LA CAUSA, Strategies
  for Youth (strategiesforyouth.org), the Los Angeles Police Department, Los
  Angeles Sheriff's Department, LA Probation, and courts to run these classes. 
  We will then outreach to other YouthBuild programs, and local entities with
  youth programs.  It will be an all inclusive program.  They will participate
  in trainings, and meetings, eventually becoming stakeholders in the
  development of the restorative justice program that LA CAUSA is working on.
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  Success on this project will be measured on a pre and post survey basis.  It
  will deal with officer knowledge base and youth knowledge base.  Furthermore,
  a followup will be attempted with our youth alumni who receive this service to
  see the impact of the trainings will have on their meetings.  The restorative
  justice program will be a much longer term program which will be an evidence
  based project with a longer timeline. The initial conception and stakeholder
  development will occur in this program.  The goal of this program will be to
  measure the fear level and distrust which will also be done via surveys
  ,ensuring activeness and openness to dealing with law enforcement and
  different location in Los Angeles.
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
  Los Angeles is a big city. It is a safe city.  But, our city doesn't feel safe
  to any of our youth and many adults.  This misperception could arguably create
  more unhappiness than we really need.  The fear of regions that have been
  infamously labeled such as "South Central", and "East LA" characterize the
  perception of fear people have for areas they have never really visited or
  experienced. Furthermore, controversies such as the Rodney King Beating and
  human rights violation charges in the Sheriff's department only further the
  perception that Los Angeles is a dangerous uninhabitable city. When in reality
  much has changed while the perception of these agencies has not.  The research
  project by SORIN MATEI, SANDRA J. BALLROKEACH, and JACK LINCHUAN QIU, titled,
  "Fear and Misperception of Los Angeles Urban Space: A SpatialStatistical Study
  of CommunicationShaped Mental Maps."
  http://mentalmap.org/files/matei_fear_CR.pdf



  Statistically analyzed how heightened and unsafe our populace feels even
  though crime has dropped to 1950 levels.  Part of the fear is of law
  enforcement by youth.  They do not see law enforcement as a support system,
  rather they see them as "the system" which is designed to take them from their
  families, harm them, and carry weapons.  The dialogue has disappeared and
  youth no longer actively participate in the community policing relationship.  



  This project will teach youth the law so they understand the logic and
  perception that law enforcement must walk within while investigating crimes. 
  Furthermore, they will be actively exposed to law enforcement so the fear of
  the unknown will be reduced.  RJ means less administrative and criminal
  justice costs.  Officers will be able to patrol more rather than be involved
  in administrative protocols involving youth, the courts will have reduced
  responsibility, public trust will increase and community policing with be
  promoted.  Furthermore, it reduces incarceration of youth which saves $200,000
  per youth in the system.  This program will save literally millions with just
  the initial investment of $100,000 to help our community.



  Using Strategies For Youth's Model of juvenile justice Jeopardy and Policing
  the Teen brain LA CAUSA is poised to empower youth and law enforcement. 
  Eventually engaging them in dialogue on a level that is frank, intimate, and
  respectful.  Youth and law enforcement alike will learn to empathize and
  communicate, role play and discourse together.  Society as a whole in Los
  Angeles will benefit.


What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  Crime will always exist in a city in which their are inequity and human
  beings.  What can be changed is the level of trust between the public and law
  enforcement.  Use of law enforcement as a resource for safety and open
  communication indicate a happier more trusting public.  LA CAUSA seeks to have
  it's young leaders become stewards of change in a community that has been
  voiceless.  In a community with many immigrants, fear of the system has led to
  victimization and our young people can be the generation that starts the cycle
  of change from protesting to advocating for improved relationships.  Youth
  will not be so easily incarcerated.  Intervention and prevention models will
  be used and effective in the lives of youth reducing recidivism.  Officers
  will have more of the community identified as advocates and voices of their
  patrol that they can rely on for support and dialogue.  It is not always to
  agree, but rather to dialogue in a trusting manner so that consensus and
  understanding can be maintained.  Only in this way will the community truly be
  the eyes and ears of law enforcement to reduce crime, promote safety, and
  reduce fear.

That actually benefit our client.   \r\n\r\nBecause of this, we actually meet via phone or in person monthly with many organizations that seek the same grants as us and have offered to partner with them so we can both continue to grow.

As a program component of the Juvenile Justice Jeopardy contains a train the trainer portion, we will seek to train our youth and have them work with our competitors to gain all the information and knowledge our program will gather.  We will always share what we learn with willing partners to improve their capacity as well as ours.

    answer: "LA CAUSA YouthBuild strives to build collaborations for the present and future.  As our name consists of words such as \"Unity\" and \"Communities\" we strive to be a leader in that same messaging by our actions of reaching out and partnering with organizations for a unified Los Angeles.  The concept of stand-alone non-profits is no longer feasible when we are facing such macro challenges in Los Angeles County.  The only success and justice we can provide our communities we serve is to be humble and open to our partnership.\r\n\r\nCompetition is also known to breed success.  We are constantly willing to learn and compare ourselves to our competition.  We need to measure our progress and learn if we can improve and help our competition get better as well.  Strangely enough, our philosophy is the more our competitors improve, then the more we as an organization must improve.  That actually benefit our client.   \r\n\r\nBecause of this, we actually meet via phone or in person monthly with many organizations that seek the same grants as us and have offered to partner with them so we can both continue to grow.  LA CAUSA will never be in a discussion as an organization unwilling to work with others and at the same time is will to stay engaged in the competition in a friendly manner to better all.\r\n\r\nWithin this program, we will invite the youth of all other agencies to participate with us.  As a program component of the Juvenile Justice Jeopardy contains a train the trainer portion, we will seek to train our youth and have them work with our competitors to gain all the information and knowledge our program will gather.  We will always share what we learn with willing partners to improve their capacity as well as ours.  One of our competing organizations has already expressed interest in our learning exchange invitations."

    answer: >-
      Crime will always exist in a city in which their are inequity and human
      beings.  What can be changed is the level of trust between the public and
      law enforcement.  Use of law enforcement as a resource for safety and open
      communication indicate a happier more trusting public.  LA CAUSA seeks to
      have it's young leaders become stewards of change in a community that has
      been voiceless.  In a community with many immigrants, fear of the system
      has led to victimization and our young people can be the generation that
      starts the cycle of change from protesting to advocating for improved
      relationships.  Youth will not be so easily incarcerated.  Intervention
      and prevention models will be used and effective in the lives of youth
      reducing recidivism.  Officers will have more of the community identified
      as advocates and voices of their patrol that they can rely on for support
      and dialogue.  It is not always to agree, but rather to dialogue in a
      trusting manner so that consensus and understanding can be maintained. 
      Only in this way will the community truly be the eyes and ears of law
      enforcement to reduce crime, promote safety, and reduce fear.
