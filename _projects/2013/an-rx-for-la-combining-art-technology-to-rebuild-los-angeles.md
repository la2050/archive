title: An Rx for LA  Combining Art & Technology to ReBuild Los Angeles
indicator: ' Income & Employment'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >+
  Our idea is to expand an existing program that has created dozens of new
  businesses and hundreds of new jobs — while helping revitalize an entire
  neighborhood  and attracting over 150 new businesses and working creative
  individuals — all without one dollar of public funds.



  An RX for Los Angeles will take what one person working with the assistance of
  dozens of different community members on each project  accomplished in
  Downtown and to now expand that program's scope in DTLA and then the reach out
  to the rest of Los Angeles.  So rather than it being a program to get one LA
  business to move to another part of LA — or competing with programs offering
  financing from the same pot of money or promoting facade improvement grants 
  RXforLA will look at the needs of each geographic area and the needs of each
  of the different major business categories (fashion, film, tech, small retail
  stores, food) to see what is working or not working.  Concurrently,  the
  different creative and tech industries are also examined to see how each of
  them might help any of these projects.  And, finally, each potential solution
  will also be examined by how it might impact any of LA's other indicators.  



  Now this may sound complicated, but there are those who quickly learn how to
  think in this way — and having multiple eyes look at each deal also makes it
  easier.  It also helps that  at times  the more constraints you have— the
  easier it might be to see the one thing that will work best.  It also helps
  that we have a team of serial entrepreneurs  who have started multiple
  businesses and have experienced just about everything that can happen.  



  The program's initial expansion will be to target specific social and industry
  wide problems within Downtown  — and then follow that with looking at specific
  industries & social problems outside of the greater Downtown area.  These
  focuses will make it easier to judge the results outside of the Downtown area.



  And now for a successful example of the process.  When the Last Bookstore
  opened its vastly expanded space at 5th & Spring, the newspapers were filled
  with all the local bookstores closing  new, vintage and even antiquarian
  bookstores.  They were closing due to not just AMAZON discounting new books
  but because AMAZON was also selling other people’s used books  as were online
  booksellers’ abebooks and eBay.  But after researching those challenges — and
  making the necessary business — and artistic  decisions, the store was
  profitable from the day it opened.  And the fact the store has expanded twice
  within a year after it opened — is no accident.



  The plan was developed by store owner Josh Spencer and  supported by the
  person who leased him the space — Brady Westwater, who started RXforLA , after
  he helped negotiated a lease  structured to make it financially possible for
  the store to first open — and then be able to expand.  And — again — none of
  this this was a fluke or an accident.  It was all planned



  And it has also fulfilled two other markers.  It has created not only a far
  connected local community, but a regionally connected larger arts community
  that didn’t exist before from all over Southern California.  And again — this
  was no accident — it was all planned from the very beginning.  






  Lastly old store  7 employees,  new store  27 employees.






  Turning to fashion, we have team members who run some of the leading LA
  Fashion Week shows for LA designers but, unfortunately, most designers don’t
  do shows in LA because our fashion week seems to be thrown together at the
  last minute —  spread out all over town, in multiple venues on different days
  — and that makes it impossible to attract the buyers and critics who attend
  New York's Fashion Week. 



  So everyone is finally asking— why can’t we all show under one big umbrella in
  one place with one set of dates?  But for that to happen —  planning would
  need to start now  to select a site and dates and then start to promote the
  hell out of the fact that LA will — finally — get its act together and try and
  have a real fashion week.  RXforLAT, if it is successful in getting the
  grant,  will develop a site promoting the major cultural industries of Los
  Angeles — a single place where people from around the world can come and see
  what is being planned.  And once that site is launched —  it will be a lot
  easier for the different producers of Fashion Week to agree upon dates and
  venues — since once everyone agrees to lock them down — then a serous effort
  can be made to lure buyers and critics from New York — and many other cities 
  to LA Fashion Week.  






  But first we need to create that infrastructure and even then   it won’t
  happen over night, But it needs to start somewhere — and it needs to start —
  now.  And to accomplish even just that — would be a huge win this fall for
  LA2050.


What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >+
  The RXforLA program is an expansion Brady Wastewater’s long work with a wide
  variety of stakeholders in DTLA.  Since moving there full time, he was a
  founding member of Downtown LA Neighborhood Council where served as both
  president & VP.  He also recruited the founders of Gallery Row, Nic Cha Kim
  and Kjell Hagen to DLANC and worked with them and Art Walk founder Bert Green
  with their projects since their inceptions and leased the majority of the
  first galleries on Gallery Row. He also helped start — and was president of
  LANCC  a citywide Neighborhood Council organization and he was one of the five
  members of the DWP MOU Committee that negotiated the first MOU with a City
  Agency.


   Since then. he as leased  (at no charge or helped create — over 150 different creative businesses or individual artists studios and when he saw the need for local fashion designers to show at reasonable rates, he organized two major Fashion Week Shows — first BOXeight — and now CONEPTU Fashion Week —with only six weeks notice. 


  He has also searched out individuals he felt would be successful in Downtown
  and convinced them first to move here — and then to opens businesses.  He also
  helped Downtown residents sell their art or their other products during Art
  Walk and then leased them stores.  He also convinced online sellers — such as
  THE LAST BOOKSTORE — to open physical spaces and convinced brick and mortar
  stores to do more sales online.



  When he read the Company of Angels lost its lease and was having a garage sale
  of all their equipment  he found them a new space 24 hours later and over the
  years, he helped over 50 homeless individuals find their way off the streets.


Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  Among our partners are the over 100 community members who have helped or
  worked with over the past decade.  It also includes institutions such as
  Gallery Row, Spring Arts Tower, the Los Angeles and the Palace Theatres, The
  Industry Opera group, Poor Dog Theater Company, Skin Graft, the HDBID and
  Bringing Back Broadway.
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  First, we are somewhat unusual in that we have already been very successful
  with our project   more successful in generating new businesses than any other
  economic development organization  even with six and seven figure budgets in
  our market area.






  So for a start we will take a baseline survey of our core market area and
  gather what statistics we can about the various local industries.   We will
  also monitor all of our new contacts to determine how many of them we convert
  to being 'clients'.






  And each of our many individual projects will also need a base line to be
  determined at the start so that there will be something to compare the later
  results with. 
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
  One of our fashion projects is working with groups and individuals who are
  trying to bring manufacturing jobs back to LA.  They are either setting up or
  working with existing groups of workers so that not matter or how large  or
  how small a job is  and no matter what skill that job will require  any
  designer will be able to get affordable quality work done.  This helps make up
  for all the lesser skilled jobs LA has lost over the years by creating higher
  skilled and higher paying jobs.






  Live Broadway theater is the number on tourist draw in New York  and it is now
  the only one of the major performing arts that has continued to grow both in
  grosses and in audience. 






  That is why one of our goals is to help develop a major theater district
  between the theaters in Downtown Los Angeles and  joined by the Red Line  the
  theaters of Hollywood and North Hollywood. And besides the billion dollars
  that New York reaps every year from the theater industry  it also creates more
  film and TV jobs in New York.  Live theater makes New York  and London  the
  only cities where an actor, director, or writer can have a major theatrical
  and film or TV career  concurrently. And it is one of the many reasons why LA
  is losing so much of the film and TV industry to New York.






  That's why we are working to assist all levels of the theatrical community
  from 49 and 99 seat equity waiver theaters to successfully finding tenants for
  existing DTLA theaters to working to create a major international  theater
  festival to helping develop technological advances that could change the
  future of live entertainment forever.  It's also why we have supported the
  Festival of New American Musicals and our new contemporary opera company  The
  Industry   since their inceptions.  A strong live theater community is
  essential to the long term health of  two of our largest existing industries 
  film & TV and tourism.


What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  The simple answer would be a Los Angeles that was as economically healthy as
  it once was.  The more complex answer would be enough good paying jobs for
  everyone who wants a job  to be able to get one  and a business climate that
  supports and rewards business.  Going much beyond that would require far more
  space to properly discuss.
