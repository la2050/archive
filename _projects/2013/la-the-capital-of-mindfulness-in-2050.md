title: LA the capital of mindfulness in 2050
project_summary: "<p>Our idea is to transform the health of Los Angeles by catalyzing a mindfulness movement and changing behavior upstream. Working with health care professionals, schools, hospitals, clinics, businesses, community centers, and citizen leaders we will provide the tools, teachings, and network of teachers to help more people learn how to install healthy behaviors that benefit ourselves, our families, our institutions, and our city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are three specific components of this idea: </p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Expand the existing InsightLA training programs for health care professionals, which currently provide mindfulness training to health care professionals at Children's Hospital of Los Angeles (CHLA) and other LA hospitals (UCLA Mattel Children's Hospital, St John's, Cedars-Sinai) and hospice programs, including a partnership with Skirball. Nurses, doctors, respiratory & other therapists, social workers, chaplains, and interpreters all receive mindfulness training. The program has proven to be popular and beneficial to the many health care professionals who have attended over the last six years. As eighty percent of child deaths in hospitals occur in ICUs, the mindfulness retreats were initially created to help PICU (Pediatric ICU) and NICU (Neonatal ICU) staffers deal with the grief of multiple losses. The program has since expanded to include practitioners from other units, including Hematology-oncology, Cardio-thoracic, Surgery, Adolescent Medicine, and Bone Marrow Transplant. We are interested in expanding this program by launching a teacher training program that specializes on serving the health care system and the people who provide care. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Repair and open a new 17 acre property that has recently been transferred to InsightLA and can serve as a center for mindfulness in the heart of the city. The property is a unique asset offering access to nature, canyon views, native plants, and hiking trails. An estimated $75,000 are needed this year for basic repairs to make the space usable. Once those repairs are made, we intend to hold a retreat for professional caregivers from area hospitals and hospices, and with this grant we would also package the case study to create manuals and show how this model can be scaled to other health institutions in LA. We can also utilize the space to create similar programs targeted to specific professional fields and workplaces throughout the city, as well as community colleges and LAUSD, offering leadership trainings to help current and future leaders develop mindfulness tools to help solve LA's most pressing challenges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Grow the network of teachers and programs that exists across LA in health care institutions, schools, and community centers through a Los Angeles Mindfulness Ambassador initiative. Currently, all InsightLA programs are open to the public, and participation is increasing. In addition to helping InsightLA launch a unique physical space, this project will help InsightLA take the mindfulness training programs online to increase reach and accessiblity of the trainings. Through this offline / online hybrid model, the project will effectively generate mindful leadership and action across our cultural, institutional, and community assets.</p>"

    We have trained more than 10,000 individual students in mindfulness. We have
    successfully maintained daily programs for which NO person is turned away
    for lack of funds. We have trained nurses, doctors, and social workers in
    mindfulness practices to deal with the dying and bereaved. We received
    grants totaling more than a half-million dollars from the Federal government
    to train clinicians at the Veterans Administration of Los Angeles to help
    them treat chronic sufferers of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and other
    conditions suffered by American veterans. We have expanded from a group of
    mindfulness practitioners meeting in a living room one night a week to
    full-service centers in three locations, and two satellite locations in the
    San Fernando Valley and South Bay. We have brought in nationally renowned
    speakers and held large public forums to educate citizens about how
    mindfulness can improve their lives.
  success: >-
    We will measure success by the ability to open the 17 acre facility this
    year, which currently is unfunded; by the number of health care
    professionals and community leaders who are trained in mindfulness; the
    number of new mindfulness teachers who go through InsightLA Programs; the
    number of communities with new practitioners and new teachers; and the
    number of people these teachers reach. Digital metrics will also be tracked,
    though additional resources will be needed to take that initiative to scale.
    The institute also has unprecedented opportunity to introduce mindfulness to
    LA based celebrities and athletes who can then engage the city and the world
    with the empirically-proven, scientifically-validated,
    experientially-contagious, cost-effective solution of meditation and
    mindfulness. Therefore, the number of influencers going through the program
    will also be tracked.

    <p>This project will create a world class resource for training leaders in
    the mindfulness movement in the heart of Los Angeles. With new access to a
    property of 17 acres of pristine nature, this project will enable InsightLA
    to create a functional space for training health care professionals,
    educators, and other community leaders to become mindfulness practitioners
    and teachers in Los Angeles. By 2050, the program will have trained
    thousands of Mindfulness Ambassadors for the city, including health care
    professionals, educators, and community leaders, and provided the catalytic
    support to make Los Angeles a 'mindful city' that addresses health and
    environmental indicators upstream. In addition, free training resources will
    be provided online, so anyone can improve their mindfulness and drive
    positive behavior change in their own lives. This project, while focused on
    health, attacks all of the indicators at their root, by giving each of us
    and all of us the tools and training to be more mindful and considerate
    about the way we engage with the social, political, and natural environment
    and contribute to our families, our communities, and our city.</p>

    We don't feel that other mindfulness centers are "competition." Rather, they
    are collaborative partners to bring what is largely a new area of scientific
    research - the benefits of mindfulness on the brain, health, and
    consciousness/compassion of those who practice it and to the growing number
    of people demanding to know more about these skills and to have affordable
    access. We co-sponsor programs, cross-pollinate ideas, share teachers,
    reciprocate publicity and best administrative practices, with the other
    centers in LA and nationwide who are also teaching mindfulness. There are so
    few people teaching it and so much need. The vast majority of our classes
    run full with a waiting list. We are happy if someone else also can help
    teach the growing number of people who come to us for help and education.
  vision: >-
    In 2050, LA is locally, nationally, and globally recognized as a leader in
    mindfulness. Thousands of active LA Mindfulness Ambassadors represent all of
    our neighborhoods and institutions. LA is seen as the city that pioneered
    healthy behaviour change through a mix of meditation and mindfulness
    training, which then led to more mindful systematic change. Our health care
    system has shifted to helping people live proactive healthy lives rather
    than treating chronic problems. The majority of citizens and actions are
    mindful, which leads to a drastic decrease in chronic disease, a more
    functional and solvent health system, and longer, more productive, healthier
    lives.

  Does your project impact Los Angeles County?: 'yes'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  <p>Our idea is to transform the health of Los Angeles by catalyzing a
  mindfulness movement and changing behavior upstream. Working with health care
  professionals, schools, hospitals, clinics, businesses, community centers, and
  citizen leaders we will provide the tools, teachings, and network of teachers
  to help more people learn how to install healthy behaviors that benefit
  ourselves, our families, our institutions, and our city.</p>






  <p>There are three specific components of this idea: </p>






  <p>1. Expand the existing InsightLA training programs for health care
  professionals, which currently provide mindfulness training to health care
  professionals at Children's Hospital of Los Angeles (CHLA) and other LA
  hospitals (UCLA Mattel Children's Hospital, St John's, CedarsSinai) and
  hospice programs, including a partnership with Skirball. Nurses, doctors,
  respiratory & other therapists, social workers, chaplains, and interpreters
  all receive mindfulness training. The program has proven to be popular and
  beneficial to the many health care professionals who have attended over the
  last six years. As eighty percent of child deaths in hospitals occur in ICUs,
  the mindfulness retreats were initially created to help PICU (Pediatric ICU)
  and NICU (Neonatal ICU) staffers deal with the grief of multiple losses. The
  program has since expanded to include practitioners from other units,
  including Hematologyoncology, Cardiothoracic, Surgery, Adolescent Medicine,
  and Bone Marrow Transplant. We are interested in expanding this program by
  launching a teacher training program that specializes on serving the health
  care system and the people who provide care. </p>






  <p>2. Repair and open a new 17 acre property that has recently been
  transferred to InsightLA and can serve as a center for mindfulness in the
  heart of the city. The property is a unique asset offering access to nature,
  canyon views, native plants, and hiking trails. An estimated $75,000 are
  needed this year for basic repairs to make the space usable. Once those
  repairs are made, we intend to hold a retreat for professional caregivers from
  area hospitals and hospices, and with this grant we would also package the
  case study to create manuals and show how this model can be scaled to other
  health institutions in LA. We can also utilize the space to create similar
  programs targeted to specific professional fields and workplaces throughout
  the city, as well as community colleges and LAUSD, offering leadership
  trainings to help current and future leaders develop mindfulness tools to help
  solve LA's most pressing challenges.</p>






  <p>3. Grow the network of teachers and programs that exists across LA in
  health care institutions, schools, and community centers through a Los Angeles
  Mindfulness Ambassador initiative. Currently, all InsightLA programs are open
  to the public, and participation is increasing. In addition to helping
  InsightLA launch a unique physical space, this project will help InsightLA
  take the mindfulness training programs online to increase reach and
  accessiblity of the trainings. Through this offline / online hybrid model, the
  project will effectively generate mindful leadership and action across our
  cultural, institutional, and community assets.</p>
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  We have trained more than 10,000 individual students in mindfulness. We have
  successfully maintained daily programs for which NO person is turned away for
  lack of funds. We have trained nurses, doctors, and social workers in
  mindfulness practices to deal with the dying and bereaved. We received grants
  totaling more than a halfmillion dollars from the Federal government to train
  clinicians at the Veterans Administration of Los Angeles to help them treat
  chronic sufferers of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and other conditions
  suffered by American veterans. We have expanded from a group of mindfulness

  in three locations, and two satellite locations in the San Fernando Valley and
  South Bay. We have brought in nationally renowned speakers and held large
  public forums to educate citizens about how mindfulness can improve their
  lives.
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  <p>Our intention is to partner wherever possible and appropriate to help scale
  the impact.






  Children's Hospital of Los Angeles is the initial pilot for a health care
  institution, and we will look to build on existing partnerships with UCLA
  Pediatric Pain Program, UCLArts and Healing, the SIMMS/MANN Center for
  Integrative Oncology, the Cancer Support CommunityBenjamin Center, and the LA
  Veteran's Administration.






  Green Yoga Association, or another relevant partner, will serve as an
  environmental steward for the 17 acre property. 






  Foundation for a Mindful Society (Mindful magazine & Mindful.org) will help
  document the pilot programs.






  InsightLA Ed, the educational arm of InsightLA, will administer education and
  training programs.
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  We will measure success by the ability to open the 17 acre facility this year,
  which currently is unfunded; by the number of health care professionals and
  community leaders who are trained in mindfulness; the number of new
  mindfulness teachers who go through InsightLA Programs; the number of
  communities with new practitioners and new teachers; and the number of people
  these teachers reach. Digital metrics will also be tracked, though additional
  resources will be needed to take that initiative to scale. The institute also
  has unprecedented opportunity to introduce mindfulness to LA based celebrities
  and athletes who can then engage the city and the world with the
  empiricallyproven, scientificallyvalidated, experientiallycontagious,
  costeffective solution of meditation and mindfulness. Therefore, the number of
  influencers going through the program will also be tracked.
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  <p>This project will create a world class resource for training leaders in the
  mindfulness movement in the heart of Los Angeles. With new access to a
  property of 17 acres of pristine nature, this project will enable InsightLA to
  create a functional space for training health care professionals, educators,
  and other community leaders to become mindfulness practitioners and teachers
  in Los Angeles. By 2050, the program will have trained thousands of
  Mindfulness Ambassadors for the city, including health care professionals,
  educators, and community leaders, and provided the catalytic support to make
  Los Angeles a 'mindful city' that addresses health and environmental
  indicators upstream. In addition, free training resources will be provided
  online, so anyone can improve their mindfulness and drive positive behavior
  change in their own lives. This project, while focused on health, attacks all
  of the indicators at their root, by giving each of us and all of us the tools
  and training to be more mindful and considerate about the way we engage with
  the social, political, and natural environment and contribute to our families,
  our communities, and our city.</p>
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  In 2050, LA is locally, nationally, and globally recognized as a leader in
  mindfulness. Thousands of active LA Mindfulness Ambassadors represent all of
  our neighborhoods and institutions. LA is seen as the city that pioneered
  healthy behaviour change through a mix of meditation and mindfulness training,
