title: You Can Compost That!
indicator: ' Environmental Quality'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  Composting extends the lifespan of existing landfills, protects water quality,
  prevents the release of potent greenhouse gases, and produces the best
  fertilizer plants have ever met.  Currently, City Earthworm is already gearing
  up to make composting accessible, easy, and desirable to the residents of
  Santa Monica by providing affordable weekly food waste pickup.  At the same
  time, we will complete the farmtotabletofarm circle by delivering the food
  waste to organic farms for composting and increase their food production.  






  With the funds provided by My LA2050, we would be able to expand our service
  to residents, restaurants, grocers, and other commercial customers throughout
  Los Angeles County so that everyone would be able to compost.  






  In addition, we will partner up with local schools to set up composting
  operations onsite.  We provide the setup, training, and a service plan to make
  sure the school’s composting operation is truly functional.  Tending the
  composting operation is simple and can be done with coordinated efforts by the
  school’s groundskeeper, cafeteria staff, and designated students.  This model
  is based on a system that is commonplace in the United Kingdom, in which local
  residents and business pay community gardens to compost their food waste.






  Composting is tremendously beneficial for the environment.  The following is a
  short list of reasons why it should become common practice:









  1) Greenhouse gas emissions from food rotting in landfills would be
  dramatically reduced through composting.  When food waste rots in a landfill,
  methane — a greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 21 times that of
  carbon dioxide — is released into the atmosphere.  Considering that Americans
  throw away nearly 40% of their food and that food is the single largest source
  of waste to landfills, composting food scraps instead of simply trashing them
  can dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  






  2) Existing landfill lifespans would be increased by composting.  According to
  the 2006 Annual Report by Waste Management, existing landfills at that time
  had an average life of 28 years left.  Land is one of Earth’s most precious
  natural resources.  Using land for building new landfills or expanding
  existing ones is undesirable when it could be used for more productive
  purposes such as food production, housing, or habitat conservation.  Even more
  importantly, landfilling carries significant negative environmental impacts
  and should be viewed as a last resort for waste disposal rather than the
  default path.






  3) Water quality is preserved through composting.  As mentioned above,
  composting diverts waste from landfills, which often contaminate groundwater
  supplies.  Further, the use of compost in agriculture in place of synthetic
  fertilizers should be heavily promoted.  Synthetic fertilizer causes algal
  blooms and aquatic dead zones when released into local bodies of water by rain
  or erosion.  Naturally derived compost does not cause this harmful effect and,
  in fact, strengthens soil structure to reverse erosion.  Compost has also been
  shown to significantly improve crop yield and strengthen plants’ resistance to
  disease.  Furthermore, composting food waste instead of sending it to insink
  garbage disposals lessens the load on municipal wastewater treatment plants.





    
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >+
  City Earthworm was started with a single mission: to make composting a
  household activity.  We designed and built the City Bin, a modern and compact
  indoor composter that will allow EVERYONE to compost, regardless of the size
  of their living space or yard.  The City Bin will soon be in production
  locally in Los Angeles County and will be manufactured using recycled
  plastic.  






  Both City Earthworm and the City Bin have been featured in blogs, newspapers,
  as well as in television news programs.  






  City Earthworm realizes that, while it would be great to allow more people to
  compost at home, there will also be some people who do not want to or are
  unable to do so.  The easiest way to truly popularize composting is to make it
  easy for people.  Therefore, we started offering a food service pickup program
  to apartment dwellers in Santa Monica.  We now hope to expand our service to
  the entire Los Angeles County.


Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  We will be sending food waste for composting to Burkart Organics Farm and
  Silver Lake Farms initially.  As we expand our service and the amount of waste
  picked up increases, we will partner with additional farms.  Delivery and
  dropoff will be performed locally within Los Angeles County to minimize
  emissions from vehicles.
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >+
  The project will have achieved its goal by diverting waste from landfills
  through composting.  Towards this, we will measure the weight of food waste
  picked up each week and sum up the total at the end of the year.  An average
  family of four generates about 500 pounds of food waste per year.  We hope to
  divert 25,000 pounds of food waste from landfills in the remaining half of
  2013 (equivalent to participation from 100 households).






  Additionally, we hope to develop a selfsustaining business from the injection
  of funds from My LA2050.  Therefore, we will also measure our success by
  examining the viability of the pickup business, the number of households
  served by our business, as well as the number of jobs created by the project. 
  We hope to be serving at least 100 Los Angeles households and have created two
  fulltime positions by the end of the year.






  Finally, we aim to set up five selfsustaining composting operations at local
  schools by the year’s end.


How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: "Our project would primarily benefit Los Angeles by reducing its environmental impacts.  However, it would also produce positive outcomes for several other indicators included in the My LA2050 Challenge.  Below is a list of just some of the benefits provided by our project:\n\n\n\n\n\n\tFood waste composting will significantly reduce Los Angeles’ contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions and climate change.  In addition, diverting food waste from landfills will help improve air quality in Los Angeles by reducing the vehicles miles traveled by waste haulers to landfills and lessening odors produced by the rotting of organic waste.\n\n\n\n\n\n\tProviding affordable weekly food scrap pickup will help Los Angeles meet the State’s waste diversion requirement to divert at least 50% of waste from landfills after 2004.  Existing landfill lifespans in the Los Angeles area would also be increased by composting.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\tCreate jobs for Angelenos as we will need individuals to perform weekly pickup services in the various neighborhoods of Los Angeles\n\n\n\n\n\n\tSetting up composting operations in our schools would allow them to reduce their waste management expenses, produce the fertilizer needed for their grounds, generate income by composting community food waste, and teach students important lessons in biology, ecology, agriculture, and sustainability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\tBoth residents and businesses of Los Angeles can potentially save money by reducing the amount of trash picked up by conventional haulers to be sent to landfills.  Additionally, they will gain satisfaction from helping their local schools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\tIncrease environmental awareness within Los Angeles in general, particularly with regards to food wastefulness and global climate change\n\n\n\n\n\n\tOrganic farms will benefit from the incoming stream of compostable food waste provided by our service.  The compost will be used to enhance or increase crop yield, completing the farmtotabletofarm circle."
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  We at City Earthworm aim to make it easier for the residents and businesses of
  Los Angeles to lower their environmental impact.  We hope that Los Angeles
  will continue (but at an accelerated pace) on the path to becoming an
  environmentallyoriented, sustainable city.  In the year 2050, success with
  regards to environmental quality means that Los Angeles would have achieved
  and surpassed the 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels,
  as mandated by AB 32.  We would be a zerowaste city, instead composting,
  recycling, or upcycling all of our waste.  Composting would be mandatory for
  all organic waste.  All Los Angeles farms would be organic, and most — if not
  all  produce and meats sold in grocery stores would be organically produced. 
  Compost would be available free of charge to everyone for use in their own
  yards.  Backyard vegetable gardens would be commonplace, and everyone would
  have easy access to fresh produce.

    Similarly, the City of Los Angeles provides restaurant food waste recycling

    Agriculture (CSA) groups also collect food waste from their subscribers. 
    However, we do not view either municipalities or CSAs as competition.  We
    feel that our service can complement existing or future food waste pick-up

The City Bin will soon be in production locally in Los Angeles County and will be manufactured using recycled plastic.  \r\n\r\nBoth City Earthworm and the City Bin have been featured in blogs, newspapers, as well as in television news programs.  \r\n\r\nCity Earthworm realizes that, while it would be great to allow more people to compost at home, there will also be some people who do not want to or are unable to do so.  The easiest way to truly popularize composting is to make it easy for people.  Therefore, we started offering a food service pick-up program to apartment dwellers in Santa Monica.  We now hope to expand our service to the entire Los Angeles County.\r\n"
