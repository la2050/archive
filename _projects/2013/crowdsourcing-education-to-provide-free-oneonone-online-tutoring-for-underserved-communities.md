  topic </li>



  <li>Track time needed for student to complete each problem </li>

  </ul>












  <p><b>PROJECT DETAILS</b></p>






  <i>Introduction to Learn To Be</i>






  <p>In an interview given to CNN in late 2011, Bill Gates stated that "oneonone
  teaching is kind of that ideal that you would like to achieve where you see
  where they're [students are] confused, you see where they're [students are]
  bored and you're tuning what you say according to that." </p>






  <p>Since 2009, that ideal is exactly what the Learn To Be Foundation (LTB) has
  been offering to K12 students in Los Angeles and around the nation.  Through
  the use of a realtime virtual whiteboard with voice and webcam conferencing
  abilities, Learn To Be provides 100% free, online, oneonone academic support
  to underserved students struggling in math, science, and language arts. In
  this time, we have recruited over 600 volunteer tutors and have enabled them
  to teach over 20,000 sessions for over 11,000 hours of instruction to our
  students.  </p>






  <p>Imagine a tutor from Iowa, sitting at a cafe on a portable device, helping
  a homeless student at a Los Angeles shelter learn his multiplication facts
  through the LTB online platform. Or a college student in her dorm in Austin
  helping a student at an elementary school in LA learn how to read.  This is
  what Learn To Be tutors have been doing since 2009.  Our tutors are likeminded
  individuals who are part of a crowdsourcing solution to today’s education
  problems.  Students no longer have one teacher but an army of them scattered
  across the nation, ready at a moments notice to help out in whatever way
  possible.  </p>






  <p>But in an attempt to create an even more meaningful interaction between
  students and tutors we need to know what exactly students are struggling with,
  and as such we have proposed the following project: </p>






  <p><i>An Adaptive and Persistent Problem Module (APPM)</i><br />






  Adaptive systems are those in which the questions presented to students adapt
  based on whether the previous question was answered correctly or not.  So as
  students answer questions correctly, subsequent questions become increasingly
  difficult. </p>






  <p>And by persistent, we mean that all problems logged by a student will be
  forever stored for recall.  This includes information regarding the
  correctness of the answer, all incorrect answers inputted before the correct
  answer was submitted, and how long it took the student to answer the problem
  correctly. </p>






  <p>By themselves, adaptive and persistent programs already exist. However,
  none have been integrated so extensively into the constructs of a live,
  oneonone tutoring session. We want to implement our own APPM and integrate it
  into our online classroom.  </p>






  <p>Not only does this practice help students to master academic material, but
  it also allows all tutors to have access to the same data for that student. 
  So, if for example, a tutor was working with a student on fractions during an
  online tutoring session, he could assign the student problems using the APPM
  and then subsequent tutors would know exactly how many problems were solved by
  that student in the previous session, how many were answered correctly, and
  how long it took them to answer these questions. This would instantly improve
  the quality of the session because the tutor need not rely on only the student
  to diagnose problem areas. </p>






  <p>Ultimately, the goal is to close achievement gaps and this can be done when
  fundamental deficiencies in core subjects are addressed.  And once we address
  these deficiencies, attitudes towards learning improve and students are able
  to thrive in school, leading to higher scores and ultimately to higher
  graduation rates.  </p>

  <p><b>STANDARDIZED EXAM IMPROVEMENTS</b><br />






  Learn To Be is currently working with its flagship program at Dorris Place
  Elementary, located in East Los Angeles. LTB tutors work with struggling 6th
  graders 3 times a week in core math concepts.  Prior to beginning, students
  had taken a statemandated periodic assessment exam and after 8 weeks of
  tutoring, they were given another periodic assessment.  In that time, no other
  additional academic service was provided other than Learn To Be and as a
  result, students saw an average increase of 22% on their exams. With the
  implementation of the APPM, we hope that further increases will be attained as
  tutors are able to better tailor their sessions to the direct needs of the
  students. </p>






  <p><b>INTERNAL EVALUATION OF STUDENT DATA</b><br />






  After completion of the APPM, Learn To Be will have a core set of problems
  solved for various students across multiple academic subjects.  This data can
  be analyzed both in the short term and the long term. </p>






  <p>Immediate assessment postsession as tutors can recall stored data to
  confirm whether a student understood concepts or not based on number of
  questions answered correctly and time needed to complete each question. Learn
  To Be administrators can also evaluate how effective the tutor was in
  delivering content based on the problems solved by the student before, during
  and immediately after the session. </p>






  <p>Long term internal assessments conducted by Learn to Be will measure both
  the accuracy AND speed with which students answer questions in different
  subject area over a period of time as data of all problems solved is stored on
  Learn To Be servers. For example, over a 6 month period, Learn To Be
  administrators can view progress on a students arithmetic knowledge or algebra
  knowledge. </p>






  <p>With increased scores comes increased confidence and because Learn To Be
  focuses on fundamental concepts, students will be put on a more firm footing
  in school, enabling them to thrive as they grow older and coursework becomes
  more challenging. Attitudes towards learning will improve and ultimately, the
  hope is that graduation rates will as well. </p>
