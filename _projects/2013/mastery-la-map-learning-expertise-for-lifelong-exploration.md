title: 'MASTERY LA: Map Learning & Expertise for Lifelong Exploration'
project_summary: "Ten years ago I was a schoolteacher for special education, focused on violent offenders age 12-21. \r\n\r\nIn one program I designed we taught teens to read by using their own music, asking them to rap freestyle into the computer and then sending them home with a CD, their lyrics and the assignment to produce a 2 song album in 9 weeks. Not only did all students complete the assignment, a large portion of the students improved their reading and writing tremendously, many jumping multiple grade levels in a matter of weeks while showing great motivation for the process of creative music production. Two students won demos in local studios for recording contracts and overall engagement and retention of this at-risk population was the highest we witnessed in years of teaching.\r\n\r\nI saw the sadness, desperation, the expressions of fear that come from feeling lost - and I also saw that the creative arts education can rapidly change this situation and the motivation of the individual learner.\r\n\r\nOur team at EDDEFY met at Singularity University's graduate program in 2012 at NASA/Ames where we galvanized around a mission to provide educational access to anyone, anywhere, anytime. We saw mobility, ubiquity of resources, tracking and personalization to be essential along with sharing the most engaging learning opportunities available to motivate individuals to be their best and achieve their goals.  \r\n\r\nMany of us could not SEE THE PATH TO MASTERY and so we began creating the EDDEFY toolkit and this MASTERY campaign for Los Angeles. We aim to map and visualize learning for the city of LA.\r\n\r\nSo far we have shared the EDDEFY tools in development at startup/technology pitch sessions and at the educational GetIdeas Conference. This week we shared our work at DigitalLA and we will be demoing our product at technology events in LA this year.\r\n\r\nPreviously my work included transmedia production challenges for audiences of all ages:\r\n* Creating arts events and collaborations including\r\n* Festivals, big events and social connectedness games\r\n* Educational reform through creative pedagogy and curricula\r\n* Cause campaigns for major nonprofits around the world, engaging storytellers to share their work effectively and build momentum for thousands of causes\r\n\r\nMy team has collectively over 2 decades of experience in formal and informal learning settings along with 3 decades of nonprofit management experience and a vast pool of technology tools and expertise to bring to this process. My cofounders include two PhDs in data sciences for analysis and mapping of the insights we find through this campaign and we won awards in our graduate program for our ability to navigate the subtle challenges of the educational field using the EDDEFY toolkit.\r\n\r\nI have served in government, lobbied for computers in all schools when I was 7 years old and continue my lifelong work empowering others to be their best through any media available.\r\n\r\nOur network collectively reaches over 100,000 experts in Los Angeles.\r\n"

  success: "We aim to achieve measurable positive outcomes by tracking the progress of youth who opt-in for additional support through their learning, mentorship and transition to adulthood.\r\n\r\nThe current situation is grim, but the results will be measurable and we have two PhD researchers on our team who will lead a comprehensive qualitative study of usability and learning progress that includes community support for this at-risk population.\r\n\r\nChildren who emancipate from the child welfare system are unlikely to find safe, affordable housing.\r\n\r\nWithin 2-4 years of emancipation, 25% of emancipated youth have been homeless for at least one night. In California, 65% of youth leaving care do so without a place to live.\r\n\r\nNearly 40% of transitioning youth will be homeless within eighteen months of discharge. In Los Angeles and Alameda counties, 50% of emancipated youth will be homeless within six months.\r\n\r\nWithout housing, youth are less likely to complete their education, find employment, and gain access to health care, all of which jeopardize their ability to make a successful transition to independence.\r\n\r\nStudies found that between 44 - 77 % of emancipating youth have completed high school as compared to 93% of non-foster care youth.\r\nResearch shows that only 1% to 5% of foster youth ever graduate from college (we can improve this by a long shot!).\r\n\r\nMost foster youth want to go to college, but the facts of life in foster care – often including fractured family relationships, living in group homes, and moving and changing schools frequently – work to prevent many students from fulfilling their educational potential (McMillin, et al, 2003). Foster youth are less likely than the general population to complete high school, and those who do graduate are less likely to go to college (Wolanin, 2005). Among those who do go\r\nto college, foster youth are less likely than other students to earn a credential (Davis, 2006).\r\n\r\nIn 2008-09, 3,136 foster youth in California received Chafee Grants totaling $12 million, but those youth represent only 47 percent of the eligible applicants that year. Many of the eligible applicants were offered grants late in the academic year, at which point they did not meet the enrollment criteria to receive a grant. Over one thousand of them (18 percent) were never offered one due to insufficient program funding.\r\n\r\nFrom a foster youth in CA: “Even twice a year is a lot to move to a whole different school because different schools have different curriculum... What really sucks is that if you don’t have that good support group in high school and if you were moving around all these other times, how are you supposed to get the knowledge to even write well, to read well, to do those kinds of things? ... People have to realize that by moving people constantly, by putting them into volatile situations all the time, you’re reducing the time for the foster youth to actually learn anything in school.”"

  brief: "MASTERY Campaign\r\n\r\nLos Angeles is ready to connect the vast talent it has waiting at home - masters in many fields who have time on their hands and interest in making LA a better place to live - with the students who are looking for inspiration and creative action outside of the classroom.\r\n\r\nEducation received the lowest rating in the LA2050 assessment because our schools are failing most of the kids in our system. We do not provide personalized learning options designed to meet the students at their level and interests, nor do we tailor most content for the rich media world that we are creating here in our tech industry.\r\n\r\nIn LAUSD today it is difficult for a student to watch a video or play a game, two essential activities that improve learning interactivity and engagement. We will start by working with the community to provide mobile, alternative access to learning resources outside of the classroom for the thousands currently disengaged from the formal learning system. We will be targeting foster youth, dropouts and those disenfranchised by traditional learning and we will partner with great organizations throughout the city that work hands-on with youth (DIY Girls, Machine Project, Big Art Labs, LA Makerspace are a few identified through the LA2050 events).\r\n\r\nWe aim to create a path for personalized, lifelong learning for all people, connecting the lost and displaced with educational resources across all types of media, people, places and courses of study.\r\n\r\nMISSION: Be the bridge for lifelong education of foster youth and all people, connecting people ready to learn skills with the masters in our community. Map expertise and comprehend our hidden talent!\r\n\r\nWe can create the virtual support group for these youth to help each other finish their education and move forward to pursue their potential.\r\n\r\nSOLUTION:\r\nTargeting youth age 16-21 for engagement with masters across fields\r\nHelp with sharing their skills as they develop + connecting to mentors\r\nChart a path to becoming the expert in a new skill and apply for the grants available to achieve goals\r\n\r\nWe will be asking the masters of Los Angeles to share a quick learning path = how they got to be the master in their field and how they choose to share that path with the next generation of creative leaders. We are creating a dynamic interface and network mapping tool for this learning so that we can see how LA connects the dots, shares resources, where the hidden gems are and how to begin empowering LA's youth to work with our masters in a clear and coordinated way.\r\n\r\nThis is more than a mentorship program. MASTERY will include:\r\n* Livestreaming hangout series to connect youth around the city\r\n* Opportunities to win tablets and learning resource access\r\n* Bridge support for grants, funding opportunities and open doors to continuing education for those who may be losing hope\r\n* A lifeline and network of care for our disenfranchised youth and their friends throughout the city\r\n* Vision for building the future of Los Angeles together by rapidly building skills across fields and sectors, preparing LA for 21st century careers now emerging\r\n\r\nINDICATOR OBJECTIVES FOR LA2050:\r\n* Help at least 1000 kids access financial aid support to follow their path\r\n* Map at least 1000 experts across Los Angeles skills, talents, mastery abilities\r\n* Meet local design challenges through collaboration and invention in community\r\n\r\nSTRATEGY:\r\nLivestreaming broadcast series in Hangouts + YouTube using the EDDEFY tools\r\nHost live, interactive events produced in the Vortex Immersion Dome at LA Center Studios (home to Mad Men and a ton of famous film/television projects) that match experts and students and bridge gaps for grants, support and continuing education\r\nUse social media to engage with youth and invite participation to find local resources that may be missing on our maps\r\n\r\nMAP ALL LEARNING:\r\nMakerspaces, museums, masters, courses, schools and universities, training programs, places that inspire us and resources from games to books and apps that teach us quickly how to work together and achieve our personal goals.\r\n\r\nIn practice, our events will work a bit like an online game show via Google Hangouts and YouTube, providing access for anyone who can get to YouTube via library or community center. Emancipated youth and those who are transitioning to adulthood will be invited to participate online and these events will build the audience for the live event to be hosted near the end of 2013.\r\n\r\nMasters will be mapped over the summer and fall of 2013 in partnership with many major events, festivals and community gatherings where people can take a few minutes to share their expertise and put themselves on the map to begin earning a reputation for their mastery.\r\n"

  description3: "We connect the entire open learning web and aim to map all learning, starting with Los Angeles. In the process we will be working with university partners in LA and beyond to share insightful findings from our data scientists. There are currently very few AI and data science leaders in LA and we have created a new company based in LA to focus on this field.\r\n\r\nRight now we are building a toolkit for learning that will include tools created by many of our \"competitors\", creating cooperation and improving discovery and use for dozens of related companies and institutions. We are building the best tool box for learning on the planet and we welcome collaborators from related fields.\r\n\r\nCollaboration is our culture and we enjoy working with a wide variety of partners in education, finance, creative arts, social connectedness, cultural and civic engagement along with supporting the social structures needed for a healthy society.\r\n\r\nWe know a number of the other LA2050 applicants and we look forward to working with many of them through coordinated events, campaign messages, social media, educational programs and opportunities for collective growth. Some of the great organizations we have met in LA that we'd like to work with in the future include CicLAVia, Machine Project, MindshareLA, Create:Fixate, Lightning in a Bottle Festival, Autumn Lights Festival, GLOW, State of the Arts/C3, Book Fair, Media companies and conferences for related fields. We partner with a wide variety of event and production teams and we are happy to co-sponsor events whenever we can match masters and students, creating live and interactive ways to map learning and build momentum at existing gatherings.\r\n\r\nWe will map all of these resources and assist with discovery and value creation across the entire landscape of learning. Our team is committed to creating value for all types of work and our tools will connect these resources to make it easy to find the local gems that may not be discovered otherwise.\r\n\r\nThese tools will be available via mobile app by 2014 and we will also be coordinating with other mobile app developers to collaborate and provide modular access to a wide variety of useful tools for learning.\r\n\r\nA full competitive analysis is available in our slidedeck including a field gap analysis of the companies working in educational technology: http://portal.sliderocket.com/TechSoup/eddefyinc\r\n\r\nThere are currently no companies locally or in the US taking on this challenge in this way and we are aligning with the universities that are looking at this problem in a meaningful way to solve the visualization problems we currently face in our learning paths.\r\n\r\nOver time we will integrate these tools with existing learning management systems and educational companies that provide continuing education resources for our agencies and institutions, offering a path to credentials, badges and demonstrations of skills and abilities to improve employability and workforce competencies."
  vision: "In 2050...\r\nEveryone has access to quality educational resources to follow their interests and meet their personal goals.\r\n\r\nEveryone can read and write (over 99% literacy).\r\n\r\nOver 3 million LAUSD students using over 8,000 buildings and facilities with availability for every child to go to school in a stable community connected to mobile, ubiquitous resources.\r\n\r\nHomeschool and flexible open schools are common along with smaller private groups with integrated tools to track progress between formal and informal learning opportunities.\r\n\r\n9 million more will graduate by 2050 from the LAUSD\r\nSchool districts collaborate around the globe.\r\n\r\nLos Angeles is the 3rd largest city in the Americas with great wealth and abundance - no visible displacement and little visible poverty in community.\r\n\r\nEveryone (99+%) can translate to English and speaks/writes in their native language fluently.\r\n\r\nEveryone (99+%) can manage finances and basic math abilities.\r\n\r\nScores are no longer measured in points but LA has one of the stronger educational indicators in the Americas.\r\n\r\nGraduation performance 90%+ verified through personal communication device as all basic paths are pursued.\r\n\r\nEvery student is given personal choices to explore that suit their interests and weave in basic skills appropriate for advanced university studies and mastery.\r\n\r\nApplications in Spanish and any language make barriers to completion easier to overcome for at least 60% of the emigrant populations, including video that's live and subtitled to many languages for instant translation.\r\n\r\nAfterschool opportunities from incubators to collaboration zones are open every afternoon for thousands of nomadic youth, including advanced study in technology and physical sports/abilities.\r\n\r\nSensors and ubiquitous computing allow for learning anywhere, anytime to be tracked and demonstrated for public success and growth.\r\n\r\nWearable technology is common and used by students to capture daily moments, remix culture and create new options while engaged in tasks throughout the city.\r\n\r\nImmersion learning happens in domes, in classrooms, on the walls and floors and on any smart surface surrounding us.\r\n\r\nAccess is available at any time to anyone.\r\n\r\nThe wide variety of learning preferences and abilities are respected in our communities and we value the unique gifts of those currently sequestered in special educational programs.\r\n\r\nLos Angeles leads the world in educational access for all, ensuring that everyone can pursue their potential and demonstrate success across fields, tracking the everyday actions that lead to learning outside of the classroom.\r\n\r\nEveryone deserves a quality education and we can provide an alternative to the traditional classroom environment that's experiential, personalized to the individual learning needs and localized to match the interests of the individual with the resources in their community.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  MASTERY Campaign






  Los Angeles is ready to connect the vast talent it has waiting at home 
  masters in many fields who have time on their hands and interest in making LA
  a better place to live  with the students who are looking for inspiration and
  creative action outside of the classroom.






  Education received the lowest rating in the LA2050 assessment because our
  schools are failing most of the kids in our system. We do not provide
  personalized learning options designed to meet the students at their level and
  interests, nor do we tailor most content for the rich media world that we are
  creating here in our tech industry.






  In LAUSD today it is difficult for a student to watch a video or play a game,
  two essential activities that improve learning interactivity and engagement.
  We will start by working with the community to provide mobile, alternative
  access to learning resources outside of the classroom for the thousands
  currently disengaged from the formal learning system. We will be targeting
  foster youth, dropouts and those disenfranchised by traditional learning and
  we will partner with great organizations throughout the city that work handson
  with youth (DIY Girls, Machine Project, Big Art Labs, LA Makerspace are a few
  identified through the LA2050 events).






  We aim to create a path for personalized, lifelong learning for all people,
  connecting the lost and displaced with educational resources across all types
  of media, people, places and courses of study.






  MISSION: Be the bridge for lifelong education of foster youth and all people,
  connecting people ready to learn skills with the masters in our community. Map
  expertise and comprehend our hidden talent!






  We can create the virtual support group for these youth to help each other
  finish their education and move forward to pursue their potential.






  SOLUTION:



  Targeting youth age 1621 for engagement with masters across fields



  Help with sharing their skills as they develop + connecting to mentors



  Chart a path to becoming the expert in a new skill and apply for the grants
  available to achieve goals






  We will be asking the masters of Los Angeles to share a quick learning path =
  how they got to be the master in their field and how they choose to share that
  path with the next generation of creative leaders. We are creating a dynamic
  interface and network mapping tool for this learning so that we can see how LA
  connects the dots, shares resources, where the hidden gems are and how to
  begin empowering LA's youth to work with our masters in a clear and
  coordinated way.






  This is more than a mentorship program. MASTERY will include:



  * Livestreaming hangout series to connect youth around the city



  * Opportunities to win tablets and learning resource access



  * Bridge support for grants, funding opportunities and open doors to
  continuing education for those who may be losing hope



  * A lifeline and network of care for our disenfranchised youth and their
  friends throughout the city



  * Vision for building the future of Los Angeles together by rapidly building
  skills across fields and sectors, preparing LA for 21st century careers now
  emerging






  INDICATOR OBJECTIVES FOR LA2050:



  * Help at least 1000 kids access financial aid support to follow their path



  * Map at least 1000 experts across Los Angeles skills, talents, mastery
  abilities



  * Meet local design challenges through collaboration and invention in
  community






  STRATEGY:



  Livestreaming broadcast series in Hangouts + YouTube using the EDDEFY tools



  Host live, interactive events produced in the Vortex Immersion Dome at LA
  Center Studios (home to Mad Men and a ton of famous film/television projects)
  that match experts and students and bridge gaps for grants, support and
  continuing education



  Use social media to engage with youth and invite participation to find local
  resources that may be missing on our maps






  MAP ALL LEARNING:



  Makerspaces, museums, masters, courses, schools and universities, training
  programs, places that inspire us and resources from games to books and apps
  that teach us quickly how to work together and achieve our personal goals.






  In practice, our events will work a bit like an online game show via Google
  Hangouts and YouTube, providing access for anyone who can get to YouTube via
  library or community center. Emancipated youth and those who are transitioning
  to adulthood will be invited to participate online and these events will build
  the audience for the live event to be hosted near the end of 2013.






  Masters will be mapped over the summer and fall of 2013 in partnership with
  many major events, festivals and community gatherings where people can take a
  few minutes to share their expertise and put themselves on the map to begin
  earning a reputation for their mastery.


What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >+
  Ten years ago I was a schoolteacher for special education, focused on violent
  offenders age 1221. 






  In one program I designed we taught teens to read by using their own music,
  asking them to rap freestyle into the computer and then sending them home with
  a CD, their lyrics and the assignment to produce a 2 song album in 9 weeks.
  Not only did all students complete the assignment, a large portion of the
  students improved their reading and writing tremendously, many jumping
  multiple grade levels in a matter of weeks while showing great motivation for
  the process of creative music production. Two students won demos in local
  studios for recording contracts and overall engagement and retention of this
  atrisk population was the highest we witnessed in years of teaching.






  I saw the sadness, desperation, the expressions of fear that come from feeling
  lost  and I also saw that the creative arts education can rapidly change this
  situation and the motivation of the individual learner.






  Our team at EDDEFY met at Singularity University's graduate program in 2012 at
  NASA/Ames where we galvanized around a mission to provide educational access
  to anyone, anywhere, anytime. We saw mobility, ubiquity of resources, tracking
  and personalization to be essential along with sharing the most engaging
  learning opportunities available to motivate individuals to be their best and
  achieve their goals.  






  Many of us could not SEE THE PATH TO MASTERY and so we began creating the
  EDDEFY toolkit and this MASTERY campaign for Los Angeles. We aim to map and
  visualize learning for the city of LA.






  So far we have shared the EDDEFY tools in development at startup/technology
  pitch sessions and at the educational GetIdeas Conference. This week we shared
  our work at DigitalLA and we will be demoing our product at technology events
  in LA this year.






  Previously my work included transmedia production challenges for audiences of
  all ages:



  * Creating arts events and collaborations including



  * Festivals, big events and social connectedness games



  * Educational reform through creative pedagogy and curricula



  * Cause campaigns for major nonprofits around the world, engaging storytellers
  to share their work effectively and build momentum for thousands of causes






  My team has collectively over 2 decades of experience in formal and informal
  learning settings along with 3 decades of nonprofit management experience and
  a vast pool of technology tools and expertise to bring to this process. My
  cofounders include two PhDs in data sciences for analysis and mapping of the
  insights we find through this campaign and we won awards in our graduate
  program for our ability to navigate the subtle challenges of the educational
  field using the EDDEFY toolkit.






  I have served in government, lobbied for computers in all schools when I was 7
  years old and continue my lifelong work empowering others to be their best
  through any media available.

Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  We aim to achieve measurable positive outcomes by tracking the progress of
  youth who optin for additional support through their learning, mentorship and
  transition to adulthood.






  The current situation is grim, but the results will be measurable and we have
  two PhD researchers on our team who will lead a comprehensive qualitative
  study of usability and learning progress that includes community support for
  this atrisk population.






  Children who emancipate from the child welfare system are unlikely to find
  safe, affordable housing.






  Within 24 years of emancipation, 25% of emancipated youth have been homeless
  for at least one night. In California, 65% of youth leaving care do so without
  a place to live.






  Nearly 40% of transitioning youth will be homeless within eighteen months of
  discharge. In Los Angeles and Alameda counties, 50% of emancipated youth will
  be homeless within six months.






  Without housing, youth are less likely to complete their education, find
  employment, and gain access to health care, all of which jeopardize their
  ability to make a successful transition to independence.






  Studies found that between 44  77 % of emancipating youth have completed high
  school as compared to 93% of nonfoster care youth.



  Research shows that only 1% to 5% of foster youth ever graduate from college
  (we can improve this by a long shot!).






  Most foster youth want to go to college, but the facts of life in foster care
  — often including fractured family relationships, living in group homes, and
  moving and changing schools frequently — work to prevent many students from
  fulfilling their educational potential (McMillin, et al, 2003). Foster youth
  are less likely than the general population to complete high school, and those
  who do graduate are less likely to go to college (Wolanin, 2005). Among those
  who do go



  to college, foster youth are less likely than other students to earn a
  credential (Davis, 2006).






  In 200809, 3,136 foster youth in California received Chafee Grants totaling
  $12 million, but those youth represent only 47 percent of the eligible
  applicants that year. Many of the eligible applicants were offered grants late
  in the academic year, at which point they did not meet the enrollment criteria
  to receive a grant. Over one thousand of them (18 percent) were never offered
  one due to insufficient program funding.






  From a foster youth in CA: “Even twice a year is a lot to move to a whole
  different school because different schools have different curriculum... What
  really sucks is that if you don’t have that good support group in high school
  and if you were moving around all these other times, how are you supposed to
  get the knowledge to even write well, to read well, to do those kinds of
  things? ... People have to realize that by moving people constantly, by
  putting them into volatile situations all the time, you’re reducing the time
  for the foster youth to actually learn anything in school.”
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  1. Map over 1000 masters of Los Angeles to show pockets of expertise and human
  resources ready to be connected. 



  2. Help youth discover opportunities to continue their education inside and
  outside traditional learning environments in fun, interactive ways.



  3. Provide a bridge to funding, grants, technology, training and support for
  transitional youth who may be falling through the cracks through open events
  with experts on hand to help.



  4. Match the masters of LA and the students who are ready to learn new skills
  for new apprenticeships and guilds.



  5. Offer events that contribute to cultural/arts/connectedness within our
  communities through alignments with partners throughout the Los Angeles
  creative communities and other LA2050 grantees.



  6. Provide momentum for independent learning with tools to track progress and
  demonstrate skillbuilding for employment.



  7. Connect thousands of learning resources already engaging in improving LA
  and help people find the best community resources for their personal growth.



  8. Understand how we learn better over time and help each individual find an
  individual learning path that suits their preferences and abilities.



  9. Improve dropout rates by providing alternatives that are engaging, local
  and appropriate for the individual learning profile.



  10. Encourage mastery learning and 21st century skills by showing the high
  quality talent already working within Los Angeles and how we can all work
  together to make a more amazing and creative city together.



  11. Work together to envision the city we want to live in at hackathon events
  and city festivals.



  12.  Empower students to finish their GED by making it into an interactive
  game played in Google Hangouts to bring together transitional youth with
  opportunities to learn and complete goals.



  13.  Provide easier access to grants and local funding opportunities for
  foster youth and other young adults who may be prone to homelessness without
  support.



  14. Improve literacy and soft skills by utilizing tablets and mobile devices
  to creatively engage difficult students in new ways, using music, handson
  experiences and local masters to bridge the gaps in learning.



  15. Create ripple momentum for a @MasteryLA campaign to encourage everyone to
  become a master in their chosen field and follow their passion through social
  media and events.



  16. Encourage youth to share their learning process publically through events,
  social media, in learning centers and on the EDDEFY platform.



  17. Map the connections between masters and students and how these
  relationships evolve over time to understand how to improve local education
  and mentorship services.



  18. Identify the areas of the city where services need to be focused for
  future success between now and 2050.



  19. Partner with great local resources to grow great relationships between
  youth and local masters: BuiltinLA, Mentor organizations and Foster Youth
  organizations: Kids Alliance, ILP, First Place for Youth

    answer: "MASTERY Campaign\r\n\r\nLos Angeles is ready to connect the vast talent it has waiting at home - masters in many fields who have time on their hands and interest in making LA a better place to live - with the students who are looking for inspiration and creative action outside of the classroom.\r\n\r\nEducation received the lowest rating in the LA2050 assessment because our schools are failing most of the kids in our system. We do not provide personalized learning options designed to meet the students at their level and interests, nor do we tailor most content for the rich media world that we are creating here in our tech industry.\r\n\r\nIn LAUSD today it is difficult for a student to watch a video or play a game, two essential activities that improve learning interactivity and engagement. We will start by working with the community to provide mobile, alternative access to learning resources outside of the classroom for the thousands currently disengaged from the formal learning system. We will be targeting foster youth, dropouts and those disenfranchised by traditional learning and we will partner with great organizations throughout the city that work hands-on with youth (DIY Girls, Machine Project, Big Art Labs, LA Makerspace are a few identified through the LA2050 events).\r\n\r\nWe aim to create a path for personalized, lifelong learning for all people, connecting the lost and displaced with educational resources across all types of media, people, places and courses of study.\r\n\r\nMISSION: Be the bridge for lifelong education of foster youth and all people, connecting people ready to learn skills with the masters in our community. Map expertise and comprehend our hidden talent!\r\n\r\nWe can create the virtual support group for these youth to help each other finish their education and move forward to pursue their potential.\r\n\r\nSOLUTION:\r\nTargeting youth age 16-21 for engagement with masters across fields\r\nHelp with sharing their skills as they develop + connecting to mentors\r\nChart a path to becoming the expert in a new skill and apply for the grants available to achieve goals\r\n\r\nWe will be asking the masters of Los Angeles to share a quick learning path = how they got to be the master in their field and how they choose to share that path with the next generation of creative leaders. We are creating a dynamic interface and network mapping tool for this learning so that we can see how LA connects the dots, shares resources, where the hidden gems are and how to begin empowering LA's youth to work with our masters in a clear and coordinated way.\r\n\r\nThis is more than a mentorship program. MASTERY will include:\r\n* Livestreaming hangout series to connect youth around the city\r\n* Opportunities to win tablets and learning resource access\r\n* Bridge support for grants, funding opportunities and open doors to continuing education for those who may be losing hope\r\n* A lifeline and network of care for our disenfranchised youth and their friends throughout the city\r\n* Vision for building the future of Los Angeles together by rapidly building skills across fields and sectors, preparing LA for 21st century careers now emerging\r\n\r\nINDICATOR OBJECTIVES FOR LA2050:\r\n* Help at least 1000 kids access financial aid support to follow their path\r\n* Map at least 1000 experts across Los Angeles skills, talents, mastery abilities\r\n* Meet local design challenges through collaboration and invention in community\r\n\r\nSTRATEGY:\r\nLivestreaming broadcast series in Hangouts + YouTube using the EDDEFY tools\r\nHost live, interactive events produced in the Vortex Immersion Dome at LA Center Studios (home to Mad Men and a ton of famous film/television projects) that match experts and students and bridge gaps for grants, support and continuing education\r\nUse social media to engage with youth and invite participation to find local resources that may be missing on our maps\r\n\r\nMAP ALL LEARNING:\r\nMakerspaces, museums, masters, courses, schools and universities, training programs, places that inspire us and resources from games to books and apps that teach us quickly how to work together and achieve our personal goals.\r\n\r\nIn practice, our events will work a bit like an online game show via Google Hangouts and YouTube, providing access for anyone who can get to YouTube via library or community center. Emancipated youth and those who are transitioning to adulthood will be invited to participate online and these events will build the audience for the live event to be hosted near the end of 2013.\r\n\r\nMasters will be mapped over the summer and fall of 2013 in partnership with many major events, festivals and community gatherings where people can take a few minutes to share their expertise and put themselves on the map to begin earning a reputation for their mastery.\r\n"

    answer: "Ten years ago I was a schoolteacher for special education, focused on violent offenders age 12-21. \r\n\r\nIn one program I designed we taught teens to read by using their own music, asking them to rap freestyle into the computer and then sending them home with a CD, their lyrics and the assignment to produce a 2 song album in 9 weeks. Not only did all students complete the assignment, a large portion of the students improved their reading and writing tremendously, many jumping multiple grade levels in a matter of weeks while showing great motivation for the process of creative music production. Two students won demos in local studios for recording contracts and overall engagement and retention of this at-risk population was the highest we witnessed in years of teaching.\r\n\r\nI saw the sadness, desperation, the expressions of fear that come from feeling lost - and I also saw that the creative arts education can rapidly change this situation and the motivation of the individual learner.\r\n\r\nOur team at EDDEFY met at Singularity University's graduate program in 2012 at NASA/Ames where we galvanized around a mission to provide educational access to anyone, anywhere, anytime. We saw mobility, ubiquity of resources, tracking and personalization to be essential along with sharing the most engaging learning opportunities available to motivate individuals to be their best and achieve their goals.  \r\n\r\nMany of us could not SEE THE PATH TO MASTERY and so we began creating the EDDEFY toolkit and this MASTERY campaign for Los Angeles. We aim to map and visualize learning for the city of LA.\r\n\r\nSo far we have shared the EDDEFY tools in development at startup/technology pitch sessions and at the educational GetIdeas Conference. This week we shared our work at DigitalLA and we will be demoing our product at technology events in LA this year.\r\n\r\nPreviously my work included transmedia production challenges for audiences of all ages:\r\n* Creating arts events and collaborations including\r\n* Festivals, big events and social connectedness games\r\n* Educational reform through creative pedagogy and curricula\r\n* Cause campaigns for major nonprofits around the world, engaging storytellers to share their work effectively and build momentum for thousands of causes\r\n\r\nMy team has collectively over 2 decades of experience in formal and informal learning settings along with 3 decades of nonprofit management experience and a vast pool of technology tools and expertise to bring to this process. My cofounders include two PhDs in data sciences for analysis and mapping of the insights we find through this campaign and we won awards in our graduate program for our ability to navigate the subtle challenges of the educational field using the EDDEFY toolkit.\r\n\r\nI have served in government, lobbied for computers in all schools when I was 7 years old and continue my lifelong work empowering others to be their best through any media available.\r\n\r\nOur network collectively reaches over 100,000 experts in Los Angeles.\r\n"

    answer: "We connect the entire open learning web and aim to map all learning, starting with Los Angeles. In the process we will be working with university partners in LA and beyond to share insightful findings from our data scientists. There are currently very few AI and data science leaders in LA and we have created a new company based in LA to focus on this field.\r\n\r\nRight now we are building a toolkit for learning that will include tools created by many of our \"competitors\", creating cooperation and improving discovery and use for dozens of related companies and institutions. We are building the best tool box for learning on the planet and we welcome collaborators from related fields.\r\n\r\nCollaboration is our culture and we enjoy working with a wide variety of partners in education, finance, creative arts, social connectedness, cultural and civic engagement along with supporting the social structures needed for a healthy society.\r\n\r\nWe know a number of the other LA2050 applicants and we look forward to working with many of them through coordinated events, campaign messages, social media, educational programs and opportunities for collective growth. Some of the great organizations we have met in LA that we'd like to work with in the future include CicLAVia, Machine Project, MindshareLA, Create:Fixate, Lightning in a Bottle Festival, Autumn Lights Festival, GLOW, State of the Arts/C3, Book Fair, Media companies and conferences for related fields. We partner with a wide variety of event and production teams and we are happy to co-sponsor events whenever we can match masters and students, creating live and interactive ways to map learning and build momentum at existing gatherings.\r\n\r\nWe will map all of these resources and assist with discovery and value creation across the entire landscape of learning. Our team is committed to creating value for all types of work and our tools will connect these resources to make it easy to find the local gems that may not be discovered otherwise.\r\n\r\nThese tools will be available via mobile app by 2014 and we will also be coordinating with other mobile app developers to collaborate and provide modular access to a wide variety of useful tools for learning.\r\n\r\nA full competitive analysis is available in our slidedeck including a field gap analysis of the companies working in educational technology: http://portal.sliderocket.com/TechSoup/eddefyinc\r\n\r\nThere are currently no companies locally or in the US taking on this challenge in this way and we are aligning with the universities that are looking at this problem in a meaningful way to solve the visualization problems we currently face in our learning paths.\r\n\r\nOver time we will integrate these tools with existing learning management systems and educational companies that provide continuing education resources for our agencies and institutions, offering a path to credentials, badges and demonstrations of skills and abilities to improve employability and workforce competencies."
