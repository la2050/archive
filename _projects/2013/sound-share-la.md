Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  The Sound Share LA initiative will be evaluated by the following metrics:



  <br>



  <br>



  <strong>PUBLIC FEEDBACK:</strong>



  <br>



  To evaluate the response from the public, an email survey will be conducted
  with participants at the end of the project’s first year.  Feedback given by
  the public will be compiled with anecdotal reports from event staff.



  <br>



  <br>



  <strong>MEDIA RESPONSE:</strong>



  <br>



  Press received will be taken into consideration alongside public opinion. 
  Positive coverage in at least one major Los Angeles media outlet per event
  will be considered a success.  We will also take into account the depth of
  social media activity throughout the course of the initiative and the number
  of followers gained.



  <br>



  <br>



  <strong>NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS:</strong>



  <br>



  We will collect website statistics, such as number of unique visitors and
  listeners.  In order to consider the project successful, web traffic must be
  comparable to equivalent online media platforms.  Attendance figures and live
  tuneins for each community broadcast event will also be recorded.  These
  statistics should expand as the project develops.



  <br>



  <br>



  <strong>PROGRAM QUALITY:</strong>



  <br>



  The staff will conduct a review at the end of each community broadcast event
  to evaluate its success based on enthusiasm of the audience and depth of
  engagement.  At the end of the first year of programming we will determine if
  the quality of the project's web presence and live broadcasts across Los
  Angeles County successfully fulfilled the initiative’s goals.
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-

   Increasing community awareness of the city's cultural heritage, history and value.





   Providing the opportunity for residents to engage with local musicians in a live setting.





   Educating listeners around the world about Los Angeles’ diverse musical contributions. 





  The monthly community radio broadcasts will have an immediate impact within
  the neighborhoods where they occur.  The public will come together to explore
  notable LA music phases in the very spaces these genres thrived.  Audiences
  will enjoy a full day of free programming giving them rare insight into the
  people and places behind these influential music developments: 1950’s Central

  uprising among many others.  






  Oral histories from the pioneers who forged these music movements will be
  shared alongside input from the generations who followed in their footsteps. 
  DJ sets and performances will bring the music genres to life.  Attendees and
  those accessing the radio broadcasts will learn about the musical heritage of
  specific LA neighborhoods.  This experience will educate them about truly
  unique music breakthroughs from Los Angeles.  Eventually these radio shows
  will have a long term impact as they are made available as online archives.

  vitality of Los Angeles by creating an ongoing document of not only the past
  but also contemporary music made in Los Angeles.  The Sound Share LA website,
