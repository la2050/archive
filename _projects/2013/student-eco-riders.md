title: Student Eco Riders
project_summary: "Wouldn’t it be great if your college student ID was also your transit pass? It is if your student ID is from Santa Monica College and you get to ride “Any Line, Any Time” on the Big Blue Bus. It’s a triple win – for students, transit agencies and colleges.  Students get to ride “Any Line, Any Time” for a nominal fee each semester, the transit agency has more riders, and the college doesn’t have to build so much parking. Whether or not you’re a student you benefit from less traffic in the neighborhoods surrounding colleges and less air pollution in the LA Basin. With less driving, lower greenhouse gases and less emissions, the environment and our health are the really big winners. That’s why we call it “Student Eco Riders.” \r\n\r\nHere’s how it works in Santa Monica. Fourteen dollars of the student body fee each Santa Monica College student pays go towards “purchasing” the transit passes each semester. Santa Monica College also kicks in some money, too.  The Big Blue Bus gets additional revenues and additional riders allowing them to increase bus service.  The student ID is a smart card that is programed to work on the Big Blue Bus.\r\n\r\nStudents at 10 other Southland colleges also ride free on any line at any time -- CSU Long Beach, UC Riverside, Chaffey College, Crafton Hills College, San Bernardino Valley College, Rio Hondo College, Riverside City College, California Baptist University, La Sierra University and Mt.

  description: "Transit is expanding in LA County thanks to voter-approved Measure R. We’ll get seven new light rail, subway and bus rapid transit lines over the next 30 years – or possibly sooner if our efforts to accelerate the construction are successful.  Building ridership for the bigger and better transit is key to getting the environmental benefits we’re after. \r\n\r\nSanta Monica College’s efforts are producing concrete results. A traffic study from 2010 found that whopping 40% of Santa Monica College's 34,000 students and 1,800 staff used the bus to get to campus in the morning. That’s huge when you consider that in LA County less than 7% of people use transit to get to work now. In 2009, LA Community College District offered a deeply discounted transit pass to students ($15 for 6 months) and students took nearly six million transit trips that year and reduced VMT (vehicle miles traveled) by 42 million miles and CO2 emissions by 36 tons. That’s the kind of impact we need to address climate change. In San Bernardino County, Omnitrans estimates that student ridership has risen from less than 5% to over 20% following a pilot program with free transit passes.\r\n\r\nCollege students are the ideal group to win over to transit for several reasons. First, they are a significant part of the population, in fact, over the next decade about 10% of LA County residents will be enrolled in community colleges alone. And students are more mobile, more open to trying new things, more environmentally conscious, and more creative when it comes to stretching their limited budgets. Learning to take transit, or experimenting with living “car-light” makes a lot more sense to college students than it does to the general public.\r\n"

    Move LA’s forte is getting key people into the room together to see and
    seize the opportunities for addressing big problems. That’s what we did in
    2008 when we convened representatives from labor, business, and
    environmental groups to get Measure R on the ballot which has proven to be a
    game changer for transit in Los Angeles County. With Student Eco Riders we
    will reach out to municipal bus agencies and LA Metro, and to student
    governments and administrations at universities and community colleges.  The
    focus would be on the larger community colleges and universities and the
    municipal bus lines, including Metro,  that serve those campuses.

    We don’t consider anyone competition, as we seek ways to work on common
    ground.
  vision: "Transportation may not be a key indicator for LA 2050, but how we get around certainly impacts many other key indicators including the environment, health, social connectedness, income and employment and access to opportunity.  \r\n\r\nToday less than a quarter of the people working in New York City drive to work alone, over half take the subway or bus.  Success in 2050 would be for three- quarters of Angelenos to arrive at work by transit, walking, bicycling or some way other than driving alone. Santa Monica College’s experience with “Any Line, Any Time” translating into to 40% of students and staff arriving on campus by transit shows us that this is possible. Since currently 70% drive alone in Los Angeles, dropping that to 25% would represent a dramatic lowering of the number of miles traveled in vehicles chalked up. Less driving means less air pollution and, consequentially, fewer children with asthma – a significant health impact.  Driving less also usually means more walking, which is critical in combatting our sedentary lifestyles, expanding waistlines and declining life expectancy – yet another health impact. \r\n\r\nThere are other very personal benefits of having transit that works, like relieving the burden on family budgets that are already strained by high gasoline prices, car repairs, insurance and all the costs of owning a car. On average it costs about $8,000/year to own a car. Freeing up that kind of  money in a working family’s budget could bring other things within reach – buying health insurance, getting dental work done, getting child care, hiring a tutor, giving up a second job, going back to school, taking art classes or enjoying more cultural events.  \r\n\r\nLess driving also means fewer greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change.  LA Community College District’s experience of just 6 million transit trips resulting in 42 million fewer miles driven and 36 fewer tons of carbon dioxide emissions shows that creating and promoting high quality transit can have an impact. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, if fewer people are driving then we don’t need so many parking places. Parking structures are expensive to build and take up valuable space on campus or in the heart of the city – space that could be used for classrooms, ball fields, student housing, or a variety of places that are more fun to hang out in than parking lots. \r\n\r\nFinally, getting more people on transit can increase our social connectedness. We’re more likely to see our neighbors as we walk to and from our transit stop. Also being around people from diverse backgrounds and ethnicities while on transit can lessen the fear of others and help us connect to the diversity of Los Angeles County. \r\n"

What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >+
  Move LA built the powerful businesslaborenvironmental coalition that worked
  with LA Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and LA Metro to get the Measure R halfcent
  sales tax for transportation on the ballot in 2008 and ensure its passage.
  Because of Measure R Los Angeles has embarked on this country’s most ambitious
  transit expansion — a virtual doubling of the size of LA County’s light rail,
  subway and bus way transit system from 120 miles and 103 stations to 236 miles

  Former Santa Monica Mayor Denny Zane recognized the opportunity created by the
  commitment of Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, then in his first term, to building
  a transit system. In January 2008, with the help of the Annenberg Foundation,
  Zane convened a “transportation conversation” with major stakeholders,

  elected officials, a pollster and a political consultant. It was decided on
  that fateful day to mount a campaign to get a county sales tax measure to
  build out a robust transit system on the ballot that November.






  Mayor Villaraigosa has proved an energetic and skillful champion, and this
  coalition succeeded in passing the 30year Measure R sales tax to provide $25
  billion for public transit — even as the Great Recession came howling down
  upon the nation. The Mayor, LA Metro and the Move LA coalition worked with the
  Obama Administration, Senator Barbara Boxer and Congress to secure funding and
  to create an ambitious new lowinterest loan program, that is the largest
  transportation infrastructure financing fund in the history of the U.S.
  Department of Transportation. 






  Measure R construction is in full swing: Last year LA Metro opened the Expo
  Line to Culver City and the Orange Line extension to Chatsworth, construction
  began on Expo to Santa Monica and continued on the Foothill Extension of the
  Gold Line to Azusa. Utilities are being relocated so construction can begin on
  the Westside Subway and the Regional Connector, and Metro is showing off

  Metro to use the longer revenue stream to secure financing and accelerate
  construction — at a time when interest rates and construction costs are at
  historic lows. Measure J won an overwhelming 66.1% of the vote, proving voters
  enthusiastically support this transit revolution, but failed to pass because
  of a ‘technicality’ — only in California do such measures require 2/3 voter
  approval to become law.






  One clear measure of Move LA’s success is that the Measure R campaign secured
  $25 billion for transit capital and operations, an investment expected to
  result in 400,000 good jobs and a major boost to the local and regional
  economy.
