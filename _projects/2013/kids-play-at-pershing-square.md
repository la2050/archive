    We measure all of our programs by quality, not by quantity. It’s not how
    large of an audience or how much of an end result that is important, not how
    many people are affected, but rather the quality of the effect. We are
    successful by insuring a safe, comfortable, positive experience for our
    community. We are successful when our neighbors’ children interact with each
    other and invite their families and friends to join.

  brief: "The Pershing Square Park Advisory Board (PAB) is seeking funding for the design, planning and installation of a playground in Pershing Square Park in Downtown Los Angeles. Pershing Square is a City of Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks outdoor concert and event center which serves the community as a recreation center.\r\nWith the addition of a playground at Pershing Square the community can continue to meet the growing needs of its youngest residents. Playgrounds provide crucial and vital opportunities for children to play. There is substantial research showing the clear link between play and brain development, motor-skills, and social capabilities. All learning—emotional, social, motor and cognitive—is accelerated, facilitated, and fueled by the pleasure of play. Playgrounds that promote different types of play are vital for a child’s cognitive, emotional, physical, and social development.\r\n\r\nPlaygrounds provide a safe environment designed specifically to foster and enhance the opportunities for a child to play alone, with a caregiver, or with other children. Given the importance of play in the development of a child, any space which gives a child free reign to do just that should be seen a crucial component in a child’s life and in the continued growth and development of one’s community.\r\n\r\nQuite simply, the addition of a playground to Pershing Square will improve the quality of life for the downtown community.\r\n"

  description: "The PAB wants to establish a place for kids to be outdoors, dream, play and learn to work with others. So whether kids are playing on the playground swings at recess, or having friends over to swing on their own swing sets, it's more than playtime; it's a time to grow.  A playground is a wonderful place for children to release stress. Swinging, jumping, climbing and running are good for children both physically and emotionally. Taking time away from structured activity is an important part of keeping a child well-rounded and healthy. A playground is not just a playground. It's a place for kids to dream, relax and learn to work with others.  By nurturing our children in this way, we help create a healthier community.\r\n\r\nDowntown Los Angeles has a changing demographic with 50,000 new residents and a growing number of children.  Currently, here is no playground for them to play, dream and learn.  We want to fill that void.\r\n"

    The PAB does not have competition – we are the only group focused on
    supporting Pershing Square Park. Pershing Square is an established park and
    run by the Department of Recreation & Parks with space and operations
    established for current programs.
  vision: "If we were able to transport to the realization of our vision of Pershing Square in 2050, we would find a reestablishment of the “Living Room” of Downtown Los Angeles. In the mid 1800's, the park was the center of family life and provided the local residents with a social gathering place of shaded walks and topical foliage, a community retreat. In the next decades as the city expanded, and its population center relocated, Pershing Square worked to establish a representation of its growth, and supported the incorporation of structural modifications designed to attract visitors to our growing city. After several reincarnations executed by creative work by the Department, and with strong support from the business community, it was resolved to reestablish the original dream to make Pershing Square once again the jewel of the downtown core, and offer the best of space to local residents, venue visitors, and tourists.\r\nPershing Square's South and Southwest kiosks will be children’s play areas serving the residential families in Downtown, South and East LA. This common area for children and their parents will provide a friendly oasis for family fun. The current Pershing Square cafe will transition to a full service restaurant to provide a social gathering stop to tourists and the community.\r\n\r\nAcross from the cafe, the \"Art Squared Gallery\" will provide a changing platform for the works of local and international artists, and provide a cultural exhibit of our beautiful city's artistic contributions. \r\n\r\nOn the Northwest kiosk, chess and checker games boards will be available for leisure game activity, as well as programmed tournament activity.\r\n\r\nThe Northeast side of the Square will have an extended urban wall garden curated by the Pershing Square staff and community members. Jasmine roses, and other native flowers and plants will enhance the ambiance of the area and highlight the public perception of LA's intrinsic natural environment. \r\n\r\nOur tradition of free summer concerts will continue, with the performances presented on a world class iconic stage. The new structure will incorporate cutting edge lighting and sound equipment which will enable the City to attract high level artists and performers as well as loyal patrons of the venue.\r\n\r\n\"Downtown On Ice\", the outdoor ice skating rink at Pershing Square, will expand to accommodate twice the number of participants. Both the Summer stage and Winter ice rink will have established our new Pershing Square as an outstanding Los Angeles entertainment destination.\r\n\r\nAll of the above projections will enhance the quality of life for the Los Angeles population. Further it will optimize the City’s image to international visitors and diplomatic guests.\r\n\r\nThe children and grandchildren of the kids using the playground today would still be enjoying this wonderful part of the park.\r\n\r\n"

  The PAB wants to establish a place for kids to be outdoors, dream, play and
  learn to work with others. So whether kids are playing on the playground
  swings at recess, or having friends over to swing on their own swing sets,
  it's more than playtime; it's a time to grow.  A playground is a wonderful
  place for children to release stress. Swinging, jumping, climbing and running

  healthy. A playground is not just a playground. It's a place for kids to
  dream, relax and learn to work with others.  By nurturing our children in this
  way, we help create a healthier community.






  Downtown Los Angeles has a changing demographic with 50,000 new residents and
  a growing number of children.  Currently, here is no playground for them to
  play, dream and learn.  We want to fill that void.


What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >+
  If we were able to transport to the realization of our vision of Pershing
  Square in 2050, we would find a reestablishment of the “Living Room” of
  Downtown Los Angeles. In the mid 1800's, the park was the center of family
  life and provided the local residents with a social gathering place of shaded
  walks and topical foliage, a community retreat. In the next decades as the
  city expanded, and its population center relocated, Pershing Square worked to
  establish a representation of its growth, and supported the incorporation of

  After several reincarnations executed by creative work by the Department, and
  with strong support from the business community, it was resolved to
  reestablish the original dream to make Pershing Square once again the jewel of
  the downtown core, and offer the best of space to local residents, venue
  visitors, and tourists.



  Pershing Square's South and Southwest kiosks will be children’s play areas
  serving the residential families in Downtown, South and East LA. This common
  area for children and their parents will provide a friendly oasis for family
  fun. The current Pershing Square cafe will transition to a full service
  restaurant to provide a social gathering stop to tourists and the community.






  Across from the cafe, the "Art Squared Gallery" will provide a changing
  platform for the works of local and international artists, and provide a
  cultural exhibit of our beautiful city's artistic contributions. 






  On the Northwest kiosk, chess and checker games boards will be available for
  leisure game activity, as well as programmed tournament activity.






  The Northeast side of the Square will have an extended urban wall garden
  curated by the Pershing Square staff and community members. Jasmine roses, and
  other native flowers and plants will enhance the ambiance of the area and
  highlight the public perception of LA's intrinsic natural environment. 






  Our tradition of free summer concerts will continue, with the performances
  presented on a world class iconic stage. The new structure will incorporate
  cutting edge lighting and sound equipment which will enable the City to
  attract high level artists and performers as well as loyal patrons of the
  venue.






  "Downtown On Ice", the outdoor ice skating rink at Pershing Square, will
  expand to accommodate twice the number of participants. Both the Summer stage
  and Winter ice rink will have established our new Pershing Square as an
  outstanding Los Angeles entertainment destination.






  All of the above projections will enhance the quality of life for the Los
  Angeles population. Further it will optimize the City’s image to international
  visitors and diplomatic guests.






  The children and grandchildren of the kids using the playground today would
  still be enjoying this wonderful part of the park.
