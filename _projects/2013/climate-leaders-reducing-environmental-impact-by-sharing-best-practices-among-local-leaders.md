  Climate Leaders  reducing environmental impact by sharing best practices among
  local leaders
project_summary: "The mission of Generation Green's Contra Costa County Climate Leaders Program (4CL) is to facilitate education on environmental policy implementation- to encourage local cities to take action to reduce greenhouse gases in Northern California by implementing best practices used by other local governments. The 4CL Program is modeled after other county networks which have proven to build capacity to the region and we see this model as a perfect addition to the environmental groups in LA county, striving to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prepare their cities for the climate changes we are currently experiencing and the larger impacts that are yet to come. Our organization provides local elected officials and staff professionals with up-to-date information through a monthly newsletter, fact sheets, and a website with references and links to projects and policies from peer cities in our county and the larger Bay Area. We bolster this effort with a quarterly workshop opportunity to gather face-to-face to review, discuss, network and learn about a current topic through several guest speakers and important stakeholders from the area.\r\n\r\nUnlike other counties in the Bay Area, Contra Costa County governments have been slower than other governments to address the issue of climate change and we see a similar pattern in the majority of LA County cities. Yet, real action and real implementation is well underway! We see this model as the ideal system for getting LA County to move forward to reduce emissions in order to abide by emission reduction policy and prepare the local cities for what lies ahead. By focusing on the reduction emission strategies which save cities money, local governments can reduce their impact with devastating their budgets. Sharing best practices, policies, documents and activities reduces the strain on any one cities already overworked staff and elected officials. Whether it is benchmarking building energy use or focusing on emergency planning through adaptation strategies, cities can help one another with facilitation by a Climate Leaders branch in LA.\r\nGeneration Green's 4CL Program has formally established a network of over 700 leaders through our Constant Contact newsletter list and another 500 leaders on social media outlets such as Facebook in the Bay Area, specifically in Contra Costa County. Our network continues to grow on a regular basis. The network uses a multimedia communications strategy that ensures that best practices are shared and implemented throughout the local regional county network as climate action plans are continuing to develop. The communication strategy we have selected has a three pronged multi-media approach that provides encouraging reminders and easy access to the tools necessary to implement new policies. These prongs are:\r\no A regional website that acts as a repository for best practices polices with an interactive map and matrix of key issues\r\no A monthly newsletter full of pertinent and useful information including funding, legislative updates and upcoming events\r\no Periodic half-day workshops providing education and networking opportunities for key stakeholders on key climate issues\r\nThis multi-media approach ensures that best practices at the forefront of day-to-day discussion--and that they are shared, supported, and implemented into policies that reduce Greenhouse gas emissions in Contra Costa County. By supporting the leaders that are already present in LA County, we will not be stepping on the heels of other organizations or creating more work for staff, but we will be bringing together the many individuals and fostering the Climate Leaders that are already taking action!\r\n"

    4CL will work with all of the local governments: both elected officials and
    staff members. We will also work with local non-profit groups to mentor and
    create an active network in LA County. Any and all key stakeholders will be
    involved in order to spread the work and benefits of best practices.

    Competition? Those who don't "believe" in climate change, believe that
    environmental initiatives are a waste of money and those that try to stall
    environmental progress would be our biggest form of competition.  Our
    working relationship with these groups involve a different approach. We
    focus on the money-saving initiatives. Everyone and every city is strapped
    for cash these days. We strive to connect with these organizations by
    approaching topics and promoting activities that will truly save cities
    money in the long run. 
  vision: >-
    A 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from city operations would be a
    sure sign of success by 2050. This would take real work, real commitment,
    and a multitude of support from local governments, residents, constituents
    and key stakeholders.

  The mission of Generation Green's Contra Costa County Climate Leaders Program
  (4CL) is to facilitate education on environmental policy implementation to
  encourage local cities to take action to reduce greenhouse gases in Northern
  California by implementing best practices used by other local governments. The
  4CL Program is modeled after other county networks which have proven to build
  capacity to the region and we see this model as a perfect addition to the
  environmental groups in LA county, striving to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
  and prepare their cities for the climate changes we are currently experiencing
  and the larger impacts that are yet to come. Our organization provides local
  elected officials and staff professionals with uptodate information through a
  monthly newsletter, fact sheets, and a website with references and links to
  projects and policies from peer cities in our county and the larger Bay Area.
  We bolster this effort with a quarterly workshop opportunity to gather
  facetoface to review, discuss, network and learn about a current topic through
  several guest speakers and important stakeholders from the area.






  Unlike other counties in the Bay Area, Contra Costa County governments have
  been slower than other governments to address the issue of climate change and
  we see a similar pattern in the majority of LA County cities. Yet, real action
  and real implementation is well underway! We see this model as the ideal
  system for getting LA County to move forward to reduce emissions in order to
  abide by emission reduction policy and prepare the local cities for what lies
  ahead. By focusing on the reduction emission strategies which save cities
  money, local governments can reduce their impact with devastating their
  budgets. Sharing best practices, policies, documents and activities reduces
  the strain on any one cities already overworked staff and elected officials.
  Whether it is benchmarking building energy use or focusing on emergency
  planning through adaptation strategies, cities can help one another with
  facilitation by a Climate Leaders branch in LA.



  Generation Green's 4CL Program has formally established a network of over 700
  leaders through our Constant Contact newsletter list and another 500 leaders
  on social media outlets such as Facebook in the Bay Area, specifically in
  Contra Costa County. Our network continues to grow on a regular basis. The
  network uses a multimedia communications strategy that ensures that best
  practices are shared and implemented throughout the local regional county
  network as climate action plans are continuing to develop. The communication
  strategy we have selected has a three pronged multimedia approach that
  provides encouraging reminders and easy access to the tools necessary to
  implement new policies. These prongs are:



  o A regional website that acts as a repository for best practices polices with
  an interactive map and matrix of key issues



  o A monthly newsletter full of pertinent and useful information including
  funding, legislative updates and upcoming events



  o Periodic halfday workshops providing education and networking opportunities
  for key stakeholders on key climate issues



  This multimedia approach ensures that best practices at the forefront of
  daytoday discussionand that they are shared, supported, and implemented into
  policies that reduce Greenhouse gas emissions in Contra Costa County. By
  supporting the leaders that are already present in LA County, we will not be
  stepping on the heels of other organizations or creating more work for staff,
  but we will be bringing together the many individuals and fostering the
  Climate Leaders that are already taking action!


What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >+
  Directly from our efforts, six Contra Costa cities have completed Climate
  Action Plans. Four other Cities are currently in the process of developing a
  Climate Action Plan and eight additional city agreements have been made to
  accept assistance from local environmental organizations to being the Climate
  Action Planning Process by focusing on energyrelated emission reduction
  strategies. By viewing the interactive map on our website,
  http://www.cccclimateleaders.org/greencitiesmap.html, you can see the progress
  of our county. Significant environmental progress is underway but, there is
  still much to be done.






  We have grown our newsletter network to over 700 people and have over 500
  individuals on our social media outlets. 






  We have completed a dozen indepth studies on environmental issues which have
  been used by several local cities.






  We have held over a dozen workshops, connected with individuals from every
  city in Contra Costa County and have made real strides with the majority of
  the cities we work with.





Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  4CL will work with all of the local governments: both elected officials and
  staff members. We will also work with local nonprofit groups to mentor and
  create an active network in LA County. Any and all key stakeholders will be
  involved in order to spread the work and benefits of best practices.
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  We use evaluation feedback surveys, track our website traffic, and monitor the
  activity and interactions with our newsletter.






  We will continually maintain and expand our network in Contra Costa County and
  track our contacts. An uptodate contacts database tracks our efforts to target
  our message to the right people and prevent duplicating efforts.



  We evaluate the use and effectiveness of our newsletter through the open rates
  and clicks on links through Constant Contact. We can see what draws the most
  attention and focus on the issues we see our network relating to most.



  We rigorously track workshop attendees: both numbers of attendees as well as
  the cities represented. We post and share these lists of attendees on our
  website to ensure that the sustainability leaders are able to communicate with
  one another and continue the conversations that began during our workshops.



  At the end of each workshop, we provide evaluation forms to ensure that
  attendees learn from our workshop topics, speakers, and receive enough
  information to help them. Through this process, each workshop is graded and
  feedback is reviewed on a scale of one to five in a number of categories, we
  have consistently receive scores averaging 4.5 or higher for our Contra Costa
  County Workshops.



  We keep track of city progress through a local actions section on our website
  to see where each city is in environmental progress. Through a Climate Action
  Matrix and the Green Cities Map, we see where cities are in completing a
  climate action plan and on other important pieces of policy. This would most
  definitely be replicated for LA County.



  We would also monitor the visitors and visitor activity on our website.



  Our true measure of success and best feedback/evaluation is through the
  progress of the local governments we work with. The education, networking
  opportunities, and resources we provide are best evaluated by those who use
  our tools (or we find out why others do not use them). We continually seek
