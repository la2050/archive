  success: "I can perform evidenced-based outcome studies to either show that virtual mentoring provides a statistically significant benefit to foster youth and their ability to complete college, or that the program does not provide the anticipated benefits and future funding should be directed on other types of programming.

  Indicator: ' Education'
  brief: "I would use $100,000 to shape the future of Los Angeles by applying this money to the development and implementation of the Foster Care Counts Virtual Mentor Program that is currently being conceived by Foster Care Counts, a 501c3 corporation whose mission is to improve the lives of foster youth in Los Angeles County.  Although I believe that a mentor can help a foster or at-risk youth with any if not all of the challenge areas proposed in LA2050, I propose that Foster Care Counts’ Virtual Mentoring Program will create positive change in the area of education, as educational achievement continues to be one of the major impediments foster youth face in our country today.  Although 70% of our nation’s foster youth desire to go to college, only 3% of them are able to graduate with a degree.  After fully developing a best-practices virtual mentor program, I propose to use this funding to pilot a mentoring program to assist current and former foster youth to both enter as well as remain in the following postsecondary educational institutions in Los Angeles: UCLA, Los Angeles City College, Los Angeles Trade Tech Community College, and Cal State Los Angeles.\r\nBackground\r\nThere are currently more than 400,000 foster youth in our country today, and approximately 20,000 of them reside in Los Angeles.   This is by far the highest number of foster youth living in any city in the United States.  Having been removed from the homes of their biological parents due to abuse and neglect, either through the criminal justice system or LA County Social Services, these children become wards of the state. As decisions and resources available to raise them are now dictated by taxpayer votes and dollars, we, as taxpayers, have now become the parents of these children who, through no fault of their own, have found themselves homeless, voiceless, and powerless. \r\nFoster children are much more likely to experience the consequences of not only abuse and neglect than the general population, but face serious impediments to the ability to grow and mature to live stable, adaptive lives in rates that are astonishingly higher than their non-foster peers.  Upon becoming legal adults, usually at the age of 18, foster youth are no longer protected by the foster care system, and face disproportionate rates of homelessness, unemployment, inadequate education, poverty, and physical and mental health problems when compared with their non-foster peers.\r\nFor example, according to Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services, The United States Department of Health and Human Services, Casey Family Programs, and the Hilton Foundation,  in 2011 approximately 22% of former foster youth were experiencing homelessness compared with .04% of the general population, 52% of former foster youth were unemployed compared to 9% of the population at large, 33% were living below the poverty level compared with 15% of the greater population, 57% of former foster youth have had at least one mental health diagnosis compared with 26% of the general population, and somewhere between 25-35% of former foster youth have been incarcerated compared with 2.7% of the general population. (Barbell & Freundlich, 2001; Culhane, Metraux, Byrne, Moreno, & Toros, November 2011; Marian, Lovie, Kirk, & Peter, 2009; Munson & McMillen, 2009; P. J. Pecora et al.; P. J. J. P. S. R. L. H. L. J. O. A. Pecora, 2009; Trout, Hagaman, Casey, Reid, & Epstein; Zima et al., 2000)\r\nMoreover, the average number of placements in different foster homes for these youth is 7, and many foster youth experience as many as 12 separate foster placements before they reach age 18. 65% of former foster youth experienced seven or more school changes before 12th grade, less than 60% of foster youth graduate high school, and although 70% of foster youth would like to and/or plan to attend college, approximately only 3% graduate college, as compared to the national average of about 30%.  Of the foster youth who do enter college, almost a full 100% are unprepared academically and do not possess the independent living skills necessary to matriculate successfully through college without the support network of a family.\r\nThere is a tremendous amount of peer-reviewed literature analyzing both the barriers to as well as protective factors that enable foster youth to succeed in their ability to grow up, become educated, and lead constructive lives as adults.  In fact, foster youth probably suffer from significant lags in most if not all of the challenge areas included in LA2050, and could benefit from assistance directed toward each one of these arenas.  I believe that a mentor would have the flexibility to be able to assist foster youth in many if not most of these challenges, and that if the foster youth population could be significantly assisted, we might see other at-risk populations become included into this model, with the ability to positively impact the statistics in each of the LA2050 challenge areas. "
  budget explanation: "What, specifically then, will this money be used for? \r\n1)\tAlthough I have done all the preliminary research on the best practices of all the existing, well-established mentoring practices to date, and have evaluated the current peer-reviewed literature available on the results of evidence-based studies of existing mentoring programs, I now have the opportunity to collaborate with two California state-licensed clinical psychologists, both of whom have considerable experience working with the foster care population, to actually develop a mentoring program and mentor training program that will include American Psychological Association approved ethically-constrained best practices in their development, implementation, and ongoing guidance and monitoring. I believe that I can develop the most professional, well-evaluated program possible for these youth by investing $10-15,000 on engaging my two clinical psychologist colleagues to consult with me on its development.\r\n2)\t 2) In addition, I believe that with an investment of $10-15,000, I can perform evidenced-based outcome studies to either show that virtual mentoring provides a statistically significant benefit to foster youth and their ability to improve their life outcomes, or that the program does not provide the anticipated benefits and future funding should be directed on other types of programming. If outcome studies show statistically significant benefits, these studies can prove to be very valuable in attempting to direct government funding and legislative change by showing how vastly the benefits would outweigh the costs.\r\n3)\tFinally, the economics of the existing virtual mentoring program with whom I originally explored partnering demonstrated an extremely cost-efficient model.  The total annual budget of the program, divided by the number of mentees being supported by the program, resulted in a per child cost of approximately $564 per child per annum.  Compared to the annual costs of so many social service programs, a virtual mentoring program which asks for a reasonable, feasible, and flexible commitment from a caring adult should be extremely well-equipped to leverage the talents of many adults who would like to give back to society, utilize their own parenting skills acquired through the raising of their own families, and do so in a manner that doesn’t inconvenience them beyond their capacity, for a very low per child expense.\r\nAfter development and outcome study costs, for a program such as this, at $562 per youth per year, could provide ethically-driven, supervised mentors for a minimum of 125 kids for a year for each $70,000 raised, as well as create a sustainable model that can be expanded to include not only foster youth, but any at-risk youth who could benefit from the guidance, support, and friendship of a caring adult who had time to give, with increasing efficiencies of scale as the program grew.  Thank you for considering my request.\r\n"
  description: "Virtual mentors can help foster youth enter and complete college, and as indicated in the LA2050 challenge, better education can increase prospects and participation in community life in all areas of the LA2050 challenge, creating better citizens and a better city. A myriad of resources exist to support my assumptions about the potential benefits of providing mentors to youth who lack the support and guidance of a stable family.  M.R. Munson et al. found that “older youth exiting foster care value having someone that maintains contact, stays by their side, and is simply there for them” (Munson & McMillen, 2009). Samuels and Pryce found that young adults more often seek instrumental forms of support, such as help with housing, but that their pride may hinder them from asking for emotional support (Griffin et al., 2011; Samuels, 2008). Data from this study revealed that both of these forms of support were perceived by the foster youth as valuable. Leadbeater & Way’s study on young adults  reported that they often want another person in their lives that will hold them accountable and set limits (Leadbeater & Way, 2001). Finally, the National Mentoring Partnership (2004) found that an online mentoring program taking place between 2002-2004 “bolstered mentees' self-esteem, literacy and future orientation.”\r\n\r\nWhy virtual mentors? There are two main reasons. First, in reading the existing literature about the most established face-to-face mentoring programs, and surveying adult peers about their potential willingness to be a mentor, it seems that one of the main impediments to peoples’ willingness to be a mentor is the expectation that the mentor commit to a regularly-scheduled, minimum amount of time spent with the mentee, not including travel time and having to juggle unexpected conflicts and the vagaries of today’s overcrowded lifestyles.  \r\nThis seems to be a commitment that may feel overwhelming for the average bright, accomplished, busy individual who could probably REALLY help a youth navigate the complexities of his or her own life if the volunteer had the flexibility to make this commitment fit within his or her own set of obligations. Indeed I myself have always wanted to be a mentor or big sister but have always hesitated when trying to imagine myself fighting traffic to get to East LA by a certain time to meet a vulnerable kid waiting and wondering if I am going to show up and then there is an accident on the freeway and one of my kids’ schools calls to inform me that a kid is sick, etc…\r\nThe second reason virtual mentoring makes sense is that today’s youth are potentially as or more comfortable with online communication as they are face-to-face communication. Additionally, given that many foster youth have issues of trust and attachment, a virtual relationship may feel safer and less overwhelming than a traditional face-to-face relationship with a stranger who looks like the many other adults who may have already disappointed a mentee.\r\n"

  Los Angeles.



  Background



  There are currently more than 400,000 foster youth in our country today, and
  approximately 20,000 of them reside in Los Angeles.   This is by far the
  highest number of foster youth living in any city in the United States. 
  Having been removed from the homes of their biological parents due to abuse
  and neglect, either through the criminal justice system or LA County Social
  Services, these children become wards of the state. As decisions and resources
  available to raise them are now dictated by taxpayer votes and dollars, we, as
  taxpayers, have now become the parents of these children who, through no fault
  of their own, have found themselves homeless, voiceless, and powerless. 



  Foster children are much more likely to experience the consequences of not
  only abuse and neglect than the general population, but face serious
  impediments to the ability to grow and mature to live stable, adaptive lives
  in rates that are astonishingly higher than their nonfoster peers.  Upon
  becoming legal adults, usually at the age of 18, foster youth are no longer
  protected by the foster care system, and face disproportionate rates of
  homelessness, unemployment, inadequate education, poverty, and physical and
  mental health problems when compared with their nonfoster peers.



  For example, according to Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family
  Services, The United States Department of Health and Human Services, Casey
  Family Programs, and the Hilton Foundation,  in 2011 approximately 22% of
  former foster youth were experiencing homelessness compared with .04% of the
  general population, 52% of former foster youth were unemployed compared to 9%
  of the population at large, 33% were living below the poverty level compared
  with 15% of the greater population, 57% of former foster youth have had at
  least one mental health diagnosis compared with 26% of the general population,
  and somewhere between 2535% of former foster youth have been incarcerated
  compared with 2.7% of the general population. (Barbell & Freundlich, 2001;
  Culhane, Metraux, Byrne, Moreno, & Toros, November 2011; Marian, Lovie, Kirk,
  & Peter, 2009; Munson & McMillen, 2009; P. J. Pecora et al.; P. J. J. P. S. R.
  L. H. L. J. O. A. Pecora, 2009; Trout, Hagaman, Casey, Reid, & Epstein; Zima
  et al., 2000)



  Moreover, the average number of placements in different foster homes for these
  youth is 7, and many foster youth experience as many as 12 separate foster
  placements before they reach age 18. 65% of former foster youth experienced
  seven or more school changes before 12th grade, less than 60% of foster youth
  graduate high school, and although 70% of foster youth would like to and/or
  plan to attend college, approximately only 3% graduate college, as compared to
  the national average of about 30%.  Of the foster youth who do enter college,
  almost a full 100% are unprepared academically and do not possess the
  independent living skills necessary to matriculate successfully through
  college without the support network of a family.



  There is a tremendous amount of peerreviewed literature analyzing both the
  barriers to as well as protective factors that enable foster youth to succeed
  in their ability to grow up, become educated, and lead constructive lives as
  adults.  In fact, foster youth probably suffer from significant lags in most

  significantly assisted, we might see other atrisk populations become included

Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  I plan to partner with Guardian Scholars organizations at the following
  Institutions: UCLA, Los Angeles City College, Los Angeles Trade Tech Community
  College, Cal State Fullerton.  Guardian Scholars is an oncampus support
  organization to support foster youth in college.  I plan to partner with two

  youth, one of whom has done a great deal of consulting for Los Angeles County.
  I plan to collaborate outcome research with the University of Southern
  California, with whom I am collaborating on other outcome research related to
  the foster care system.
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  I can perform evidencedbased outcome studies to either show that virtual
  mentoring provides a statistically significant benefit to foster youth and
  their ability to complete college, or that the program does not provide the
  anticipated benefits and future funding should be directed on other types of
  programming. If outcome studies show statistically significant benefits, these
  studies can prove to be very valuable in attempting to direct government
  funding and legislative change by showing how vastly the benefits would
  outweigh the costs.






  The project will be evaluated by comparing an experimental group of foster
  youth college students who have virtual mentors to a control group of foster
  youth college students who have similar demographic characteristics who do not
  have mentors, and, controlling for various extraneous environmental
  circumstances, determine whether foster youth in college who have mentors
  exhibit statistically significant higher rates of graduation than foster
  students in college without virtual mentors.
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
  Virtual mentors can help foster youth enter and complete college, and as
  indicated in the LA2050 challenge, better education can increase prospects and
  participation in community life in all areas of the LA2050 challenge, creating

What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >+
  Of the 70 % of foster youth who wish to attend and complete college, I would
  consider my program successful if a statistically significantly greater number
  of youth were able to finish college with the help of a virtual mentor than
  are able to do so today, if the model of virtual mentoring were extended
  beyond the foster care system to all atrisk populations, and if there were
  government incentives available to those willing to be virtual mentors because
  the benefit to society far outweighed the taxpayer cost of the incentive.

    answer: "I would use $100,000 to shape the future of Los Angeles by applying this money to the development and implementation of the Foster Care Counts Virtual Mentor Program that is currently being conceived by Foster Care Counts, a 501c3 corporation whose mission is to improve the lives of foster youth in Los Angeles County.  Although I believe that a mentor can help a foster or at-risk youth with any if not all of the challenge areas proposed in LA2050, I propose that Foster Care Counts’ Virtual Mentoring Program will create positive change in the area of education, as educational achievement continues to be one of the major impediments foster youth face in our country today.  Although 70% of our nation’s foster youth desire to go to college, only 3% of them are able to graduate with a degree.  After fully developing a best-practices virtual mentor program, I propose to use this funding to pilot a mentoring program to assist current and former foster youth to both enter as well as remain in the following postsecondary educational institutions in Los Angeles: UCLA, Los Angeles City College, Los Angeles Trade Tech Community College, and Cal State Los Angeles.\r\nBackground\r\nThere are currently more than 400,000 foster youth in our country today, and approximately 20,000 of them reside in Los Angeles.   This is by far the highest number of foster youth living in any city in the United States.  Having been removed from the homes of their biological parents due to abuse and neglect, either through the criminal justice system or LA County Social Services, these children become wards of the state. As decisions and resources available to raise them are now dictated by taxpayer votes and dollars, we, as taxpayers, have now become the parents of these children who, through no fault of their own, have found themselves homeless, voiceless, and powerless. \r\nFoster children are much more likely to experience the consequences of not only abuse and neglect than the general population, but face serious impediments to the ability to grow and mature to live stable, adaptive lives in rates that are astonishingly higher than their non-foster peers.  Upon becoming legal adults, usually at the age of 18, foster youth are no longer protected by the foster care system, and face disproportionate rates of homelessness, unemployment, inadequate education, poverty, and physical and mental health problems when compared with their non-foster peers.\r\nFor example, according to Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services, The United States Department of Health and Human Services, Casey Family Programs, and the Hilton Foundation,  in 2011 approximately 22% of former foster youth were experiencing homelessness compared with .04% of the general population, 52% of former foster youth were unemployed compared to 9% of the population at large, 33% were living below the poverty level compared with 15% of the greater population, 57% of former foster youth have had at least one mental health diagnosis compared with 26% of the general population, and somewhere between 25-35% of former foster youth have been incarcerated compared with 2.7% of the general population. (Barbell & Freundlich, 2001; Culhane, Metraux, Byrne, Moreno, & Toros, November 2011; Marian, Lovie, Kirk, & Peter, 2009; Munson & McMillen, 2009; P. J. Pecora et al.; P. J. J. P. S. R. L. H. L. J. O. A. Pecora, 2009; Trout, Hagaman, Casey, Reid, & Epstein; Zima et al., 2000)\r\nMoreover, the average number of placements in different foster homes for these youth is 7, and many foster youth experience as many as 12 separate foster placements before they reach age 18. 65% of former foster youth experienced seven or more school changes before 12th grade, less than 60% of foster youth graduate high school, and although 70% of foster youth would like to and/or plan to attend college, approximately only 3% graduate college, as compared to the national average of about 30%.  Of the foster youth who do enter college, almost a full 100% are unprepared academically and do not possess the independent living skills necessary to matriculate successfully through college without the support network of a family.\r\nThere is a tremendous amount of peer-reviewed literature analyzing both the barriers to as well as protective factors that enable foster youth to succeed in their ability to grow up, become educated, and lead constructive lives as adults.  In fact, foster youth probably suffer from significant lags in most if not all of the challenge areas included in LA2050, and could benefit from assistance directed toward each one of these arenas.  I believe that a mentor would have the flexibility to be able to assist foster youth in many if not most of these challenges, and that if the foster youth population could be significantly assisted, we might see other at-risk populations become included into this model, with the ability to positively impact the statistics in each of the LA2050 challenge areas.

    answer: "What, specifically then, will this money be used for? \r\n1)\tAlthough I have done all the preliminary research on the best practices of all the existing, well-established mentoring practices to date, and have evaluated the current peer-reviewed literature available on the results of evidence-based studies of existing mentoring programs, I now have the opportunity to collaborate with two California state-licensed clinical psychologists, both of whom have considerable experience working with the foster care population, to actually develop a mentoring program and mentor training program that will include American Psychological Association approved ethically-constrained best practices in their development, implementation, and ongoing guidance and monitoring. I believe that I can develop the most professional, well-evaluated program possible for these youth by investing $10-15,000 on engaging my two clinical psychologist colleagues to consult with me on its development.\r\n2)\t 2) In addition, I believe that with an investment of $10-15,000, I can perform evidenced-based outcome studies to either show that virtual mentoring provides a statistically significant benefit to foster youth and their ability to improve their life outcomes, or that the program does not provide the anticipated benefits and future funding should be directed on other types of programming. If outcome studies show statistically significant benefits, these studies can prove to be very valuable in attempting to direct government funding and legislative change by showing how vastly the benefits would outweigh the costs.\r\n3)\tFinally, the economics of the existing virtual mentoring program with whom I originally explored partnering demonstrated an extremely cost-efficient model.  The total annual budget of the program, divided by the number of mentees being supported by the program, resulted in a per child cost of approximately $564 per child per annum.  Compared to the annual costs of so many social service programs, a virtual mentoring program which asks for a reasonable, feasible, and flexible commitment from a caring adult should be extremely well-equipped to leverage the talents of many adults who would like to give back to society, utilize their own parenting skills acquired through the raising of their own families, and do so in a manner that doesn’t inconvenience them beyond their capacity, for a very low per child expense.\r\nAfter development and outcome study costs, for a program such as this, at $562 per youth per year, could provide ethically-driven, supervised mentors for a minimum of 125 kids for a year for each $70,000 raised, as well as create a sustainable model that can be expanded to include not only foster youth, but any at-risk youth who could benefit from the guidance, support, and friendship of a caring adult who had time to give, with increasing efficiencies of scale as the program grew.  Thank you for considering my request.\r\n"

    answer: "Virtual mentors can help foster youth enter and complete college, and as indicated in the LA2050 challenge, better education can increase prospects and participation in community life in all areas of the LA2050 challenge, creating better citizens and a better city. A myriad of resources exist to support my assumptions about the potential benefits of providing mentors to youth who lack the support and guidance of a stable family.  M.R. Munson et al. found that “older youth exiting foster care value having someone that maintains contact, stays by their side, and is simply there for them” (Munson & McMillen, 2009). Samuels and Pryce found that young adults more often seek instrumental forms of support, such as help with housing, but that their pride may hinder them from asking for emotional support (Griffin et al., 2011; Samuels, 2008). Data from this study revealed that both of these forms of support were perceived by the foster youth as valuable. Leadbeater & Way’s study on young adults  reported that they often want another person in their lives that will hold them accountable and set limits (Leadbeater & Way, 2001). Finally, the National Mentoring Partnership (2004) found that an online mentoring program taking place between 2002-2004 “bolstered mentees' self-esteem, literacy and future orientation.”\r\n\r\nWhy virtual mentors? There are two main reasons. First, in reading the existing literature about the most established face-to-face mentoring programs, and surveying adult peers about their potential willingness to be a mentor, it seems that one of the main impediments to peoples’ willingness to be a mentor is the expectation that the mentor commit to a regularly-scheduled, minimum amount of time spent with the mentee, not including travel time and having to juggle unexpected conflicts and the vagaries of today’s overcrowded lifestyles.  \r\nThis seems to be a commitment that may feel overwhelming for the average bright, accomplished, busy individual who could probably REALLY help a youth navigate the complexities of his or her own life if the volunteer had the flexibility to make this commitment fit within his or her own set of obligations. Indeed I myself have always wanted to be a mentor or big sister but have always hesitated when trying to imagine myself fighting traffic to get to East LA by a certain time to meet a vulnerable kid waiting and wondering if I am going to show up and then there is an accident on the freeway and one of my kids’ schools calls to inform me that a kid is sick, etc…\r\nThe second reason virtual mentoring makes sense is that today’s youth are potentially as or more comfortable with online communication as they are face-to-face communication. Additionally, given that many foster youth have issues of trust and attachment, a virtual relationship may feel safer and less overwhelming than a traditional face-to-face relationship with a stranger who looks like the many other adults who may have already disappointed a mentee.\r\n"
