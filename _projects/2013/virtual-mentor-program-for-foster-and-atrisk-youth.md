title: Virtual Mentor Program for Foster and Atrisk Youth
indicator: ' Education'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  I would use $100,000 to shape the future of Los Angeles by applying this money
  to the development and implementation of the Foster Care Counts Virtual Mentor
  Program that is currently being conceived by Foster Care Counts, a 501c3
  corporation whose mission is to improve the lives of foster youth in Los
  Angeles County.  Although I believe that a mentor can help a foster or atrisk
  youth with any if not all of the challenge areas proposed in LA2050, I propose
  that Foster Care Counts’ Virtual Mentoring Program will create positive change
  in the area of education, as educational achievement continues to be one of
  the major impediments foster youth face in our country today.  Although 70% of
  our nation’s foster youth desire to go to college, only 3% of them are able to
  graduate with a degree.  After fully developing a bestpractices virtual mentor
  program, I propose to use this funding to pilot a mentoring program to assist
  current and former foster youth to both enter as well as remain in the
  following postsecondary educational institutions in Los Angeles: UCLA, Los
  Angeles City College, Los Angeles Trade Tech Community College, and Cal State
  Los Angeles.



  Background



  There are currently more than 400,000 foster youth in our country today, and
  approximately 20,000 of them reside in Los Angeles.   This is by far the
  highest number of foster youth living in any city in the United States. 
  Having been removed from the homes of their biological parents due to abuse
  and neglect, either through the criminal justice system or LA County Social
  Services, these children become wards of the state. As decisions and resources
  available to raise them are now dictated by taxpayer votes and dollars, we, as
  taxpayers, have now become the parents of these children who, through no fault
  of their own, have found themselves homeless, voiceless, and powerless. 



  Foster children are much more likely to experience the consequences of not
  only abuse and neglect than the general population, but face serious
  impediments to the ability to grow and mature to live stable, adaptive lives
  in rates that are astonishingly higher than their nonfoster peers.  Upon
  becoming legal adults, usually at the age of 18, foster youth are no longer
  protected by the foster care system, and face disproportionate rates of
  homelessness, unemployment, inadequate education, poverty, and physical and
  mental health problems when compared with their nonfoster peers.



  For example, according to Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family
  Services, The United States Department of Health and Human Services, Casey
  Family Programs, and the Hilton Foundation,  in 2011 approximately 22% of
  former foster youth were experiencing homelessness compared with .04% of the
  general population, 52% of former foster youth were unemployed compared to 9%
  of the population at large, 33% were living below the poverty level compared
  with 15% of the greater population, 57% of former foster youth have had at
  least one mental health diagnosis compared with 26% of the general population,
  and somewhere between 2535% of former foster youth have been incarcerated
  compared with 2.7% of the general population. (Barbell & Freundlich, 2001;
  Culhane, Metraux, Byrne, Moreno, & Toros, November 2011; Marian, Lovie, Kirk,
  & Peter, 2009; Munson & McMillen, 2009; P. J. Pecora et al.; P. J. J. P. S. R.
  L. H. L. J. O. A. Pecora, 2009; Trout, Hagaman, Casey, Reid, & Epstein; Zima
  et al., 2000)



  Moreover, the average number of placements in different foster homes for these
  youth is 7, and many foster youth experience as many as 12 separate foster
  placements before they reach age 18. 65% of former foster youth experienced
  seven or more school changes before 12th grade, less than 60% of foster youth
  graduate high school, and although 70% of foster youth would like to and/or
  plan to attend college, approximately only 3% graduate college, as compared to
  the national average of about 30%.  Of the foster youth who do enter college,
  almost a full 100% are unprepared academically and do not possess the
  independent living skills necessary to matriculate successfully through
  college without the support network of a family.



  There is a tremendous amount of peerreviewed literature analyzing both the
  barriers to as well as protective factors that enable foster youth to succeed
  in their ability to grow up, become educated, and lead constructive lives as
  adults.  In fact, foster youth probably suffer from significant lags in most
  if not all of the challenge areas included in LA2050, and could benefit from
  assistance directed toward each one of these arenas.  I believe that a mentor
  would have the flexibility to be able to assist foster youth in many if not
  most of these challenges, and that if the foster youth population could be
  significantly assisted, we might see other atrisk populations become included
  into this model, with the ability to positively impact the statistics in each
  of the LA2050 challenge areas.

Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  I plan to partner with Guardian Scholars organizations at the following
  Institutions: UCLA, Los Angeles City College, Los Angeles Trade Tech Community
  College, Cal State Fullerton.  Guardian Scholars is an oncampus support
  organization to support foster youth in college.  I plan to partner with two
  state licensed clinical psychologists who have prior experience with foster
  youth, one of whom has done a great deal of consulting for Los Angeles County.
  I plan to collaborate outcome research with the University of Southern
  California, with whom I am collaborating on other outcome research related to
  the foster care system.
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  I can perform evidencedbased outcome studies to either show that virtual
  mentoring provides a statistically significant benefit to foster youth and
  their ability to complete college, or that the program does not provide the
  anticipated benefits and future funding should be directed on other types of
  programming. If outcome studies show statistically significant benefits, these
  studies can prove to be very valuable in attempting to direct government
  funding and legislative change by showing how vastly the benefits would
  outweigh the costs.






  The project will be evaluated by comparing an experimental group of foster
  youth college students who have virtual mentors to a control group of foster
  youth college students who have similar demographic characteristics who do not
  have mentors, and, controlling for various extraneous environmental
  circumstances, determine whether foster youth in college who have mentors
  exhibit statistically significant higher rates of graduation than foster
  students in college without virtual mentors.
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
  Virtual mentors can help foster youth enter and complete college, and as
  indicated in the LA2050 challenge, better education can increase prospects and
  participation in community life in all areas of the LA2050 challenge, creating
  better citizens and a better city. A myriad of resources exist to support my
  assumptions about the potential benefits of providing mentors to youth who
  lack the support and guidance of a stable family.  M.R. Munson et al. found
  that “older youth exiting foster care value having someone that maintains
  contact, stays by their side, and is simply there for them” (Munson &
  McMillen, 2009). Samuels and Pryce found that young adults more often seek
  instrumental forms of support, such as help with housing, but that their pride
  may hinder them from asking for emotional support (Griffin et al., 2011;
  Samuels, 2008). Data from this study revealed that both of these forms of
  support were perceived by the foster youth as valuable. Leadbeater & Way’s
  study on young adults  reported that they often want another person in their
  lives that will hold them accountable and set limits (Leadbeater & Way, 2001).
  Finally, the National Mentoring Partnership (2004) found that an online
  mentoring program taking place between 20022004 “bolstered mentees'
  selfesteem, literacy and future orientation.”






  Why virtual mentors? There are two main reasons. First, in reading the
  existing literature about the most established facetoface mentoring programs,
  and surveying adult peers about their potential willingness to be a mentor, it
  seems that one of the main impediments to peoples’ willingness to be a mentor
  is the expectation that the mentor commit to a regularlyscheduled, minimum
  amount of time spent with the mentee, not including travel time and having to
  juggle unexpected conflicts and the vagaries of today’s overcrowded
  lifestyles.  



  This seems to be a commitment that may feel overwhelming for the average
  bright, accomplished, busy individual who could probably REALLY help a youth
  navigate the complexities of his or her own life if the volunteer had the
  flexibility to make this commitment fit within his or her own set of
  obligations. Indeed I myself have always wanted to be a mentor or big sister
  but have always hesitated when trying to imagine myself fighting traffic to
  get to East LA by a certain time to meet a vulnerable kid waiting and
  wondering if I am going to show up and then there is an accident on the
  freeway and one of my kids’ schools calls to inform me that a kid is sick,
  etc…



  The second reason virtual mentoring makes sense is that today’s youth are
  potentially as or more comfortable with online communication as they are
  facetoface communication. Additionally, given that many foster youth have
  issues of trust and attachment, a virtual relationship may feel safer and less
  overwhelming than a traditional facetoface relationship with a stranger who
  looks like the many other adults who may have already disappointed a mentee.


What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >+
  Of the 70 % of foster youth who wish to attend and complete college, I would
  consider my program successful if a statistically significantly greater number
  of youth were able to finish college with the help of a virtual mentor than
  are able to do so today, if the model of virtual mentoring were extended
  beyond the foster care system to all atrisk populations, and if there were
  government incentives available to those willing to be virtual mentors because
  the benefit to society far outweighed the taxpayer cost of the incentive.
