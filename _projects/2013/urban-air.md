title: URBAN AIR
project_summary: >-
  Urban Air is a project that transforms existing billboards into living,
  suspended bamboo gardens.  Embedded with intelligent technology, Urban Air is
  at once a provocative artwork and a crack in the urban skyline meant to
  surprise, inform, suggest, and create a visual respite for a road weary city. 
  With a donated billboard over one of LA’s busiest freeways, the façade of the
  billboard will be removed and replaced with architecturally integrated
  planters. Imagine being stuck in traffic, channel surfing on the radio,
  nothing but billboards with advertising on the skyline, and up pops a cluster
  of suspended living bamboo with water misters creating a visual cloud forest. 
  As per artist Stephen Glassman, Urban Air is an opportunity for people to
  “look up, feel themselves as human, and conceive of what might be.”  Beginning
  with one billboard, Urban Air intends to take an infrastructure that is only
  meant for modern advertising and commerce and create something accessible,
  inspiring, and altogether different - art for art’s sake in a social, urban,
  and ecological context. Billboards right now exist mostly as visually opaque
  structures, like boarded up windows on the horizon. Urban Air transforms them
  into portals… Open windows that connect the viewers not only to the sky but
  also to their own sense of humanity, and ultimately and potentially, to other
  Urban Air billboards around the globe. Urban Air is about transforming
  structures often seen as urban blight into living metaphors. While Urban Air
  is primarily an artwork, each “green” board will also be a “hotspot” that
  measures and wirelessly communicates the comparative air quality of its
  internal microclimate relative to its surrounding area via the internet. We
  are reportedly exposed to up to 5,000 advertisements alone per day. And it has
  been said that the average city dweller is exposed to as much information in
  one day as the average Victorian was in a lifetime. When advertising is
  replaced with art, something that is purely visual and intended only to be
  looked at and experienced, we all win. Urban Air becomes a global node, an
  open space in the urban skyline intended to inspire and revitalize, at once an
  artwork, a symbol of, and an instrument for a green future.

Since then, Stephen Glassman Studio has gone on to do significant large-scale projects including a 4,000 square foot sculpture plaza at the LNR Warner Center, the Fairmont Skate Park in Salt Lake City, Utah, Arkansas’ Southeast Shear (an NEA & White House Millennium Project), the Sylvia Campuan Bridge in Bali, and more. Stephen Glassman Studio has collaborated with architects such as Sasaki, Steinberg, Miller / Hull, and Arup Engineering as a creative consultant to urban master planning, as well as in the creation of commissioned art works for large-scale projects.

Stephen Glassman Studio’s work has been collected and exhibited throughout Southern California, New York City, and internationally. The design and concept for Urban Air first received notice when it won the 2011 London International Creativity Award. As a successful Kickstarter project Urban Air went on to generate international dialogue about the nature of advertising and the role of art in communities, garnering support from over 1500 people internationally, with the film about it receiving over 150,000 downloads in 125 countries.  Urban Air has been written about in countries around the Globe including Japan, Greece, Egypt, India, China, Russia, Italy, Peru, Brazil, France, England, Taiwan, Italy, Poland, and by publications and/or programs including The Huffington Post, Wired (Italy), LA Times, National Geographic, Forbes, Dwell, Landscape Architecture, DAD (Peru), Good Magazine, NPR, KCET, The Discovery Channel and more. Urban Air is currently slated as a main stage presenting project for The NYC Green Festival this upcoming April.

  success: "The first and most important measure of success is a prominent, fully produced and realized Urban Air billboard at a significant intersection or at a major thoroughfare in Los Angeles by the end of 2013. However, its realization alone is only the beginning of the equation. As the piece is intended to be a catalyst, the impact it generates is of equal, if not greater importance. Urban Air must inspire widespread and formidable dialogue, a matrix that can be tracked to some extent through media coverage. Likewise the amount of interest and inquiry by other cities to create like projects will indicate a measure of success. As has been done to date, we will note success in the ability of Urban Air to inspire academic curriculums, generate college classes and workshops, and stimulate other professional collaborations and artistic endeavors. An important evaluation will be the goal of shifting the edges and territories of art, building, and infrastructure in the public realm.  For example, Arup Engineering is already beginning in-house conversations to explore the possibility of public building – both art and architecture – as possible creative and beautiful solutions to a greener urban future.\r\n\r\nA technical success will be in the comparative monitoring of environmental qualities. The embedded environmental sensors will be streaming to the Urban Air website, and this data stream will be available to the public. Traffic to the website, both its quantity and quality, will be easily measured.\r\n\r\nSuccess will also mean a measurable and discernable result in the culture of advertising within the city and beyond. This could include launching a potential collaboration with an advertising company or a discernable change in the aesthetics of some ad campaigns. Questions we will ask ourselves to measure success and evaluate our project will include: Did we affect a cultural change and inspire artistic and sustainable innovation in the advertising landscape? Can Urban Air inspire and begin to generate an advertising landscape that contributes to the city and serves people? Can we begin to imagine buildings and monuments that both clean the air and beautify the skyline?  As ultimately we would like to see Urban Air become a global initiative, perhaps in partnership with the Clinton C40 Initiative – a combined effort of the 40 largest cities in the world to reduce their carbon footprint by the year 2020, to generate interest and a connection with them would be an important and significant milestone. A successful Los Angeles “proof of concept” installation will open the door to all of these possibilities.\r\n\r\n"

  description: "Urban Air is a public artwork that also puts an active face on the possibility of urban sustainability. Urban Air will bring an urgency and vibrancy to the civic landscape, inspire community dialogue and action, beautify transit corridors, and ultimately connect people. Much like a modern city, bamboo is at once both vertical and horizontal.  Each culm is connected to and sustained by the others through a vast rhizome network. Like streets, mass transit, or electrical grids in a modern city, everything and everyone is connected. The health of any individual within such a system is ultimately dependent on the health of the system as a whole. Urban Air will contribute to the overall health of Los Angeles. \r\n\r\nThroughout history, art has been a vital sphere and critical element in the construct of communities. It has lived in the public realm in cave paintings, religious idols and shrines, piazza’s, monuments, and more. In the 20th century, with the privatization of culture, art moved more into the realm of institutions, museums, and private collections. The sphere of art however, still occupies critical social space. It enhances cities by contributing to commerce and helping to revitalize neighborhoods and communities. Today however, the presence and role of art is frequently replaced by advertising. Urban Air will also generate value and spectacle in the public realm, though with a different intent.  \r\n\r\nUrban Air reclaims the territory of advertising traditionally occupied by billboards, and as such directly intervenes, engages, and transforms it. Today advertising is consciously exploring its ability to generate new value. Social entrepreneurship, transparency, and sustainability are emerging as business’s new index of what matters. Likewise, the need to experience creativity “for no reason” - art for art’s sake - in daily, urban life, becomes more urgent. Urban Air takes on that action. With its ideal climate, Los Angeles is poised to become a world leader in sustainable urban culture. As an accessible work of art and a green, interconnected billboard, Urban Air will be a flag flown for both.\r\n\r\n"

  Organization Name: 'Stephen Glassman Studio '
  description3: "Stephen Glassman Studio is a studio driven fine art practice. Based in drawing, the studio is committed to a rigorous inquiry that intuitively explores concept, form, and process. The studio is engaged in the creation of large-scale national and international public art works that include architecturally integrated sculptures, civic monuments, plazas, bridges, and transit developments.  As such Stephen Glassman regularly collaborates with architects, engineers, planners, builders and more as part of his practice. Often formidable in scale, the work created by the studio extends organically from a site and is distinct in its ability to invite, generate and celebrate community. Stephen Glassman is part of a generation of public artists that have always created work on the street - art for art’s sake in a social context.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the production arena for competitive artists relies on the luxury art market galleries and museums, public percent for art funding, academia, and/or design services. Like other art studios, Stephen Glassman is active and competitive within all of these venues and on all these fronts. To a certain extent however, the notion and initiatives behind Urban Air specifically would make what might otherwise be experienced as competition, namely the creation of more Urban Air interventions and inspired billboards, be evidence of success. \r\n\r\nGlassman comes from a history of cross disciplinary collaborations - not only collaborating regularly with architects and engineers, but also with graffiti artists, circus acrobats, martial artists, bamboo workers, scientists, dancers, performers, and artists such as Perry Farrel, Philippe Petit, Jonathan Borofsky, Paris Opera, Moscow Circus, and filmmakers such as Kevin Kerslake and Catherine Hardwicke. Stephen Glassman Studio’s work and practice is the result of a lifetime of community development, dialogue, and production, and again, while to a certain extent an increase in arts related projects would be competition in all these arenas, in a much broader context it would be evidence of success.\r\n\r\nGlassman regularly engages in dialogue with other artists about the nature and platform for art in cities. Glassman’s choice to work in the public realm (circa 1992) was a choice to develop scale and social impact in his work. With regards to Urban Air specifically and other like projects from Stephen Glassman studio, Glassman will both continue to be competitive and continue his dialogue with “the competition”.\r\n\r\n"
  vision: >-
    The success of Urban Air in 2050 would look something like this:  A driver
    in LA would see a plethora of Urban Air, and Urban Air inspired
    constructions gracing the skyline. Bamboo and other living plant life would
    be integrated with art on the edifices  of the built environment. There
    would be Urban Air billboards by an array of different artists as part of
    the Clinton C40 Initiative – a combined effort of the 40 largest cities in
    the world to reduce their carbon footprint by the year 2020. These
    “greenboards” would be catalysts for the way we think, act, educate,
    advertise, and integrate both the arts and greening of our cities. There
    would be additional Urban Air or Urban Air inspired billboards in other
    cities around the globe. Many edifices around LA, as well as elsewhere,
    would be exploring the use of art as an initiative in and of itself – “art
    for arts sake” – as well as potentially for integration in socially and
    aesthetically conscious ad campaigns.  The urban advertising landscape would
    be transformed to become another layer of serviceable urban infrastructure.
    Campaigns and companies themselves would be taking a different approach to
    the use of billboards, frequently integrating environmental sensors to
    measure air quality and otherwise concerning themselves not just with
    commerce but with providing service and both integrating and communicating
    aesthetics and sustainability. Universities and schools would regularly
    offer courses studying the use of both art and sustainable concerns in
    advertising and in platforms traditionally used for advertising. Commercial
    architectural projects would integrate Urban Air inspired billboards as part
    of their initial architectural planning and design, rather than as a post
    construction after thought. Conversations and dialogue around the way we
    experience and use art, aesthetics, sustainability, technology and commerce
    would have expanded and changed significantly in ways that major cities
    approach both the integration of arts, sustainability and economy throughout
    the world, so that he human experience of living in cities would be
    significantly improved.

Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >+
  The first and most important measure of success is a prominent, fully produced
  and realized Urban Air billboard at a significant intersection or at a major
  thoroughfare in Los Angeles by the end of 2013. However, its realization alone
  is only the beginning of the equation. As the piece is intended to be a
  catalyst, the impact it generates is of equal, if not greater importance.
  Urban Air must inspire widespread and formidable dialogue, a matrix that can

  territories of art, building, and infrastructure in the public realm.  For
  example, Arup Engineering is already beginning inhouse conversations to
  explore the possibility of public building — both art and architecture — as
  possible creative and beautiful solutions to a greener urban future.






  A technical success will be in the comparative monitoring of environmental
  qualities. The embedded environmental sensors will be streaming to the Urban
  Air website, and this data stream will be available to the public. Traffic to
  the website, both its quantity and quality, will be easily measured.






  Success will also mean a measurable and discernable result in the culture of
  advertising within the city and beyond. This could include launching a
  potential collaboration with an advertising company or a discernable change in
  the aesthetics of some ad campaigns. Questions we will ask ourselves to
  measure success and evaluate our project will include: Did we affect a
