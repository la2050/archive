title: Professional women Step Up to help underserved teen girls graduate
indicator: ' Education'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  The goal of Step Up’s Teen Empowerment Programs is for girls to graduate
  highschool confident, collegebound and careerready.  Our partner schools focus
  on the IQ: the reading, writing and arithmetic.  We focus on the EQ: the
  emotional and social skills they need to be successful and break the cycle of
  poverty. Built into our afterschool and Saturday programming are elements that
  address barriers to success such as a lack of parental involvement and support
  at home, the disconnect between the relevance of schoolwork to ‘the real
  world’, negative peer pressure, lack of positive role models and lack of
  confidence. By taking a more holistic approach to the needs of our teen girls
  we are succeeding in partnership with schools where schools alone are
  failing.  Step Up’s proven programs directly impact high school completion and
  dropout rates, college going rates and afterschool enrichment program
  participation. 


    


  Our model is unique.  Girls are introduced to many different mentors and role
  models, not just one.  If a 9th grade girl is interested in becoming a doctor
  we can introduce her to one.  By 10th grade she may be thinking she wants to
  be a writer, a psychologist or a talk show host (or all three!).  Step Up has
  that covered.  Not only are we able to introduce our girls to the women who
  have the careers they are interested in, we introduce them to the companies as
  well.  They get to experience what it is like to be on the inside.  Providing
  a tangible, attainable vision for the future is a powerful tool keeping our
  girls in school and motivated to go to college. 






  The professional women in our network are there all four years of highschool
  as classroom volunteers, hosts for field trips to their offices, providing
  internships and as mentors.  Our group mentoring model enables busy
  professional women who cannot commit to longterm mentoring relationships to
  leverage their personal and professional resources on behalf of the girls in
  our community in an accessible way.  This keeps the women, and their
  companies, engaged.  






  9th and 10th Grade Confidence Building Program



  9th and 10th grade classes are taught after school, oneday per week.  This
  curriculum offers 30 weeks of afterschool programming per grade and is
  designed to offer girls a solid foundation in life skills that will build
  their confidence. Created by internationally renowned confidence expert, Jess
  Weiner, the curriculum is jam packed with confidence boosting activities that
  also ground the students in career and college prep. Rooted in a multi
  disciplinary approach of team work, creative selfexpression, group exercises,
  and open dialogue  students use their real life experiences to explore issues
  of identity, action, vision, voice, and expression.  The 9th grade class
  focuses on Identity, Relationships and Voice.  The 10th grade class focuses on
  Vision, Action and Expression.  









  11th Grade Career and College Exploration: Pathways to Professions



  Pathways to Professions is Step Up’s program aimed at jumpstarting high school
  girls’ careerexploration by providing invaluable firsthand exposure to a
  variety of industries and strong professional female role models. Step Up
  takes girls on field trips to companies and collaborates with each host to
  create dynamic, meaningful activities for students such as tours, roleplaying
  and panel discussions. The program aims to instill greater professional
  confidence in Step Up teens.  We leverage the reach of our professional women
  members to secure field trips to companies in a variety of industries from
  tech to publishing to banking to entertainment.  After the field trips, the
  girls are led through critical thinking exercises about what they’ve
  experienced with the help of our membermentors.  Students attend at least five
  field trips throughout the year and meet one Saturday per month. Saturday
  workshops cover multiple college preparation topics utilizing our professional
  women mentors.






  12th Grade College and Career Preparation: Young Luminaries



  This  program is aimed at supporting Step Up seniors as they apply to and make
  their transition to college.  Utilizing a group mentoring model, mentees and
  mentors attend a workshop one Saturday per month. In the fall semester the
  program focuses on support through the college application process. In the
  spring semester the program focuses on preparing students for summer
  internships at Step Up member companies.  Topics include resume writing, cover
  letters, professional etiquette, dressing for success, mock interviews and
  more.  






  All students meeting Step Up’s internship criteria are matched with a company
  for a six week paid summer internship.  These internships help girls from
  socioeconomically disadvantaged communities level the playing field by
  building their resume and exposing them to powerful networks of professionals
  that can provide recommendations to college and references for job
  opportunities. 
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >+
  Step Up is proud that since beginning Teen Empowerment Programs in 2006 we
  have worked with nearly 700 underserved teen girls. For the past three years,
  100% of Step Up seniors graduated from high school and were accepted to a
  college of their choice.






  In addition, after participating in Step Up:



  * 80% of students felt comfortable speaking in public, as compared to 60%
  before



  * 75% felt they had  gained strong college and career role models



  * 80% felt they understood the college admissions process, as compared to 60%
  before



  * 85% felt informed about career options, as compared to 65% before



  * 90% felt they understood and felt comfortable networking professionally, as
  compared to 50% before






  Here are some stories of our girls that help bring these successes to life. 






  Kayla, Class of 2013: “Step Up has shaped who I am today. I’ve learned to
  speak my mind and become an independent woman and a leader. After graduation,
  I plan to go on to college and continue my journey, to try out all of the
  great things that the world has to offer me. I would definitely encourage
  other girls to join Step Up. Step Up is a family you build, and it will only
  make you stronger.”






  Yosselin, Kenyan College Class of 2015: At 10 years old, Yosselin left El
  Salvador to join her mother in Los Angeles and a troublesome period of her
  life began. She was skipping a lot of school and got involved with a gang. She
  turned a corner her freshman year of high school when she joined Step Up.
  Through Step Up, she was able to imagine a better life for herself for the
  first time. “My best moment with Step Up has been interviewing Jane Wurwand,
  founder of Dermalogica, and having been able to visit her office and see her
  in action, running her company. This is when I realized that school was very
  important and I had to get serious. In 9th grade, Step Up not only became my
  escape, it became my new family. It has been the influence of so many strong
  successful women that have kept me working hard. It has been the Step Up
  college tours, internships, and my Step Up mentors that have helped me
  envision the future I know now I am capable of achieving. Through Step Up, I
  discovered my passion for writing and my potential to thrive in college.”






  Ja’Nai, Gettysburg College Class of 2016 “By participating in Step Up they
  taught me all about the business world and what I needed to do to be
  successful in it. In addition, it taught me exactly what my working style is
  and helped guide me in my search of what career I may want to pursue in the
  future by providing me with several exceptional mentors who are successful
  businesswoman. Through this program I was also able to obtain an internship at
  The JAR Group. I want to be a writer when I get older so my internship really
  helps me exercise my skills, since I spend most of my time finding content and
  sampling copies to go along with it. The Step Up program has given me the
  opportunity to have a voice.”

Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: "In a 2011 evaluation of our programs, we interviewed educators including administrators as well as academic subject teachers at our partner schools. 100% of those interviewed said that they would recommend Step Up programs to the girls in their classes.  Step Up teens exhibit qualities of inquisitiveness, independence, resilience and an ability to express themselves that make them stand out.  Educators shared with us that they have confidence that these girls will go on to college and be successful.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith pro bono support from Deloitte consulting and input from Step Up staff, our alumnae and school partners we developed 11 key outcomes (and indicators of behaviors which demonstrate progress toward those outcomes) that represent the confident, collegebound and careerready young women we want our Step Up teens to become.  Our curriculum (outlined above) is specifically designed to achieve these outcomes. \n\n\n\n\n\nStep Up measures programmatic success through various tools including number of students in the program, attendance, retention, the results of pre and post surveys administered to teen girls, and soliciting feedback from members and teen girls.  During the first three weeks of the program, Step Up administers presurveys to students.  The students take the same post survey at the end of the school year. The aim of these surveys is to measure the 11 key outcomes including the impact the program has had on the student and a change in overall habits.  \n\n\n\n\n\nProgram Objectives:\n\n\nPercentage of seniors graduating high school  90%\n\n\nPercentage of seniors accepted to college  90%\n\n\nPre and PostProgramming Survey Results:   \t\n\n\nPercentage of girls reporting they feel more confident in themselves as a student\t75%\n\n\nPercentage of girls reporting an increased comfort level in taking on tough school assignments\t75%\n\n\nPercentage of girls reporting an increased ability to complete school assignments well and on time\t75%\n\n\nPercentage of girls reporting an increased ability to solve problems with limited guidance\t75%\n\n\nPercentage of girls reporting an increased comfort level when making a presentation in class\t75%\n\n\nPercentage of girls reporting an increase in comfort level when interacting with and adults \t75%\n\n\nPercentage of girls reporting an increase in ability to be a strong teammate on group projects\t75%\n\n\nPercentage of girls reporting an increased comfort in building trusting relationships with adults\t75%\n\n\nPercentage of girls reporting an increased comfort level in speaking in class\t75%\n\n\nPercentage of girls reporting an increase in feeling positive about themselves \t75%\n\n\nPercentage of girls reporting an increased ability to accept constructive feedback\t75%\n\n\nPercentage of girls reporting that Step Up made them aware of new career possibilities \t75%\n\n\nPercentage of girls reporting feeling more prepared to choose the college that’s right for them\t75%\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n"
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
  By yearend 2013 Step Up will serve at least 230 female students in grades nine
  through 12 in lowincome and underserved neighborhoods in the city of Los
  Angeles who attend four of our partner Title 1 schools. Ninety percent of
  these students are eligible for the federal lunch program, meaning that the
  students and their families live at or below the federal poverty level, which
  is how Step Up defines lowincome. 






  The ethnic makeup of our students is 2% AfricanAmerican, 7% Asian, 84% Latina,
  4% multiracial and 2% Did Not Report. 






  In addition:



  *        Over 85% of their primary home languages are not English. 



  *        Less than 50% of Step Up girls' parents or guardians have a high
  school diploma.



  *        98% of Step Up teens do not have a parent who attended college.






  We are open to all girls at our partner schools.  There is no GPA
  requirement.  Often our girls are those at the middle to bottom of the pack
  who lack a cohesive social group.  But they have an inner drive that gets them
  in the door.  Once in Step Up we’re able to ignite their potential.    



  The impact of lowincome, minority youth graduating high school and attending
  college is documented well by statistics.  But what is not always captured is
  the ripple effect on the community.  Many of our girls have younger siblings. 
  They are acutely aware that their success models a new way of life for their
  family.  They know that they are trailblazing in their communities and that
  other kids are watching.  You can’t be what you can’t see.  Our professional
  women serve as role models for our girls.  The girls then serve as role models
  for their peer group and help set higher expectations for the next
  generation.  


What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >+
  In 37 years another generation of young people will grow up here in Los
  Angeles.  Their communities will offer a stronger base of support, a
  highquality education system, stronger local economy and an engaged community
  that operates in a spirit of collaboration rather than competition.  Our
  public education system will be a source of pride that prepares kids to not
  only be ready to work and contribute to the economy, but will take a holistic
  view of youth as people with unlimited potential.  






  Step Up envisions that the teen girls served by Step Up’s network of
  professional women today will be serving as the mentors and role models for
  that next generation of Step Up teens.  A Step Up teen in 2050 will have a
  large national network of women and companies ready to open their doors for a
  mentorship experience, internship, a job.   Step Up women will be the CEOs of
  Fortune 500 companies, Senators (or perhaps President of the United States),
  and influencers in all industries that believe in the power of community
  partnerships and investments in education and workforce development.  Step Up
  will be an attitude, not just an organization.
