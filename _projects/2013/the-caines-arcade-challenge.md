title: The Caines Arcade Challenge
indicator: ' Education'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  <p>10,000 children in Los Angeles will start their 2013 school year by
  participating in the Caine’s Arcade Challenge. Hosted by the Imagination
  Foundation and inspired by the short film, “Caine’s Arcade,” this Challenge
  will foster creativity and celebrate the imagination of children by inviting
  elementary and middle schoolaged youth to design and build fun and engaging
  arcade games made from cardboard, recycled materials and imagination.</p>






  <p>“Caine’s Arcade” has been widely cited as one of the most inspirational
  stories of 2012. The film has received nearly 8 million views, trended
  worldwide on Twitter, gathered a Facebook community of 130,000+ fans, and
  inspired a wave of cardboard creativity in backyards and classrooms across the
  globe.</p>






  <p>During the month of September, children participating in the Caine’s Arcade
  Challenge will design and build cardboard arcades in schools all over the
  Southland; then on October 5th, commemorating the flashmob that came out to
  make Caine’s day in the short film, communities will come together and play.
  On this day, the “Day of Play,” children will operate their arcades to raise
  money to support various local causes, practicing the value of social
  entrepreneurship. And adults will learn the simple things they can do to
  foster a child’s creativity.</p>






  <p>Though focused on Los Angeles, the Caine’s Arcade Challenge will coincide
  with our Global Cardboard Challenge that will take place in 70 countries and
  serve 1 million children. Our first Global Cardboard Challenge was in 2012 and
  included a unique range of participants  from a school district in Texas to an
  EcoArt Park in Uganda, from Adobe Offices in San Francisco to the Warehouse
  Project in Sri Lanka. Kids repurposed cardboard into games, toys, robots and
  spaceships  whatever they could imagine. Along the way they learned about
  teamwork, problem solving, creativity and the value of recycling. Watch
  footage from last year’s Challenge at: www.imagination.is/gcc_videos.</p>






  <p>The Caine’s Arcade Challenge will provide thousands of children in Los
  Angeles a crash course in creativity and social entrepreneurship. 500 teachers
  will learn effective projectbased learning inspired by the Caine’s Arcade
  story, and thousands of members of the Los Angeles community will come out to
  play at cardboard arcades built by kids.</p>






  <p>During the Challenge, student participants will be part of a projectbased
  learning environment of unprecedented scale that inspires invention and makes
  leaning fun. Students will engage in a simple process that develops
  creativity, and along the way, they will learn: Design Thinking, Math and
  Financial LIteracy, Engineering, Social Entrepreneurship and the value of
  Recycling. Where appropriate, all content standards will be aligned to the
  Common Core.</p>






  <p>Student learning will occur in a uniquely connected environment as children
  from Los Angeles will have opportunities to showcase their work along with
  children participating in the Global Challenge in other countries. Some
  classes will Skype with other classes as far away as Costa Rica, Uganda and
  Bali. Many of the classes participating in the Challenge will take field trips
  to the actual Caine’s Arcade site in Boyle Heights for handson inspiration and
  real world connection.</p>






  <p>The Challenge is designed as follows:


   A 24 week projectbased learning curriculum, conducted in the month of September, derived from the “Caine’s Arcade” short film, and aimed at fostering creative thinking and social entrepreneurship.


   Field trips to the Caine’s Arcade site in Boyle Heights to enhance the learning experience and inspire participants.


   The “Day of Play” on October 5 when children will operate their cardboard arcades and raise money for various local causes.


   Professional development for teacher participants during August.


   A Caine’s Arcade community website will showcase the Challenges, locate the arcades, and capture an expansive catalogue of content uploaded by Challenge participants.</p>





  <p>About the Imagination Foundation:



  The mission of the Imagination Foundation is to find, foster and fund
  creativity and entrepreneurship in children around the world to raise a new
  generation of innovators and problem solvers who have the tools they need to
  build the world they imagine.</p>






  <p>We accomplish our mission by building a worldwide movement that celebrates
  imagination and fosters creativity. To fuel this movement, we produce and
  amplify inspirational stories of creative children, orchestrate largescale
  events, campaigns and challenges, and grow an ecosystem of rich content to
  equip teachers, parents and communities everywhere with the tools and
  knowledge they need to develop child creativity.</p>
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  <p>On the last day of summer, through a chance encounter, filmmaker Nirvan
  Mullick met Caine Monroy, a 9yearold boy who built an elaborate cardboard
  arcade inside his dad’s East LA auto parts shop. Nirvan was Caine’s first
  customer. Amazed by the boy’s creativity, Nirvan organized a flash mob of
  customers to surprise Caine and make his day. Then he made a film about
  it.</p>






  <p>The Imagination Foundation is a new organization, but is rapidly becoming
  the leader of a worldwide movement to foster creativity, imagination and
  entrepreneurship in children.  The film that launched the Imagination
  Foundation, “Caine’s Arcade,” has been widely cited as one of the most
  inspirational stories of 2012. The film has received nearly 8 million views,
  trended worldwide on Twitter, gathered a Facebook community of 130,000+ fans,
  and inspired a wave of cardboard creativity in backyards and classrooms across
  the globe. The Christian Science Monitor calls the film a “great American
  story,” and Wired Magazine writes, “It’s a sweet story that brings viewers
  back to a time of potent imagination and creativity.”</p>






  <p>Our first Global Cardboard Challenge took place in October 2012, with
  thousands of participants in 41 countries on six continents.</p>
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  <p>As a largescale community event, the Caine’s Arcade Challenge will engage
  numerous stakeholders, including schools, districts, charter management
  organizations, community groups, colleges and universities, businesses,
  nonprofit organizations, government and elected offices, and general members
  of the Los Angeles community.</p> 






  <p>Trash for Teaching will be able to provide recycled materials. Skype  in
  the Classroom will help connect classes here in Los Angeles with classes in
  other parts of the world.</p>






  <p>Media partners, such as YouTube, will promote and feature Challenge
  activities.</p>
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  <p>The success of the Caine’s Arcade Challenge will be measured by multiple
  factors, including: those that demonstrate the level and degree of
  participation in the Challenge; those that demonstrate the level of school
  engagement and attitudes toward school; those that demonstrate mastery of key
  standards related to creative thinking, problem solving and social
  entrepreneurship; and those that demonstrate mastery of STEMrelated content
  (such as math and engineering).</p>






  <p>The scale of the Challenge is critical to its success, so we will track the
  number of participants across four major groups: children, teachers, schools
  and general members of the community who will attend the Day of Play at local
  cardboard arcades in their area.</p>






  <p>Success will also be measured by the amount of money raised by children
  operating their cardboard arcades on October 5, the Day of Play.</p>






  <p>The quality and amount of online content uploaded during the time period of
  the Challenge will be carefully tracked and managed to ensure an expansive web
  catalogue of Challenge activities. Built on top of a simple and robust open
  source platform, this website will register Challenge participants, provide
  participant content feeds for uploading and sharing relevant material, show
  the various cardboard arcade locations, and handle RSVP’s for local Day of
  Play events.</p>






  <p>Surveys to assess teacher satisfaction will be completed online.</p>






  <p>An assessment administered by teachers through a short online question bank
  will measure the proficiency of student participants with regard to
  appropriate Common Core standards outlined in the Caine’s Arcade curriculum,
  as well as unique standards that demonstrate an increase in creative thinking,
  Social Emotional Learning, and attitudes toward school.</p>
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  We envision a city in which creativity is a core social value and a critical
  skill developed in every child; where the innate passion, curiosity and
  creativity of children is nurtured in schools, homes and communities
  everywhere; where all children are taught to be creative thinkers and doers,
  and encouraged to make their very best ideas happen in the world.






  The Caine’s Arcade Challenge will celebrate and develop the creativity and
  social entrepreneurship of children on a grand scale throughout the Southland.
  The Challenge will also showcase the role adults can play in fostering these
  traits. Specifically, the Challenge will engage 10,000 children, 500 teachers,
  100 schools, building over 100 cardboard arcades, and raising over $25,000 for
  local charitable causes.






  Student participants will become more creative, more entrepreneurial and more
  empathetic. Teacher participants will become more proficient at projectbased
  learning and more networked to each other locally and globally. Other adult
  participants who attend events on the Day of Play will learn about the simple
  things they can do to foster creativity in children. The scale of the event
  will raise public awareness about the value of creativity.






  Over the course of the Challenge, projectbased learning and social
  entrepreneurship will proliferate throughout the city. A website designed for
  the Challenge will capture content from the various participants: photos,
  videos, lesson plans, activity kits, blogs and other content will showcase the
  ingenuity of students and their teachers, and become sources for inspiration
  and the mass proliferation of projectbased learning beyond the scope of the
  Challenge itself.
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >+
  In 2050, creativity will be a core social value and a critical skill fostered
  and developed in every school and community.  Creativity will be as
  fundamental to the education of our children as literacy, and schools will be
  designed accordingly. In 2050, we will have a thriving network of "Imagination
  Chapters" throughout LA County, and every school and community center will
  have devoted space for children to discover their passions and practice
  building the things they imagine. Angelenos  young and old  will face the
  challenges of our city with optimism, invention and creativity.
