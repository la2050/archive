title: 'Neighbor to Neighbor: Connecting Los Angeles Through Storytelling'
project_summary: >-
  One of the best ways to connect people is through storytelling. In September
  of 2013, we will launch a 24-hour collaborative filmmaking project that
  connects diverse populations and neighborhoods of Los Angeles. The theme of
  the project is “local heroes” and each team will discover, document, and share
  inspiring stories of the community. 15 filmmaking teams will be assembled that
  consist of three novice filmmakers from underserved communities, three
  professional filmmakers (mentors), and six to ten volunteers. Each team will
  be diverse in age, race/ethnicity, and sexual orientation. Moreover, each
  project will take place in a different neighborhood, with the goal of
  occupying as many unique areas of Los Angeles as possible. Prior to shooting
  the film, the team will work with community-based organizations to discover
  stories of local heroes and to build support for the project. The teams will
  have a month to develop relationships, but only one day to actually shoot and
  edit the film. At the end of the 24-hour period, the films will be screened
  first to the community, then as a complete program at a special event, and
  finally they’ll live online and will be pushed out via a social networking
  campaign. Prizes will be given to the most impactful film, greatest number of
  volunteers engaged, and best team cooperation.

  success: >-
    In the short term, we will measure success by the number of volunteers who
    participate, the number of films that are completed, how well the teams work
    together, and how many community members were engaged to complete the
    projects. In the long term, we’ll look at how many of the participants in
    the project continued in volunteer service at Outfest or another non-profit
    organization, how many people got more engaged in their neighborhood or
    community, how many underserved people became engaged in filmmaking or
    storytelling as a result of this project, and how many people used the
    skills they learned in the project to get work. Ideally, this project will
    continue annually and will build stronger and deeper relationships within
    neighborhoods every year.

    Outfest has over 80 community partners that we work with through our film
    festivals that include The Wall La Memorias Project, Jovenes Inc., Satrang,
    AIDS Project Los Angeles, Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, Gay-Straight
    Alliance Network (GSA Network), Planned Parenthood Los Angeles, The Trevor
    Project, The Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center, and The Community Rights
    Campaign. We will work with many of these organizations, specifically those
    who are neighborhood and/or community specific. In addition, we will engage
    neighborhood councils, such as the Historic Highland Park Neighborhood
    Council, who has been a key collaborator in a recent neighborhood based
    Outfest program.

    Founded by UCLA students in 1982, Outfest is the leading organization that
    promotes equality by creating, sharing, and protecting LGBT (Lesbian, Gay,
    Bisexual and Transgender) stories on the screen. Outfest builds community by
    connecting diverse populations to discover, discuss, and celebrate stories
    of LGBT lives. Over the past three decades, Outfest has showcased thousands
    of films from around the world to audiences of nearly a million, educated
    and mentored hundreds of emerging filmmakers, and protected more than 20,000
    LGBT films and videos. In addition, Outfest produces one of the largest film
    festivals in Southern California, the only LGBT people of color film
    festival, three filmmaking programs using mentors, and we have over 400
    volunteers who participate in our programs. 
  vision: "In 2050, Los Angeles neighborhoods will have actively engaged residents, who not only know their neighbors, but they know their neighbor’s histories and stories, as well as their local heroes. Community members will understand the issues that affect their neighborhoods, collaborate in uplifting the Los Angeles region, and participate in local government. The result of this connection and involvement is that all neighborhoods will have affordable housing, jobs within a 30-minute commute, and access to parks, arts, and culture. \r\n\r\nOur project, Neighbor to Neighbor: Connecting Los Angeles Through Storytelling, contributes to this picture of success by connecting people to each other through community-based collaborative storytelling and volunteerism. By working on a project together people will get to know each other, develop common bonds, become involved in their community and invested in making Los Angeles a better place to live for everyone. "
