title: First Star UCLA Bruin Guardian Scholars Academy
indicator: ' Education'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  Less than 3% of Foster Youth go on to earn a Bachelors Degree, despite the
  fact that it is their best ladder out of awful childhoods of abuse or neglect.
  We request your support in dramatically improving the statistic. Please
  support the First Star UCLA Bruin Guardian Scholars Academy, our scalable
  college prep program for foster youth, that provides a 45 week summer
  residential component, monthly followup meetings, and additional online and
  other fullyear enablements. With a comprehensive focus on education,
  psychosocial functioning and selfsufficiency, the Academy program offers
  transformative tools and support throughout high school, so that these youth
  enter and succeed in college and beyond.



  Our Foster Youth Academies, now operating in Los Angeles, CA, Rhode Island and
  the greater Washington, DC area, are inspiring, challenging and equipping
  foster youth in grades 8 through 10 for success in college and beyond.
  Students who remain in good standing are invited to continue in the Academy
  program — summer residential sessions, monthly workshop days, and our
  protected students’ social media site — each year through high school
  graduation. With the enthusiastic support of local publicprivate partnerships,
  including child welfare agencies and public schools, we have launched these
  three Academies in two years. To launch and operate Academies around the
  country, additional publicprivate partnerships are at work at six additional
  campuses across the nation.
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  Our series of groundbreaking Report Cards — which measure and compare how each
  state provides protection to maltreated children within the framework of its
  state law — have educated untold numbers of Americans about essential
  legislative, legal and policy developments. They have become the gold standard
  arbiter of policy and legislation and now greatly influence lawmakers, the
  judiciary and CPS agencies on a running basis. Over time have seen states’
  grades improve, showing that the Report Cards are fueling statelevel
  improvements. The Children’s Advocacy Institute, Center for Public Interest
  Law at the University of San Diego School of Law is a treasured partner in
  developing and disseminating the Report Cards nationwide.



  We convene Congressional Forums, held in the U.S. Capitol, where lawmakers and
  their staffs are invited to learn about the latest Report Cards and to
  dialogue with experts in the field on child abuse, dependency courts, foster
  care, and child protective services. The discussions provide guidance and
  feedback on pertinent policy areas. They also provide a rare opportunity for
  youth who have experienced Foster Care to speak directly to government, face
  to face.

Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  UCLA, our University partner, is intimately involved in design and
  implementation of the program and has been since its inception. First Star and
  UCLA work together to develop curriculum, identify educators, course selection
  etc. The program’s formal evaluation team comes from the UCLA Graduate School
  of Education & Information Studies, and they have been instrumental in
  developing the logic model for the program.






  We've also collaborated with the Department of Children and Family Services,
  the LA County Board of Supervisors, the Alliance for Children's Rights, United
  Friends of the Children and the Bruin Guardian Scholars for participant
  recruitment, county support, legal assistance, tutoring and peer counselor
  support respectively. 
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  Indicators for education outcomes include: 1) high school grade point averages
  from one high school semester to the next, 2) successful completion of
  appropriate high school courses and examinations, 3) improved knowledge of the
  processes for entering postsecondary education, 4) an understanding of the
  linkage between education and success, 5), development of a commitment to
  learning, 6) development of career awareness, interests, and aptitudes, 7)
  investigation and analysis of different career paths to inform future
  decisionmaking, and 8) development of job search, application, and
  interviewing skills.



  Indicators for psychosocial functioning outcomes include students’ development
  and demonstrated use of: 1) negotiation and persuasion skills, 2) mentor
  relationships, 3) positive peertopeer relationships, 4) positive adultyouth
  relationships, 5) social supports, 6) external supports, 7) understanding and
  appreciation of diversity, 8) commitment to service and advocacy, 9)
  selfawareness, including selfreflection, 10) selfesteem, and 11) emotional
  selfregulation skills.



  Indicators for selfsufficiency outcomes include students’ development of: 1)
  problem solving skills, including adaptability to life transitions, 2)
  selfadvocacy skills, 3) the ability to use time constructively, 4) life
  skills, including financial literacy, resource management, the ability to
  identify transitional living opportunities, and emancipation, and 5) healthy
  habits, such as engaging in health promoting activities (e.g., hygiene,
  healthy diet, disease prevention).



  We track and monitor all indicators of progress with the assistance of the
  Social Research Methodology Evaluation Group (an independent evaluation team
  affiliated with UCLA). The SRM Evaluation Group has implemented a mixed
  methods approach with both quantitative and qualitative data collected from
  students’ public school records and report cards, surveys, regular interviews,
  focus groups, observations, and social service agency case files. Data is
  collected, analyzed, and reported throughout the program, generally during
  three periods — the fall and spring semesters of each academic year and in the
  summer, during the oncampus, residential immersion component.  Our results
  will inform programming for the next year of operations (summer oncampus
  immersion and monthly followup meetings until the students graduate from high
  school. In addition, our progress, challenges and lessons learned are
  informing the implementation of other First Star Foster Youth Academies around
  the country (those already operating in Rhode Island and the Washington, DC
  area and others in development).
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
  Our project will benefit Los Angeles by addressing the abysmal educational
  outcomes for the foster youth population of Los Angeles, the largest in the
  nation. 






  Current outcomes for foster youth in Los Angeles are dismal. After leaving
  foster care, approximately 64 percent of young men experience incarceration ,
  and approximately 60 percent of young women become pregnant by age 20 , and 24
  percent of these young people will have experienced homelessness , creating a
  repetitive generational cycle of chaos, poverty and poor outcomes that are
  expensive in both human and fiscal terms.  Of the approximately 5,200 youth
  who age out of foster care every year in California, the cost to the state,
  counties and cities is estimated to be over $165MM per year for those that are
  incarcerated, become homeless, and/or pregnant. See Appendix V.






  On average in Los Angeles County, only 50 percent of foster youth graduate
  from high school , far underperforming the average of 70 percent among youth
  not involved in the foster care system . Furthermore, only 3 percent graduate
  2 or 4 year college , even though over 70 percent express a desire to
  participate in higher education.  A study of dropouts by UCSB calculates that
  for each youth that drops out of high school in California, the economic loss
  over their lifetime is estimated to be $386,666 per youth. 


What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  In the year 2050 we hope to have changed the face of foster education in this
  nation.  






  We hope to have First Star Academies operating on university campuses across
  the nation. When a University President is asked what they do at their
  University they will have a three pronged answer; 1) educate undergraduates
  and graduate students 2) conduct research 3) do our part to ensure the nations
  foster youth are able to gain admission to and obtain a college education.
