  Indicator: ' Social Connectedness'
  brief: "<p>Imagine a stronger, more connected South LA. This vision means more resident participation, deeper connections between community members, and greater collaboration amongst community organizations. The road to this vision of Los Angeles relies on strengthening and supporting the entities that are designed to bring people together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are working with a group of non-profits to create a hub for capacity building using the talents and strengths of nine veteran organizations who have worked in the field.  By finding new roles for these veteran leaders and managers in South LA, we create pathways for emerging leaders, increase earned income for the nonprofits by providing consulting and technical assistance to their peers and strengthen social connection through these interactions. Our goal is to fortify the nonprofit infrastructure in a part of LA that is underserved in order to see a stronger movement towards civic engagement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Capacity building and technical assistance support is a $2billion industry in the US led by consultants and for-profit management service agencies (Foundation Center).  By coalescing nonprofit organizations in South LA and establishing a physical space for these leaders and managers to crowdsource, our model will increase collaborative efforts and result in healthier nonprofit organizations. The hub model conserves resources by promoting strategic partnerships and assist organizations in developing business plans, exchanging skills and knowledge, breaking their isolation and adding more focus to their individual efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Envision a place in South LA bustling with small groups of nonprofit leaders collaborating to share ideas and spark innovation. Imagine a hub for peer learning that is available to members in Spanish and English, with sessions led not by external experts, but by people in the community that leaders can relate to. Here nonprofit managers can bring their questions on the difficult to navigate financial statements, for example, and receive one-on-one support from a peer organization trained and verified as having skill within this topic of interest. This mentor organization will serve as an ongoing point of contact for resource sharing between the two agencies. Both organizations participate in peer-led sessions on community mobilization strategies while gaining partners in day-to-day challenges of managing an organization as well as allies in the movement to engage communities. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Different than other collaborative models already at work in South LA and Boyle Heights, this effort works specifically build capacity within organizations versus creating a campaign or agenda. Our goal is to provide tools to organizations so that they might be more effective and connected to others when engaging in work of their own. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the support of LA2050, we will take the first step in creating this environment. By December 31, 2013 we will design this buh-like model and launch a series of ‘Peer-led Consulting Convenings’ to engage at least 100 South LA organizations in peer-led capacity building support around their pressing management challenges. This effort requires the identification and training of nine veteran nonprofits with demonstrated skill in civic engagement work and internal management. At least 30 participating organizations will benefit from one-one-one consulting support from the veteran leaders. Through the convenings, these trained veterans will offer free, high-quality consulting to their peers, building a stronger network of capable community engagement organizations within the nonprofit landscape. In turn, these organizations will be more resilient and better equipped to lead Los Angeles towards a new era of greater connectedness.</p>"

  description: "With the city’s massive physical landscape, our slow move towards an integrated public transit system, and the fast-paced lifestyle many of us lead, it’s not easy for Angelenos to connect with one another. Without mechanisms to facilitate interactions, or organizations ready with the skills, strategies and tactics to effectively encourage public engagement, Los Angeles will have more of the same fragmented, often unengaged communities. Our goal is to build up Los Angeles organizations that focus on civic engagement, voter turn-out, neighborhood-based advocacy, and local community building to change this. \r\n\r\nWith stronger, more collaborative, and strategic community organizations, Los Angeles residents will receive better services, become more informed, and find new pathways to participate in community. In time, this means higher voter turnout, greater civic discourse, heightened community collaboration, and new organizations and campaigns coming from the ground up. These neighborhood based initiatives would be made of people with skills to tackle almost any issue – from crime and violence prevention to low-performing schools and public health. \r\n\r\nUCLA’s Luskin Center for Public Affairs’ report on the state of non-profit organizations in Los Angeles County found an extreme service gap in low-income communities – nonprofits exist in the lowest numbers in poor neighborhoods. This means that, at present day, the people in Los Angeles who have the least support are those who essentially need it the most. Our focus on South Los Angeles represents a desire to reverse the service gap by strengthening the organizations that already exist so that they might more effectively engage Angelenos. The regional emphasis also represents our long-term commitment to serving underserved communities of color. We strongly believe that the South Los Angeles Hub is the first step in designing an engagement model that can be replicated city-wide.\r\n"

    In this work we may be in competition with other Management Service
    Organizations and consulting groups that work with community based
    nonprofits. By encouraging a shift in the model that puts organizations as
    the lead source of knowledge and consultation support – we in effect, move
    business away from the more traditional providers of capacity building
    support and nonprofit technical assistance. In this regard, ‘capacity
    building,’ or the work of providing services to build skills and address
    organizational challenges, is estimated to be a $2 billion industry
    primarily fueled by philanthropic organizations and government. In many ways
    we have seen first-hand how this industry creates a fragile non-profit
    infrastructure within marginalized communities as these well-intended
    strategies often leave agencies dependent  on expensive external parties for
    their own growth and development. In many ways, the model we propose reduces
    costs and has potential to yield more durable results than traditional
    models with which we compete. 
  vision: >-
    We could be described as friendly antagonists. Certainly we have a history
    and track record of cooperation and collaboration with the efforts of other
    management service organizations. We have learned from them and engaged in
    thought partnership with them. Our efforts in many ways complement theirs
    and have caused them to step up their efforts in areas like
    culturally-competent capacity building and deconstructing racism as a factor
    that perpetuates poverty and injustices.

  UCLA’s Luskin Center for Public Affairs’ report on the state of nonprofit
  organizations in Los Angeles County found an extreme service gap in lowincome
  communities — nonprofits exist in the lowest numbers in poor neighborhoods.
  This means that, at present day, the people in Los Angeles who have the least
  support are those who essentially need it the most. Our focus on South Los
  Angeles represents a desire to reverse the service gap by strengthening the
  organizations that already exist so that they might more effectively engage
  Angelenos. The regional emphasis also represents our longterm commitment to
  serving underserved communities of color. We strongly believe that the South
