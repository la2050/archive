title: 'The South LA Hub: Strengthening Nonprofits in South Los Angeles '
indicator: ' Social Connectedness'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  <p>Imagine a stronger, more connected South LA. This vision means more
  resident participation, deeper connections between community members, and
  greater collaboration amongst community organizations. The road to this vision
  of Los Angeles relies on strengthening and supporting the entities that are
  designed to bring people together.</p>






  <p>We are working with a group of nonprofits to create a hub for capacity
  building using the talents and strengths of nine veteran organizations who
  have worked in the field.  By finding new roles for these veteran leaders and
  managers in South LA, we create pathways for emerging leaders, increase earned
  income for the nonprofits by providing consulting and technical assistance to
  their peers and strengthen social connection through these interactions. Our
  goal is to fortify the nonprofit infrastructure in a part of LA that is
  underserved in order to see a stronger movement towards civic engagement.</p>






  <p>Capacity building and technical assistance support is a $2billion industry
  in the US led by consultants and forprofit management service agencies
  (Foundation Center).  By coalescing nonprofit organizations in South LA and
  establishing a physical space for these leaders and managers to crowdsource,
  our model will increase collaborative efforts and result in healthier
  nonprofit organizations. The hub model conserves resources by promoting
  strategic partnerships and assist organizations in developing business plans,
  exchanging skills and knowledge, breaking their isolation and adding more
  focus to their individual efforts.</p>






  <p>Envision a place in South LA bustling with small groups of nonprofit
  leaders collaborating to share ideas and spark innovation. Imagine a hub for
  peer learning that is available to members in Spanish and English, with
  sessions led not by external experts, but by people in the community that
  leaders can relate to. Here nonprofit managers can bring their questions on
  the difficult to navigate financial statements, for example, and receive
  oneonone support from a peer organization trained and verified as having skill
  within this topic of interest. This mentor organization will serve as an
  ongoing point of contact for resource sharing between the two agencies. Both
  organizations participate in peerled sessions on community mobilization
  strategies while gaining partners in daytoday challenges of managing an
  organization as well as allies in the movement to engage communities. </p>






  <p>Different than other collaborative models already at work in South LA and
  Boyle Heights, this effort works specifically build capacity within
  organizations versus creating a campaign or agenda. Our goal is to provide
  tools to organizations so that they might be more effective and connected to
  others when engaging in work of their own. </p>






  <p>With the support of LA2050, we will take the first step in creating this
  environment. By December 31, 2013 we will design this buhlike model and launch
  a series of ‘Peerled Consulting Convenings’ to engage at least 100 South LA
  organizations in peerled capacity building support around their pressing
  management challenges. This effort requires the identification and training of
  nine veteran nonprofits with demonstrated skill in civic engagement work and
  internal management. At least 30 participating organizations will benefit from
  oneoneone consulting support from the veteran leaders. Through the convenings,
  these trained veterans will offer free, highquality consulting to their peers,
  building a stronger network of capable community engagement organizations
  within the nonprofit landscape. In turn, these organizations will be more
  resilient and better equipped to lead Los Angeles towards a new era of greater
  connectedness.</p>
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  <p>As a management consulting firm, Jemmott Rollins Group has built a
  reputation for developing innovative concepts and providing leadership in
  working with marginalized communities. Relevant achievements to this effort
  include:</p>






  <p> Facilitated an 18 month planning process for South Los Angeles Building
  Healthy Communities, a tenyear, comprehensive community initiative of the
  California Endowment to revolutionize the way Californians think about and
  support health in their communities. </p>






  <p> Conceptualized and currently serves as lead coordinator of Strong Field
  Project, a fouryear effort by the Blue Shield of California Foundation aimed
  at building a strong, coordinated network of domestic violence service
  providers in California.</p>


    


  <p>Provided a space for Black, Latino and Southeast Asian boys and men of
  color to connect with local and state officials on issues affecting young men
  in South LA, East LA and Long Beach through the Brothers, Sons, Selves
  campaign, a project funded by the Liberty Hill Foundation and the California
  Endowment.</p>






  <p> Provided consulting services to over 30 nonprofits and foundations in
  California, garnering testimonials that include the following:</p>






  <p>"JRG is uniquely qualified to facilitate and support the complex process of
  community change. They 'get it' in a way that few others do." —Tom David,
  Tides Network, San Franscisco</p>






  <p>"JRG helped diversify our funding base, increase capacity and manage
  growth. Every time we've worked with JRG over the past five years, CoCo has
  taken a leap in organizational development."—Aurea MontesRodriguez, Community
  Coalition, Los Angeles</p>






  <p>"JRG helped us realize that we all need to step back and look at the big
  picture every so often so that we make sure we keep on the right track." —Ben
  Schirmer, Rainbow Services, San Pedro</p>

Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  Jemmott Rollins Group, acting as lead coordinator is partnering with
  CompassPoint Nonprofit Services (www.compasspoint.org), a leader in nonprofit
  coaching, peer learning and leadership development. Although identifying the
  nine partner organizations is a critical step for once the initiative has
  begun, already, outstanding organizations have expressed commitment to
  participate in this work. One of these leading nonprofits is the Community
  Coalition of South Los Angeles (www.cocosouthla.org), a veteran  community
  action organization based in South Los Angeles. 
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  <p>Jemmott Rollins Group will evaluate the project in large part by measuring
  organizational change as a result of participation in the program. This
  information wil be collected through analysis of the needs assessments of a
  sample group of organizations and postconvening surveys and interviews. With
  the nine partner organizations, we will use the Core Capacity Assessment Tool
  (CCAT) to more systematically measure growth before and after participating in
  coaching, training and consulting engagement.</p>





   <p>The CCAT is a 146question online survey developed by TCC group (http://www.tccccat.com/) that measures a nonprofit organization's effectiveness and can taken multiple times to measure development over time. “The CCAT is the most comprehensive, valid, and reliable tool of its kind, and has been used by funders and nonprofits as a planning, capacity building, research, and evaluation tool.” — TCC Group.</p>
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
  With the city’s massive physical landscape, our slow move towards an
  integrated public transit system, and the fastpaced lifestyle many of us lead,
  it’s not easy for Angelenos to connect with one another. Without mechanisms to
  facilitate interactions, or organizations ready with the skills, strategies
  and tactics to effectively encourage public engagement, Los Angeles will have
  more of the same fragmented, often unengaged communities. Our goal is to build
  up Los Angeles organizations that focus on civic engagement, voter turnout,
  neighborhoodbased advocacy, and local community building to change this. 






  With stronger, more collaborative, and strategic community organizations, Los
  Angeles residents will receive better services, become more informed, and find
  new pathways to participate in community. In time, this means higher voter
  turnout, greater civic discourse, heightened community collaboration, and new
  organizations and campaigns coming from the ground up. These neighborhood
  based initiatives would be made of people with skills to tackle almost any
  issue — from crime and violence prevention to lowperforming schools and public
  health. 






  UCLA’s Luskin Center for Public Affairs’ report on the state of nonprofit
  organizations in Los Angeles County found an extreme service gap in lowincome
  communities — nonprofits exist in the lowest numbers in poor neighborhoods.
  This means that, at present day, the people in Los Angeles who have the least
  support are those who essentially need it the most. Our focus on South Los
  Angeles represents a desire to reverse the service gap by strengthening the
  organizations that already exist so that they might more effectively engage
  Angelenos. The regional emphasis also represents our longterm commitment to
  serving underserved communities of color. We strongly believe that the South
  Los Angeles Hub is the first step in designing an engagement model that can be
  replicated citywide.


What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  We could be described as friendly antagonists. Certainly we have a history and
  track record of cooperation and collaboration with the efforts of other
  management service organizations. We have learned from them and engaged in
  thought partnership with them. Our efforts in many ways complement theirs and
  have caused them to step up their efforts in areas like culturallycompetent
  capacity building and deconstructing racism as a factor that perpetuates
  poverty and injustices.
