title: 'L.A. Kitchen: Neither Food or People Should Ever Go to Waste'
indicator: ' Social Connectedness'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  <p>‘Charity is about the redemption of the giver, not the liberation of the
  receiver.’</p>






  <p>Each of us has experienced the power of food to bring people together;
  whether through the intergenerational passing down of recipes and techniques,
  serving the less fortunate, or even around our own kitchen tables. But when it
  comes to helping people who are hungry, our systems are plagued by
  fragmentation, reinforcing models that perpetuate the kind of dependency that
  make breaking these cycles impossible. This antiquated model is inequitable
  ineffective and has more of a lasting impact on the ‘giver’ than the
  ‘receiver.’ The new L.A. Kitchen is at the heart of an innovative approach, a
  transformative model that uses the universal power of food to foster
  volunteerism, civic and social engagement, and voting. </p>






  <p>First, we will recruit diverse L.A. residents to volunteer and join us in
  our commercial kitchen and produce processing hub, renewing raw fruits and
  vegetables into “strong” meals and nutritious snacks. Once there, volunteers
  will find incredibly real, rewarding work to be done. Very often, these
  perfectly edible items are discarded by farmers because they don’t appeal to a
  mass, privileged market; but thanks to L.A. Kitchen, they will be recombined
  as nutrientrich, dignified fuel for hungry and atrisk individuals. While some
  of our volunteers will be the recognizable, middleclass dogooders whose
  generosity currently supports nonprofits across the city, older adults who
  want to stay active and engaged and students from local high schools and
  universities seeking service hours will be a huge part of our mission, turning
  our kitchen into a gathering place and classroom. Everyone has a role to play
  and job to do at the L.A. Kitchen, and all are welcome!</p>






  <p>Volunteers won’t be the only ones standing in our production line. At their
  side will be young men and women aging out of the foster care system and
  formerly incarcerated adults. These seemingly unlikelypaired groups will be
  enrolled in a pioneering threemonth jobtraining program, allowing them to
  develop real culinary skills, while simultaneously mentoring one other &
  enriching the community. </p>






  <p>Volunteers will interact on a human level with the very people they thought
  they would be serving, and together, they will nourish Los Angeles on a new
  level and be challenged to a degree that personal paradigms will shift. Both
  groups will be guided through the daily process by L.A. Kitchen staff, and
  most will have completed the rigorous culinary curriculum and earn living
  wages.</p>






  <p>Once we’ve humanized hunger and joblessness in the minds of our volunteers,
  we will expose them to the true power of their dollars and their votes. </p>






  <p>As consumers, each of us possesses great power. “Strong Food,” L.A.
  Kitchen’s dynamic social enterprise, will provide highquality, nutritious
  items through responsible sourcing and fair employment practices, allowing
  everyday people to support our charitable work by purchasing our products. We
  believe in breaking down the obsolete barrier between .coms and .orgs.
  (forprofits and nonprofits), and L.A. Kitchen will provide the topquality
  skills and services expected of a forprofit with the social impact of a
  nonprofit. As volunteers, L.A. residents can contribute their time and see
  meaningful impact as a result. As customers, they can spend their dollars and
  see the same. We will prove that living wages, an encouraging work
  environment, quality benefits, and financial transparency are not detractors
  from a company’s bottom line; they are some of its greatest champions.</p>






  <p>Unlike too many nonprofits, L.A. Kitchen is unafraid of political action.
  Today’s leaders are paralyzed between the false choice of providing public
  good and creating private sector jobs. The L.A. Kitchen promotes a new civic
  currency, insisting that both are essential to generating profit and
  maintaining a civil society. </p>






  <p>Employing foster care graduates and exoffenders is cheaper than
  reincarcerating them; recovering surplus food is smarter than throwing it
  away; giving our seniors healthy meals is less costly & more effective than
  loading them up with prescriptions. Engaging volunteers and utilizing their
  professional skills is smarter than having them paint shelter walls over and
  over again.</p>






  <p>Humantohuman interaction, facilitated by food & fueled by social
  enterprise, grounded in empathy & dedicated to justice will unite Los Angeles
  around an inclusive vision for a healthier, more prosperous community. </p>
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >+
  L.A. Kitchen is brand new. Many of its core ideas have been proven successful
  — though, never quite in this dynamic combination. L.A. Kitchen is the latest
  venture of Robert Egger, the author of the award winning book “Begging for
  Change, The Dollars and Sense of Making Nonprofits Responsive, Efficient and
  Rewarding for All” and the pioneering creator of D.C. Central Kitchen, The
  Campus Kitchens Project, and CForward.






  D.C. Central Kitchen, founded in Washington, D.C. in 1989, is now a thriving
  $11 million nonprofit with a $6 million social enterprise portfolio. Egger
  created DCCK to turn leftover food into balanced meals in a ‘central kitchen’
  that could in turn deliver them to 100 other nonprofits that were spending too
  much for substandard meals. There, he launched a culinary training program
  that brought in some of the city’s toughest cases — men and women written off
  as hopeless, helpless, or both — and prepared them for lasting careers. Since
  2008, DCCK’s 370 culinary graduates have averaged a job placement rate of 90%,
  despite the weak economy, and are 96% less likely to return to prison than
  exoffenders nationwide. Egger’s results inspire 14,000 individuals to
  contribute their time and effort as volunteers to DC Central Kitchen each
  year.






  Egger launched The Campus Kitchens Project in 2001, because he saw a
  generation of young people dedicated to community service, but few nonprofits
  capable of maximizing their tremendous potential. Today, there are 34 CKP
  sites in 20 states across America, led by 5,000 tireless student volunteers
  who turned idle college and high school dining halls and cafeteria leftovers
  into new tools in the fight against hunger. In addition to preparing meals,
  CKP is preparing a new generation of community leaders. In 2012, 45% of CKP’s
  student volunteers reported that their experiences had changed their entire
  career path, opening their eyes to new needs and new opportunities. 






  His work in Washington earned him numerous accolades and awards, including
  being named an Oprah Angel, the James Beard Humanitarian of the Year and a
  Washingtonian of the Year.






  In 2006, Egger CoConvened the first Nonprofit Congress, and in 2011, he
  launched CForward, America’s first Political Action Committee for nonprofits.
  Nonprofits comprise 10% of the US economy and 10% of the American workforce,
  but they speak with no common voice in our electoral process. In 2012,
  CForward made history by endorsing 8 candidates, representing both major
  parties, who had strong, clear plans for strengthening nonprofits and their
  role in solving key problems. Most won. This work also earned him a spot on
  the “Top 50 Most Influential Nonprofit leaders” four years in a row.






  Now, Egger’s energy, experience, and entrepreneurial spirit are here in the
  region where he grew up in the 1960’s and 70’s, with an added focus on
  fighting the needless waste of fresh produce and strengthening our senior
  citizens. It’s time for change.


Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >+
  St. Vincent’s Meals on Wheels, EngAge and AARPCA know the unique needs of our
  city’s senior citizens well, and we have forged exciting partnerships that
  allows for direct outreach to L.A.’s elders.






  We will build on the job readiness programming provided by programs like our
  partner Chrysalis, as well as programs that focus on supporting emancipating
  foster youth and returning felons.






  We will provide student volunteers with service hour opportunities & nutrition
  education, which will make the LA Kitchen a dynamic partner for LAUSD.






  We will work with Central Valley farmers, chefs, and the UCLA Arts and Healing
  Center to develop recipes that will pioneer the “food as medicine” movement. 


Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  Old metrics that have defined ‘success’ in the nonprofit sector—meals
  prepared, clients served, expenditure on overhead—are as tired as the
  solutions they claim to measure. We believe in integrated metrics to show
  valuable synergies between programmatic activities.






  First, we will push back against the status quo of measuring impact based on
  “pounds moved or agencies served.” Big does not equal good, and L.A. Kitchen
  will pioneer measuring the nutritional content of what we serve. We will
  partner with local medical schools & nutritionists to develop metrics that can
  quantify the medicinal / health impacts of the meals we serve. This will
  shatter the typical way we measure the impact of “hunger” programs and
  incentivize a new way for foundation officers and regular people to understand
  which programs are making people strong, versus those who are endangering
  people’s health in the name of feeding them.






  Second, we will assess the impact of our dynamic approach to volunteer
  engagement. By building a base of strategically managed senior citizen
  volunteers, we will generate more than free labor. We will reimagine the way
  nonprofits measure the value of volunteers by extending that value to the
  tangible benefits provided to volunteers themselves. By offering physical
  activity and intergenerational engagement opportunities (mentoring to atrisk /
  younger individuals), our senior citizens will lead healthier, more connected
  lives. And by actively recruiting the potentially isolated seniors who rely on
  L.A. Kitchen meals and nutritional items to volunteer in our kitchen, we will
  be energizing individuals, who in turn bring that energy to a meaningful
  outlet of community service. Giving seniors a place to reinvest all they know
  and have experienced will produce costeffective — & actually effective —
  mentoring and social support services for atrisk populations, including
  exoffenders and emancipated youth. The interplay between qualitative
  results—changes in perceptions, reported shifts in behavior—and quantitative
  ones — hours of community service among marginalized populations, vitamin
  intake among seniors, and reduced recidivism — will tell a far more compelling
  story than either form of evaluation alone.






  Finally, we will capture changes in voting & political behavior. In
  partnership with the nonprofit sector’s PAC, CForward, we will track increased
  nonprofit activity in the electoral process through social media & lobbying
  activities, while surveying individual nonprofit workers & volunteers about
  their perceptions of the role of nonprofits. In time, the many rating systems
  for charities, which claim to address questions of effectiveness and fiscal
  responsibility, should change their approaches on savvy business techniques,
  quality job creation and strategic, nonpartisan political activity as vital
  indicators of a thoughtful, wellbuilt nonprofit organization, & our success in
  effecting such change will be a vital indicator of our continued work. 
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >2-
   empower older Los Angelenos, those not returning to prison because of participation in our program, and foster youth who will avoid their anticipated cycle of lifelong systemliving


   use healthy food to offer meaningful volunteer opportunities


   unite diverse populations in the battles against hunger and poor health 


   help the city redefine aging, making LA more whole, freeing up resources used to address declining health and prison terms, and redistributing it in much more impacting ways





  Too many volunteer experiences achieve little for those purportedly being
  served. Our efforts to train atrisk members of our community for decent jobs
  mean we are pulling men and women out of the service line & empowering them to
  be part of the solution. Volunteers will see that transformation in action,
  and demand similar accountability and results from all their community service
  activities. Financial donors demand detailed accounting and transparency;
  nonprofits owe volunteers the same respect when they give their time and
  labor.






  Second, we will bring together a diverse group of L.A. residents to fight
  hunger together. We will place special emphasis on recruiting and leveraging
  older volunteers, men and women eager to redefine retirement. LAK will engage
  thousands of these experienced community members each year, empowering them to
  remain active and involved as they grow older. 






  Our intergenerational approach will unite our elders with atrisk youth,
  especially those in the foster care system. We will also offer a meaningful
  mentoring program that is specially geared toward preventing destructive,
  shortsighted behaviors and negative outcomes among foster youth. Many of these
  mentors will be fellow trainees, men and women returning from years in prison
  who made the mistakes and learned the lessons the hard way. We will empower
  men and women who have turned their lives around to counsel and coach young
  people about the key decisions involved in avoiding prison and addiction. In
  turn, the younger men and women will help older trainees transition into the
  cyberworld of today. 






  Helping any one of these populations is valuable. Helping them to help one
  another is visionary.






  Third, we will engineer a change in business practices and political debates
  by educating and engaging individuals as consumers and voters after they come
  to us as volunteers. The success of our social enterprises will empower
  nonprofits to launch new enterprises and inspire forprofits to change their
  approach. When consumers understand the full costs of substandard wages and
  lowquality food products, the competitive balance of the marketplace will
  shift. Similarly, individuals will have a new understanding of the vital role
  nonprofits do and must play in political debates and policy solutions if we
  are to meet the challenges of this century. We will be nonpartisan, but not
  nonpolitical. 
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  Our vision for Los Angeles in 2050: our city will unite individuals of
  different generations, cultures, and tax brackets to make engagement,
  volunteerism, voting, and responsible business practices essential components
  of our daily life.






  For a town that worships youthfulness, the notion that we can make it a hub
  for the redefinition of aging might seem unrealistic, but this is at the core
  of the L.A. Kitchen experiment. Given the extra years that science is
  affording us, it is economically essential that older Americans live at home
  and stay productive for as long as possible. We must develop programs,
  establish metrics and elect officials to make that a reality NOW, not in 10,
  20 or 50 years.






  It may be strange for an organization that will focus on strengthening senior
  citizens to speak so boldly about a future nearly fifty years away. But if
  you’re a young adult reading this today, you’ll likely be a senior citizen in
  2050. We want senior citizens to be valued, treasured citizens, and to see
  their later years as a new opportunity to connect to their communities. We
  will prove that our model of intergenerational service and engagement will
  empower seniors to live healthier, more active lives while sharing meaningful
  knowledge with fellow residents. 






  We will reveal the economic power of keeping our older citizens engaged and
  respected. Redefining aging, while also providing healthy meals, will have a
  huge impact on the city’s treasury and its ability to invest money in its
  schools, parks and other community enhancing initiatives. 






  LA Kitchen believes that organizations should treat volunteers like any
  foundation officer or donor, and provide reporting on the impact, value, and
  longterm results of their contribution in the lives of those it serves and the
  community we share. We believe that increased transparency among nonprofits
  will inspire active engagement among volunteers, donors, and other community
  stakeholders, as they hold nonprofits like L.A. Kitchen to account, demanding
  that we make the most of our available resources and constantly innovate in
  service of our community.






  We also envision a future where missiondriven nonprofits are unafraid to act
  politically. It isn’t a violation of tax laws to educate lawmakers, inspire
  voters, or speak truth to power. Rather, doing those things is an inherent
  part of what a valuesoriented organization must do to earn its taxexempt
  status. In our vision, nonprofits, public sector agencies, and forprofit
  actors all have equal seats at the decisionmaking table as we devise shared
  solutions to our common problems. 






  Finally, we seek a future where for and nonprofits alike behave responsibly in
  their business practices. Americanmade products, living wages, and
  preventative health care must be part of any viable business model.
  Accountability among employers will inspire harderworking employees, increased
  worker productivity, and profits that ultimately fuel growth & development in
  Los Angeles.
