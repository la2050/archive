title: ChangeMaking Gardens
indicator: ' Environmental Quality'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >+
  What if that broad expanse of grass in your local community was instead
  producing healthy, nutritious, organic fruits and vegetables?  Our project is
  about empowering citizens to turn the underutilized spaces around them into
  productive gardens: public spaces where people can learn, gather, and share.






  Food gardens can be beautiful nature spaces within our concretebound city. 
  Community gardens can provide gathering places in a city that doesn't have
  much public open space.  Public gardens can be places to meet your neighbors
  and work together; they are centers for learning, for arts and culture, and
  for a new sense of community.



  Gardening is enticing, fun, approachable, and accessible to multiple
  demographics.  It builds health through exercise and stretching, sunshine and
  fresh air, and promotes healthy eating with fresh, organic, local, clean,
  unprocessed food.  In these times of ongoing economic contraction and resource
  limitations, learning the skills of growing food is a necessary skill for
  survival.






  Community gardening provides an excellent vehicle for much broader lessons
  about environmental stewardship and social dynamics.  Organic gardening opens
  the door to muchneeded conversations about pollutants, toxins, consumerism,
  and activism.  It cultivates new perspectives on humanity's place within the
  earth's ecosystems.






  Our project is about **changing minds**, which then inspires people to change
  their habits, surroundings, and environment. 






  Our proposal consists of three parts:  



  1) Growing gardeners.  Through experience, we understand that “more community
  gardens” is not simply a matter of more physical construction and
  installation.  Rather, we must grow the skillbase to maintain the spaces we
  create.  We propose to offer a series of "Organic Vegetable Gardening" classes
  for the general public at multiple locations around the greater LA area.  Our
  unique approach to gardening education integrates organics, permaculture,
  saner resource consumption, and ecosystems awareness.  We integrate food
  gardening with environmental transformation. 


   


  2) Growing gardens.  The grant would make it possible for ECM to mentor
  several community groups* who are contemplating the installation of community
  gardens like ours.  We can guide these prospective community garden groups,
  based upon our experiences of what works/doesn’t work; help them find
  resources; match landholders with knowledgeable local food gardeners; give
  them a helping start with garden design to create beautiful, artful, and
  healthful open spaces; help them learn how to make the most out of minimal
  inputs, available onsite materials, and shoestring construction budgets; help
  them establish and grow a local leadership team. 



  *(specific sites are currently being identified by our networking partners)






  3) Growing rootlevel change.  To deepen environmental transformation, we would
  host a training about a much more panoramic view of change.  The Transition
  training (a) raises awareness of the sweeping implications of peak oil,
  climate change, resource limitations, and the economic crisis, (b) helps
  participants grasp the vast number of things that can be done at the
  grassroots level to prepare for such a future, and (c) trains participants to
  be community leaders for this preparedness effort.  It includes training on
  community empowerment, evolved group dynamics, economic solutions, and the
  psychological implications of the massive changes humanity faces. We propose
  to bring trainers from Transition US (the national representative of the
  international Transition Network) to Los Angeles, to train leaders and help
  additional local neighborhoods start neighborhood action groups.  Grant
  funding would make this training accessible to low income participants in
  lessaffluent areas of our megacity, so that postpetroleum preparedness can get
  underway on a widespread basis.


What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >+
  In 2005, we founded the Environmental ChangeMakers (ECM), a network of
  "proactivists" who focus on What We Can Do about our environmental and social
  issues.



  In 2008 ECM built the Community Garden at Holy Nativity.  ECM members continue
  to manage this garden's production and have achieved 5 years of weekly
  harvests for the benefit of Food Pantry LAX.



  Since 2008, ECM has offered monthly Organic Vegetable Gardening classes to the
  general public.



  In 2008, ECM hosted the first Transition Training in Southern California,
  bringing trainers in from the UK to do so.  Subsequently, we launched 8 action
  groups in neighborhoods around the greater LA area.



  In 20092011, ECM worked with LAUSD and the Mayor’s office to found and build
  the Emerson Avenue Community Garden.


Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  ECM been asked to be the garden knowhow and support for the "Seeds of Hope"
  community garden program (directed by the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles). 
  ECM has an ongoing / founder relationship with Transition Mar Vista/Venice,
  Transition Culver City, NELA Transition, and the Emerson Avenue Community
  Garden (Westchester).  ECM has collaborated in the past in varying capacities
  with The Learning Garden (Venice), the Seed Library of Los Angeles, the Arroyo
  SECO Time Banking network, Our Time Bank (Culver City), Whittier Time Bank,
  Metabolic Studios (downtown), the Green Team at Cal Poly Pomona, Good Karma
  Gardens (Mar Vista), Permaculture networks throughout Southern California,
  Transition US and the international Transition Network.
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >+
  We will evaluate our success at Growing Gardeners by the number of
  participants in the garden classes and with a followup survey. 


   


  In evaluating our success at Growing Gardens, we understand from experience
  that a meaningful and changemaking garden and garden community cannot be built
  within the short timeframe defined by a grant.  Within the timeline of this
  grant, we will evaluate success by the number of prospective community gardens
  we support and the degree of our involvement.  Longerterm — over a period of
  years — the better measure of our success would be how many gardens are
  brought to fruition (built, maintained, and harvested).  Another longer term
  measure of Growing Gardens success would be the number of communities who
  eventually become ready to deepen their environmental transformation by
  sending participants to a Transition training.






  Within the timeline of this grant, we will evaluate our success at Growing
  RootLevel Change by the number of participants in the Transition training and
  by the diversity of participant demographics.  Longerterm, however, the better
  measure of success will be how many training graduates go on to establish
  active groups in their home neighborhoods, and the degree to which those
  groups engage local neighbors in proactive change.


How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
  Right now to get a plot at a community garden, in most places in LA County you
  have to wait 3 to 6 YEARS.






  Meanwhile, there are many groups that are “thinking about” creating a
  community garden.  ECM’s networking partners know specific landholders who are
  “thinking about” opening their land to growing food.  Yet all these groups are
  scared of the unknown because they have never done it before.  






  We have.  We’ve created gardens in several vastly different models of what
  “community gardening” can mean (traditional plot style, school garden, and
  charity style).  We can share what works and what doesn’t work, and help
  groups who are “thinking about it” get past the mullingitover stage into
  meaningful action — into creating real, physical, muchneeded garden spaces. 
  Ultimately, our project will facilitate much more land being available for
  community gardens in Los Angeles.






  Additionally, ECM has the connections — locally, nationally and
  internationally — with people who are taking a proactive stance to the threats
  posed by climate change, peak oil, resource limitations, and economic
  contraction.  These are big scary problems, but there is plenty that we can do
  as grassroots citizens.  Our project will lead to greater awareness of the
  issues, with more people striving to prepare our city and its citizens for the
  realities of the future.


What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >+
  By the year 2050, direct success would look like far more food gardens in and
  around Los Angeles.  Local residents will know how to garden their food and
  harvest rainwater.  They’ll exchange the delicious and healthful fruits of
  their harvests with each other.  Local neighbors will feel a sense of
  “belonging” to their home communities, and happy gatherings of all colors and
  cultures will frequent the beautiful open spaces under the L.A. sunshine.






  By 2050, everyone will be really glad that way back in 2013, people started
  planning for the realities of the future.  Because of that planning, people of
  the late 2010s began to “Transition” their lifestyles.  They began to think
  locally, and build up local infrastructure, so that the pain of having less
  and less petroleum and energy supply (and thus less transportation and less
  technology) hasn’t been nearly so great. 






  Because people understood that climate change was coming, they planned
  appropriately.  They planted lowchill fruit trees that could adapt, which in
  2050 still bear fruit despite hotter temperatures.  They knew to save seed
  locally and develop food plant varieties which are adapted to LA’s changed
  weather patterns. They talked among themselves (in those delightful community
  gardens) and began to build water cisterns and energyfree devices to cope with
  the heat. 


   


  Now (in 2050), elders hand down to younger generations the skills of growing
  rich, nutritious, local food, and it is normalized within the culture that
  everything is fresh and organic.  The community gardens that were built back
  in the mid2010s are now a vital part of The Commons.  They are the “town
  squares” where people gather socially, gather to make art and music, gather to
  discuss community issues, and gather to enjoy their food together.
