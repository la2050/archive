  Streetcraft: where street hustlers and tag bangers become creative economy
  entrepreneurs
project_summary: "Streetcraft LA is a new social venture of the South Bay Center for Community Development (SBCC). SBCC is a long-standing non-profit organization that has been working to empower low-income communities in the greater Los Angeles area since 1976. SBCC has a long history of being one of those do-gooders that operates job-training programs to mitigate unemployment. The organization’s career pathway programs have been recognized by the United Way of Greater Los Angeles as a national best practice and were awarded a Everychild grant (one of the most competitive grants in LA) to apply its model to unemployed at risk youth.  In addition, the organization founded the Urban Teacher Fellowship, an initiative that moves underrepresented groups into the teaching profession funded by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation; and The Promo Pathway, a career pathway funded by The James Irvine Foundation and recognized by The Aspen Institute as a national best practice. In doing this work, however, we came to believe that job training wasn’t good enough. We needed to train entrepreneurs who can create their own jobs. So a team of us launched Streetcraft LA as a related, but autonomous social venture to train and incubate youth-led micro ventures. \r\n\r\nStreetcraft is currently testing its core components and theory of change in a proof of concept pilot state funded the James Irvine Foundation.  Guided by our board of directors, the focus of this planning stage was to test three assumptions critical to our model: marginalized youth engaged in graffiti culture or other illicit entrepreneur activities have talents that can be re-directed; a process of engagement can be created including partnerships with public systems and community based social networks; and youth’s talents can be monetized and professionalized. Streetcraft has piloted its model with 50 Streetcraft fellows, referred through probation and other community-based networks, who went through a work based contextualized learning experience and developed products for a retail store located on main street, Santa Monica. During this pilot period 100% of participants completed the pilot and 85% percent increased their annual income by 50%. \r\n"

    Streetcraft has identified metrics to measure impact. To measure participant
    level economic impact, we will track participants’ earned income through
    product sales and micro venture profits. To measure personal and
    professional skill development we will administer pre/post assessments of
    basic skills, personal resiliency (University of Pennsylvania GRIT
    assessment) and professional skills (adobe certification). To measure
    community level impact, specifically decreases in graffiti, unemployment,
    and illicit street activities, we will work with local law enforcement to
    measure localized arrests for graffiti, calls for local graffiti “clean up,”
    arrests for drug dealing, and local unemployment rates collected by the
    State Department of Labor.  
  Indicator: ' Income & Employment'
  brief: "July 13, 2012, The Los Angeles Times Business section: “Recession Erases 2.7 Million Youth Jobs, Widens Employment Gap.” If we didn’t know this already, the headline of the article reminds us that youth unemployment is one of the largest social issues facing Los Angeles.  The current unemployment rate for 16 to 24-year-olds is 16.5% -- double the national 8.2%. More than 2 in 10 Latino youth are jobless, while 3 in 10 black youth are unemployed, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \r\n\r\nMost of us—do-gooders, funders, policy makers—assume that the answer to youth unemployment is pretty straight forward: hope the economy gets better and provide kids training and education to help them get jobs when it does.  Streetcraft LA has a different approach to youth unemployment. We don’t provide education and training to help young people get jobs. We provide education and training to empower youth to create their own jobs.  \r\n\r\nStreetcraft empowers low income, at risk, and unemployed youth to improve their economic future through creative economy entrepreneurship. Don’t get the wrong idea—we are not talking about lemonade stands or bake sales. We especially support youth in building creative sector small businesses in three categories: apparel, design, and creative services.   Why is this our strategy? Entrepreneurship and the creative economy are the future. The factories are closed, pensions are dead, and design studios are hiring freelancers. And this self-made creative economy is a natural fit for our kids. Streetcraft kids have a lot of creative capacity, energy and hustle that is being misapplied as graffiti on, well, the side of your building. \r\n\r\n\tHow do we help kids create their own jobs in the creative economy? Streetcraft LA’s approach to launching creative micro-ventures is a three-step model we call engage, partner, launch.  First, we engage youth misapplying their creative capacity through graffiti in a training and youth development program we call The Streetcraft Crew. Crew is a yearlong program taught by well-known street artists that empowers at-risk kids to see themselves as artists, designers, and entrepreneurs. Crew functions not only as a positive intervention in the life of at risk youth but functions as a Streetcraft human resources department sourcing the true talent that is ready for step two, a formal paid apprenticeship in Streetcraft LA's retail platform and design studio. \r\n\r\nStreetcraft LA operates a retail store in Los Angeles that showcases collaboratively designed and produced products and original apparel. Youth are formal partners in this social venture working with Streetcraft’s lead designer to design custom furniture and original apparel such as hoodies, lids, and t-shirts. Over a one-year period, Streetcraft partners are exposed to the product design process including market research, sales, marketing and promotion, distribution platforms and retail management through both direct instruction by industry professionals and experiential learning.  Streetcraft partners are paid and also receive a percentage of all sales.  Streetcraft partners are also required and supported to complete high school and attend relevant higher education while enrolled.\r\n\r\nAfter a year partnership, Streetcraft youth enter a process to launch their own creative micro enterprise. Youth can choose to enter a business planning process in one of three creative sectors: apparel, product design, and creative services.  Youth are paired with industry mentors and attend lectures on product development, market analysis, financing and organization development. At the conclusion of the year planning process, youth pitch their venture to a group of funders including banking partners such as Wells Fargo. \r\n"

    Only 25% of participants in most job training programs increase their annual
    wages (Jobs for the Future). Over 85% of Streetcraft youth triple their
    annual income. Within five years Streetcraft will spread this impact
    throughout Los Angeles county, becoming a countywide initiative with retail
    hubs in 20 locations working with over 20,000 young people a year. These
    retail hubs will house our engagement programming, apprenticeships, and
    provide a commercial marketplace for products designed by streetcraft
    artists as well as engage 1000 students a year. Our engagement programming
    will reduce graffiti and illicit street enterprises; the apprenticeship
    program will increase youth’s annual income and provide concrete technical
    skills and work experience; and the micro venture program will increase the
    annual income of students by 50%. Finally, communities where streetcraft
    hubs are located will see youth unemployment decrease by 5%.

    Streetcraft has a number of strategic partners. First, we will work the
    public and social sector to refer youth into the program. Future referral
    partners will be youth development community based organizations seeking
    career opportunities for marginalized young people such as the boys and
    girls club, home boys INC. and other CBOs. In addition, Streetcraft is
    currently partnering with the department of probation to receive a
    court-mandated placement for youth arrested for graffiti.

    The status quo answer to youth unemployment is reductive, ineffective, but
    prevalent: provide youth with job training and education to help them get
    jobs. Streetcraft has a different approach. We don’t provide education and
    training to help young people get jobs. We provide education and training to
    empower youth to create their own jobs. We do this because entrepreneurship
    and the creative economy are the future. The factories are closed and design
    studios are hiring freelancers. This self-made creative economy is a natural
    fit for street hustlers and tag bangers.  Few organizations run a training
    program in urban arts, a retail store, a creative service agency, and launch
    micro ventures focusing on the creative economy.  Don’t get us wrong, there
    are a number of organizations that do one, or at most two, of these
    activities.  Some organizations operate revenue-generating platforms (social
    ventures) like our retail store such as Change agent productions, Barrio
    bonito, and Homeboy industries.  But these are really job training, not job
    creating programs.  Like streetcraft, however, Homeboy does target
    gang-involved youth with multiple barriers to employment and life success.
    It employs them in running a café and other social ventures, and it provides
    wrap around supportive services to support youth in re-integrating into
    their community and re-engaging with education. Homeboy does not engage
    youth in creating original apparel or creative services. Its social venture
    is focused on food services. Homeboy participants do not receive any direct
    instruction on small business development, business planning, or
    entrepreneurship; they receive no support in accessing capital or launching
    their own micro venture.  Homeboy will be, however, an important partner
    acting as a referral agency. In addition, Streetcraft will explore
    partnering with Homeboy’s to create an integrated retail dining social
    venture platform.The network for teaching entrepreneurship is streetcraft’s
    direct competition in incubating urban entrepreneurs. NTE is focused on
    exposing low income youth to entrepreneurship and developing entrepreneurial
    skills. Like Streetcraft, it targets at risk youth and offers a structured
    program that includes direct instruction on business plan development and
    concept ideation. The organization also, in its advance courses, offers
    students entrepreneurial coaching. Students also have limited access to
    start up capital in the form of local, regional, and national competition
    prizes. NTE works primarily within school systems and supports a wide range
    of low-income students in learning about entrepreneurship. Streetcraft has a
    specific focus on disengaged youth who are out of school and involved in the
    juvenile justice system.  Streetcraft’s goal is not to simply re-engage
    these youth through entrepreneurship, but improve their short term and
    long-term economic capacity by monetizing their talents, hiring them as
    fellows, and launching their own venture.
  vision: >-
    Streetcraft’s vision for success in 2050 is ambition: reduce youth
    unemployment through creative economy entrepreneurship by 25% in Los
    Angeles. It’s imperative that we achieve this. Youth unemployment has long
    term and systemic consequences. Unemployed youth face lifelong diminished
    economic and social opportunity. Communities with high youth unemployment
    have higher crime rates and have higher rates of birth out of wedlock. And a
    country with high youth un-employment suffers. The tax base erodes. Civic
    engagement and trust in government decreases. And entitlement programs
    become unsustainable. It’s not a pretty picture; it is an issue that we must
    solve now, and Streetcraft LA can lead the way.

What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >+
  Streetcraft LA is a new social venture of the South Bay Center for Community
  Development (SBCC). SBCC is a longstanding nonprofit organization that has
  been working to empower lowincome communities in the greater Los Angeles area
  since 1976. SBCC has a long history of being one of those dogooders that
  operates jobtraining programs to mitigate unemployment. The organization’s
  career pathway programs have been recognized by the United Way of Greater Los
  Angeles as a national best practice and were awarded a Everychild grant (one
  of the most competitive grants in LA) to apply its model to unemployed at risk
  youth.  In addition, the organization founded the Urban Teacher Fellowship, an
  initiative that moves underrepresented groups into the teaching profession
  funded by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation; and The Promo Pathway, a
  career pathway funded by The James Irvine Foundation and recognized by The
  Aspen Institute as a national best practice. In doing this work, however, we
  came to believe that job training wasn’t good enough. We needed to train
  entrepreneurs who can create their own jobs. So a team of us launched
  Streetcraft LA as a related, but autonomous social venture to train and
  incubate youthled micro ventures. 






  Streetcraft is currently testing its core components and theory of change in a
  proof of concept pilot state funded the James Irvine Foundation.  Guided by
  our board of directors, the focus of this planning stage was to test three
  assumptions critical to our model: marginalized youth engaged in graffiti
  culture or other illicit entrepreneur activities have talents that can be
  redirected; a process of engagement can be created including partnerships with
  public systems and community based social networks; and youth’s talents can be
  monetized and professionalized. Streetcraft has piloted its model with 50
  Streetcraft fellows, referred through probation and other communitybased
  networks, who went through a work based contextualized learning experience and
  developed products for a retail store located on main street, Santa Monica.
  During this pilot period 100% of participants completed the pilot and 85%
  percent increased their annual income by 50%.

Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  Streetcraft has identified metrics to measure impact. To measure participant

  personal resiliency (University of Pennsylvania GRIT assessment) and
  professional skills (adobe certification). To measure community level impact,
  specifically decreases in graffiti, unemployment, and illicit street
  activities, we will work with local law enforcement to measure localized
  arrests for graffiti, calls for local graffiti “clean up,” arrests for drug
  dealing, and local unemployment rates collected by the State Department of
  Labor.  
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-

      public and social sector to refer youth into the program. Future referral
      partners will be youth development community based organizations seeking
      career opportunities for marginalized young people such as the boys and
      girls club, home boys INC. and other CBOs. In addition, Streetcraft is
      currently partnering with the department of probation to receive a
      court-mandated placement for youth arrested for graffiti.

      Streetcraft has identified metrics to measure impact. To measure
      participant level economic impact, we will track participants’ earned
      income through product sales and micro venture profits. To measure
      personal and professional skill development we will administer pre/post
      assessments of basic skills, personal resiliency (University of
      Pennsylvania GRIT assessment) and professional skills (adobe
      certification). To measure community level impact, specifically decreases
      in graffiti, unemployment, and illicit street activities, we will work
      with local law enforcement to measure localized arrests for graffiti,
      calls for local graffiti “clean up,” arrests for drug dealing, and local
      unemployment rates collected by the State Department of Labor.

    answer: "Streetcraft LA is a new social venture of the South Bay Center for Community Development (SBCC). SBCC is a long-standing non-profit organization that has been working to empower low-income communities in the greater Los Angeles area since 1976. SBCC has a long history of being one of those do-gooders that operates job-training programs to mitigate unemployment. The organization’s career pathway programs have been recognized by the United Way of Greater Los Angeles as a national best practice and were awarded a Everychild grant (one of the most competitive grants in LA) to apply its model to unemployed at risk youth.  In addition, the organization founded the Urban Teacher Fellowship, an initiative that moves underrepresented groups into the teaching profession funded by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation; and The Promo Pathway, a career pathway funded by The James Irvine Foundation and recognized by The Aspen Institute as a national best practice. In doing this work, however, we came to believe that job training wasn’t good enough. We needed to train entrepreneurs who can create their own jobs. So a team of us launched Streetcraft LA as a related, but autonomous social venture to train and incubate youth-led micro ventures. \r\n\r\nStreetcraft is currently testing its core components and theory of change in a proof of concept pilot state funded the James Irvine Foundation.  Guided by our board of directors, the focus of this planning stage was to test three assumptions critical to our model: marginalized youth engaged in graffiti culture or other illicit entrepreneur activities have talents that can be re-directed; a process of engagement can be created including partnerships with public systems and community based social networks; and youth’s talents can be monetized and professionalized. Streetcraft has piloted its model with 50 Streetcraft fellows, referred through probation and other community-based networks, who went through a work based contextualized learning experience and developed products for a retail store located on main street, Santa Monica. During this pilot period 100% of participants completed the pilot and 85% percent increased their annual income by 50%. \r\n"

      The status quo answer to youth unemployment is reductive, ineffective, but
      prevalent: provide youth with job training and education to help them get
      jobs. Streetcraft has a different approach. We don’t provide education and
      training to help young people get jobs. We provide education and training
      to empower youth to create their own jobs. We do this because
      entrepreneurship and the creative economy are the future. The factories
      are closed and design studios are hiring freelancers. This self-made
      creative economy is a natural fit for street hustlers and tag bangers. 
      Few organizations run a training program in urban arts, a retail store, a
      creative service agency, and launch micro ventures focusing on the
      creative economy.  Don’t get us wrong, there are a number of organizations
      that do one, or at most two, of these activities.  Some organizations
      operate revenue-generating platforms (social ventures) like our retail
      store such as Change agent productions, Barrio bonito, and Homeboy
      industries.  But these are really job training, not job creating
      programs.  Like streetcraft, however, Homeboy does target gang-involved
      youth with multiple barriers to employment and life success. It employs
      them in running a café and other social ventures, and it provides wrap
      around supportive services to support youth in re-integrating into their
      community and re-engaging with education. Homeboy does not engage youth in
      creating original apparel or creative services. Its social venture is
      focused on food services. Homeboy participants do not receive any direct
      instruction on small business development, business planning, or
      entrepreneurship; they receive no support in accessing capital or
      launching their own micro venture.  Homeboy will be, however, an important
      partner acting as a referral agency. In addition, Streetcraft will explore
      partnering with Homeboy’s to create an integrated retail dining social
      venture platform.The network for teaching entrepreneurship is
      streetcraft’s direct competition in incubating urban entrepreneurs. NTE is
      focused on exposing low income youth to entrepreneurship and developing
      entrepreneurial skills. Like Streetcraft, it targets at risk youth and
      offers a structured program that includes direct instruction on business
      plan development and concept ideation. The organization also, in its
      advance courses, offers students entrepreneurial coaching. Students also
      have limited access to start up capital in the form of local, regional,
      and national competition prizes. NTE works primarily within school systems
      and supports a wide range of low-income students in learning about
      entrepreneurship. Streetcraft has a specific focus on disengaged youth who
      are out of school and involved in the juvenile justice system. 
      Streetcraft’s goal is not to simply re-engage these youth through
      entrepreneurship, but improve their short term and long-term economic
      capacity by monetizing their talents, hiring them as fellows, and
      launching their own venture.

      Streetcraft’s vision for success in 2050 is ambition: reduce youth
      unemployment through creative economy entrepreneurship by 25% in Los
      Angeles. It’s imperative that we achieve this. Youth unemployment has long
      term and systemic consequences. Unemployed youth face lifelong diminished
      economic and social opportunity. Communities with high youth unemployment
      have higher crime rates and have higher rates of birth out of wedlock. And
      a country with high youth un-employment suffers. The tax base erodes.
      Civic engagement and trust in government decreases. And entitlement
      programs become unsustainable. It’s not a pretty picture; it is an issue
      that we must solve now, and Streetcraft LA can lead the way.
