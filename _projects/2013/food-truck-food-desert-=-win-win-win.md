title: 'Food Truck + Food Desert = Win Win Win! '
indicator: ' Health'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  <p>Imagine what would happen if a large supermarket chain deployed a small
  fleet of reimagined food trucks into the neighborhoods lacking access to
  fresh, healthy meals  neighborhoods where dialysis centers are popping up
  faster than the fast food joints that surround
  them...</p>                                                                                                                                           






  <p>Food deserts are the perfect storm of many social, political, and economic
  factors, not just access.  Many families simply can’t afford more nutritious
  foods, whether from traditional supermarkets or farmers markets, which have
  become more upscale than democratizing; singleparent or socalled latchkey
  homes often lack time to prepare truly healthy meals; and years of compounded
  challenges have meant that many residents of food deserts no longer know how
  to cook fresh, tasty meals from
  scratch.</p>                                                                                                                                           






  <p>Food trucks in Los Angeles have been the province of the uppermiddle
  classes — serving up specialty foods to those who can track their locations on
  Twitter via smartphones and wordofmouth.  But if we reframe the basic notion
  of food trucks, we have the potential to reach populations in need and can
  deliver much more than just mobile grocers, which are cropping up in places
  like Boston, Chicago, and Seattle.  The massive scale of Los Angeles,
  prototypical of a megacity defined by its sprawl, calls for a more versatile
  solution to address the complex dynamics underlying the health crisis
  spreading in food deserts.
  </p>                                                                     






  <p>Enter Curious Catalyst.  We’re a unique consultancy — more Swiss Army knife
  than agency  using agile and lean methodologies, credited for revolutionizing
  change in technology, to explore and rapidly iterate within urban solution
  spaces.  We believe that the old methods of topdown urban planning are worse
  than outdated — they’re irresponsible. Our cities are changing so fast that we
  must use new approaches to experiment, refine, and address realtime, relevant
  solutions for our
  communities.</p>                                                                                                  






  <p>Picture an established supermarket chain, in need of new revenue streams
  but unwilling to take a chance in less economicallydeveloped neighborhoods. 
  Now, consider the movers and shakers in that community who dream of opening
  restaurants, sharing recipes, and feeding their families back to top health. 
  Finally, how might we work with the existing Mom and Pop corner stores, who
  can’t afford to lose business to new markets, even ones that offer healthy
  alternatives.  Until now, no one has considered how to come up with a
  winwinwin situation.  But Curious Catalyst specializes in finding new middle
  ground, which benefits all
  stakeholders.</p>                                                                                                                                      






  <p>The CC Food Desert Food Truck pilot will explore how to leverage the
  distribution chain of an established supermarket brand, to offer prices that
  truly compete with fast food meals for the first time.  In addition to fresh
  fruits and vegetables, the CC Food Desert Food Trucks will provide a selection
  of prepared foods to help introduce new flavors and recipes, for families who
  may not have time to cook.  We’ll explore highlighting local LA chefs from
  different communities who promote simple, delicious, straightforward healthy
  eating. And, in order not to drive out neighborhood businesses, we will test
  partnering with existing bodegas and corner stores to set up regular schedules
  in an effort to drive more business.  In the long run, we can even imagine
  using the trucks to truly catalyze change, letting the supermarket use the
  existing bodegas as minimarts while the trucks move on to a new section of the
  neighborhood!</p>                                                                                                                                          






  <p>Given that lack of access to basic nutrition impacts the ability to
  maintain engagement in education, longterm health forecasts, and stable
  employment potential, enabling regular access to fresh foods and education
  around eating habits can rebuild a foundation of wellness in food deserts.  A
  modest investment in offering true food security has major impact later on the
  cost of medical services provided by the city, as well as the opportunities
  then available to the residents of lower income neighborhoods.  And this kind
  of health intervention is not only good for us but also a way to fuel social
  connectedness — food trucks are fun!</p>
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  <p>Curious Catalyst is a new consultancy that employs agile and lean
  methodologies typically associated with disruption in ICT to drive
  transformation and innovation in urban planning.  Composed of a senior corps
  of emerging platform strategists, Curious Catalyst engages subject matter
  expertise as well as citizen stakeholders to develop breakthrough MVPs.  We
  use a license model to incentivize project pioneers to open the core of the
  solutions we develop to other megacities.  For example, when we design a
  business model for addressing food deserts in Los Angeles, the plugandplay
  core “Experience Blueprint” will be released to other cities for a nominal
  license fee; this positions the pioneers as leaders in a given area of urban
  challenge but benefits the broader global community while providing upside to
  the initial stakeholder.  And we provide consulting services for localization
  and contextual adjustment.</p>






  <p>This disruptive business model was developed by founder, Kaz Brecher, as
  part of an accelerator project at THNK, the new Amsterdam School for Creative
  Leadership. The members of the Curious Catalyst team have collectively worked
  on strategy and implementation of solutions for everyone from the Library of
  Congress to Microsoft, and Disney to Oprah.  We’ve done hundreds of agile
  sprints in emerging platforms, and our expertise is easily applied to the
  complexities of urban challenges facing Los Angeles.</p>






  <p>The company has garnered support from some of the top architects and urban
  developers in the world, as we’re building our Advisory Board.  And as
  passionate believers in usercentered design, we are committed to genuine
  collaboration with all constituencies when developing approaches to these
  solutions.</p>
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  Since we aren’t investing in longterm infrastructure yet, we’ll approach a
  passionate Food Truck Pioneer, who'll let us use their staff and truck;
  involve a Chef to help strategize on meals and produce; work with a community
  group, like Farmworks, to navigate existing neighborhood relationships; and
  we’ll collaborate with a supermarket to test the realities of tapping into
  their distribution supply chain.  We’ll invite participation from food justice
  Subject Matter Experts, as well as food entrepreneurs, nonfood space design
  thinkers, and citizen stakeholders among others.  The goal is to balance
  orchestration of innovation processes while allowing the emergence of
  unexpected, communitydriven strategies by having the right mix of people.
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  <p>As with any lean Minimum Viable Product (MVP), our goal is to learn what
  resonates in the community and with all stakeholders and what needs to be
  adjusted — with both qualitative and quantitative data. The food truck is only
  one method of using a more distributed approach to bringing healthier options
  into food deserts.  So, the primary goal is to demonstrate the potential, both
  socially and economically, for this method of disrupting the cyclical, endemic
  challenges that comprise food deserts — bringing access to healthier foods as
  well as opportunity to gain employment as part of the changing landscape and
  ecosystem. </p>






  <p>In this sprint, we will test several elements of how food trucks promote
  health and food security in food deserts.  These parameters could include: the
  variety of fresh produce SKUs and prepared meals; whether healthy frozen foods
  are more easily sampled; ways to collaborate within the existing neighborhood
  structures with Mom and Pop businesses; possible models for franchise versus
  scaling a fleet; using rotating trucks to catalyze small bodegas as micromart
  locations for major markets; and the kind of POP materials needed to make the
  offering attractive and informative.  </p>






  <p>The sprint may be evaluated on several elements of the test, depending on
  how we define the MVP: cost of providing an affordable, healthy meal for a
  family as compared to a fast food option; interest and uptake of these meals;
  percentage of fresh produce purchased versus prepared food; interest in
  recipes handed out from the truck; buzz in the neighborhood around the idea
  and return visits to the truck.  Analysis will be conducted at the end of the
  prototyping phase, with an eye to shortterm and longterm scaling
  indicators.</p>






  <p>A successful MVP is one that points the direction for the next sprint,
  providing new data and discovery about hypotheses, and gains traction from the
  community around the core proposition.  Needless to say, food deserts are not
  a new problem.  And various groups have attempted to make a dent in the issues
  and impact on Los Angeles.  We deeply believe that it’s time for a new
  approach.  So, rather than evaluating this effort merely on what works and
  what doesn’t in the MVP, Curious Catalyst will consider this a successful
  sprint if we demonstrate the potential for this new agile urban method to
  tackling the complexity of the entrenched food desert challenge. </p>
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  <p>There is no reason that the simple pleasures and benefits of fresh food
  that are enjoyed by citizens in Santa Monica can’t be found in any other
  corner of the city.  Like a small house that is expanded room by room, until
  the wiring is a disastrous fire hazard, the LA sprawl has created pockets of
  neglect that leave citizens with unequal opportunity and weaker connections to
  the prosperity that the rest of Los Angeles enjoys.</p>






  <p>And childhood obesity is a problem that is having a tremendous impact on
  not only the state's physical health but also its financial health.  According
  to a report by the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research and the California
  Center for Public Health Advocacy, California spends more than $21 billion in
  public and private money on healthcare and other costs because of obesity,
  which increases the risk of diabetes, high blood pressure and other diseases
  later in life.  Access to better basic nutrition tends to prevent longerterm
  chronic diseases, adding a buffer against the ramifications of lack of
  insurance.</p>






  <p>The CC Food Desert Food Truck project will prove that it’s possible to
  bring affordable access to fresh, healthy foods into neighborhoods in South or
  Central Los Angeles through new approaches, while exploring ways that the
  trucks could deliver even more benefit.  For example, a fleet of trucks could:
  create new jobs, provide education around eating habits and the causes of
  childhood diabetes and heart disease, offer new flavors and cuisines in areas
  where fast food is the only option, and create a sense of festivity with a
  regular schedule, building more social cohesion into neighborhoods.  </p>






  <p>But this is just the beginning.  Los Angeles could fast be positioned as a
  leading innovator in food security issues, by taking this rapid iteration
  approach in the context of public/private partnership — testing everything
  from multiuse trucks (meals combined with basic health monitoring from
  timetotime) to franchises for anyone interested in starting a new business. 
  The point is to START!  We can’t wait for more task force reports or think
  tank strategies.  Involving residents in creating the city in which they want
  to thrive would be a success in itself.  We give power back to the people,
  while we facilitate a vision for a healthier Los Angeles.</p>
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  <p>The only boarded up buildings in South Central Los Angeles will be the old
  dialysis centers, a reminder of services no longer needed.  Food truck drivers
  will be as beloved a neighborhood institution as the ice cream truck driver of
  the 1950s was. The cost of chronic health care needs will have dropped
  significantly, and more taxpayer dollars can be reallocated to community
  gardens and planting food forests along parkways.  </p>






  <p>Los Angeles will see a decrease in rates of childhood obesity and Type 2
  diabetes, an increase in high school graduates from neighborhoods formerly
  known as food deserts, and the proliferation of new small businesses focused
  on food, from corner stores to restaurants to artisan goods.  Disparities in
  chronic diseases and health outcomes between those living inside and outside
  of the food deserts of the past would be indistinguishable.</p>






  <p>As basic nutritional needs are met in every corner of the city, today’s
  young people and families will be better able to contribute to their own
  prosperity — pursuing educational and employment opportunities, giving back in
  their own neighborhoods, and shaping the next 50 years of Los Angeles.</p>
