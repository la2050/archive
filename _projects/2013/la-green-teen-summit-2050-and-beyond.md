  success: "<p>Using Salesforce, ACE maintains a robust macrometrics system, tracking efficiency and output of our educator force nationwide as well as our activities in schools and with partner organizations.

  description: "Over the course of the LA Green Teen Summit, these young leaders will identify the “hot topic” for LA that they want to focus on in the coming semester. This might be greening their local community, starting with elevating the rate of waste recovery on their school campus, through to carbon reduction initiatives in support of LA’s goals to reduce its emissions and dependence on fossil fuels. \r\n\r\nFollowing the Summit, ACE will support the students in taking action on the key issue that they identified as critical for immediate priority. Taking the skills that they learned, youth leaders will come together in smaller teams to tackle the issue in their local communities, share their ideas for citywide action and campaign for the initiatives that they want to see implemented.\r\n\r\nACE will offer mentoring and guidance, connecting teens to relevant partners and helping them to arrange meetings with district authorities, local politicians, and civic leaders.\r\n\r\nStudent leaders will be connected to each other at the Summit and beyond, through online interactions and offline actions that they will take together, supported by ACE. \r\n\r\nIn December, the teens will come together again for a half-day Town Hall meeting with key representatives from the city of LA and local media. Selected student leaders, supported by their peers, will address the panel of guests and lobby for the changes that they want to see in their city. The city representatives will be given the opportunity to respond with a facilitated Q&A session.\r\n\r\nThe event will be set up and publicized well in advance, providing an opportunity for the city authorities to hear the collective voice of youth speak about what they want to see happen now – and over the next 10, 20, 30 years – to ensure a thriving, sustainable future for LA."

  description3: "<p>We take great pride in the name of our organization. As the Alliance for Climate Education, we believe in the power of education, the truth of climate science, and the necessity of alliance to make change happen. We seek to partner with climate and environmental organizations that share our values and ideals. We are collaborating with other organizations to assess the business and social case for energy conservation and other mitigation efforts, to develop new relationships with school district officials, and to promote positive stories of youth-driven energy conservation through national media. ACE also seeks partners to provide experience and opportunities for our most promising youth leaders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ACE’s programs are unique as there are no other organizations that address the issue of climate change through integrated education, action and leadership programs in high schools that have a clear method of engagement for long-term results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our strategy for 2013 is founded on building on existing partnerships, developing and nurturing new, long-term alliances, and partnering to share best practice with and learn from other organizations that are working to develop next generation leadership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As well as the partners named for this project (see above), ACE will continue to collaborate or partner nationally with organizations that play critical roles in activating climate leadership among youth and young adults.

  vision: "<p>ACE has a vision for LA and the nation, in which a generation of informed and connected American youth realizes its potential to act, innovate and influence others as an organized force to successfully confront the climate crisis.

  <p>ACE knows that LA teens are motivated and passionate about their city.
  We’ve seen it in the work we’ve been doing in LA high schools for the past
  four years, delivering climate science education and action programs to
  students. Most recently, we saw it when our students joined the Forward on
  Climate Rally on March 17th, 2013, gaining the attention of the public, the
  media, and the White House.</p>






  <p>LA’s game changers are in our high schools. This generation is more mobile
  and better connected than ever before, with new technology and social
  networking revolutionizing their potential to share ideas, build a movement
  and drive significant and sustainable change.</p>






  <p>We want to bring all that energy, commitment and innovation together, in
  one room, and engage LA’s youth in leading the changes we need to see in our
  city.</p>






  <p>Over 200 high school seniors drawn from schools across LA, will be invited
  to participate in an LA Green Teen Summit, networking with their peers and
  connecting their shared passion to lead the movement against climate change
  and a vision of their city’s future — environmentally and economically
  sustainable and thriving.</p>






  <p>ACE will organize and deliver the two-day event, which will include
  seminars and training sessions co-facilitated by key individuals from partner
  organizations, as well as plenary presentations and Q&A. Students will have
  the opportunity to take part in education experiences as well as skills
  sessions, where they will learn team working, leadership and campaign skills,
  such as effective lobbying and public speaking.</p>






  <p>ACE’s team in LA will leverage their unparalleled reach into high schools
  across the city, through relationships with teachers, administrators and
  school districts, to invite teens together for the Green Teen Summit.</p>






  <p>The Summit may be scheduled to coincide with PowerShift 2013, drawing from
  and in solidarity with the event in Pittsburgh, PA on October 18-21.
  http://www.wearepowershift.org/</p>






  <p>ACE Educators in LA will bring campaign organizing expertise, building from
  student leadership training and mentoring that they have been delivering over
  the past 3 years.</p>






  <p>With the support of ACE trainings and mentorship, ACE’s green teen leaders
  have crafted a mission and message for “Waste Free Schools” in LA,  that they
  will be delivering to City Hall via a peaceful, student-led rally at the
  CicLAvia event on April 21, 2013. http://www.ciclavia.org/</p>
