title: Youth for Environmental Justice and Community Revitalization
indicator: ' Environmental Quality'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >+
  Low income communities of color are disproportionately impacted by cumulative
  sources of pollution and poor land use decisions.  The only way these
  disparities can be seriously addressed is for wellinformed community members
  to engage in the decisionmaking process.  Our idea is to build a generation of
  civic leaders that will work with different stakeholders to transform their
  communities and their neighborhoods toward more sustainable and livable
  environments.  In this project we propose to offer a wide range of leadership
  development and technical trainings related to civic engagement and
  environmental stewardship.  These trainings will build the capacity of a
  dedicated group of youth activists, leaders and future decisionmakers in
  Southeast Los Angeles County and in the Harbor areawhich is host to some of
  the most polluted and vulnerable communities in the Los Angeles region.  Here
  are the activities that CBE proposes:






  Leadership Development Trainings:  Youth will complete an intensive 6week,
  18hour summer training. Youth will learn how and why pollution
  disproportionately affects lowincome communities of color (Session I); the
  locations of the most egregious polluting industries in their communities
  (Session 2); pollution’s detrimental effects on human health in their
  communities (Session 3); the environmental decisionmaking processes in their
  communities (Session 4); how community efforts can successfully stop or
  prevent pollution (Session 5); and how communities develop a vision for
  protecting and improving their environments (Session 6).  Educational and
  teambuilding elements of the trainings will help youth build motivation to
  become leaders in community environmental stewardship. 






  Mono Lake Trainings:  Youth and adults will participate in intergenerational
  “Parent Night” workshops on water issues and Mono Lake. Youth, with CBE staff,
  will participate in 5day, 4night educational field trips and trainings at Mono
  Lake, hosted by the Mono Lake Committee. Youth will learn to analyze the
  relationship between Mono Lake and the Southern California water supply, how
  to gather and test water samples to assess the health of water, and uses for
  this data. By learning about water conservation practices and about the impact
  of Southern California water use on Mono Lake, they will develop motivation to
  conserve water on individual and household levels, for example by turning off
  the tap while showering or brushing teeth and by using waterefficient systems
  to water plants.  






  LA River Stewardship Training:  Youth will each attend 1.5hour LA River
  Stewardship workshops and one of three, 2.5hour LA River Stewardship kayaking
  field trips with CBE and LA River Expeditions staff. During the workshops,
  youth will learn about water pollution issues related to the LA River, the
  history of the revitalization of the upper portion of the river, and current
  community efforts to revitalize the lower portion. Youth will learn to analyze
  the relationships between mobile sources of pollution and river water quality,
  and between the future health of the lower portion of the river and planning
  for Highway I710, which runs next to it. During the postfield trip workshop,
  all youth will gather to compare the upper and lower LA River, to analyze the
  impact of river pollution on human health, to problemsolve better solutions,
  and to conduct a visioning process for river stewardship. 






  Stormwater Pollution Trainings:  Youth will participate in one 1.5hour
  stormwater pollution workshops and water sampling field trips with CBE and LA
  Waterkeeper staff. The workshops, coled by CBE staff and LA Waterkeeper, will
  teach youth to think critically about industrial water pollution and how the
  Clean Water Act can be used to reduce it. During the field trips, youth will
  see and learn how industrial runoff contaminates ecological systems and
  affects the health of humans and other species and will gather water samples
  to be evaluated for pollution levels. 


What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: "*\tWorking with adult and youth members in refinery communities to achieve precedentsetting standards to prevent chemical leaks from thousands of valves at oil refineries and mandating vapor controls on refinery tankers loading in California. This historic regulation is now a national standard. \n\n\n\n\n\n*\tWorking with adult and youth members to significantly strengthen the California South Coast Air Quality Management District’s Rule 1402 to reduce allowable cancer risks from air pollution from stationary sources of pollution by 75%. \n\n\n\n\n\n*\tWorking with adult and youth members in refinery communities in California to achieve the nation’s most stringent regulations of “flaring,” or burning of excess gases by refineries, at both the Bay Area and South Coast Air Quality Management Districts, now a national working model that can be put in place at all refineries. In the South Coast air shed alone, by December of 2012, this regulation has achieved an estimated reduction of 1.18 tons per day of SO2 (sulfur dioxide) and 1.44 tons per day of CO2 (carbon dioxide). \n\n\n\n\n\n*\tWorking in intergenerational settings to lead a successful campaign against construction of an unneeded and highlypolluting power plant in the City of Vernon, California. This prevented an annual emission of 1.8 million pounds of local and regional pollution and 5.5 billion pounds of greenhouse gases from entering the environment. It also created regional awareness about health impacts of pollution, energy planning, and contributed to exposing corruption in Vernon’s city governance.   \n\n\n\n\n\n*\tWorking with Youth members to defeat an unnecessary polluting power plant proposal in the City of South Gate, California.  This campaign is analyzed in Power Politics, a book written by UCLA social anthropologist, Karen Bodkin.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\tWorking with youth and adult members along the Long Beach Freeway (I710) corridor and in coalition with other environmental and community groups to create an unprecedented public participation framework in the I710 freeway expansion project led by Caltrans and Metro. We used this strategic opportunity to elevate community demands for a cleaner, healthier project. \n\n\n\n\n\n*\tWorking with youth and adult members, allies and academic partners to introduce a novel policy initiative in the City of Los Angeles called Clean Up Green Up to address cumulative impacts from multiple pollution sources and environmental health and justice concerns in city planning. Relying on participatory action research methods and engaging community members in the Wilmington area from the early phases of policy formulation, CBE staff and community members engaged with experts, allies, city councilmembers and the Mayor’s office to win their support for this policy. \n\n\n\n\n\n*\tBuilding one of the most successful and vibrant environmental justice youth programs in the country during the past 15 years in Southeast Los Angeles County.\n\n\n"
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: "*\tMono Lake Committee\n\n\n*\tLA River Expeditions \n\n\n*\tLos Angeles Waterkeeper"
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  Evaluation strategies and tools will include, at a minimum: (a) plus/delta
  evaluations of all meetings, trainings, activities, recorded on butcher paper
  during the meeting, then transcribed into electronic format;  (b) pre and
  postsurveys for selected attitudes, knowledge and skills; (c) results of pre
  and postsurveys conducted by Mono Lake Committee for youth members who
  participate in Mono Lake field trips; (d) monitoring of quarterly staff work
  plans by supervisors to ensure that satisfactory progress is being made on
  project elements; and (d) endofyear evaluations in December/January of each
  year.
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  Environmental justice communities are at the fenceline of polluting sources. 
  Creating greener and cleaner operations at the fenceline neighborhoods and
  improving landuse decisions in vulnerable communities will not only promote
  the public health of residents most in need but also benefit the entire LA
  region.  Addressing environmental equity for communities that have
  traditionally been neglected due to gaps in proper permitting, enforcement and
  planning will create great environmental benefits to the most susceptible LA
  communities by way of improved air quality, reduction of water pollution,
  enhanced access to open space, revitalization of blighted lands, greater
  access to healthy food options, greater community cohesion and overall
  improvement of quality of life.  






  These benefits will not be limited to the areas that will be receiving direct
  attention. They will have a positive impact on all of the residents in the
  region by reducing pollution and spurring economic growth regionally.  Working
  with businesses with industrial operations in environmental justice
  communities to better manage their storm water runoff will protect our
  waterways and the Pacific Ocean. Pushing for zero emission technologies during
  the expansion of goodsmovement operations near Wilmington and along the I710
  corridor will benefit all communities in Los Angeles.   Prioritizing green
  jobs and clean energy sources in lowincome neighborhoods will benefit all LA
  residents and our planet by way of reducing our region’s carbon footprint. We
  believe the main component of improving the quality of life for vulnerable
  communities is enhancing civic engagement of local residents in these
  communities, and this project is focused on this effort.
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  We hope that in 2050, environmental justice communities will rank high in a
  wide range of sustainability indicators. Clean water, clean air, safe streets
  for walking and biking, an improved public transportation system, revitalized
  brownfields, more open/green space, more access to healthy food outlets and
  nutrition,  more engaged communities, and more accountable decisionmakers will
  be the indicators that will demonstrate significant improvements in the
  current disparities in environmental justice communities.
