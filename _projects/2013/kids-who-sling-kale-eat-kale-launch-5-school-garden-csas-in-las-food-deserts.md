title: 'Kids who sling kale eat kale: Launch 5 School Garden CSAs in LAs Food Deserts'
project_summary: "<p>Let us give kids jobs this summer growing and selling vegetables at 5 sites throughout Los Angeles. Let us finance their would-be produce empires with a replicable model that gives their non-profit partners or even \"just classroom teachers\" the means to enable young eaters to engage in the business of #food.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can expand our current program model of urban school garden and rural farm partnership and create Muir Ranch Community Supported Agriculture satellites (CSA) that insert really amazing food into high need communities at the same time provide opportunities for non-profits with the energy and vision to be social entrepreneurs. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>We work with farmers and their California abundance to provide really awesome food from the Santa Monica and Hollywood Farmers Markets. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>WHO WE ARE IS MUIR RANCH.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are a growing teen jobs program that looks like a 2 acre school farm, CSA vegetable social enterprise and catering start up. We have nearly 200 customers, 50 of whom are low income and fully subsidized via a Pasadena Children's Health Foundation grant, that receive the same weekly veg. box as our retail clients. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our model gives our students at Muir High School the opportunity to run a business. We spend little time as \"nutrition educators\" preaching about the value of kale, kohlrabi and persimmons. But if the kids want to be successful business people they have to know their \"product,\" so they eat it. No drama. No fuss. If you want to work here, eat kale. Michelle Obama would be so proud.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We started our program, not unlike Steve Jobs and that other Steve in a garage, with a vision and just ourselves as customers. Last year one teacher, then a neighbor and then a parent signed up. We had 20 customers our first month. With just under 200 customers currently we spend $6,000 a month on our produce, money for farmers, and we gross $12-15,000 per month from our client base. Everyone eats. Everyone. And our $30 weekly box is 50% tax-deductible. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our vegetable subscription box is a better choice for our students, 90% of whom are on \"free and reduced\" school lunches and food stamps, SNAP. According to the Social Justice Learning Institute, LA families only spend 1-2% of their federal benefit on fresh fruits and vegetables, i.e. healthy food. Unacceptable. Horrible. And if you are Dr. Jonathon Fielding of LA County Health you can predict the billion dollar health economic impacts of diet on LA in 2050. Obesity, diabetes, hyper-tension, let alone the self-esteem and physical suffering associated with junk food, fast food and all things \"flaming hot.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Couple that with the teen unemployment rate in NW Pasadena, Boyle Hts, Crenshaw, Sylmar and Inglewood you can paint a bleak picture. While we are a teaching program with at-risk, low income and other challenged youth and it is about process, we do, however, PRODUCE. As my students say, \"it's expensive being a teenager, Mr. Mud.\" A simple paycheck is a game changer for my kids, 90% of whom who have never received one before. The simple dignity of having a phone is something that motivates my kids like no other. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>We deliver our CSA to the City of Pasadena Health Dept, City Hall and the school district headquarters.

  vision: "Currently, there are 5,000 acres of asphalt in LA Unified School District campuses.

  about_you: 'Pasadena, CA '
  Does your project impact Los Angeles County?: 'yes'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  <p>Let us give kids jobs this summer growing and selling vegetables at 5 sites
  throughout Los Angeles. Let us finance their wouldbe produce empires with a
  replicable model that gives their nonprofit partners or even "just classroom
  teachers" the means to enable young eaters to engage in the business of
  #food.</p>






  <p>We can expand our current program model of urban school garden and rural
  farm partnership and create Muir Ranch Community Supported Agriculture
  satellites (CSA) that insert really amazing food into high need communities at
  the same time provide opportunities for nonprofits with the energy and vision
  to be social entrepreneurs. </p>






  <p>We work with farmers and their California abundance to provide really
  awesome food from the Santa Monica and Hollywood Farmers Markets. </p>






  <p>WHO WE ARE IS MUIR RANCH.</p>






  <p>We are a growing teen jobs program that looks like a 2 acre school farm,
  CSA vegetable social enterprise and catering start up. We have nearly 200
  customers, 50 of whom are low income and fully subsidized via a Pasadena
  Children's Health Foundation grant, that receive the same weekly veg. box as
  our retail clients. </p>






  <p>Our model gives our students at Muir High School the opportunity to run a
  business. We spend little time as "nutrition educators" preaching about the
  value of kale, kohlrabi and persimmons. But if the kids want to be successful
  business people they have to know their "product," so they eat it. No drama.
  No fuss. If you want to work here, eat kale. Michelle Obama would be so
  proud.</p>






  <p>We started our program, not unlike Steve Jobs and that other Steve in a
  garage, with a vision and just ourselves as customers. Last year one teacher,
  then a neighbor and then a parent signed up. We had 20 customers our first
  month. With just under 200 customers currently we spend $6,000 a month on our
  produce, money for farmers, and we gross $1215,000 per month from our client
  base. Everyone eats. Everyone. And our $30 weekly box is 50% taxdeductible.
  </p>






  <p>Our vegetable subscription box is a better choice for our students, 90% of
  whom are on "free and reduced" school lunches and food stamps, SNAP. According
  to the Social Justice Learning Institute, LA families only spend 12% of their
  federal benefit on fresh fruits and vegetables, i.e. healthy food.
  Unacceptable. Horrible. And if you are Dr. Jonathon Fielding of LA County
  Health you can predict the billion dollar health economic impacts of diet on
  LA in 2050. Obesity, diabetes, hypertension, let alone the selfesteem and
  physical suffering associated with junk food, fast food and all things
  "flaming hot."</p>






  <p>Couple that with the teen unemployment rate in NW Pasadena, Boyle Hts,
  Crenshaw, Sylmar and Inglewood you can paint a bleak picture. While we are a
  teaching program with atrisk, low income and other challenged youth and it is
  about process, we do, however, PRODUCE. As my students say, "it's expensive
  being a teenager, Mr. Mud." A simple paycheck is a game changer for my kids,
  90% of whom who have never received one before. The simple dignity of having a
  phone is something that motivates my kids like no other. </p>






  <p>We deliver our CSA to the City of Pasadena Health Dept, City Hall and the
  school district headquarters. We host open houses on Mondays for our school
  site pick up. Just having the students meet the customers, take checks, and
  provide customer service is a game changer. And the clients? They get kale.

What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  My students have iPods and don't wear county ankle bracelets any more. 






  Alondra, Jacqui, Perla and Lali, all 1518 yearold students, help manage a
  6figure start up: schedule, distribution and payroll.






  They steal all the customers champagne grapes during the season. The business
  part of me cringes. The teacher says, "go ahead, eat them. they're good for
  you and the customers don't know they were in the CSA anyway."






  My kids know how to grow a "green zebra" tomato.






  We won this year's "Green Curriculum" award from the Green School Summit. We
  don't have an actual curriculum. We do have an actual business. As an employer
  what matters to you???






  Not a single case of foodborn illness to date. Knock wood. Clean hands.






  We haven't missed a single CSA distribution since launch. Consistency.






  50 Lowincome families receive free CSA boxes thanks to the Pasadena Children's
  Health Foundation. The wait list for other familes is 23 times this.






  We have been approved by the USDA for SNAP electronic payments.






  We host the LA County Master Gardeners, the largest food justice group in Los
  Angeles, as of this year. The LA County Master Food Preservers are not far
  behind.






  Amongst Whole Foods' Whole Kids Foundation's 2,000 plus school garden grantees
  our grant was 5 times the average amount and the only one given in the country
  as a social enterprise business. The kids are invited to Austin, Texas in 2014
  for the national corporate meeting.






  We've brought on chef Ernie Miller of the Hollywood Farmers' Market to teach
  in our semiendowed "Julia Child Culinary Chair" as the kids learn to cook
  chard, kale, lentils and shiso. Yes, shiso. 






  Our second long table dinner at Muir Ranch with chef Matthew Poley of Heirloom
  LA in April 14. Come eat.

Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >+
  Financials.






  Within a year we will have obvious successful models and ones that need
  improvement amongst our 5 new partner sites. IF the satellites can build
  customers and secure additional funding they will grow. Their financials will
  paint a picture of the economics. How many jobs? How many customers? Is it
  sustainable?









  Health.






  What is the cost of "being healthy." What is the cost of not? We can call on
  our Health Dept partners to measure in avery "epidemiological" way the effects
  of the CSA on the students, staff, and community. 









  Beauty.






  Kale or asphalt?





How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
  Provide lowincome teens jobs, work experience, socent exposure and fresh,
  organic veg.






  Weigh the students, measure health impact






  Bootstrap wouldbe schoolgarden based produce nonprofit companies and teachers
  with an executable economic model 






  Insert fresh, organic produce into "food deserts." 






  Support urban/rural farm partnerships in California






  Identity best practices in the school garden/rural farm CSA model


What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  Currently, there are 5,000 acres of asphalt in LA Unified School District
  campuses. If we are do be more sustainable, half of that amount could be fruit
  trees with their shade and apples or gardens with kale. 






  The students we teach now will be in their midfifties by then. If they develop
  an awareness of the natural world and the importance of diet we'll only be in
  a better world for it.
