title: Increasing Capacity for College Going
project_summary: >-
  The Pullias Center for Higher Education is dedicated to improving access to
  college for low-income and historically under-represented students. The
  academic arm of our Center has focused on: (1) researching how students,
  families and schools define and address challenges related to college going
  and (2) identifying effective strategies for improving college going outcomes.
  Our publications are widely used as guides by practitioners across the
  country.  Yet just as significant, our Center has developed a three-pronged
  outreach approach where we work with schools and students to provide high
  quality college guidance and support; the three programs we run rank among the
  Center’s most important achievements to date. The first program we developed –
  I AM (Increasing Access through Mentoring) provides targeted college guidance
  support to juniors and seniors in high school as they prepare to apply for
  college. Many of the students we work with will be the first in their families
  to attend college. Many also attend high schools with exorbitant counselor to
  student ratios. I AM mentors work with school based counselors to identify
  students who might slip through the cracks and then meet with students
  regularly to make sure the (very complicated) college application process goes
  smoothly. Once students are accepted to colleges, mentors help students figure
  out financial aid awards and provide students with support as they decide
  where to go.  We’ve helped over 1,000 students get into college since starting
  the program in 2005.  The SummerTIME (Tool Information Motivation Education)
  program focuses on college completion. We bring students who have graduated
  from LAUSD schools and who will be heading to four-year colleges/universities
  to USC for a month-long intensive writing program. The curriculum is infused
  with lessons on college knowledge such has how to balance finances, how to
  interact with professors and how to cultivate effective study skills.   The
  third program provides a twist to traditional college outreach approaches. We
  decided to meet students where they choose to spend after-school hours – in
  cyberspace! We partnered with USC’s Game Innovation Lab and students from
  Foshay Learning Center to create a series of role-playing games about college
  and careers. Our games were developed and pilot tested in Los Angeles and are
  now utilized nationally. My LA2050 funding would enable us to expand these
  programs and train practitioners on how to make use of the game-based tools.

  success: "With regards to the effects of the programs on students outcomes, we will measure success by administering surveys to students prior to and post participation in our programs. The surveys will be designed to collect data on the effects of the program on college knowledge and college-going efficacy. We also will conduct selected focus groups with students and practitioners in order to gain a deeper  understanding of which practices are working best for students and their teachers and/or counselors.\r\nWe will also evaluate the project by analyzing the numbers of game players and if/how those numbers increase, thus increasing traction in the project. We will also analyze back-end server data related to the games in order to ascertain the effects of game play on students' college aspirations and/or plans."

  brief: >-
    Our primary goal is to increase college attendance throughout the
    under-served communities of Los Angeles which will have a major impact on
    improving education in Los Angeles and the state of California.  There are
    thousands of students that attend schools in Los Angeles that are not
    getting the information they need to help them with the college going
    process.  They have the grades and have taken the required courses but are
    overwhelmed and confused about the college application process so choose not
    to attend college or go directly to a community college instead of a
    four-year institution. Attending a community college is not a bad option but
    may take students at least 3-4 years to transfer to a four-year college if
    they ultimately want to receive a Bachelor’s degree. The programs that we
    offer target first generation, low-income, college-bound seniors from
    low-performing high schools and assist them with the college-going process.
    The I AM( Increasing Access via Mentoring) program is a mentoring program
    that provides assistance with the college choice, college admissions and
    financial aid processes. The SummerTIME (Tools, Information, Motivation, and
    Education) program teaches advanced writing and “College Knowledge” (e.g.
    time management, note-taking, financial literacy) to support participating
    students' transition to the freshman year.  Finally, Collegeology includes
    games (Application Crunch and Mission: Admission) that teach strategies for
    navigating the college application process in fun and interactive ways. The
    first game is a card game, the second is a Facebook Application. In April,
    we’ll be launching FutureBound, a game targeting middle school students that
    illustrates the connection between making good decisions in middle school
    and college/career. We are currently working on a game that fosters
    financial literacy and knowledge about financial aid options for college. 
    Here’s the challenge: with I AM and SummerTIME, we are limited by resources
    as to how many students we can serve. With the online games, we need to
    train teachers and practitioners on how to use the games. The 2050 grant
    would help us expand the capacity of these programs.  We currently work with
    11 high schools and serve approximately 300 students but we would like to
    expand our college-going model so that we can serve a wider student
    population in Los Angeles.  Our programs contain tools that can be
    replicated on a larger scale so that more students will have the opportunity
    to be accepted to college and receive a college education.  A My LA2050
    grant would enable us to train more mentors, implement guidance activities
    at more schools, expand services offered and ensure college opportunity for
    a larger number of students.
  budget explanation: >-
    The $100,000 grant would allow us to expand our activities by providing
    approximately $60,000 toward additional part-time salaries and benefits for
    outreach support staff, communication and media support staff and instructor
    and workshop training staff.  This is necessary as all USC Pullias Center
    staff salaries and benefits are 100% grant funded. Staff will work directly
    with students to provide college information and support services.
    Furthermore, staff will identify partner businesses and train volunteers to
    serve as mentors. After mentors are trained, project staff will provide
    ongoing and frequent support to mentors to ensure they are providing
    effective support.  The remaining $40,000 in funding will be used toward
    programmatic costs.  These costs include covering low-income students’
    college application fees, college prep (SAT) testing fees,  and student
    resources such as college admission tools.  Funding will enable us to take
    students on local college campus tours and provide college application and
    financial aid training (FAFSA) workshops for both volunteer mentors,
    students, and their parents.  A minimal amount of the funding would support
    volunteer live scan fees and local travel costs for outreach staff and
    volunteers.

    Our project will help improve the college-going rates at high schools that
    have the lowest college-going rates within the Los Angeles Unified School
    District.  Many students who are eligible for college choose not to attend
    college because they receive little support on how to navigate the
    college-going process or lack the information on how to apply.  By pairing
    mentors with high school seniors who are college-eligible, they can
    successfully guide them through the college application process.   The high
    school graduation rate in California ranks in the bottom half of all U.S.
    states, with the Los Angeles Unified School District’s own graduation rate
    well below the state’s, according to the U.S. Department of Education. 
    Budget cuts have severely affected the amount of college counselors at the
    schools. A shortage of counselors limits the support that students receive
    regarding the college application process. Traditionally, California
    students' access to counselors varies by grade level, and 29 percent of
    California school districts have no counseling programs at all. The ratio of
    students per counselor in California averages 945 to 1, compared to the
    national average of 477 to 1, ranking California last in the nation.  In Los
    Angeles, the average ratio is 800 students to 1 guidance counselor. Many
    under-resourced schools have guidance counselors, but not dedicated college
    counselors. Students attending private schools and public schools in
    affluent parts of the city are afforded very different access to college
    information and support, often supplemented by parents employing private
    college counselors to shepherd their children through the complexity of
    college applications. Thus the gap between those who have access to
    resources and those who don’t remains stark; the implications for college
    graduation rates and lifetime earning potential are obvious.  By having
    volunteers serve as mentors, they can alleviate the burden of college
    counselors having to work with enormous case loads and students can have the
    one on one interaction needed to understand how to navigate the college
    admissions and financial aid processes.

    Central to the mission of the Pullias Center is a commitment to conducting
    practitioner-oriented research and sharing best practices. While there are
    multiple organizations in Los Angeles designed to provide college outreach
    services to low-income students, we do not view them as competitors. Rather
    we work with them as collaborators. We value their input and often involve
    their practitioners on our advisory board to guide our research and program
    development. We also translate research findings for practitioner audiences
    and make an effort to share our game products with other organizations in
    order to improve the college access and completion landscape in Los Angeles.
    Unfortunately, the high drop-out rates and low college-going rates of
    students in Los Angeles are concerning. We simply need as many organizations
    and individuals working together to figure out solutions and provide support
    to students and teachers/counselors in a concerted effort.
  vision: >-
    Currently California ranks 40th among the states in the rate of high school
    graduates going directly to college.  By 2050, we hope to increase
    college-going rates by 15-20% by working directly with students who are
    eligible to attend college but lack the information and guidance to do so. 
    Young adults who delay college attendance also delay the economic and social
    benefits of higher education, benefits that accrue both to the individuals
    and to the state which contributes to our economy. In addition, research on
    college completion shows that students who follow the traditional college
    enrollment pattern of entering college immediately following high school are
    more likely to graduate from college.  California’s population is expected
    to grow from 37 million to approximately 60 million by 2050.  Since our
    population will dramatically increase by 2050, it is imperative that we have
    a college-educated population that will contribute to our economy.  We
    understand that it may not be realistic for every student to receive a
    college degree but it’s important that they are pointed in a direction that
    offers as many opportunities as possible and that they learn invaluable
    skills that are required for long-term and sustainable employment.  We would
    like to expand our programs so that we can serve at least 1,000-2,000
    students during the academic year.

Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  With regards to the effects of the programs on students outcomes, we will
  measure success by administering surveys to students prior to and post
  participation in our programs. The surveys will be designed to collect data on
  the effects of the program on college knowledge and collegegoing efficacy. We
  also will conduct selected focus groups with students and practitioners in
  order to gain a deeper  understanding of which practices are working best for
  students and their teachers and/or counselors.



  We will also evaluate the project by analyzing the numbers of game players and
  if/how those numbers increase, thus increasing traction in the project. We
  will also analyze backend server data related to the games in order to
  ascertain the effects of game play on students' college aspirations and/or
  plans.
