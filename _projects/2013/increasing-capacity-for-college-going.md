title: Increasing Capacity for College Going
project_summary: >-
  Our primary goal is to increase college attendance throughout the under-served
  communities of Los Angeles which will have a major impact on improving
  education in Los Angeles and the state of California.  There are thousands of
  students that attend schools in Los Angeles that are not getting the
  information they need to help them with the college going process.  They have
  the grades and have taken the required courses but are overwhelmed and
  confused about the college application process so choose not to attend college
  or go directly to a community college instead of a four-year institution.
  Attending a community college is not a bad option but may take students at
  least 3-4 years to transfer to a four-year college if they ultimately want to
  receive a Bachelor’s degree. The programs that we offer target first
  generation, low-income, college-bound seniors from low-performing high schools
  and assist them with the college-going process. The I AM( Increasing Access
  via Mentoring) program is a mentoring program that provides assistance with
  the college choice, college admissions and financial aid processes. The
  SummerTIME (Tools, Information, Motivation, and Education) program teaches
  advanced writing and “College Knowledge” (e.g. time management, note-taking,
  financial literacy) to support participating students' transition to the
  freshman year.  Finally, Collegeology includes games (Application Crunch and
  Mission: Admission) that teach strategies for navigating the college
  application process in fun and interactive ways. The first game is a card
  game, the second is a Facebook Application. In April, we’ll be launching
  FutureBound, a game targeting middle school students that illustrates the
  connection between making good decisions in middle school and college/career.
  We are currently working on a game that fosters financial literacy and
  knowledge about financial aid options for college.  Here’s the challenge: with
  I AM and SummerTIME, we are limited by resources as to how many students we
  can serve. With the online games, we need to train teachers and practitioners
  on how to use the games. The 2050 grant would help us expand the capacity of
  these programs.  We currently work with 11 high schools and serve
  approximately 300 students but we would like to expand our college-going model
  so that we can serve a wider student population in Los Angeles.  Our programs
  contain tools that can be replicated on a larger scale so that more students
  will have the opportunity to be accepted to college and receive a college
  education.  A My LA2050 grant would enable us to train more mentors, implement
  guidance activities at more schools, expand services offered and ensure
  college opportunity for a larger number of students.

  The Pullias Center for Higher Education is dedicated to improving access to
  college for low-income and historically under-represented students. The
  academic arm of our Center has focused on: (1) researching how students,
  families and schools define and address challenges related to college going
  and (2) identifying effective strategies for improving college going outcomes.
  Our publications are widely used as guides by practitioners across the
  country.  Yet just as significant, our Center has developed a three-pronged
  outreach approach where we work with schools and students to provide high
  quality college guidance and support; the three programs we run rank among the
  Center’s most important achievements to date. The first program we developed –
  I AM (Increasing Access through Mentoring) provides targeted college guidance
  support to juniors and seniors in high school as they prepare to apply for
  college. Many of the students we work with will be the first in their families
  to attend college. Many also attend high schools with exorbitant counselor to
  student ratios. I AM mentors work with school based counselors to identify
  students who might slip through the cracks and then meet with students
  regularly to make sure the (very complicated) college application process goes
  smoothly. Once students are accepted to colleges, mentors help students figure
  out financial aid awards and provide students with support as they decide
  where to go.  We’ve helped over 1,000 students get into college since starting
  the program in 2005.  The SummerTIME (Tool Information Motivation Education)
  program focuses on college completion. We bring students who have graduated
  from LAUSD schools and who will be heading to four-year colleges/universities
  to USC for a month-long intensive writing program. The curriculum is infused
  with lessons on college knowledge such has how to balance finances, how to
  interact with professors and how to cultivate effective study skills.   The
  third program provides a twist to traditional college outreach approaches. We
  decided to meet students where they choose to spend after-school hours – in
  cyberspace! We partnered with USC’s Game Innovation Lab and students from
  Foshay Learning Center to create a series of role-playing games about college
  and careers. Our games were developed and pilot tested in Los Angeles and are
  now utilized nationally. My LA2050 funding would enable us to expand these
  programs and train practitioners on how to make use of the game-based tools.

success: "With regards to the effects of the programs on students outcomes, we will measure success by administering surveys to students prior to and post participation in our programs. The surveys will be designed to collect data on the effects of the program on college knowledge and college-going efficacy. We also will conduct selected focus groups with students and practitioners in order to gain a deeper  understanding of which practices are working best for students and their teachers and/or counselors.\r\nWe will also evaluate the project by analyzing the numbers of game players and if/how those numbers increase, thus increasing traction in the project. We will also analyze back-end server data related to the games in order to ascertain the effects of game play on students' college aspirations and/or plans."

  Our project will help improve the college-going rates at high schools that
  have the lowest college-going rates within the Los Angeles Unified School
  District.  Many students who are eligible for college choose not to attend
  college because they receive little support on how to navigate the
  college-going process or lack the information on how to apply.  By pairing
  mentors with high school seniors who are college-eligible, they can
  successfully guide them through the college application process.   The high
  school graduation rate in California ranks in the bottom half of all U.S.
  states, with the Los Angeles Unified School District’s own graduation rate
  well below the state’s, according to the U.S. Department of Education.  Budget
  cuts have severely affected the amount of college counselors at the schools. A
  shortage of counselors limits the support that students receive regarding the
  college application process. Traditionally, California students' access to
  counselors varies by grade level, and 29 percent of California school
  districts have no counseling programs at all. The ratio of students per
  counselor in California averages 945 to 1, compared to the national average of
  477 to 1, ranking California last in the nation.  In Los Angeles, the average
  ratio is 800 students to 1 guidance counselor. Many under-resourced schools
  have guidance counselors, but not dedicated college counselors. Students
  attending private schools and public schools in affluent parts of the city are
  afforded very different access to college information and support, often
  supplemented by parents employing private college counselors to shepherd their
  children through the complexity of college applications. Thus the gap between
  those who have access to resources and those who don’t remains stark; the
  implications for college graduation rates and lifetime earning potential are
  obvious.  By having volunteers serve as mentors, they can alleviate the burden
  of college counselors having to work with enormous case loads and students can
  have the one on one interaction needed to understand how to navigate the
  college admissions and financial aid processes.

  Currently California ranks 40th among the states in the rate of high school
  graduates going directly to college.  By 2050, we hope to increase
  college-going rates by 15-20% by working directly with students who are
  eligible to attend college but lack the information and guidance to do so. 
  Young adults who delay college attendance also delay the economic and social
  benefits of higher education, benefits that accrue both to the individuals and
  to the state which contributes to our economy. In addition, research on
  college completion shows that students who follow the traditional college
  enrollment pattern of entering college immediately following high school are
  more likely to graduate from college.  California’s population is expected to
  grow from 37 million to approximately 60 million by 2050.  Since our
  population will dramatically increase by 2050, it is imperative that we have a
  college-educated population that will contribute to our economy.  We
  understand that it may not be realistic for every student to receive a college
  degree but it’s important that they are pointed in a direction that offers as
  many opportunities as possible and that they learn invaluable skills that are
  required for long-term and sustainable employment.  We would like to expand
  our programs so that we can serve at least 1,000-2,000 students during the
  academic year.
