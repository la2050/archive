  success: "We keep track of how many people experience the Do Good Bus each year and how many of those people return to volunteer at select causes.  If we could double our numbers, we’d consider it a huge success.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside of pure numbers and excel spreadsheets, we measure our success by trying to accomplish three goals:\r\n1.\tCreate Awareness\r\n2.\tCreate Community\r\n3.\tEncourage Continued Support\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe already track each of these goals and would continue to do so by doing the following:\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nAWARENESS: We are creating awareness about Los Angeles causes for Do Good Bus participants, which is easy to measure by simply counting how many people get on the bus.  But we are also committed to creating a broader awareness for each specific cause by consistently mentioning and supporting them via Do Good Bus social networks and ideally, the social networks of our 30 passengers.  We know the power of word of mouth and encourage all our participants to share their experience via Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and good ol’ fashioned coffee dates.  We are currently working on a template to track and report increased awareness for the non-profits we visit to show the benefit of partnering with Do Good Bus.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCOMMUNITY: This category could also be called, GETTING DIGITS.  Our favorite part of a Do Good Bus ride is seeing people connect and find a common ground.  We are constantly amazed to see people trading information at the end of our rides so they can reconnect in the future.  Past doGOODers have gone out on dates, found new babysitters and even started their own small community projects. All because we put them on a bus together!\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCONTINUED SUPPORT:  After each Do Good Bus ride, passengers receive a follow up email with info on how to continue to support the cause they visited as well as other causes in Los Angeles.  We do our best to work with the non-profits and causes to monitor and track return volunteers and hope to increase those “return rates” as we move forward.  Ideally, our goal is to check in twice a year with people who have been on the bus and give them examples of new ways to help and creative ways to get involved."

  brief: "The Do Good Bus is an opportunity to get involved and help your community. Just get on the bus and we do the rest. Each trip is different and the locations are a secret.  If you have always wanted to get involved, volunteer or help others but didn’t know how – hop on the Do Good Bus!\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe currently host monthly community rides to give Los Angelenos an opportunity to learn about local causes, experience giving back and most importantly, connect with other people in their city.  Over the past three years, we’ve visited dozens of causes and connected hundreds of volunteers.  In order to expand and give more people in Los Angeles an opportunity to participate – we need to buy a bus.  With our own bus, our goals are to: double participation, offer one free ride per month and focus on teaching youth the importance of giving back.  \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDOUBLE TIME & MAKE IT FREE\r\n<br>\r\nWith our current costs and bus rental availability, we are limited to one community ride per month. These rides require people to purchase a ticket.  We believe there’s true value in a Do Good Bus ticket (you even get a gourmet lunch!) but we also know the ticket can be a barrier for some.  If we could host one FREE ride per month in addition to a ticketed ride -- viola! -- we’ve doubled the amount of people who can connect and doubled the amount of GOOD we can do.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKIDS AND GIVING BACK\r\n<br>\r\nIn line with the LA2050 report about the direct connection between education and social connectedness, we’ve been working on ideas to engage students via the Do Good Bus.  We are committed to teaching our youth the importance of giving back and connecting with their community.  In fact, we’ve started hosting FAMILY RIDES to give families access to kid-friendly volunteer activities and teach kids the vocabulary and concepts of giving back.  We would love to offer the same experience to students in Los Angeles schools - giving teachers an opportunity to incorporate volunteerism into their curriculums. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe LA2050 report also suggests education levels are directly related to social connectedness levels.  While we don’t have the resources to ensure kids make it to their senior year, we think exposing kids to unique experiences on a Do Good Field Trip, will give them a chance to connect with students across neighborhood lines and with a world outside of the classroom.  In addition, a Do Good Field Trip would expose students to unique career options (i.e. Non-profit CEO or Do Good Bus tour guide) - potentially giving them new motivation to make it through school. "

We encourage them to harness that feeling and search for ways to find it again in their every day lives.  We strongly believe that inspiration in people will continue to shape Los Angeles into a more connected place.  \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn addition to one free ride per month and Do Good Field Trips, owning a bus would give us a unique opportunity to help Los Angeles in a hyper-local capacity.  With 24-hour access to a vehicle equipped with supplies and enough seats for 30 willing volunteers, we’d have the capability to coordinate last minute trips to help our neighbors in a time of emergency or disaster relief.

    Do Good Bus doesn’t have any direct competitors using our exact model, but
    there are a handful of companies and organizations doing similar work. 
    Organizations like LA Works and Volunteer Match offer resources for people
    to find volunteer and community service opportunities in Los Angeles.  LA
    Works even creates fun events (i.e. their annual scavenger hunt-esque
    Service Crawl) to take some of the work out of finding a cause on your own.
    Do Good Bus actually participated in the very first LA Works Service Crawl
    and we’ve also had numerous conversations on how to potentially create
    events together.  In addition to a possible partnership, we continue to use
    LA Works (and other online databases) as a resource for non-profit and cause
    ideas.  
  vision: "We think the SMALL THINGS will mean success.  \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn 2050, if most Los Angelenos know more than one neighbor and if kids don’t roll their eyes when teachers say “volunteer” – success.  \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn 37 years, if people understand picking up a piece of trash is just as much their responsibility as the next person’s – success.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd on our way to 2050, if people have unique opportunities to connect and even have FUN together, they will be more likely to work together to make those small things Los Angeles’s reality.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuccess."

  believe there’s true value in a Do Good Bus ticket (you even get a gourmet
  lunch!) but we also know the ticket can be a barrier for some.  If we could

  KIDS AND GIVING BACK



  <br>



  In line with the LA2050 report about the direct connection between education
  and social connectedness, we’ve been working on ideas to engage students via
  the Do Good Bus.  We are committed to teaching our youth the importance of
  giving back and connecting with their community.  In fact, we’ve started
  hosting FAMILY RIDES to give families access to kidfriendly volunteer
  activities and teach kids the vocabulary and concepts of giving back.  We
  would love to offer the same experience to students in Los Angeles schools 
  giving teachers an opportunity to incorporate volunteerism into their
  curriculums. 



  <br>



  <br>



  The LA2050 report also suggests education levels are directly related to
  social connectedness levels.  While we don’t have the resources to ensure kids
  make it to their senior year, we think exposing kids to unique experiences on
  a Do Good Field Trip, will give them a chance to connect with students across
  neighborhood lines and with a world outside of the classroom.  In addition, a
  Do Good Field Trip would expose students to unique career options (i.e.
  Nonprofit CEO or Do Good Bus tour guide)  potentially giving them new
  motivation to make it through school.

  Locally, we’ve partnered with dozens of Los Angeles causes to give Los

  murals, helped students write their college entrance essays and sorted dog
  food for some of the cutest rescue animals in Los Angeles.

  BUS PARTNERS



  <br>



  For the nitty gritty logistics, Townride, Inc. would like to offer their
  expertise in helping us through the purchase and refurbishing process of
  creating the coolest Do Good Bus possible.  We are also working on a plan to
  partner with Townride for storage and maintenance.



  <br>



  <br>



  EDUCATION PARTNERS



  <br>



  As for causes and organizations who can help us make Do Good Field Trips a
  reality, we’re looking forward to working with No Right Brain Left Behind,
  Green Dot Schools, Breakaway Education and Zimmer Children’s Museum.
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: "We keep track of how many people experience the Do Good Bus each year and how many of those people return to volunteer at select causes.  If we could double our numbers, we’d consider it a huge success.\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n<br>\n\n\nOutside of pure numbers and excel spreadsheets, we measure our success by trying to accomplish three goals:\n\n\n1.\tCreate Awareness\n\n\n2.\tCreate Community\n\n\n3.\tEncourage Continued Support\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n<br>\n\n\nWe already track each of these goals and would continue to do so by doing the following:\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n\n\nAWARENESS: We are creating awareness about Los Angeles causes for Do Good Bus participants, which is easy to measure by simply counting how many people get on the bus.

Ideally, our goal is to check in twice a year with people who have been on the bus and give them examples of new ways to help and creative ways to get involved."
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  If Do Good Bus can host multiple rides per month and offer one of them for
  free, we can give more Los Angelenos an opportunity to help their
  communities.  In one year, over 1,000 people will be newly connected and if we
  add Do Good Field Trips to that number, we end up with 1,000 newly connected
  kids as well.



  <br>



  <br>



  One of our goals on the bus is to encourage continued support and inspire
  people to do good on a regular basis.  For us, that doesn’t always mean
  returning to the cause we just visited.  During a ride, passengers are not
  only exposed to meaningful causes they are also introduced to what it FEELS
  like to give back. We encourage them to harness that feeling and search for
  ways to find it again in their every day lives.  We strongly believe that
  inspiration in people will continue to shape Los Angeles into a more connected
  place.  



  <br>



  <br>



  In addition to one free ride per month and Do Good Field Trips, owning a bus
  would give us a unique opportunity to help Los Angeles in a hyperlocal
  capacity.  With 24hour access to a vehicle equipped with supplies and enough
  seats for 30 willing volunteers, we’d have the capability to coordinate last
  minute trips to help our neighbors in a time of emergency or disaster relief. 
  This might be the most exciting element of owning our own vehicle.



  <br>



  <br>



  One ride at a time, Do Good Bus can begin to shape Los Angeles into a more
  connected city; one with informed and inspired residents who can help one
  another.
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  We think the SMALL THINGS will mean success.  



  <br>



  <br>



  In 2050, if most Los Angelenos know more than one neighbor and if kids don’t
  roll their eyes when teachers say “volunteer” — success.  



  <br>



  <br>



  In 37 years, if people understand picking up a piece of trash is just as much
  their responsibility as the next person’s — success.



  <br>



  <br>



  And on our way to 2050, if people have unique opportunities to connect and
  even have FUN together, they will be more likely to work together to make
  those small things Los Angeles’s reality.



  <br>



  <br>



  Success.
