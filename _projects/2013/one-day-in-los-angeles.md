title: One Day in Los Angeles
indicator: ' Social Connectedness'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  <p>One Day in Los Angeles is a communitybased, oneday filmmaking event in
  which participants across L.A. will document the challenges and hopes of our
  local communities. Participants will film during a 24hour period with the goal
  of raising the level of community engagement in L.A., and inspiring action
  towards a better city by 2050. The resulting media will be made available to
  the public through a geotagged archive and video map of Los Angeles.</p>



  <p>In a region divided by mountains, freeways, economic barriers, and
  municipal boundaries, many of us identify more strongly with our own
  neighborhoods than with sprawling and fragmented L.A. County. This
  relationship can manifest as a deep sense of neighborhood pride, but can also
  take the form of ostracism along poverty lines and language barriers. One Day
  in Los Angeles will tell stories of the neighborhoods that make up our region,
  and in doing so expose the challenges and human potential of a large and
  diverse community.</p>



  <p>The 24hour mediacreation event will take place across Los Angeles County,
  and will feature filmmakers, local charities, city policymakers, community
  organizations, and student groups filming stories emblematic of the particular
  struggles and hopes of their communities. In the process, we will create a
  video dialogue crossing the cultural and economic barriers that inhibit social
  connectedness, and inspire volunteerism towards enhancing human development in
  Los Angeles by the year 2050.</p>



  <p>The event will be organized by One Day on Earth, an L.A.based nonprofit
  organization with experience coordinating causebased media creation events on
  a global scale. The project will culminate with the release of a geotagged
  video archive featuring all media captured during the event. The technology
  platform will be based on software developed by One Day on Earth for our
  annual global collaboration: https://vimeo.com/18910284</p>



  <p>One Day in Los Angeles participants are welcome to film any subject matter.
  The only parameters are, a) all filming takes place within Los Angeles County,
  b) all filming takes place during the oneday event, and c) the motivation
  behind filming is for L.A. to become an even better place to live by the year
  2050. </p>



  <p>To ensure diverse participation, the One Day in Los Angeles staff will
  reach out to local schools, charities, policymakers, and inspired citizens to
  join the project’s social networking platform, www.onedayonearth.org.
  Onedayonearth.org currently hosts a community of over 35,000 participants
  representing every country in the world, with over 1200 in L.A. County alone.
  All prospective participants will be given access to the educational toolkit
  which was developed to train students of all ages in the use of digital
  filmmaking technologies </p>(http://www.onedayonearth.org/page/education1.)
  The toolkit is currently in use in over 70 countries around the world, and has
  been invaluable to empowering highlevel participation from individuals with
  access only to camera phones or consumergrade video cameras.



  <p>Beyond educational support, project producers will reach out to prominent
  issuebased filmmakers within the region to serve as localized producers,
  ensuring that there is comprehensive coverage across all regions of the city,
  and across all key indicators set forth by the LA 2050 initiative.</p>



  <p>One Day in Los Angeles will impact the Social Connectedness indicator by
  providing an opportunity for regionwide social engagement; generating media
  that will inspire volunteerism; creating accessible media through the
  interactive online video archive; and forming a framework for local filmmakers
  to collectively produce an inclusive view of the current state of human
  development in Los Angeles.  </p>



  <p>While One Day in Los Angeles primarily affects the Social Connectedness
  indicator, we believe that this is not an insular category. By creating a
  dialogue between Angelinos communities, the project’s residual effects could
  potentially cover all indicators listed by this initiative. A socially
  connected L.A. will allow citizens to collaborate on shaping their own future
  and engaging in activities that will most impact the region’s improvement.
  </p>



  <p>To inspire specifically directed participation we will put forth the
  following call to action: </p>



  <p>If you had one day to document what Los Angeles needs to change by 2050,
  what would you show us? Tell the story. Take action. Be heard. </p>
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  <p>DEVELOPMENT OF THE ONE DAY ON EARTH SOCIAL NETWORK:



  In early 2010, One Day on Earth launched an online socialnetworking platform
  to organize an international community of filmmakers. The site
  (www.onedayonearth.org) currently hosts over 35,000 members representing every
  country of the world, and over 1,200 in Los Angeles County alone. Through the
  One Day on Earth platform participants collaborate on an annual film, as
  described below.</p>






  <p>GLOBAL FILMING EVENTS:



  One Day on Earth has produced three annual filming events on 10.10.10,
  11.11.11, and 12.12.12. These events have generated over 12,000 hours of video
  submissions representing every country of the world. The filming events have
  been adopted by NGOs and nonprofit organizations around the world as an
  effective means to engage talented filmmakers on local and global issues.</p>






  <p>GEOTAGGED VIDEO ARCHIVE:



  All footage produced during One Day on Earth filming events and uploaded by
  participants is available to the public: archive.onedayonearth.org



  The archive is interactive and searchable by location or contentspecific
  metadata tagged by participants upon upload. </p>






  <p>FEATURE DOCUMENTARY FILMS:



  One Day on Earth has recently released a feature film cut exclusively from
  footage captured during the 10.10.10 filming event. This film was released
  theatrically and is now publicly available on home video. The 11.11.11 and
  12.12.12 films are currently being edited.</p>






  <p>THE WORLD'S MOST GLOBAL PREMIERE



  One Day on Earth premiered in over 160 countries on Earth Day 2012 (April 22,
  2012), making it the world's most global film premiere:
  <http://mashable.com/2012/04/22/onedayonearthpremiere/></p>






  <p>NONPROFIT PARTNERSHIPS:



  One Day on Earth has developed organizational partnerships with over 100
  global NGOs and nonprofit organizations around the world, and we have helped
  many of those organizations work towards their missions by empowering
  widespread mediacreation in support of their cause.</p>
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >+
  One Day in Los Angeles will draw on One Day on Earth’s extensive partnership
  building experience and forge new relationships with local organizations to
  document the key indicators of LA 2050. 






  Current partners of the One Day on Earth global filming initiative include:






  350.org



  The American Red Cross



  The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement



  Human Rights Watch



  Oxfam



  UNAIDS



  UNESCO



  UNHCR



  The United Nations Development Programme



  UN Women



  Water.Org



  WWF






  One Day in Los Angeles will seek support and participation from our
  unprecedented team of partners to film topics related to:






  Education



  Environmental Quality



  Health



  Social Connectedness



  Arts & Cultural Vitality



  Income & Employment



  Housing



  Public Safety


Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >+
  If awarded the LA 2050 Challenge Grant, One Day in Los Angeles will meet the
  following core criteria of a successful project:






  — All areas of Los Angeles are documented by participating filmmakers.






  — Over 300 participants take part in the One Day in Los Angeles filming event.






  — One Day in Los Angeles engages partnerships with no less than 5 local
  charities to participate in the filming event and works with those
  organizations to create media around the key hindrances to human development
  as put forth by LA 2050.





   No less than 10 educational institutions participate in the filming event. 





  — One Day in Los Angeles releases a geotagged video archive of all content
  produced by the filmmaking community.









  Beyond these benchmarks of a successful project, One Day in Los Angeles will
  seek additional partnerships in funding and working towards the following
  goals:





   A public screening in Los Angeles that showcases the films produced during the oneday filming event.





  — Corporate sponsorship for the One Day in Los Angeles event to provide
  additional resources to participants, expand the scope of the project, and
  work towards a fully edited One Day in Los Angeles film.





   Broadcast opportunities for a One Day in Los Angeles film or series through traditional channels, including distribution opportunities through the educational market.


How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
  One Day in Los Angeles will benefit L.A. by providing a participatory,
  causebased media creation event related to civic and social engagement. The
  event will produce residual benefits across many fields, as local filmmakers
  will be asked to document hindrances to human development across greater Los
  Angeles. The archive will provide access to firsthand experiences, giving a
  firsthand view of the issues that face Los Angeles and, ultimately, an
  opportunity to create more informed solutions. 






  The undeniable power of seeing the diversity of the Los Angeles experience
  through a single day enriches the perspective of who we are, interconnecting
  both our joys and struggles.  






  One Day on Earth has over 100 nonprofit partners. Our staff will engage
  partner organizations as well as build new relationships with local nonprofits
  specifically for this initiative. By working with local community organizers
  our producers will draw attention to real frontline issues. One Day in Los
  Angeles will present an opportunity for local nonprofits to generate media to
  communicate their mission and to rally support for their cause.






  In addition to nonprofit outreach, our staff will focus efforts on inspiring
  students and educators to participate. Preparing young people to effectively
  communicate through digital media is a critical tool in expanding civic and
  social engagement. As with previous One Day on Earth initiatives, One Day in
  Los Angeles will inspire volunteerism around the issues that matter most to
  Los Angeles.






  With the filming event yielding hundreds of hours of media, the geotagged
  archive will be searchable by location, keyword, and subject matter. This
  robust video resource will be a useful tool for local policymakers, community
  organizers, and educators to reference and support greater insight into both
  highpriority local issues and cultural diversity. 


What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  <p>One Day in Los Angeles looks forward to a city in 2050 that has overcome
  civic apathy and social division by engaging the skills of the world’s most
  talented digital media community. Los Angeles trails the national average in
  volunteerism, voting rates, newspaper readership, and civic engagement. We are
  a city that remains deeply divided along racial and economic lines. </p>






  <p>Our vision of L.A. in 2050 is a city that expands its amazing ability to
  captivate and move audiences through media, and focuses that ability to
  educate and expose topics that are critical to the sustainability of our city,
  and beyond. The vision is of a city where the mediamakers have inspired
  widespread volunteerism, advocacy, and interconnectedness.</p>






  <p>We are looking forward to deploying the One Day on Earth platform as part
  of our shared vision. Our filming event and resulting archive will seed a
  dialogue to help develop a clear path towards a more united L.A. in 2050. By
  using the great strength of our mediamaking community, we can help turn the
  corner on our long struggle with disconnectedness. Los Angeles can bring down
  the barriers of economic disparity and cultural exclusion. By 2050 we can see
  a Los Angeles with a united identity — a connected city. </p>

    answer: "One Day in Los Angeles will benefit L.A. by providing a participatory, cause-based media creation event related to civic and social engagement. The event will produce residual benefits across many fields, as local filmmakers will be asked to document hindrances to human development across greater Los Angeles. The archive will provide access to firsthand experiences, giving a first-hand view of the issues that face Los Angeles and, ultimately, an opportunity to create more informed solutions. \r\n\r\nThe undeniable power of seeing the diversity of the Los Angeles experience through a single day enriches the perspective of who we are, interconnecting both our joys and struggles.  \r\n\r\nOne Day on Earth has over 100 nonprofit partners. Our staff will engage partner organizations as well as build new relationships with local nonprofits specifically for this initiative. By working with local community organizers our producers will draw attention to real frontline issues. One Day in Los Angeles will present an opportunity for local nonprofits to generate media to communicate their mission and to rally support for their cause.\r\n\r\nIn addition to nonprofit outreach, our staff will focus efforts on inspiring students and educators to participate. Preparing young people to effectively communicate through digital media is a critical tool in expanding civic and social engagement. As with previous One Day on Earth initiatives, One Day in Los Angeles will inspire volunteerism around the issues that matter most to Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nWith the filming event yielding hundreds of hours of media, the geo-tagged archive will be searchable by location, keyword, and subject matter. This robust video resource will be a useful tool for local policymakers, community organizers, and educators to reference and support greater insight into both high-priority local issues and cultural diversity. \r\n"

    answer: "<p>One Day in Los Angeles looks forward to a city in 2050 that has overcome civic apathy and social division by engaging the skills of the world’s most talented digital media community. Los Angeles trails the national average in volunteerism, voting rates, newspaper readership, and civic engagement. We are a city that remains deeply divided along racial and economic lines. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our vision of L.A. in 2050 is a city that expands its amazing ability to captivate and move audiences through media, and focuses that ability to educate and expose topics that are critical to the sustainability of our city, and beyond. The vision is of a city where the media-makers have inspired widespread volunteerism, advocacy, and interconnectedness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are looking forward to deploying the One Day on Earth platform as part of our shared vision. Our filming event and resulting archive will seed a dialogue to help develop a clear path towards a more united L.A. in 2050. By using the great strength of our media-making community, we can help turn the corner on our long struggle with disconnectedness. Los Angeles can bring down the barriers of economic disparity and cultural exclusion. By 2050 we can see a Los Angeles with a united identity – a connected city. </p>"
