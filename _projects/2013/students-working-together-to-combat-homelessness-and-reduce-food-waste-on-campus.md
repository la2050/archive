  Students Working Together to Combat Homelessness and Reduce Food Waste on
  Campus
indicator: ' Housing'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >+
  In September 2009, “Swipes for the Homeless” was established as an official
  university student organization at UCLA in order to help alleviate the
  destitution of the neighboring homeless community, specifically the growing
  homeless student population. 






  Having seen oncampus students collect hot meals for the needy in past years,
  UCLA students Thach Nguyen and Bryan Pezeshki came up with a brilliant idea.
  They set out to create a partnership between the multiple campus departments
  to fully institutionalize a program that would allow the impact and influence
  of their idea to grow to its full potential. 






  What exactly was this idea? Oncampus residents with meal plans that allow them
  to roll over unused meals from week to week, tend to accrue many unused meals,
  or “swipes”, by the end of each academic quarter. At the end of the quarter,
  these students can donate their unused meal swipes, which would otherwise go
  to waste, to Swipes for the Homeless. These swipes are then transferred into
  nonperishable goods and then taken to homeless shelters, homeless living on
  the streets, and homeless and hungry students on campus. In addition, many
  other subprojects target wasted food in the residential dining halls, fastfood
  eateries on campus, and community businesses in order to salvage that food for
  those less fortunate on a daily basis. The organization has collected over
  30,000 meals to date, with a record of 7,421 meals this past university
  quarter 






  The simplicity and effectiveness of this idea quickly led to its expansion
  onto numerous college campuses worldwide, amongst those being USC, UC Berkeley
  and University of Paris in France. In April of 2012, after a nationwide search
  and vetting of thousands of applicants, President Obama recognized our
  organization as one of five “Champions of Change,” personally inviting our
  group to the White House to honor us for our impact on the community. “Swipes”
  has since become a statecertified 501(c)3 non profit organization with the aim
  of spreading its impact on to every campus in the world.






  Although our main indicator would be “housing,” Swipes for the Homeless
  affects several other indicators on many different levels. For example, our
  dual mission is to tangibly and tactically partner with college campuses to
  alleviate hunger while raising young people’s awareness of homelessness and
  hunger through education and outreach. Through this we hope to facilitate the
  spirit of giving and volunteerism, a crucial component of social
  connectedness. Swipes for the Homeless is also environmentallyfocused because
  it helps University campuses reduce their food waste. We understand that all
  indicators and social issues are interconnected, and that improving one area
  would correlate with an improvement in another indicator. 


What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  Since its humble beginnings, Swipes for the Homeless has donated over 35,000
  pounds of food just in Los Angeles and thousands of additional meals around
  the nation. In fact, we have recorded a whopping number of 57,268 pounds of
  food donated as of January 2013! All of this couldn’t have been done without
  our dedicated university chapters. We are continuing to spread our mission to
  university campuses, and additional students from over 30 universities have
  recently reached out to us to establish a chapter on their perspective
  campuses. Swipes for the Homeless has been featured in many publications and
  media outlets such as the Los Angeles Times, MTV, GOOD Magazine, Forbes, UCLA
  Magazine, and many others. Our biggest (and most exciting) achievement to date
  was when our organization was recognized by President Barack Obama as a Campus
  Champion of Change in 2011. The Champions of Change challenge was launched by
  the White House to honor five young leaders for outstanding leadership on
  their college campuses. After reviewing a record number of entries, fifteen
  Challenge finalists were announced and the public chose the top five projects
  they think best embody the President’s goal to win the future. Swipes for the
  Homeless was voted as one of the top five! Our members were honored with the
  opportunity to travel to the White House and personally meet Obama for a press
  conference with the other winners. In 2012, Swipes for the Homeless was also
  recognized as Most Influential College Organization at the 2012 Stay Classy
  Awards, the largest philanthropic recognition ceremony in America. From these
  various recognitions, we have been blessed with the opportunity to bring this
  important cause to further light on the national media scale, and would like
  to thank all of our supporters who have been with us every step of the way. 
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  Swipes for the Homeless has engaged with several organizations and companies
  that span across a wide range of industries. For example, we have conducted
  talks with companies such as TowelSafe (a cuttingedge company with a program
  that allows people to donate one pocketed towel with a toiletry kit to a local
  homeless individual) and KNOclothing (a sociallyminded business that donates
  an article of clothing to those in need for every purchase). Our talks have
  focused on partnership possibilities and ways that we can support each other.
  Recently, Swipes for the Homeless collaborated with Ebay's Giving Works
  program. Through this program,customers can donate to a nonprofit or charity
  of their choice, simply by buying or selling an item.
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >+
  The meaning of success for us is multifaceted. If the past three years have
  served as any evidence, we anticipate exponential growth and impact. From a
  pragmatic standpoint, we want to streamline our relationships with our campus
  chapters by providing more communication, training, and development. Our
  executive team has spent last summer redefining our vision for the
  organization and made plans to establish stronger ties with our campus
  communities. Shortterm strategies include institutionalizing quarterly video
  conferences and developing grantwriting/campus development kits; our longterm
  strategies include providing financial and webbased support for our individual
  chapters. These new tools aim to elevate resources available athand for our
  campus leaders. From a highlevel vision, our hope and goal is to maximize the
  impact of our organization by being more intentional about our programming
  initiatives. 






  We, of course, want to maintain our growth and expansion beyond the 12
  campuses we currently exist in. But rather than simply focusing on the
  quantity of food in which collect, we want to establish partnerships with
  organizations and professionals from the medical field who will work with us
  to identify the most nourishing and nutritious foods. We hope to use our
  donated foods to not only alleviate hunger but to find opportunities to
  address deep malnutrition and the issues associated with it. Furthermore, as
  our organization continues to grow and our vision mature, we want to look at
  targeted demographics with special needs rather than just adopting a blind,
  homogenous view of the homeless population. Special communities, such as LGBT
  youth, experience unique circumstances that make them the most atrisk
  population and our goal is to develop programming that will address these
  issues. It’s an incredibly exciting time in the history of organization as we
  are transforming our structure both internally and externally. As Swipes for
  the Homeless continues to grow, we are rethinking our strategy by both
  broadening our scope and the campuses we are able to reach, as well as
  refining our approach to maximize the quality of our impact.


How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  According to a 2012 article in the Huffington Post, “more than 51,000 homeless
  people live in Los Angeles County, from Antelope Valley to the South Bay, with
  doubledigit percentage increases in the number of families, seniors and
  veterans over last year.” The LA2050 website quotes that “Los Angeles is
  considered the ‘homeless capital of the country.’” Swipes for the Homeless is
  especially prominent and beneficial in Los Angeles because of two main
  reasons. Firstly, the statistics tell all — there is a strong need for support
  and services for the local homeless population. With such a large homeless
  population and shelters lacking in resources, every act of giving and every
  helping hand counts. We hope that Swipes for the Homeless has helped — and
  will continue to — alleviate the strain on homeless shelters and missions in
  Los Angeles. In addition, Swipes for the Homeless has two very strong chapters
  that are based in Los Angeles — UCLA and USC. UCLA is our oldest and most
  established chapter, with a fully selfsufficient and independent team that
  runs smoothly every quarter. USC is a relatively newer chapter, but during
  their first donation drive in Fall 2012 the Trojans managed to collect 2,300
  pounds of food! Despite the friendly rivalry between both schools, here is a
  wonderful example where students from rival universities can work together for
  a greater cause. Combined, our UCLA and USC chapters prove to be a strong
  force that is united in its mission to fight homelessness in Los Angeles and
  its surrounding areas.
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  Our dual mission is to tangibly and tactically partner with college campuses
  to alleviate hunger while raising young people’s awareness of homelessness and
  hunger through education and outreach. Because of our commitment to fighting
  homelessness, our vision for the year 2050 would be a large national decrease
  in (if not a complete eradication of) homelessness, especially amongst the
  student population. We hope that through our advocacy and outreach on this
  issue, we can influence and mobilize youth for generations to come. In
  addition, we would also like to see a reduction in food waste across campus
  dining halls on a national level. The future of the environment is already in
  jeopardy, and it is frightening to think what our cities will look like in the
  year 2050 if we don’t take action to reduce waste and implement sustainable
  measures now. Ultimately, we want to advocate for the idea that each
  individual person, each small act of kindness or helping hand can make a
  difference in the lives of others.
