  PROPOSED PROJECT:  Planning and development phase of AxS Festival.






  BACKGROUND:  Art and science, left brain/right brain, STEM to STEAM — across
  the country and around the world, artists and scientists are exploring the
  interconnectedness of the two domains, dissolving traditional borders and
  developing new vocabularies, and leaders in culture, media and business are
  focusing with deep interest on the artscience movement.  In Pasadena, a
  textured conversation between the sciences and the arts is ongoing, emblematic
  of the city's history, and is equally fused with the future.






  Every three years, the Pasadena Arts Council (PAC) presents the AxS [aksis]
  Festival, a twoweek citywide celebration of art and science featuring
  exhibitions, performances and a conversation series which honors and reflects
  on the allied importance of both the arts and the sciences to the dynamic
  tenor of our time. While often described as occupying opposite ends of a
  spectrum, art and science are instead united in the AxS Festival’s recognition
  that both domains are powerful engines of contemporary culture.  A theme
  unique to each Festival is chosen which lends itself to interpretation by both
  disciplines and to consideration of profound questions of the human
  experience.






  For the next festival, PAC has selected “Curiosity” as its theme to honor the
  JPLbuilt Mars rover which reached its destination in August 2012 and began its
  23month mission of surveying and analyzing the Martian surface.






  AxS Festival | CURIOSITY explores the uncharted journey of artistic and
  scientific creativity—the question, the experiment, the discovery.  From
  Pandora’s irresistible desire to look into the box to NASA/JPL’s “Curiosity”
  roving on the surface of Mars, human inquisitiveness defines our species and
  resonates powerfully through all works of art and scientific inquiry.  The
  festival will feature works from artists responding to the CURIOSITY theme,
  including dance and theater performances, multimedia and visual arts events,
  and provocative conversations by artists and thinkers…even a curiously amazing
  ArtScience fair for imaging minds of all ages.






  AxS Festival will be presented at partner venues throughout the city, and for
  the first time AxScommissioned works will be housed in an arresting temporary
  pavilion, architectdesigned and built just for the Festival.  AxS Festival
  will be a twoweek expedition across terrain both ancient and familiar, guided
  by artists and scientists at the horizon of discovery.






  In addition to the exhibitions, performances, lectures, workshops, tours and
  other festival activities, PAC will curate a special Conversation Series to
  more deeply investigate the core questions raised by the theme, and
  “Curiosity” will ignite some of the most imaginative and thoughtprovoking AxS
  Festival Conversation to date.  Two of our most prominent thinkers will
  oversee the design of the Conversation Series: Dr. Michael E. Brown, the
  celebrated professor of planetary astronomy at California institute of
  Technology, and Dr. Daniel Lewis, Dibner Senior Curator of the History of
  Science and Technology and Chief Curator of Manuscripts at the renowned
  Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens.  






  PROPOSED FOR My LA 2050: The period May 1, 2013, through December 31, 2013,
  represents the planning and development phase for AxS Festival | CURIOSITY. 
  Primary among the benchmarks for this phase are the launch and completion of a
  pavilion design competition. An RFP will be issued, seeking an innovative
  design for a temporary popup pavilion to house commissions of new works for
  the Festival.  A final design will be chosen based on the most compelling
  design and innovative use of materials to complement the presentations, which
  will include the Curiously Amazing Festival of Stuff, presented by Machine
  Project (think Machine artists meet high school science fair) and the Jet
  Propulsion Laboratory Cabinet of Curiosities, in addition to other new works
  commissioned from multimedia dance and theater artists.






  Other benchmarks during the project period include:



  Completion of educational component developed by Jet Propulsion Lab.



  New work commissions finalized and under way.



  Completion of schedule and participants in Conversation Series.



  Festival partner exhibitions and performances finalized.



  Festival funding 8085% secured.


What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >+
  AxS Festivals have examined the interplay of art and science since The
  Universe” (2001), which contemplated man’s place in the cosmos; “The Tender
  Land” (2004) meditated on the fragile complexity of the natural world; “Skin”
  (2007) investigated culture, race and biology; “Origins” (2009), celebrating
  the bicentennial of Darwin's birth, explored the origins of creativity and
  questions of evolution, faith and the universe; and “Fire and Water” (2011)
  explored the epic natural forces that have shaped human history and the
  landscape of this region.






  In 2010, Pasadena Arts Council began conversations local leaders on the legacy
  and potential of Southern California’s arts and science assets — assets, it
  was agreed, that distinguish the area in a unique way on a national basis and
  provide a framework for thinking about future economic and cultural
  development.   These conversations led to the notion of a “vision summit,”
  gathering together community leaders for an extended version of this
  conversation.  Later that year, a number of institutional and corporate
  leaders were invited to explore ideas for tapping the full potential of the
  unique fabric of arts and science. It was proposed that these intellectual and
  institutional assets define the region as a place where ideas and creativity
  abound, and that they reflect an unharnessed regional and national identity
  that can leverage the local economy, its cultural tourism, and its citizens’
  sense of pride and belonging.    






  Pasadena Arts Council is also very proud of its EMERGE fiscal sponsorship
  program. This cultural entrepreneurship program currently incubates 60
  individual projects and emerging organizations, offering them the ability to
  seek funding through fiscal sponsorship, and supporting participants during a
  crucial stage.  It provides an opportunity to develop a project and determine
  its trajectory with the guidance and oversight of an established nonprofit.â€‚
  EMERGE supports artists who are launching new endeavors, those who are in the
  process of obtaining 501(c)(3) determination, and also projects and programs
  that prefer to remain fiscally sponsored, making use of PAC’s nonprofit
  infrastructure to support their ongoing efforts. In FY 2013, PAC helped these
  projects raise over $800,000 and serve over 43,000 people, including 12,000
  young people, through afterschool art and music programs, theater, dance and
  music performances, visual art exhibitions, public art commissions, literary
  and cultural festivals, photography and film projects and many other diverse,
  artistdriven projects throughout Southern California.






  Pasadena Arts Council is the oldest arts service organization in California,
  established in 1964.  In 2014 we will celebrate our 50th anniversary, which we
  think is a pretty good achievement in itself.


Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Art Center College of Design, Huntington Library,
  Caltech, Kidspace Children’s Museum, Descanso Gardens, Gamble House, Machine
  Project, Planetary Society, Armory Center for the Arts, Pasadena Museum of
  California Art, KPCC; other partners pending.
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >+
  A basic indicator of the success of the AxS Festival will be measured by
  attendance at Festival events.  Audience surveys will be collected and
  compiled, as well as input from a debriefing of festival partners on what went
  well and what needed improvement in terms of their partner experience.






  More important, however, will be an evaluation of how well the AxS movement
  takes hold in Los Angeles over the longer term.  PAC currently works with a
  consultant on developing elements for the “City of Art and Science” initiative
  (see next section), and this consultant will survey the cultural and creative
  landscape in Los Angeles for further artscience collaborations.  She will also
  suggest pilot programs for local schools and social service agencies. 
  Ultimately, it is hoped that the artscience movement reaches further into work
  with institutions and government on a new civic model, to bootstrap resources
  for an entire community.  At that point success may be measured on new or
  increased funding support for AxS programs, successes in sectors where pilot
  programs are implemented, and even graduation rates from STEAM academies.






  Moreover, attention is increasingly being paid to what Professor Ann Markusen
  calls “creative placemaking.”  In a study commissioned by the NEA, Markusen
  states: “In creative placemaking, partners from public, private, nonprofit,
  and community sectors strategically shape the physical and social character of
  a neighborhood, town, city, or region around arts and cultural activities.
  Creative placemaking animates public and private spaces, rejuvenates
  structures and streetscapes, improves local business viability and public
  safety, and brings diverse people together to celebrate, inspire, and be
  inspired.”  This collaborative, crosssector thinking perfectly embodies the
  AxS movement, and these outcomes are measurable on a local level, even
  neighborhood by neighborhood.


How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >2-
   In 1984, the world came to Los Angeles. Mostly they came for the Summer Olympics, but many also experienced  stunning performances by artists of international caliber during the Olympic Arts Festival; Robert Graham’s monumental Olympic Gateway sculptures still tower over Memorial Coliseum as a reminder of what a great festival can mean to a great city. In 1984, Los Angeles dismissed those Orwellian connotations and instead took its place among the great international art cities — a city of the future. This celebration of arts and culture was followed at threeyear intervals thereafter through 1993 as the Los Angeles Festival, which continued the tradition of artistic innovation and excellence, introducing a littleknown Canadian company called Cirque du Soleil alongside master artists like Peter Brook and local standouts like Lula Washington.





  Now, 20 years after the last Los Angeles Festival, the AxS [aksis] Festival
  brings to the Los Angeles area not just a dynamic public event but a bold
  challenge to cultural, business and civic leaders to engage with the
  artscience movement and allow Los Angeles to lay its claim as the movement’s
  energy center. 






  Increasingly complex challenges of the 21st century will be best addressed by
  crosssector dialogue and innovation. The artscience movement, with its
  multidisciplinary emphasis, will have a ripple effect through the region as it
  demonstrates what is possible when intellectual capital is harnessed. Several
  indicators of the quality of life in Los Angeles could be impacted by art and
  science coming together both as a festival and as a civic initiative.






  The quality of education in the Los Angeles area is dismal and getting worse
  every year. With its emphasis on STEM to STEAM, the educational components of
  the artscience movement will propose muchneeded strategies to better leverage
  creative and innovative capital and invest it in the schools. Since STEM to
  STEAM is increasingly a part of the national dialogue on education, AxS will
  help attract federal funding to launch these programs in local schools.
  Creative endeavor has long been recognized to enhance learning and improve
  graduation rates, resulting in a better prepared workforce. 



  The cultural vitality of the region is projected to decline over the next
  decades, the only indicator with this discouraging trend and caused by the
  lack of a coherent artsnurturing policy. The AxS Festival would establish Los
  Angeles as the center of a vibrant new movement, one with the potential to
  catalyze resources and realize powerful outcomes. Taking a page from the High
  Line project in New York, creative teams would be tasked with creating
  alternative park spaces in underresourced neighborhoods and communicating
  messages about healthy living. Putting crossdisciplinary programs like Art
  Center College of Design’s Designmatters at the forefront, sustainable
  solutions to environmental challenges will be developed which address scalable
  outcomes.
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  Thirtyseven years from now, eleven more AxS Festivals will have taken place,
  and with each successive festival a greater number of Angelenos have been
  captivated, enlightened and engaged by the transformational power of the
  artistic and scientific creative process.  Los Angeles is the hypocenter of a
  new cultural/educational environment which fosters the degree of innovation
  necessary to address the increasing complexities of life in the new
  midcentury, and imaginative partnerships have been established among cultural,
  research, educational, social service, government and corporate entities. 
  Every unified school district in Los Angeles County has a STEAM academy.  On
  the website of the Mayor of Los Angeles, in the “Issues” section a tab for
  “STEAM” has been added to those for Transportation, Public Safety,
  Environment, Job Creation, Housing, Balanced Budget, Clean Tech, Education and
  Gang Reduction, and the heads of each of those divisions meet regularly with
  STEAM advisors for inspired, solutionbased brainstorming.  Meanwhile, the AxS
  Festival has taken its place among the most eagerly anticipated international
  cultural events, and 2050 is a festival year, the twelfth festival to have
  taken place since the My LA 2050 initiative was launched.  A special
  commemorative look back to 2014 and the Curiosity rover is organized, putting
  into context all that we have learned about Mars in the intervening decades. 
  Interdisciplinary artscientists working at the furthest margins of discovery
  are invited to create new work for the 2050 AxS Festival, which is presented
  at venues around the region, including the Getty, UCLA, Art Center College of
  Design and Otis College of Art and Design, the Huntington Library, LACMA,
  Caltech, JPL, Carnegie Observatories, USC, the Natural History Museum, the
  California Science Center and many others.  The Academy of Motion Picture Arts
  and Sciences is a major supporter of the AxS Initiative, as is SpaceX. 
  Artists have taken their rightful place alongside scientists, engineers, and
  business entrepreneurs as change agents and California now ranks in the top 10
  states in terms of per capita spending on arts and culture.  And a 46yearold
  woman who came to the AxS Festival as a fourthgrader is heading up the
  Governor’s task force on arts, culture, science and technology.
