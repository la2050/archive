title: Veteran Housing Retention Initiative
indicator: ' Housing'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >+
  Ending homelessness among veterans has been the goal of U.S. VETS since its
  inception. Housing is the key to achieving success in the most basic needs of
  life. Without stable housing it is nearly impossible to maintain employment,
  family relationships, health and connection to society. U.S. VETSLos Angeles
  has been on the forefront of serving homeless veterans in Los Angeles since
  1993. The site opened a new permanent housing building in December 2011
  increasing the number of affordable housing veteran beds available at the site
  to 660. Although the numbers have dropped significantly in the past 20 years,
  Los Angeles still remains the number one city for homeless veterans with
  between 6,3008,000 veterans living on the streets—more than any other American
  city. Veterans represent a disproportionally high percentage of the Los
  Angeles homeless population at 20%.






  With the Obama administration’s announcement of its goal to end veteran
  homelessness by 2015 there has been a deliberate shift away from transitional
  programs that help homeless veterans address their issues and prepare them to
  reenter the workforce and regain their economic independence. The current
  model of HousingFirst favors putting homeless veterans into permanent housing
  and then providing mental health and addiction treatment. Not surprisingly,
  the prospect of permanent housing is very appealing to homeless veterans,
  especially if they are told that they can continue to use drugs and not risk
  losing their housing.






  In support of the HousingFirst model, the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA)
  issued VA Supported Housing (VASH) vouchers for veteran to pay for the
  permanent housing. The VASH program quickly ran out of vouchers and the system
  was overwhelmed by more applicants than available funds. Even those who were
  approved ended up waiting for months for a VASH case worker to process their
  paperwork and approve the apartment. Once housed, most veterans had little to
  no follow up from the overworked VASH case workers. By the VA measurements,
  the program is a success because veterans are off the streets and in permanent
  housing. However, as a program that has the benefit of observing the
  transitioning veterans to our adjacent building, it has become quickly
  apparent to U.S. VETS  that many of these veterans are not equipped to
  maintain their housing and thus enter back into the cycle of crisis and
  homelessness. Housing retention is the missing piece from the VA’s push to
  embrace the HousingFirst model. Although that model includes case management
  to assist veterans after the move into permanent housing, the reality is that
  the local VA has exhausted its allocation for staffing and funding to serve
  the high number of veterans in need and are encouraging veterans to seek
  assistance from other community agencies. 






  Our proposed LA2050 program will provide the wraparound case management
  necessary to increase veteran housing retention rates. As operators of a
  transitional housing program that is actively working to meet a 65% transition
  rate to permanent housing, U.S. VETSLos Angeles will already have established
  relationships with veterans moving into community permanent housing.
  Additionally, the U.S. VETSLos Angeles outreach team connects with 18002000
  veterans annually and makes referrals for housing and other services.






  The Veteran Housing Retention program will employ a Housing Retention
  Specialist who will follow up with recently transitioned veterans via personal
  visits and phone calls to make sure that they are maintaining their homes,
  budgeting their money, paying their rent/utilities on time, managing their
  health/mental health issues with the VA medical center.






  The income assistance provided by the VASH program was a successful motivation
  for homeless veterans to seek permanent housing. The U.S. VETS Housing
  Retention program will also offer a financial incentive in the form of tenant
  based assistance for security deposits, utilities and emergency supplies.


What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  10,000+ veterans served since we opened our doors in 1993.



  Our Supportive Services for Veteran Families program became a national model
  within its first year of operation in 2012.



  We consistently maintain an 80% positive transition rate from our transitional
  programs and a 75% sobriety rate. 



  We are the largest veteran community in the U.S.A. with the capacity to house
  660 veterans.



  Opened a 196bed permanent housing in 2011 specifically to address the need for
  affordable housing for low and verylow income veterans
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  The Veteran Housing Retention program will work with the VA, Los Angeles
  Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA), the Los Angeles County Department of
  Mental Health, Los Angeles Legal Aid Foundation, Employment & Education
  Department, California State Parole, HealthRight360. Didi Hirsch Mental Health
  Services, Department of Public Social Services, Department of Child Services
  and Cloudbreak Communities.
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  The program will be measured by the percentage of veterans who retain their
  housing for 18 months with a goal of at least 65% reaching that benchmark. 






  Additionally the program will measure the percentage of veterans who maintain
  their sobriety if in recovery. For those who are not in recovery the program
  will measure how many seek treatment or if relapse occurs whether they agree
  to return to treatment rather than continue using. 






  The program will reinforce the importance of steady income and therefore track
  the employment rate of participants. If veterans are unable to maintain their
  housing for economic reasons, the Housing Retention Specialist will work to
  transition them to a program or affordable housing rather than have them
  return to homelessness.






  The program will be evaluated based on whether benchmarks for client success
  in the measurement areas of maintaining housing, sobriety and employment are
  met and modifications to the program design will be made based on the data.
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  Our Housing Retention Program will directly benefit 55 veterans and their
  families with helping them attain and maintain permanent housing. The program
  will provide up to $1,125 in tenant based rental/utility assistance.
  Additionally, these veterans will benefit from the continued clinical case
  management services and ability to address developing issues before they reach
  crisis mode. Los Angeles’ high rate of homeless veterans will be decreased by
  the addition of this program, and the rate of housing retention will increase.
  Some of the populations most at risk that U.S. VETS assists is veterans with
  mental health issues and histories of incarceration. In both populations,
  access to community support services has been proven to decrease the incidence
  episodes of care in hospitals and recidivism among the parolee population.
  Reducing emergency hospital episodes and lock up time saves the city and State
  tremendous amounts of funding that can be directed at other citizens. 






  As the veterans in the Housing Retention program succeed, they will be more
  engaged in their communities, with their families and their veteran peers.
  After 20 years of providing housing to veterans, U.S. VETS has seen the
  benefit to the community of veterans who become role models of positive
  behavior. They influence the behavior of their peers and their children in
  meaningful ways.






  Once housing is stabilized, people are able to focus their attention on
  improving other areas of their lives including continuing education and
  participation in community and cultural experiences. Removing the stress of
  not having a sense of security in the basic human need of safe shelter will
  enable these veterans to improve their health and relationships with their
  families.
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: No More Homeless Vets  period!
