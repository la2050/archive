title: GLOBALGIRL MEDIA HIVE NETWORK
project_summary: "Los Angeles is one of the largest producers of media in the world in terms of television and films, and more recently, online/broadband media. The creation and consumption of this media is an integral aspect of growing up in Los Angeles. But with 45% of households in L.A. not earning enough to cover basic expenses, the chances that young people have to influence or participate in media is limited. Even with the explosion of new media formats and delivery platforms, marginalized L.A. youth, particularly young women, continue to be underrepresented both behind the camera and in front of it — creating a “digital divide.” For a city so advanced and connected through film/media technologies, it is still shocking how it is one of the more disconnected cities in terms of integrating neighborhoods, cultural/arts groups, and young people, and how so much of the media industry continues to lock out the female voice.\r\n\r\nGlobalGirl Media (GGM) develops the voice and media literacy of teenage girls in under-served communities in Los Angeles by teaching them to create and share digital journalism designed to ignite civic engagement and social change. Our model is unique in that it pairs girls in L.A. with girls in the developing world, creating a peer-to-peer international network of girls that communicate via new media, co-producing POV-style journalism content that informs, engages and challenges its audience to action. GGM currently has projects in South Africa, Morocco, Chicago and Los Angeles, where it is headquartered.\r\n\r\nWhile teenage girls are by far the most active demographic on social media, they are still more consumers rather than creators. Research has shown that  girls’ relationships, self-esteem and school performance are oftentimes negatively impacted by the more time they spend online, (Girl Scout Research Institute, 2011). GGM believes young women need to be creating their own media rather than consuming it.  We envision a worldwide movement where young women are learning to challenge, innovate and reshape their worlds through digital media. With the explosive growth of “edutech” and digital learning programs across the nation, GGM sees itself as a collaborative, innovative and leading partner in this movement, by promoting diverse, cross-cultural viewpoints from a demographic rarely heard from in this arena: the young female voice. \r\n\r\nFounded in 2010, GGM was inspired by other youth media and digital literacy projects in Los Angeles, where community-based journalism, storytelling and filmmaking workshops are reshaping young people’s lives (LA Freewaves, Urban Media Foundation,\r\nIntersections South LA, Boyle Heights Beat, Venice Arts, HOLA, Echo Park Film School, etc.) We are proposing a GLOBALGIRLS MEDIA HIVE NETWORK, working together with these like-minded organizations to amplify the civic voices, aspirations and digital networks of girls to realize a more connected, equitable and sustainable future for Los Angeles. \r\n\r\nWe are seeking funding to develop this hive, to be hosted at the Robert F. Kennedy Digital Media Learning Lab, inviting girls from all our networked programs to participate in a weekly after-school digital media lab throughout the school year, with a 4-week intensive kick-off course in the summer of 2013. Our program will train an initial 60 teen-age girls in digital literacy, solutions-based journalism, HD video production, web 2.0 basics, cell phone filming/texting and on-air media training. The girls will work in production teams and select their own subject matter, which will focus on issues of particular relevance to their lives, such as violence against women; sexuality, reproductive rights, education and careers, food and obesity, bullying and cyber relationships, education, arts, sports, music and culture.  Visiting lectures by leading women professionals in media are incorporated into the curriculum, and the training also includes field trips to local newspapers, radio and television stations, maker/hacker spaces, youtube studios, etc.  Our impact is as global as the reach of the internet and cellphone technology.  More than just giving girls the skills they need to create original media--we make sure it’s seen. Our interactive website is a place where girls can safely upload and watch their videos, post blogs, play games, add comments, and interact with young mediamakers throughout the world. \r\n\r\nAfter the summer training, The GLOBALGIRLS MEDIA HIVE will become a safe haven/hangout for girls all across Los Angeles who can drop in, create media, share stories and otherwise network with each other throughout the school year. Although there are a finite number of girls being trained each year (60) as GlobalGirl Reporters, the hive hangout will be open to any girl in Los Angeles.  Literally a HIVE of activity, girls will be producing local news programs, films, games, phone apps and media content that improves the overall quality of young womens’ lives in Los Angeles.\r\n"

  success: "While many digital news training programs and sites produce great content, they stop short of really activating their audience, finding out how that content influences and shapes lives.  We at GGM are especially interested in how our training and the girls’ stories impact themselves and their communities.  \r\n\r\nGlobalGirl Media tracks its success and achievements through many indicators, both quantitatively and qualitatively. We assess our GlobalGirl participants before, during and post-training, and we follow-up with questionaires and face-to-face interviews through our mentorship program.  In addition, we collect and analyze data from our website and social media sites, through popular engagement metrics such as Chartbeat, Facebook Insights, GetClicky, etc. \r\n\r\nHowever, we also acknowledge the pitfalls of evaluating this population and we are looking beyond the number of hits a video or website gets to really assessing the impact on our participants, their families and peers. We will be working with Kimberley Silver, the Director of Mission Measurement, LLC a strategy consulting firm that helps clients to create value through social change. They will help us track elusive and intangible outcomes such as college readiness, financial stability, policy change and public awareness.  We can then create new data through smart proxies and develop reliable insights that inform strategic decisions that will better help us communicate persuasively with our audience and future donors.\r\n\r\nBecause this will be the first time we work with such a large network of other organizations, we will collaborate on a robust evaluation program with best practices developed by these other organizations.  We are keen to include more long-term evaluations of all our participants, tracking such measurables as girls’ grades, motivation, family relationships, etc. before and after their participation in all our programs.  We also are dedicated to assessing how our videos and blogs are changing/shaping our youth viewers, and are presently designing an in-depth evaluation that will provide a better picture of how our audience goes from users to investors, in terms of both social capitols and/or as content contributors, volunteers, commentators, donors, or subscribers.\r\n"

  description: "Anyone who lives in Los Angeles is aware of the glaring disparities between wealth, education and access, and how these schisms play out in the media. Girls in our target communities are grappling with a 45% high school dropout rate, gang and drug violence, high rates of teen pregnancy, and the overall challenges of growing up with limited resources. It doesn't help when they are also bombarded with highly sensationalistic reporting and negative stereotypes in film, television and music videos, rather than providing positive images and role-models.\r\n\r\nBeing able to tell one’s own story and believe in one’s own voice is the beginning of being able to advocate for all forms of social justice. GGM believes its model of interactive, peer-based media training through which young women seek to exert both voice and influence on issues of public concern can lead to real systemic change.  Our training provides a fun, connected, and personalized education experience that  recognizes girls’ strengths in technology and media, areas where they don’t necessarily gravitate. This in turn helps them stay focused, stay in school, develop and demonstrate skills and abilities for jobs and economic development.\r\n\r\nThe potential of increasing access for women and girls to new media technology is exponential. Once one young woman experiences the transformative benefits of the program, she often becomes a “transmitter” introducing others in her community to her ideas and work, creating a ripple effect of change. Girls who are feeling disconnected can start to feel “connected” throughout our hive network, seeking out mentors, apprenticeships and other GlobalGirls from across L.A. and other countries.\r\n\r\nWhat we are really doing is advocating for a girl-driven global “digital citizenship,” where girls harness social media for social change, sharing and transferring their new knowledge with other girls who interact internationally on our website, games, apps and blogs, who in turn build on that knowledge and remix it for their own needs, then pay it forward by sharing/resharing that knowledge.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to our target area’s dropout rate, GGM graduates have a 100% high school enrollment/graduation rate and a 90% college enrollment rate. Further, 69% have continued to report for the L.A. bureau beyond their initial training. Girls who have taken our training talk about the power of connectivity, authorship and how making their own media gives them confidence to build brighter futures.\r\n\r\nIn a recent Ted Talk, GlobalGirl Rocio Ortega said this: “GlobalGirl Media taught me for the first time the value of my own voice, I worked with Tebogo form South Africa, and although we have similar dreams and ambitions, we learn from our different experiences…I thought I was alone in my struggle with my father and my culture. My opportunity with GGM has helped me to speak my mind and express my ideas-- we’ve not only become global sisters, but advocates for change in our community…”\r\n"

  description3: "Instead of seeing parallel arts/digital youth media/alternative education organizations in Los Angeles as competition, we have reached out to them to collaborate, which is the basic notion behind our GIRLS HIVE NETWORK. We are working with a dynamic group of like-minded institutions and organizations to invite girls from their programs to participate, share resources and build capacity (see list in partners section). \r\n\r\nSome of these organizations will either nominate girls from their own training programs, suggest and provide story ideas, network, and otherwise help to support the overall goal of connectedness and digital citizenship for a greater Los Angeles.  Because we are creating media network to empower girls, we want to build capacity for all our work, creating cross-pollination of ideas, resources and visions. We feel this is sorely lacking in the non-profit arts/media education field in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nHowever, unlike our partner youth media/education and after school programs, we have a global reach. Our goal is to connect all our young learners with GlobalGirls in our sister projects in South Africa and Morocco, with additional projects being launched in Kenya, Lebanon, Detroit and New York in the next three years. \r\n"
  vision: "Success will be thriving, connected, innovative and safe digital learning space for young women in Los Angeles.  Most critical to our success, more girls from low-income communities in Los Angeles will be more likely to stay in school, stay connected and excited about learning, and have a more global view of the world. \r\n\r\nOur GLOBALGIRLS HIVE NETWORK will launch hundreds of confident, empowered and opinionated young women into the job market of Los Angeles, building new digital start-ups, leading the way in innovative media and digital educaton initiatives that will put L.A. on the map as a city where women, and particularly African American and Latina women in new media technologies are breaking new ground. Yes, L.A. presently ranks third in the nation in terms of entrepreneurship and digital start-ups, but this growing \"silicon beach\" spirit must include more women, half the population of Los Angeles (!),  if it is to truly transform our city. \r\n\r\nOur success will also mean that girls will be contributing to the larger L.A. media landscape, improving access for women to professional careers in print and broadcast journalism, film and television production, new media, gaming, etc. In 2050, we see gender parity in all areas of media, due to the work of GlobalGirl Media: more female news editors and news directors, more female film/TV directors, cinematographers, producers, writers. More media that doesn’t dumb down, sexualize or otherwise stereotype women and girls. \r\n\r\nResearch by Stacy Smith at the Geena Davis' Institute on Gender and Media finds a causal relationship between female content creators and positive female portrayals in media. GGM imagines a world where young girls engage in these positive images, breaking personal boundaries and ultimately beginning to shift cultural and societal gender perceptions, having a monumental impact on the entertainment industry.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by the explosive growth in broadband TV and broadband producers (100% growth in the last 12 months to become a 6 billion dollar industry) our success will also be to expand from our current model to create a full-service broadband distribution channel – a “thinking girls global YouTube” -- that not only features work produced by GlobalGIrl Media reporters, but also includes news stories about issues pertinent to young women the world over. This GlobalGirl broadband channel will investigate what it means to be a girl today, streaming online news content by, for and about girls, and will become the “go-to” place for girls around the world, as well as researchers, reporters and teachers that will use the content for their specific needs.\r\n"

  Los Angeles is one of the largest producers of media in the world in terms of
  television and films, and more recently, online/broadband media. The creation
  and consumption of this media is an integral aspect of growing up in Los
  Angeles. But with 45% of households in L.A. not earning enough to cover basic
  expenses, the chances that young people have to influence or participate in
  media is limited. Even with the explosion of new media formats and delivery
  platforms, marginalized L.A. youth, particularly young women, continue to be
  underrepresented both behind the camera and in front of it — creating a
  “digital divide.” For a city so advanced and connected through film/media
  technologies, it is still shocking how it is one of the more disconnected
  cities in terms of integrating neighborhoods, cultural/arts groups, and young
  people, and how so much of the media industry continues to lock out the female
  voice.






  GlobalGirl Media (GGM) develops the voice and media literacy of teenage girls
  in underserved communities in Los Angeles by teaching them to create and share
  digital journalism designed to ignite civic engagement and social change. Our
  model is unique in that it pairs girls in L.A. with girls in the developing
  world, creating a peertopeer international network of girls that communicate
  via new media, coproducing POVstyle journalism content that informs, engages
  and challenges its audience to action. GGM currently has projects in South
  Africa, Morocco, Chicago and Los Angeles, where it is headquartered.






  While teenage girls are by far the most active demographic on social media,
  they are still more consumers rather than creators. Research has shown that 
  girls’ relationships, selfesteem and school performance are oftentimes
  negatively impacted by the more time they spend online, (Girl Scout Research
  Institute, 2011). GGM believes young women need to be creating their own media
  rather than consuming it.  We envision a worldwide movement where young women
  are learning to challenge, innovate and reshape their worlds through digital
  media. With the explosive growth of “edutech” and digital learning programs
  across the nation, GGM sees itself as a collaborative, innovative and leading
  partner in this movement, by promoting diverse, crosscultural viewpoints from
  a demographic rarely heard from in this arena: the young female voice. 






  Founded in 2010, GGM was inspired by other youth media and digital literacy
  projects in Los Angeles, where communitybased journalism, storytelling and
  filmmaking workshops are reshaping young people’s lives (LA Freewaves, Urban
  Media Foundation,



  Intersections South LA, Boyle Heights Beat, Venice Arts, HOLA, Echo Park Film
  School, etc.) We are proposing a GLOBALGIRLS MEDIA HIVE NETWORK, working
  together with these likeminded organizations to amplify the civic voices,
  aspirations and digital networks of girls to realize a more connected,
  equitable and sustainable future for Los Angeles. 






  We are seeking funding to develop this hive, to be hosted at the Robert F.
  Kennedy Digital Media Learning Lab, inviting girls from all our networked
  programs to participate in a weekly afterschool digital media lab throughout
  the school year, with a 4week intensive kickoff course in the summer of 2013.
  Our program will train an initial 60 teenage girls in digital literacy,
  solutionsbased journalism, HD video production, web 2.0 basics, cell phone
  filming/texting and onair media training. The girls will work in production
  teams and select their own subject matter, which will focus on issues of
  particular relevance to their lives, such as violence against women;
  sexuality, reproductive rights, education and careers, food and obesity,
  bullying and cyber relationships, education, arts, sports, music and culture. 
  Visiting lectures by leading women professionals in media are incorporated
  into the curriculum, and the training also includes field trips to local
  newspapers, radio and television stations, maker/hacker spaces, youtube
  studios, etc.  Our impact is as global as the reach of the internet and
  cellphone technology.  More than just giving girls the skills they need to
  create original mediawe make sure it’s seen. Our interactive website is a
  place where girls can safely upload and watch their videos, post blogs, play
  games, add comments, and interact with young mediamakers throughout the
  world. 






  After the summer training, The GLOBALGIRLS MEDIA HIVE will become a safe
  haven/hangout for girls all across Los Angeles who can drop in, create media,
  share stories and otherwise network with each other throughout the school
  year. Although there are a finite number of girls being trained each year (60)
  as GlobalGirl Reporters, the hive hangout will be open to any girl in Los
  Angeles.  Literally a HIVE of activity, girls will be producing local news
  programs, films, games, phone apps and media content that improves the overall
  quality of young womens’ lives in Los Angeles.


What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >+

Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >+
  While many digital news training programs and sites produce great content,
  they stop short of really activating their audience, finding out how that
  content influences and shapes lives.  We at GGM are especially interested in
  how our training and the girls’ stories impact themselves and their
  communities.  






  GlobalGirl Media tracks its success and achievements through many indicators,
  both quantitatively and qualitatively. We assess our GlobalGirl participants
  before, during and posttraining, and we followup with questionaires and
  facetoface interviews through our mentorship program.  In addition, we collect
  and analyze data from our website and social media sites, through popular
  engagement metrics such as Chartbeat, Facebook Insights, GetClicky, etc. 






  However, we also acknowledge the pitfalls of evaluating this population and we
  are looking beyond the number of hits a video or website gets to really
  assessing the impact on our participants, their families and peers. We will be
  working with Kimberley Silver, the Director of Mission Measurement, LLC a
  strategy consulting firm that helps clients to create value through social
  change. They will help us track elusive and intangible outcomes such as
  college readiness, financial stability, policy change and public awareness. 
  We can then create new data through smart proxies and develop reliable
  insights that inform strategic decisions that will better help us communicate
  persuasively with our audience and future donors.






  Because this will be the first time we work with such a large network of other
  organizations, we will collaborate on a robust evaluation program with best
  practices developed by these other organizations.  We are keen to include more
  longterm evaluations of all our participants, tracking such measurables as
  girls’ grades, motivation, family relationships, etc. before and after their
  participation in all our programs.  We also are dedicated to assessing how our
  videos and blogs are changing/shaping our youth viewers, and are presently
  designing an indepth evaluation that will provide a better picture of how our
  audience goes from users to investors, in terms of both social capitols and/or
  as content contributors, volunteers, commentators, donors, or subscribers.


How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
  Anyone who lives in Los Angeles is aware of the glaring disparities between
  wealth, education and access, and how these schisms play out in the media.
  Girls in our target communities are grappling with a 45% high school dropout
  rate, gang and drug violence, high rates of teen pregnancy, and the overall
  challenges of growing up with limited resources. It doesn't help when they are
  also bombarded with highly sensationalistic reporting and negative stereotypes
  in film, television and music videos, rather than providing positive images
  and rolemodels.






  Being able to tell one’s own story and believe in one’s own voice is the
  beginning of being able to advocate for all forms of social justice. GGM
  believes its model of interactive, peerbased media training through which
  young women seek to exert both voice and influence on issues of public concern
  can lead to real systemic change.  Our training provides a fun, connected, and
  personalized education experience that  recognizes girls’ strengths in
  technology and media, areas where they don’t necessarily gravitate. This in
  turn helps them stay focused, stay in school, develop and demonstrate skills
  and abilities for jobs and economic development.






  The potential of increasing access for women and girls to new media technology
  is exponential. Once one young woman experiences the transformative benefits
  of the program, she often becomes a “transmitter” introducing others in her
  community to her ideas and work, creating a ripple effect of change. Girls who
  are feeling disconnected can start to feel “connected” throughout our hive
  network, seeking out mentors, apprenticeships and other GlobalGirls from
  across L.A. and other countries.






  What we are really doing is advocating for a girldriven global “digital
  citizenship,” where girls harness social media for social change, sharing and
  transferring their new knowledge with other girls who interact internationally
  on our website, games, apps and blogs, who in turn build on that knowledge and
  remix it for their own needs, then pay it forward by sharing/resharing that
  knowledge.






  In contrast to our target area’s dropout rate, GGM graduates have a 100% high
  school enrollment/graduation rate and a 90% college enrollment rate. Further,
  69% have continued to report for the L.A. bureau beyond their initial
  training. Girls who have taken our training talk about the power of
  connectivity, authorship and how making their own media gives them confidence
  to build brighter futures.






  In a recent Ted Talk, GlobalGirl Rocio Ortega said this: “GlobalGirl Media
  taught me for the first time the value of my own voice, I worked with Tebogo
  form South Africa, and although we have similar dreams and ambitions, we learn
  from our different experiences…I thought I was alone in my struggle with my
  father and my culture. My opportunity with GGM has helped me to speak my mind
  and express my ideas we’ve not only become global sisters, but advocates for
  change in our community…”


What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >+
  Success will be thriving, connected, innovative and safe digital learning
  space for young women in Los Angeles.  Most critical to our success, more
  girls from lowincome communities in Los Angeles will be more likely to stay in
  school, stay connected and excited about learning, and have a more global view
  of the world. 






  Our GLOBALGIRLS HIVE NETWORK will launch hundreds of confident, empowered and
  opinionated young women into the job market of Los Angeles, building new
  digital startups, leading the way in innovative media and digital educaton
  initiatives that will put L.A. on the map as a city where women, and
  particularly African American and Latina women in new media technologies are
  breaking new ground. Yes, L.A. presently ranks third in the nation in terms of
  entrepreneurship and digital startups, but this growing "silicon beach" spirit
  must include more women, half the population of Los Angeles (!),  if it is to
  truly transform our city. 






  Our success will also mean that girls will be contributing to the larger L.A.
  media landscape, improving access for women to professional careers in print
  and broadcast journalism, film and television production, new media, gaming,
  etc. In 2050, we see gender parity in all areas of media, due to the work of
  GlobalGirl Media: more female news editors and news directors, more female
  film/TV directors, cinematographers, producers, writers. More media that
  doesn’t dumb down, sexualize or otherwise stereotype women and girls. 






  Research by Stacy Smith at the Geena Davis' Institute on Gender and Media
  finds a causal relationship between female content creators and positive
  female portrayals in media. GGM imagines a world where young girls engage in
  these positive images, breaking personal boundaries and ultimately beginning
  to shift cultural and societal gender perceptions, having a monumental impact
  on the entertainment industry.






  Encouraged by the explosive growth in broadband TV and broadband producers
  (100% growth in the last 12 months to become a 6 billion dollar industry) our
  success will also be to expand from our current model to create a fullservice
  broadband distribution channel — a “thinking girls global YouTube”  that not
  only features work produced by GlobalGIrl Media reporters, but also includes
  news stories about issues pertinent to young women the world over. This
  GlobalGirl broadband channel will investigate what it means to be a girl
  today, streaming online news content by, for and about girls, and will become
  the “goto” place for girls around the world, as well as researchers, reporters
  and teachers that will use the content for their specific needs.
