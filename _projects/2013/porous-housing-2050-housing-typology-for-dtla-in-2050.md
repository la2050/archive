title: 'Porous Housing 2050: Housing Typology for DTLA in 2050'
project_summary: "Over the past few years, the City of Los Angeles has been making ardent, varied attempts at revitalizing its Downtown district. For instance, contemporary cultural nuclei such as The Disney Concert Hall, The Broad Museum have been generating much public interest. Furthermore redevelopment of neighborhoods and renewed events in the Artists’ district has stirred more awareness so as to cajole the vivacity of the City of Angeles. These attempts assert an indirect impetus at restraining the issue of land-use but do not solve the fundamental problem.\r\nAs the incumbent urban sprawl deters mobility in Los Angeles, most commercial and recreational infrastructure has moved to suburban areas due to the availability of affordable, expansive land, and easy access. This in turn coerces Angelinos to use their personal motor vehicles to access downtown and its satellite facilities which is all the more prominent on weekends.\r\nThe Central Business District (CBD) Decline Phenomenon is becoming graver, as the Downtown is strictly utilized for business and commerce affairs but lacks much recreational activity thereafter. Fundamentally, it forces deficiency in pedestrian activity, causes traffic congestion, increased demand for parking spaces, lack of urban parks and public space which are inherently interrelated. Los Angeles is also the city with the largest homeless population with settlements in the Skid Row district bordering downtown. Unfortunately, the temperate climate and lack of assistance for the homeless has contributed to this precipitous growth of the Skid row district.\r\nOur research is based on a futuristic vision for urban collective housing with emphasis on use in Downtown Los Angeles (DTLA). Through our research we hope to envision L.A.’s housing requirements for the future and develop new housing typologies to address these very requisites.\r\nNew typologies for urban collective housing demand an exhaustive study of contextual downtown parameters such as urbanism, architecture, landscape, ecology, and social culture. This paradigm is beset by the predominant terse or perhaps lack of, use of the district in non-business hours. The research would work as a catalyst in arousing passion for the futuristic urban housing for the new era, far from the maximum units stacked prevalent woven into the fabric of the district."

  description: "Developing an affordable multi housing complex would contribute to revitalizing DTLA in various ways; provide housing opportunities for low income Angelinos, create work opportunities, give hope to skid row dwellers to find affordable housing, assist in restoring urban beauty, support pedestrian activity for downtown vibrancy, provide equal housing and equal opportunity by creating a homogenous community devoid of social class or ethnic schisms.  \r\nWe feel that if a housing typology serves as more than just a place of residence and advocates itself as social housing, it promotes a sense of community thereby insinuating self-resilience and sustainability. This allows all residents to engage as active members of the community who can socialize without biases. This is particularly important because characteristically the homeless population and low income groups tend to be isolated from mainstream society. While executing this process, there is more possibility to develop on the expansive function of housing such as advanced correlations between housing and sustainability, landscapes, urban-scapes, infrastructure which would foster further evolved typologies.\r\nBeyond generic housing complex, developing a new typology connected with public space, urban green space, or mixed-use would also serve as a catalyst to solve problems DTLA faces as urban collective housing which presently echoes a sense of reclusion from one another.\r\n"
  collaborators: "We understand that such definitive research needs rich collaboration between disciplines to envision a worthy future for the city. It beseeches urban planners, designers, engineers, landscape architects, ecosystem specialists, sustainability scientists and most importantly city dwellers to engage and develop operatives to derive new typologies. \r\nPer the project agenda, we will let specialists conduct specific research separately about detailed themes or quantitative data to foster futuristic society. Yet, our methods will also require constant collaboration between theorists and practitioners to maintain a resolute course of action."

  description1: "In many instances, professional practice may have constraints that could be client driven or simply pertaining to ordinances and budgetary constraints. In my earnest efforts at overcoming such limitations by streamlining design operatives, I founded UNITEDLAB as a private practice in 2006. It strives to develop and refine said operatives by periodically participating in international competitions while engaging in theoretical and adaptive research. To that effect, chosen topics vary from architecture and landscape architecture to urban design and cross-disciplinary systems with locations in Asia, the United States, and Europe. Projects such as the Magok Waterfront and Busan River City are provocative urban scenarios which combine city planning with infrastructure, landscape, architecture, social policy, and development as urban expansion merges with green belts or farmland merges into cities. When working on these proposals it was important to understand that the city is not merely the sum of many objects but a kind of organism which relates to and is composed of those that are visible as well as numerous invisible variables. The Magok Waterfront Project was awarded by the American Institute of Architects (New York) and by the State of New York.\r\nIn the Yongsan Park Masterplan, we proposed a project to ecologically regenerate an urban site that had been used as a military base for more than 100 years. Its location in central Seoul, as well as its proximity to Old Seoul eventually distorted its natural axis.

Its solution demanded research about the ecology and sustainability inherent to the site. UNITEDLAB was fortunate enough to receive the ASLA Professional Award and an AIA LA Award for this project.\r\nMore recently, I developed a research project called ‘Los Angeles Affordable Apartments,’ a multi-unit residential prototype based on traditional village housing schemes.

    The city is not merely a sum of quasi-determined criteria but more of a
    dynamic organism in constant flux that is ever changing. Such an endeavor of
    generating new typologies cannot be just the vision of a developer. 
  vision: >-
    We feel that creating social housing typologies will create a more
    multi-dimensional transition between the different districts in DTLA. In
    present day context, there is a stark visible contrast demarcating various
    districts and this is all the more clear when it comes to the Skid Row and
    its surrounding streets. We have already seen how there is renewed interest
    in livening the use of space in downtown and we believe that our suggested
    research and its inference will generate more interest for pedestrian
    activity and use of spaces that will never be desolate at different times.
    The three dimensionality of such a project will invite dwellers to walk
    more, socialize more, take public transportation and actively engage with
    the community. Not declined by urban sprawl, public spaces, plazas,
    residential, businesses will all be more pedestrianized with interaction
    from people of all age groups, ethnicities devoid of social segregations. We
    feel that it will present a social reclamation of the two dimensional
    demarcation and inherent decline while generating close ties between
    elaborately interweaved DTLA districts building a strong sense of
    communities.

  Over the past few years, the City of Los Angeles has been making ardent,
  varied attempts at revitalizing its Downtown district. For instance,
  contemporary cultural nuclei such as The Disney Concert Hall, The Broad Museum
  have been generating much public interest. Furthermore redevelopment of
  neighborhoods and renewed events in the Artists’ district has stirred more
  awareness so as to cajole the vivacity of the City of Angeles. These attempts
  assert an indirect impetus at restraining the issue of landuse but do not
  solve the fundamental problem.



  As the incumbent urban sprawl deters mobility in Los Angeles, most commercial
  and recreational infrastructure has moved to suburban areas due to the
  availability of affordable, expansive land, and easy access. This in turn
  coerces Angelinos to use their personal motor vehicles to access downtown and
  its satellite facilities which is all the more prominent on weekends.



  The Central Business District (CBD) Decline Phenomenon is becoming graver, as
  the Downtown is strictly utilized for business and commerce affairs but lacks
  much recreational activity thereafter. Fundamentally, it forces deficiency in
  pedestrian activity, causes traffic congestion, increased demand for parking
  spaces, lack of urban parks and public space which are inherently
  interrelated. Los Angeles is also the city with the largest homeless
  population with settlements in the Skid Row district bordering downtown.
  Unfortunately, the temperate climate and lack of assistance for the homeless
  has contributed to this precipitous growth of the Skid row district.



  Our research is based on a futuristic vision for urban collective housing with
  emphasis on use in Downtown Los Angeles (DTLA). Through our research we hope
  to envision L.A.’s housing requirements for the future and develop new housing
  typologies to address these very requisites.



  New typologies for urban collective housing demand an exhaustive study of
  contextual downtown parameters such as urbanism, architecture, landscape,
  ecology, and social culture. This paradigm is beset by the predominant terse
  or perhaps lack of, use of the district in nonbusiness hours. The research
  would work as a catalyst in arousing passion for the futuristic urban housing
  for the new era, far from the maximum units stacked prevalent woven into the
  fabric of the district.

  We understand that such definitive research needs rich collaboration between
  disciplines to envision a worthy future for the city. It beseeches urban
  planners, designers, engineers, landscape architects, ecosystem specialists,
  sustainability scientists and most importantly city dwellers to engage and
  develop operatives to derive new typologies. 



  Per the project agenda, we will let specialists conduct specific research
  separately about detailed themes or quantitative data to foster futuristic
  society. Yet, our methods will also require constant collaboration between
  theorists and practitioners to maintain a resolute course of action.
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >+
  Predicting and evaluating the future of housing that positively influences the
  dynamism of a city should have an augmented forethought well beyond
  unscrambling present day challenges.



  The pivotal attribute being that such a proposal should first catalyze
  fulfilling implementation and set a precedent for further research and
  predictions. 






  We postulate that the evaluation for measurement of success will consist of
  three different scales: 



  Firstly, we will gauge its value and degree of realization as an urban sited
  housing typology. Such a proposed typology will also be tested for its
  contribution to urban development, regeneration and revitalization. We will
  also assess how it solves downtown related problems in terms of urban planning
  or design on a macroscaled view point.



  Furthermore, we will also assess how the expansions of additional functions
  such as green and public spaces interrelate with the housing program. These
  assessments will tiein with the development of social donation and welfare.



  Secondly, the assessment will be a systematical research on a macro and
  microscale. Would this housing be planned for and be able to maintain or
  evolve with residents’ social participation for creating and vitalizing a
  community? How would the housing complex contribute or partake in the
  ecosystem and foster sustainability as well as selfreliance?



  Lastly, at the microscale level, we will infer if this housing functions well?
  Is this housing typology architecturally aesthetic? Were the residents and
  community satisfied with the outcome? How feasible was its development?


How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
  Developing an affordable multi housing complex would contribute to
  revitalizing DTLA in various ways; provide housing opportunities for low
  income Angelinos, create work opportunities, give hope to skid row dwellers to
  find affordable housing, assist in restoring urban beauty, support pedestrian
  activity for downtown vibrancy, provide equal housing and equal opportunity by
  creating a homogenous community devoid of social class or ethnic schisms.  



  We feel that if a housing typology serves as more than just a place of

  Beyond generic housing complex, developing a new typology connected with
  public space, urban green space, or mixeduse would also serve as a catalyst to
  solve problems DTLA faces as urban collective housing which presently echoes a
  sense of reclusion from one another.


What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  We feel that creating social housing typologies will create a more
  multidimensional transition between the different districts in DTLA. In
  present day context, there is a stark visible contrast demarcating various
