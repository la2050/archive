title: PARKINABOX
project_summary: "Park-in-a-Box (PIB) is a moveable pop-up park.   Two shipping containers outfitted to carry park amenities will travel to neighborhood sites for specific community events. Using under-utilized open spaces in Los Angeles, community outreach organizations will schedule an event, order PIB, unpack and configure the containers, and help to activate a neighborhood public space.  We anticipate up to four scheduled events during this initial pilot program phase scheduled by our partner community organizations. \r\nPark-in-a-Box is a kit of park essentials – chairs, tables, umbrellas, kids’ playgrounds, bbq grills, etc. – as well as specialty items requested for particular initiatives- inflatable installations, projectors, sound system, staging areas, and lights.  Once the contents are unpacked, the containers themselves unfold and transform into visual anchors of the park.  Voila! The park is ready!  \r\nPlease visit www.park-in-a-box.la for more information about how Park-in-a-Box works (more images after the jump).\r\n"

  success: "For this pilot program, we will closely evaluate and assess the project using primarily qualitative methods, namely incorporating observations and feedback into a design feedback loop.  We will be present at the pilot events and observe the on-site activities and usage.  In addition, we will interview user groups and outreach groups to gain a better understanding of how Park-in-a-Box is performing with regard to our expectations and user expectations. \r\nGiven the feedback we receive in the pilot stage, we will work with user groups and our partners to refine the program to ensure continued usage of the basic Park-in-the-Box infrastructure.\r\nIf PIB is successful, communities will ask our partners to extend the initiative in their community, schedule another event, or request additional initiatives utilizing PIB.  A successful PIB pilot program will energize a neighborhood and be an example of a quick and effective solution to the lack of nearby access to usable open space in Los Angeles.  \r\n"

  description: "Los Angeles has many park-poor neighborhoods and many communities have limited access to usable open space.  Obesity levels are high, caused in part by lack of access to active spaces and programs.  Park-in-a-Box, with partner organizations, will provide access to underutilized space in underserved neighborhoods, and provide the ingredients necessary for lively and useable open spaces.  Through this new model, Park-in-a-Box hopes to draw attention to the need for public spaces within these communities and encourage Angelinos to re-evaluate how we think about public space in our city.\r\nPlease visit www.park-in-a-box.la for more information about how Park-in-a-Box works (more images after the jump).\r\n"

    PIB has already received a statement of support from the Trust for Public
    Land’s Parks for People Program in Los Angeles
    (http://www.tpl.org/what-we-do/where-we-work/california/los-angeles-county/park-acquisition-design.html),
    which works with local residents to transform vacant lots and underutilized
    spaces to vibrant active parks all over Los Angeles.  The Trust for Public
    Land recognizes PIB as a valuable tool for quickly activating vacant or
    underused lots while waiting for the sometimes lengthy park development
    process to unfold.   As the design team, ERW + SALT will work closely with
    the Trust for Public Land and other community organizations with similar
    missions, who will play a key role in the successful implementation of PIB.

    ERW Design + SALT are design firms whose efforts support local outreach and
    community engagement missions through innovative designs and creative
    planning. We work closely with these groups to help further their missions
    in various under-served communities. We view these non-profits as our
    partners and not competitors.  
  vision: >-
    Park-in-the-Box has the potential to kickstart the conversion of empty lots
    into permanent neighborhood assets.  Success in the year 2050 would see the
    doubling of permanent small and medium sized public spaces in identified
    park-poor neighborhoods, and the City of Los Angeles would be recognized as
    the national leader in promoting neighborhood open spaces.  PIB is a
    catalyst for neighborhood change and a strong contributor to building a
    greener, healthier city for all communities.

  ParkinaBox (PIB) is a moveable popup park.   Two shipping containers outfitted
  to carry park amenities will travel to neighborhood sites for specific

  outreach organizations will schedule an event, order PIB, unpack and configure
  the containers, and help to activate a neighborhood public space.  We
  anticipate up to four scheduled events during this initial pilot program phase
  scheduled by our partner community organizations.

What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  ERW Design + SALT have partnered to develop the ParkinaBox concept.  ERW
  Design (www.erwdesign.com) is an awardwinning, multidisciplinary architecture
  firm whose work is based on the intersection of the built form and the
  landscape. Founded in 1999, ERW Design has completed over 40 institutional,

  ERW Design received the Grand Prize, as well as the award for best Civic
  Project for their work at Vista Hermosa Park.  The project received Best Urban
  Project by the Los Angeles AIA in 2009.  



  SALT Landscape Architects (www.salt.com) is a Los Angelesbased design studio
  focused on creating enduring, engaging, and innovative landscapes on a range
  of scales. The firm’s name, derived from “salt of the earth,” reflects the
  sense of grounding that we strive for in all of our projects. 



  SALT has been working with the Trust for Public Land (www.tpl.org), also our
  partner for ParkinaBox, over the past year to bring significant changes to the
  Avalon community of Los Angeles, south of downtown. SALT developed a master
  plan for the pedestrian opportunities in the community, including a thorough

  SALT also cofounded the Take Back the Boulevard (TBTB) initiative in 2011 in
  the Eagle Rock neighborhood of northeast Los Angeles. TBTB is seeking to bring
  significant pedestrian improvements to Colorado Boulevard through a grassroots
  and community based effort, focused on recapturing a portion of the public

Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >+
  For this pilot program, we will closely evaluate and assess the project using
  primarily qualitative methods, namely incorporating observations and feedback
  into a design feedback loop.  We will be present at the pilot events and
  observe the onsite activities and usage.  In addition, we will interview user
  groups and outreach groups to gain a better understanding of how ParkinaBox is
  performing with regard to our expectations and user expectations. 



  Given the feedback we receive in the pilot stage, we will work with user
  groups and our partners to refine the program to ensure continued usage of the
  basic ParkintheBox infrastructure.



  If PIB is successful, communities will ask our partners to extend the
  initiative in their community, schedule another event, or request additional
  initiatives utilizing PIB.  A successful PIB pilot program will energize a
  neighborhood and be an example of a quick and effective solution to the lack
  of nearby access to usable open space in Los Angeles.  


How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
