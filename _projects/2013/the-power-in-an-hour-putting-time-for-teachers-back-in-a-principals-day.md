title: 'The power in an hour: Putting time for teachers back in a principals day'
project_summary: >-
  <i>If you had an extra hour in your workday, what could you do?<br>If you
  spent an hour with a coach, focusing on the most challenging parts of your
  job, how helpful would that be?</i><br><br><b>We seek to put an hour back into
  each school principal’s day – so that they can put that hour each day into one
  of the classrooms in their school.</b><br><br>For our public education system
  to prepare every child to thrive in college, career, and life, all classrooms
  must be led by excellent teachers who are consistently supported, developed,
  and coached by great principals.<br><br>Though responsible for supporting
  teachers’ professional growth and development, principals often face
  challenges that reduce their ability to support teachers: with the myriad
  responsibilities of running a school, and with budget cuts forcing staff
  reduction, many principals don’t have the time or the staff capacity they need
  to devote to this important work. <br><br>The idea to meet this challenge is
  simple. Connect great principals with some really sharp people - <i>Education
  Pioneers Fellows</i> - to work with them to <b>ASSESS</b> how they currently
  spend their time, <b>REMOVE BARRIERS</b> to using it effectively and
  <b>REDESIGN</b> their systems for managing their school so that they can
  <b>FOCUS</b> on what is critical: supporting the improvement of their teachers
  and the learning of their students.<br><br>In California, which ranks 49th in
  the country with regard to per pupil funding, both school districts and
  charter school organizations must operate with extremely limited resources. 
  In districts, for example, budget cuts have reduced support staff, and an
  elementary school principal who may have previously had two coordinators and
  an assistant principal now functions as the sole school leader. While these
  cuts are necessary to preserve instructional programming, principals are
  confronted on a daily basis with urgent operational and management issues that
  can prevent them from getting into classrooms with their
  teachers.<br><br>Charter school leaders in California, who also operate with
  extremely limited resources, are tasked with taking on a range of
  entrepreneurial challenges that include building systems to support the
  effective management of their schools. With both district and charter schools,
  there is a tremendous amount of impact that can be gained by putting practices
  into place that keep principals out of operational minutiae and instead enable
  them to spend time with their students and teachers.<br><br>Providing key
  human capital support to both district and charter school leaders to help them
  redesign how they are managing their schools and free up their time to focus
  most on their teachers will have a tremendous impact on students.  To
  transform the work of hundreds of principals across Los Angeles, this project
  will seek to:<br><br>1. Understand and improve how principals in multiple
  different school settings spend their time;  <br>2. Develop, test and
  disseminate <b>TOOLS</b> that can be used by any of the more than 1000 school
  administrators across LA. <br><br>The end result is that principals will
  increase the effectiveness of their teachers through increased observation,
  coaching, feedback and collaboration and all students will benefit.

  success: >-
    At the outset of the project, all organizations will agree on a few unifying
    key performance indicators which will be measured before, during, and after
    the fall semester of the 2013-2014 school year.  These indicators will
    include the amount of time a school leader spends supporting teacher
    instruction.<br><br>Qualitative measures of school leader and teacher
    perceptions on the effectiveness of the project will be taken via brief
    online surveys. <br><br>Finally, existing measures, like test scores, will
    be analyzed from year to year and compared between pilot and comparison
    schools.

    Across Los Angeles every morning, 750,000 students enter their classrooms. 
    Each of these classrooms is led by a teacher. And each teacher should have a
    leader who can come into their classroom, observe their instruction and help
    them to grow so that those 750,000 students get the education that they need
    to be successful.  Our LA2050 proposal will enable this to happen at a
    dramatically greater scale.  This project will identify great ideas, develop
    them into tools that can be replicated, and test them for efficacy. Once
    they have been demonstrated to be effective they will be ready to be shared
    across the hundreds of schools that exist in LA.  For example, a tool that
    saves a principal <b>an hour a day</b>, spread to schools across Los Angeles
    would translate to nearly a <b>225,000 hours of coaching and support</b> for
    teachers in their classrooms during each school year. By 2050 this would
    lead to over <b>8 million</b> additional hours spent developing effective
    educators in LA. 
  collaborators: >-
    Education Pioneers (EP) has longstanding partnerships with dozens of
    organizations in Los Angeles. This project is explicitly structured to
    promote collaboration and knowledge sharing across the<b> Los Angeles
    Unified School District, PUC Schools, Camino Nuevo Charter Academy, </b>and
    additional EP partners who will be selected based on their desire to
    collaborate on generating replicable approaches.
  description1: >-
    Founded in 2003 in response to the acute shortage of leadership and
    management talent in the education sector, Education Pioneers attracts,
    prepares, and advances top leaders, managers, and analysts to accelerate
    excellence in education. <br><br>Our partners include major urban school
    districts, charter management organizations, and nonprofit organizations.
    These partners hire EP Fellows to complete mission critical projects and
    fill important organizational roles. EP provides exceptionally valuable
    talent to our Partners. Over 90% of Partners indicate that they would hire
    their Fellow in the future. <br><br>EP has grown into a thriving national
    organization and since its 2007 launch in Los Angeles has supplied
    professional talent to nearly 40 education organizations and built a network
    of program Alumni numbering over 150. EP has significantly expanded the
    talent supply in education by connecting our Alumni to high-impact careers
    in education and supporting them to succeed. More than 70 percent of our
    employed Alumni work full-time in education.
  vision: >-
    In 2050, principals in Los Angeles will lead vibrant communities of
    effective educators who are reflective and committed to continuous
    improvement of their instructional practice. These principals will have
    high-functioning systems and people in place to assure that their highest
    priority is providing instructional leadership to develop teacher leaders,
    and ensure that every child in their school is in a classroom with an
    effective teacher every day.
