    At the outset of the project, all organizations will agree on a few unifying
    key performance indicators which will be measured before, during, and after
    the fall semester of the 2013-2014 school year.  These indicators will
    include the amount of time a school leader spends supporting teacher
    instruction.<br><br>Qualitative measures of school leader and teacher
    perceptions on the effectiveness of the project will be taken via brief
    online surveys. <br><br>Finally, existing measures, like test scores, will
    be analyzed from year to year and compared between pilot and comparison
    schools.
  Indicator: ' Education'
  brief: >-
    <i>If you had an extra hour in your workday, what could you do?<br>If you
    spent an hour with a coach, focusing on the most challenging parts of your
    job, how helpful would that be?</i><br><br><b>We seek to put an hour back
    into each school principal’s day – so that they can put that hour each day
    into one of the classrooms in their school.</b><br><br>For our public
    education system to prepare every child to thrive in college, career, and
    life, all classrooms must be led by excellent teachers who are consistently
    supported, developed, and coached by great principals.<br><br>Though
    responsible for supporting teachers’ professional growth and development,
    principals often face challenges that reduce their ability to support
    teachers: with the myriad responsibilities of running a school, and with
    budget cuts forcing staff reduction, many principals don’t have the time or
    the staff capacity they need to devote to this important work. <br><br>The
    idea to meet this challenge is simple. Connect great principals with some
    really sharp people - <i>Education Pioneers Fellows</i> - to work with them
    to <b>ASSESS</b> how they currently spend their time, <b>REMOVE BARRIERS</b>
    to using it effectively and <b>REDESIGN</b> their systems for managing their
    school so that they can <b>FOCUS</b> on what is critical: supporting the
    improvement of their teachers and the learning of their students.<br><br>In
    California, which ranks 49th in the country with regard to per pupil
    funding, both school districts and charter school organizations must operate
    with extremely limited resources.  In districts, for example, budget cuts
    have reduced support staff, and an elementary school principal who may have
    previously had two coordinators and an assistant principal now functions as
    the sole school leader. While these cuts are necessary to preserve
    instructional programming, principals are confronted on a daily basis with
    urgent operational and management issues that can prevent them from getting
    into classrooms with their teachers.<br><br>Charter school leaders in
    California, who also operate with extremely limited resources, are tasked
    with taking on a range of entrepreneurial challenges that include building
    systems to support the effective management of their schools. With both
    district and charter schools, there is a tremendous amount of impact that
    can be gained by putting practices into place that keep principals out of
    operational minutiae and instead enable them to spend time with their
    students and teachers.<br><br>Providing key human capital support to both
    district and charter school leaders to help them redesign how they are
    managing their schools and free up their time to focus most on their
    teachers will have a tremendous impact on students.  To transform the work
    of hundreds of principals across Los Angeles, this project will seek
    to:<br><br>1. Understand and improve how principals in multiple different
    school settings spend their time;  <br>2. Develop, test and disseminate
    <b>TOOLS</b> that can be used by any of the more than 1000 school
    administrators across LA. <br><br>The end result is that principals will
    increase the effectiveness of their teachers through increased observation,
    coaching, feedback and collaboration and all students will benefit.
  budget explanation: "11,500 x 2 Education Pioneers Summer Fellows (10 weeks) =  $23,000<br>\r\n30,000 x 2 Education Pioneers Fellows (5 months) = $60,000<br>\r\n$4900 x 2 LAUSD Fellows (current LAUSD teachers – 8 weeks over the summer) = $9800<br>\r\nProgram Supplies (meeting meals, etc.) = $700<br>\r\nTechnology Solutions = $6500\r\n"

    Across Los Angeles every morning, 750,000 students enter their classrooms. 
    Each of these classrooms is led by a teacher. And each teacher should have a
    leader who can come into their classroom, observe their instruction and help
    them to grow so that those 750,000 students get the education that they need
    to be successful.  Our LA2050 proposal will enable this to happen at a
    dramatically greater scale.  This project will identify great ideas, develop
    them into tools that can be replicated, and test them for efficacy. Once
    they have been demonstrated to be effective they will be ready to be shared
    across the hundreds of schools that exist in LA.  For example, a tool that
    saves a principal <b>an hour a day</b>, spread to schools across Los Angeles
    would translate to nearly a <b>225,000 hours of coaching and support</b> for
    teachers in their classrooms during each school year. By 2050 this would
    lead to over <b>8 million</b> additional hours spent developing effective
    educators in LA.

  description3: >-
    Education Pioneers is a top tier national recruitment organization. In
    recruiting professional talent we compete with a range of other employers in
    a variety of industries and across multiple sectors. <br><br>While EP fills
    a unique niche as a talent provider to the education sector, partner
    organizations can hire talent independently, or may look to other human
    capital organizations and their networks. These organizations include Teach
    For America, The Broad Center, City Year, and others. Each of these other
    organizations also recruits talent into the education sector, but most often
    at different distinct stages in their careers. Within the nonprofit sector
    there is competition for philanthropic funds and public awareness, while
    this competition is rarely direct for EP, at times we are in competition
    with these other human capital organizations. <br><br>Collaboration is one
    of Education Pioneers’ four core organizational values. EP has an extremely
    high level of collaboration with other human capital organizations in Los
    Angeles. EP has launched a shared online platform for knowledge sharing with
    The Broad Center and the Harvard Strategic Data Project. City Year Los
    Angeles has not only hired Fellows and Alumni, but regularly hosts EP events
    in their space and provides speakers at EP programming events. Teach For
    America is a both a major supplier of talent to EP’s Fellowship programs, as
    well as a significant national partner that hires Fellows to meet internal
    talent needs. <br><br>EP also maintains highly collaborative relationships
    with other employers that compete for the top talent that EP recruits. For
    example, EP Alumni who have gone to work in the private sector have provided
    pro-bono consulting and valuable training opportunities for EP’s network and
    partners in the education sector. EP seeks to engage all of its Alumni, and
    their employers, in the critical work to be done in public education.
  vision: >-
    In 2050, principals in Los Angeles will lead vibrant communities of
    effective educators who are reflective and committed to continuous
    improvement of their instructional practice. These principals will have
    high-functioning systems and people in place to assure that their highest
    priority is providing instructional leadership to develop teacher leaders,
    and ensure that every child in their school is in a classroom with an
    effective teacher every day.
