  RADAR L.A. International Theater Festival; A vital investment in L.A.Theater
  Artists
indicator: Arts & Cultural Vitality
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  The RADAR L.A. Festival of Contemporary Theater brings some of the worlds most
  influential theater companies to downtown L.A., and invests in the future
  vitality of L.A.’s performing arts community with a unique residency program
  that creates infrastructure for L.A. ensembles to create their best work and
  put it in the global spotlight.






  REDCAT and CalArts, with a consortium of public and private partners, will
  contribute to the cultural vitality of L.A.’s evolving downtown, and create
  crucial infrastructure for local performing artists to create new work, with a
  twopart proposal:





   To produce RADAR L.A. 2013, a major international festival of contemporary theater that activates varied downtown L.A. locations with adventurous performances by influential artists from L.A., Latin America, and the Pacific Rim, September 23 to October 6, 2013, and





   To organize a series of extended artist residencies and related public events that expands the neighborhood impact of the festival’s artistic initiatives and allows diverse artists to create new contemporary performances, while also increasing their vital role in the planning process for revitalization of downtown L.A..





  The festival and residency programs build on momentum from the inaugural 2011
  RADAR L.A., which featured 90 performances of 15 productions, engaging over
  200 artists. Over 11,000 diverse patrons wandered between ten locations,
  experiencing affordable theatrical presentations, sitespecific events, social
  gatherings and symposia. The L.A. Times said the “revitalizing” festival
  fulfilled a “vision of downtown as a vibrant cultural nexus…a resounding
  success.”






  By expanding RADAR L.A. with increased artist commissions and residencies,
  artists receive a strategic investment that addresses the L.A. 2050 report’s
  call for policies that nurture the L.A. arts community so it can thrive.






  The experienced curatorial team’s provocative program includes:






  Innovative artists who stretch the boundaries of traditional theater;






  Communitybased projects exploring urgent social justice issues that engage the
  voices of often overlooked residents;






  Cultural influences that reflect L.A.’s demographics, presenting artists from
  Mexico, Chile, Argentina, Japan, and Indonesia;






  Interdisciplinary collaborations merging dance, theater, music and new media.






  The L.A. Times captured the essence of the first festival’s vibrancy, calling
  it “an invaluable addition to the city’s cultural ecology,” and stressing its
  impact on the neighborhood: “Because L.A.’s geography is so sprawling, that
  sense of urban density is hard to achieve. This is why a festival such as
  RADAR L.A.…situated within an easily commutable area, can be so revitalizing…I
  scurried from one theater to the next, bumping into acquaintances old and new
  along the way…”.






  The strategy behind the RADAR L.A. Festival is both local and global,
  recognizing that helping to create work is only one part of the solution—the
  plan must also include engaging the larger national/international field so
  that the impact is greatly enhanced, leading to vastly increased opportunities
  for artists and a significant shift in the perception of Los Angeles as a
  vital center for contemporary theater and dance.  This strategy is proven and
  effective: as a result of the 2011 RADAR L.A. Festival, six of the eight L.A.
  productions toured as a result of the exposure.
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  REDCAT is currently celebrating ten years of bringing experimental and
  interdisciplinary performing and visual art to Los Angeles audiences. Each
  year REDCAT collaborates with local, national and international artists and
  organizations on the presentation of more than 200 events, ranging from
  concerts to lectures, to dance festivals and film series. Collaborating
  directly with a wide range of artists and ensembles in the creation and
  presentation of their work and in the design of REDCAT programming means
  REDCAT is a part of the ongoing conversation about the changing dynamic of the
  local and global arts fields, and is uniquely positioned to influence and also
  respond to changing needs and opportunities. REDCAT engages a young,
  multiethnic, multilingual, and economically diverse audience, welcoming more
  than 60,000 audience members annually to concerts, dance performances,
  theatrical productions and exhibitions.
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >+
  A consortium of REDCAT and CalArts, Center Theatre Group, the City of Los
  Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs, The Public Theater (New York), the Los
  Angeles Stage Alliance, the Los Angeles Theater Center/Latino Theater Company,
  and Theater Communications Group is engaged in the planning for RADAR
  L.A.2013. These respected organizations have joined forces to provide greater
  voice and visibility to contemporary theater from Los Angeles and around the
  world with artists who are creating works that resist easy definitions, using
  dance, media and techniques from performance art, sport, and film.


Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  Impact will be gauged not only by critical and audience response, but also by
  the extent to which RADAR L.A. successfully meets its objectives regarding the
  number of works to be supported and premiered, the cocommissioning
  relationships to be developed, and the audiences reached through performances
  and activities, including new audiences reached through the activation of
  public spaces. Results will be assessed via additional interviews with
  partners, audience surveys and evaluative sessions with community partners.



  An online survey was distributed to all RADAR L.A. Symposium attendees after
  the 2011 Festival, and followup conversations among organizers, artists and
  the producing consortium have taken place in both informal and structured
  settings, leading to program adjustments and clarifications. In addition, 2011
  Festival surveys and conversations indicate significant change in the
  perceived vitality, quality and influence of L.A. performing artists by the
  field.



  The quality of the work is also measured by critical response from critics
  attending the festival, which The L.A. Times described as "a glorious
  convergence of contemporary performance" and "a resounding success" that
  demonstrated "a vision of downtown as a vibrant cultural nexus".
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  The RADAR L.A. Festival and the related programs to support L.A. performing
  artists will benefit Los Angeles in many ways. In addition to creating an
  exciting international cultural event for audiences, it also addresses two
  important civic issues:






  The unique festival and residency programming will contribute to larger,
  longterm strategies to utilize cultural activity as a key way to help
  revitalize transitional downtown neighborhoods that have been adversely
  affected by difficult economic conditions. Most public and private strategies
  for improving the quality of life downtown focus on capital construction and
  physical infrastructure, while the consortium’s proposal provides a burst of
  relatively immediate programmatic activity, serving as a possible model for
  how future cultural facilities currently in the planning stage might best be
  utilized.



  The artistcentric programs are designed to help address the crucial need for
  performing artists to be supported in the creation of new work with
  infrastructure support, financial commissions, and exposure to
  national/international presenters and producers. The L.A. performing arts
  community has been severely underresourced compared to other major cities, and
  the perceived vitality of the arts community suffers as a result. Increasing
  artistic capacity and enhancing the quality of the work created by L.A.
  artists is as essential as investing in cultural facilities, yet limited
  funding has stifled the creation of any comprehensive civic strategies to
  address that issue.









  By giving diverse artists the resources and exposure they need, they become
  better equipped to participate in the transformation of a community. As the
  L.A. 2050 Report cites, there is a need for artists to be nurtured so that
  they can thrive.



  While the actual RADAR festival events are serving audiences and artists in
  many ways, it is the strategic investment in the artists themselves that
  produces the most enduring results for the artistic ecology of the
  neighborhood and the region.



  The consortium addresses challenges that hinder L.A. performing artists:



  L.A performing artists are underrepresented in the international performing
  arts touring field, limiting their ability to thrive.



  Limited funding and infrastructure to create work and showcase it to leaders
  in the field, has kept L. A. artists underrecognized, with limited
  opportunities to tour or compete for national commissions vital to their
  careers.



  Many playwrights, directors and choreographers believe they must leave L.A. to
  have a career. The vitality and reputation of the region’s artistic ecology
  suffers as a result.



  RADAR L.A. helps by commissioning diverse artists and featuring their work
  alongside international productions, for an audience that includes visiting
  producers, presenters and funders, and the international symposium prominently
  features L.A. artists. The success of the 2011 festival demonstrates the
  potential longterm positive impact that reducing thes
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  The Los Angeles performing arts community can become more vibrant and have
  greater international influence if artists are given more opportunities to
  create work and gain exposure nationally and internationally. The L.A. 2050
  Report cites a need to retain artists and nurture them so that they can
  contribute more fully to the cultural ecology.



  Having a dedicated festival that at its mission supports the local arts
  community and brings artists together with presenters, producers and creative
  colleagues is absolutely fundamental to developing our city’s arts and
  cultural vitality. Artists need encouragement, space and critical feedback to
  develop confident artistic identities.  RADAR L.A. presents increased
  opportunities for cultural participation—for both local artists and
  audiences.  A strong, wellrespected performing arts festival will serve Los
  Angeles’ artistic and cultural vitality on many levels and has a spillover
  effect that enhances the quality of life for our greater community.

    year REDCAT collaborates with local, national and international artists and
    organizations on the presentation of more than 200 events, ranging from
    concerts to lectures, to dance festivals and film series. Collaborating
    directly with a wide range of artists and ensembles in the creation and
    presentation of their work and in the design of REDCAT programming means
    REDCAT is a part of the ongoing conversation about the changing dynamic of

    young, multi-ethnic, multi-lingual, and economically diverse audience,
    welcoming more than 60,000 audience members annually to concerts, dance
    performances, theatrical productions and exhibitions.

    REDCAT is increasingly recognized as a leader in an international network of
    adventurous art and performance centers, which together are shaping the
    evolution of contemporary culture. The infrastructure support that REDCAT
    provides to local artists is unique in the region, and the most likely
    alternative would be "self production", requiring the artists to rent a
    theater and equipment, hire technical support, designers, etc. – and conduct
    their own outreach, marketing and press relations. REDCAT is a "primary
    partner" in the National Performance Network, a "Hub Site" for the National
    Dance Project, the Contemporary Arts Centers Network (of organizations with
    both performing arts and visual arts programs), and the Performing Americas
    Program for Latin American/U.S. Exchange.
  vision: "The Los Angeles performing arts community can become more vibrant and have greater international influence if artists are given more opportunities to create work and gain exposure nationally and internationally.

    answer: "The RADAR L.A. Festival and the related programs to support L.A. performing artists will benefit Los Angeles in many ways. In addition to creating an exciting international cultural event for audiences, it also addresses two important civic issues:\r\n\r\n-The unique festival and residency programming will contribute to larger, long-term strategies to utilize cultural activity as a key way to help revitalize transitional downtown neighborhoods that have been adversely affected by difficult economic conditions. Most public and private strategies for improving the quality of life downtown focus on capital construction and physical infrastructure, while the consortium’s proposal provides a burst of relatively immediate programmatic activity, serving as a possible model for how future cultural facilities currently in the planning stage might best be utilized.\r\n-The artist-centric programs are designed to help address the crucial need for performing artists to be supported in the creation of new work with infrastructure support, financial commissions, and exposure to national/international presenters and producers. The L.A. performing arts community has been severely under-resourced compared to other major cities, and the perceived vitality of the arts community suffers as a result. Increasing artistic capacity and enhancing the quality of the work created by L.A. artists is as essential as investing in cultural facilities, yet limited funding has stifled the creation of any comprehensive civic strategies to address that issue.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy giving diverse artists the resources and exposure they need, they become better equipped to participate in the transformation of a community. As the L.A. 2050 Report cites, there is a need for artists to be nurtured so that they can thrive.\r\nWhile the actual RADAR festival events are serving audiences and artists in many ways, it is the strategic investment in the artists themselves that produces the most enduring results for the artistic ecology of the neighborhood and the region.\r\nThe consortium addresses challenges that hinder L.A. performing artists:\r\n-L.A performing artists are under-represented in the international performing arts touring field, limiting their ability to thrive.\r\n-Limited funding and infrastructure to create work and showcase it to leaders in the field, has kept L. A. artists under-recognized, with limited opportunities to tour or compete for national commissions vital to their careers.\r\n-Many playwrights, directors and choreographers believe they must leave L.A. to have a career. The vitality and reputation of the region’s artistic ecology suffers as a result.\r\nRADAR L.A. helps by commissioning diverse artists and featuring their work alongside international productions, for an audience that includes visiting producers, presenters and funders, and the international symposium prominently features L.A. artists. The success of the 2011 festival demonstrates the potential long-term positive impact that reducing thes"

    answer: "A consortium of REDCAT and CalArts, Center Theatre Group, the City of Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs, The Public Theater (New York), the Los Angeles Stage Alliance, the Los Angeles Theater Center/Latino Theater Company, and Theater Communications Group is engaged in the planning for RADAR L.A.2013. These respected organizations have joined forces to provide greater voice and visibility to contemporary theater from Los Angeles and around the world with artists who are creating works that resist easy definitions, using dance, media and techniques from performance art, sport, and film.\r\n"

    answer: "Impact will be gauged not only by critical and audience response, but also by the extent to which RADAR L.A. successfully meets its objectives regarding the number of works to be supported and premiered, the co-commissioning relationships to be developed, and the audiences reached through performances and activities, including new audiences reached through the activation of public spaces. Results will be assessed via additional interviews with partners, audience surveys and evaluative sessions with community partners.\r\nAn online survey was distributed to all RADAR L.A. Symposium attendees after the 2011 Festival, and follow-up conversations among organizers, artists and the producing consortium have taken place in both informal and structured settings, leading to program adjustments and clarifications. In addition, 2011 Festival surveys and conversations indicate significant change in the perceived vitality, quality and influence of L.A. performing artists by the field.\r\nThe quality of the work is also measured by critical response from critics attending the festival, which The L.A. Times described as \"a glorious convergence of contemporary performance\" and \"a resounding success\" that demonstrated \"a vision of downtown as a vibrant cultural nexus\"."

      REDCAT is increasingly recognized as a leader in an international network
      of adventurous art and performance centers, which together are shaping the
      evolution of contemporary culture. The infrastructure support that REDCAT
      provides to local artists is unique in the region, and the most likely
      alternative would be "self production", requiring the artists to rent a
      theater and equipment, hire technical support, designers, etc. – and
      conduct their own outreach, marketing and press relations. REDCAT is a
      "primary partner" in the National Performance Network, a "Hub Site" for
      the National Dance Project, the Contemporary Arts Centers Network (of
      organizations with both performing arts and visual arts programs), and the
      Performing Americas Program for Latin American/U.S. Exchange.

    answer: "The Los Angeles performing arts community can become more vibrant and have greater international influence if artists are given more opportunities to create work and gain exposure nationally and internationally. The L.A. 2050 Report cites a need to retain artists and nurture them so that they can contribute more fully to the cultural ecology.\r\nHaving a dedicated festival that at its mission supports the local arts community and brings artists together with presenters, producers and creative colleagues is absolutely fundamental to developing our city’s arts and cultural vitality. Artists need encouragement, space and critical feedback to develop confident artistic identities.  RADAR L.A. presents increased opportunities for cultural participation–for both local artists and audiences.  A strong, well-respected performing arts festival will serve Los Angeles’ artistic and cultural vitality on many levels and has a spillover effect that enhances the quality of life for our greater community.
