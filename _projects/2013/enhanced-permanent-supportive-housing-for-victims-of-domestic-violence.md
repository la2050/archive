title: Enhanced Permanent Supportive Housing for Victims of Domestic Violence
indicator: ' Housing'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  <p>In response to addressing the need for temporary shelter, supportive
  services and permanent housing assistance, Jenesse Center provides
  family-centered transitional programs to underserved and unserved victims of
  domestic violence and their children who are moving from instability and
  violence to safety and independence.  Jenesse Center’s state of the art
  services are designed to help clients become self-sufficient, as the agency
  recognizes that becoming economically empowered is an essential component for
  every client’s transition to self-sufficiency.  Jenesse’s experiences over the
  last 33 years has shown that affordable, permanent housing is a key component
  in helping our clients to break the cycle of violence in their lives once and
  for all.  Therefore, our idea is to provide long-term, supportive housing to
  victims of domestic violence by converting one of our transitional shelters
  into a permanent supportive housing facility for twelve families consisting of
  four to six individuals.  Jenesse’s main strategy under this initiative is to
  ensure that survivors of domestic violence are rapidly placed into permanent
  housing after completing our transitional program.  This strategy ensures
  maintenance and expansion of placement for homeless domestic violence
  survivors at Jenesse Center, thereby completing our housing continuum. </p>






  <p>Clients that are eligible for permanent housing through Jenesse will have
  access to a wide range of supportive services including: Independent Living
  and Life Skills Training; Legal Representation; Vocational Education Programs;
  Economic Empowerment Workshops; Children’s Enrichment Program: Individual and
  Group Counseling; Mental Health Services; Health Education and Management; and
  Community Resources and Referrals.  Services will be provided free of charge
  and will be focused on safety and sustaining independent living.</p>
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  Jenesse Center has long believed that in order to make a real and lasting
  change in how families and communities view and respond to domestic violence,
  we have to talk about it openly and honestly. Since their inception, Jenesse
  has successfully begun to change the conversation on domestic violence and
  remove a lot of the stigma unfairly associated with the issue.






  The “Conversations” events began in 1999 to bring together new and potential
  friends and supporters, in a relaxed environment to discuss new and exciting
  ways to support Jenesse. The events also provide an opportunity to discuss
  domestic violence without the stigma that is usually associated with this
  issue and remind people that victims of domestic violence should be applauded
  and supported in their efforts to stand tall, and ready, to improve their
  lives and the lives of their children.

Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  Jenesse Center has worked hard over the past 33 years to build our
  infrastructure to support this project. We currently have a working
  relationship with Los Angeles Housing Department to support our efforts
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  Jenesse has a great success in sustaining  and evaluting new programs that are
  later fully intergrated into the overall complement of core services provided
  to domestic violence clients.
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  Jenesse's own data and experience in this issue also found that affordable
  housing and insufficient resurces contributes to the chronic homeless problems
  of our clients.  After completing our program, our clients are ready to live
  on their own providing a safe, nuturing home for themselves and their
  children.  Nonetheless, being able to do so is not an easy task.  Thie high
  cost of rent and poor credit scores often make it nearly impossible for them
  to attain adequate housing.    Our data reports that , of clients who
  graduated from our transitional program, 30% had to move in with family, 37%
  moved to rental housing, 7% leave Jenesse and go to another transtional or
  homeless shelter, 6% move into Section 8 or other subsidized housing, 3% move
  to a psychiatric hospital, and 17% are unknown.  According to the United Way,
  70% of Angelenos cannot afford to purchase a home and renters spend
  disproportionately more for housing than homeowners.  With a rapid increase in
  demand and a slow increase in supply, the United Way reports that both rental
  and home prices have skyrocketed over the past few years, with the majority of
  renters in SPA 6 having to use 50% or more of their income just to pay rent.  






  Jenesse has been studying this problem for years and knows that women who exit
  our program need affordable, permanent housing. This is why Jenesse Center,
  Inc. plans to transform some of its transitional housing into affordable,
  low-income housing.



  The facilities will accommodate unserved and underserved members of SPA 6
  including those who have not previously resided in a Jenesse facility,
  including emancipated youth. Jenesse will offer tenants self-contained an
  interactive facility that contains a classroom/computer lab, recreation room,
  and in-house store. All tenants will be mandated to follow a client
  responsibility standard that will be explained to them before they move in.






  Jenesse Center, Inc. intends to assist with meeting the housing needs of the
  21st Century and to make sure that residents have the opportunity for safe,
  affordable housing that meets their ever-changing and ever-growing needs.
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  We have a hope to see every victim of domestic violence housed with
  sustainable reasources.
