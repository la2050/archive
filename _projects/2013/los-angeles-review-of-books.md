project_summary: >-
  We have already partially succeeded in bringing a sense of community to the
  cultural life of L.A. in a new way. We are training a new generation in the
  lost art of editing. We have built something the literary, artistic, &
  intellectual community is proud to be associated with, & proud to have
  represent them. We have received extravagant praise from the larger literary
  community. The New Yorker called us “an instant jewel of the internet,” Pico
  Iyer said we are “like 1000 angels descending,” Salman Rushdie claims ours was
  the best piece of criticism written about his work, & writers Jon Robin Baitz
  & Michael Tolkin call LARB “the best literary magazine in the country.” But
  more importantly the best writers in the country want to write for us, &
  continue to come to us not only from all over L.A. County, but also from New
  York, Boston, the Midwest, the West, & overseas. We have achieved the status
  of a major voice in the cultural conversation in a remarkably short time. We
  have been recognized by the publishing industry in Publisher’s Weekly, the
  business community in Forbes, & the academic community in Chronicle of Higher
  Education, & many other venues. The accolades are based on our daily
  achievements in bringing forth smart, dynamic, beautifully written, carefully
  curated, edited, & fact-checked essays, reviews and interviews and the
  conversations that develop about them on the website. Primarily, in other
  words, our site is our achievement, an ever-growing, intelligently interlinked
  conversation on literature, art, music, film, TV, politics, new media, & the
  rest of our shared culture. We have succeeded in bringing together writers
  from around the world, bringing together new writers with top professionals,
  writers from a wide variety of different cultural worlds: literary fiction,
  SF, fantasy, mystery, thriller & other genres; the commercial publishing world
  & the nonprofit & academic worlds; the big presses and the small and the
  self-published; artists, architects, sociologists, medical researchers,
  musicians, filmmakers, scientists, & TV writers; & all of these from across a
  broad array of the immigrant communities that define L.A. We cover a much
  wider range of texts, genres, media, & topics than the traditional periodicals
  in this field, reflective of the less hierarchical, less tradition-bound
  culture of Los Angeles. While the other arts have enjoyed national prominence,
  literature & criticism have lagged. We feel we have succeeded in making people
  (including the New York publishing world) understand the importance,
  diversity, and vibrancy of the literary culture of this, the largest book
  market in the world, & in making the perspective of L.A. writers we provide
  part of the necessary reading for publishing professionals around the world.
  Our pieces are reprinted by Salon, Daily Beast, & publications in Brazil,
  Germany & elsewhere. And we have managed to begin working toward
  sustainability, increasing our income significantly.

  success: >-
    There are 5 central measurements we use to assess how we are doing. (1) We
    will measure our readership. Although our most engaged readers are in L.A.,
    we now have readers in 150 countries and in all 50 states reading almost a
    half million pieces a month. We hope to double that each year for the next
    two years. Reaching those numbers would constitute success in this area. (2)
    We will measure the diversity of our contributors. We successfully attracted
    a wider range of writers & reviewers than any of the other most important
    reviews of books and culture; in the VIDA survey of women’s participation in
    book reviewing, for instance, our numbers are better, sometimes by a factor
    of two or three, than all the major outlets except the Women’s Review of
    Books. But we want to have much more robust representation of African
    American, Latino/a, Asian American, Persian, and other communities. We would
    measure our success by the rise in those numbers. (3) We will monitor our
    influence. Already we see publishers featuring our reviews on book covers
    and in advertisements, and see references to our pieces in NY Times, New
    Yorker, Slate, Salon, and many other newspapers, magazines, and websites. To
    see that increase would be a measure of our ability to impact the national
    cultural conversation, as would higher Google rankings of our pieces, and
    mentioned in other highly-ranked pieces. (4) We will gauge our success by
    the support we receive. Our success so far has been made possible by
    people’s willingness to support the project financially (as well as by their
    willingness to volunteer their time as editors, & by their willingness to
    donate their writing or write for a very nominal sum). Our success going
    forward can be measured by the willingness of people to financially support
    our project, making the other two less necessary. We have roughly doubled
    our contributions from our 1st year to our 2nd, & we would like to double
    again this year and next. We are starting a membership program, & the level
    of participation in the program will be an important measure of our success,
    as will the total dollars raised. (5) We will measure our success in terms
    of the support we can give to others. We believe strongly that writers
    should get paid for their work, & aim to help to reverse the damage done to
    writers’ livelihood by the decline of print periodicals. We will consider it
    a major success if we raise enough through gifts, grants, & auxiliary income
    to pay writers the rates that print book reviews have traditionally paid. We
    also would measure our success by whether we can expand our outreach in
    community programming & educational services. We hope to produce more in the
    way of radio programming, for instance, to bring our curriculum project to
    more schools, & to bring the intensive editing workshops we provide our
    interns to other high school, college students & recent graduates. If we are
    serving a broad range of L.A. communities we will consider ourselves a
    success.
  Organization Name: Los Angeles Review of Books
  Indicator: Arts & Cultural Vitality
  brief: >-
    We are trying to establish a major institution for cultural exchange and
    conversation, centered on an online review of arts and culture. Los
    Angeles-based and Los Angeles-focused, the Los Angeles Review of Books
    (LARB) is the communal product of many minds, including some of the best
    know and most established figures on the L.A. cultural scene, along with
    emerging L.A. writers in the fields of literature, art, music, politics, and
    cultural studies, enhanced and enlarged by the active conversation of
    readers all over the city, the county, the state, and beyond. We work hard
    to bring the worlds of publishing, academia, film and television, new media,
    art, and music together with the common reader in a fruitful, productive,
    and engaging conversation. --- In a feudal world, there is no criticism;
    only the king's taste matters. Given the cosmopolitan collection of diverse
    cultures here in Los Angeles, literature, the arts, and culture need a
    critical conversation, need to have spokespeople and champions and
    translators and critics to help cultural work find its audience, to build
    bridges among communities, and to disseminate the best that is being
    thought, written, and produced here in Los Angeles to the full range of
    local audiences and out into the larger world. --- Cultural criticism has a
    long and important history, and for the last 150 years it has taken place
    largely in a print world supported by advertising and subscription. That
    world is dying, as seen as the shuttering of book review supplements in
    almost every city in the country, and the shrinking of book and arts
    coverage elsewhere. LARB aims not just to replace these lost venues, which
    have been central to the vibrancy of American culture over the last century
    and more, but to rethink them, reinvent them using all of the new media
    tools at our disposal, making the cultural conversation more diverse, more
    interactive, and more wide-ranging, less hemmed in by traditional models. By
    merging the worlds of traditional literary publishing, academia, small
    presses, online writing, film and television, and the explosion of desktop
    production of all kinds, LARB hopes to build a big cultural tent, creating a
    space for very fragmented communities to interact and learn from each other.
    --- LARB is a daily online publication that has already, in a small way,
    begun this transformation. We are a largely volunteer organization that has
    managed to post over 1300 in-depth reviews, essays, and interviews, produced
    by a wide variety of contributors, from first-time writers to some of the
    most esteemed figures in literature, art, music, film, television, politics,
    and culture. We have already seen the impact on the morale of writers and
    readers in L.A., and we hope to increase our presence and impact, bringing
    our work to a larger audience, and a wider array of audiences, as described
    below. We also will impact the arts and culture scene through innovative
    public programming around the city, and through developing innovative
    curricula for our schools. --- In sharing culture and cultures, communities
    thrive. We are not interested in art for art's sake, or criticism for
    criticism's sake. We think that literature, art, and culture are central
    ways that a society understands itself, incubates its own progress, and
    forges its bonds across what might otherwise be divides. We hope to be a
    major partner in helping Los Angeles arts and culture continue to
    significantly enhance human development. --- We believe that all art and
    culture is both local and (at least potentially) global at the same time,
    and that a central way to ensure the continuing vitality of the L.A. arts
    and culture scene is to disseminate its work nationally and globally. We
    also believe that while the world has taken notice of L.A.'s excellence in
    classical music and art, as well as, of course film and television, it has
    been slower to recognize L.A.'s literary and critical strengths. We have
    started to have a real impact in that area and hope to do much more.
    Criticism and conversation are necessary to incubation, to nurturing, and to
    bringing literature, the arts, and culture to their largest possible
    audience, and thus to have their greatest impact, to realize their greatest
    potential.
  budget explanation: "We have an aspirational budget of $900,000/year, of which we managed to raise $125,000 our first year and $225,000 our second. Our staff is a mixture of volunteers and people on minimal consulting stipends, and although we will continue to rely on volunteers, some professional staff is necessary to insure sustainability. The budget is divided into six areas: Editorial staff: $300,000 -- Managerial, production, and technical staff: $200,000 -- Contributor payments: $250,000 -- Rent and operating expenses: $75,000 -- Development expenses: $75,000.  --- Our income includes sponsorships from universities, publishers, and other institutions, voluntary memberships at different levels; and other gifts and grants, each projected to account for roughly one-third of our total budget. The sponsorship and membership efforts have only just become, so to date, sponsorship income has accounted for 20% of income, membership 5% and gifts and grants 75% (our grantwriting is also just underway, so most of that last figure is from gifts). We are glad to provide an spreadsheet with our financial data to date and our projections for the next several years, with detailed income and expenditures.\r\n\r\nThe $100,000 grant from GOOD would be spent in the following manner: $30,000 for contributor payments, directly benefiting Los Angeles writers (this will pay for 150 to 200 reviews, essays, or interviews at $150 to $200 a piece); $15,000 to help pay for our consulting art director, directly benefiting a local artist; $35,000 to help pay editorial staff stipends, again directly benefiting Los Angeles culture workers; $20,000 for multimedia production, directly benefiting local filmmakers.  All of these workers cobble together livings from multiple sources and have an art practice of their own that these stipends help support. The Editor-in-Chief and many of the section editors and contributors who have full-time professional jobs work as volunteers and will continue to work as volunteers."

    LARB will provide, for the people of Los Angeles, a source of lifetime
    learning, global in scope and yet local in its perspective and in many of
    its concerns. Our website will be a meeting place for everyone interested in
    culture in all its various guises, an open forum for anyone to participate
    in. --- Our presence in local media, as in our current collaboration with
    KCRW and our work with KCET in development, will help more people become
    engaged with the literary, artistic, and intellectual life of the city.  Our
    public programming, like our current collaborations with The Broad Stage,
    LiveTalksLA, and LAPL’s ALOUD series, will continue to increase in breadth
    and frequency, bringing a series of newly conceived, multigenre performances
    to a variety of audiences, building on the work being done on our website.
    And, in turn, our national and global presence will help bring readers
    elsewhere an appreciation for L.A.’s contributions to culture; that is, we
    will post podcasts and video digests of these events on our website and our
    YouTube channel.  Our public programming will enhance the offerings the city
    already has, and our partnerships with the arts and culture organizations
    listed below, along with, we hope, partnerships with many more, will help
    integrate our famously fragmented city. --- We bring the most recondite and
    specialized research from our major universities, art schools, and colleges
    and make it accessible to anyone in the city. --- By placing the writers in
    the worlds of film and television, the literary writers, the popular genre
    writers, the academic writers, and the newspaper and magazine writers, we
    build bridges among tribes that have long kept their distance from one
    another, with benefits in all directions. --- Our work with high schools
    will help engage students with culture in many different ways. --- We will
    be a new and vigorous and innovative partner with all of the arts and
    culture organizations in town in the project of bringing the world to Los
    Angeles and Los Angeles to the world. We will help recruit, train, and
    retain the writers and critics required to keep Los Angeles the most
    important city for arts and culture in the country.
  collaborators: >-
    We collaborate, first and foremost, with the 100s of contributors and our
    100s of contributing editors, the majority of whom are L.A.-based. We are
    collaborating with our readers, whose comments are an increasingly important
    part of the site. We collaborate with a number of local arts and culture
    institutions, including the L.A. Public Library, KCRW, KCET, Broad Stage, UC
    Riverside, UC Irvine, USC, CalArts, UCHRI, Los Angeles Institute for the
    Humanities, LiveTalksLA, and PEN USA. We collaborate with publications,
    universities, and literary groups around the country, co-sponsoring events,
    doing cross-promotion on our sites and in social media. We have also started
    to work with LAUSD, a pilot program at Animo Pat Brown Charter H.S.

    We don't feel we are in competition with any other groups; although
    individual artists may be in competition for grants or audience, and
    although we may hope to someday be recognized as a more influential review
    of books and culture than those traditionally recognized as having the
    greatest cultural impact, these competitive moments are secondary. Art,
    literature, and culture are fundamentally communal, cooperative activities,
    and criticism even more so.  We work together with, rather than compete
    against, other literary, arts, and culture organizations, as outlined in the
    discussion of collaborators above. We think of the reviews in other outlets,
    for instance, as being not in competition with ours, but in conversation
    with them. --- In terms of our competition for this grant, we feel we are
    particularly worthy of support because what we do has a positive impact on
    virtually every other potential grantee. Publicizing their work is a central
    part of what we do. We also feel that, although we chose Arts & Cultural
    Vitality as our prime indicator, we also have impact in the fields of
    Education, Social Connectedness, and Income and Employment, and through all
    four of these, Health.  
  vision: >-
    Los Angeles would be a city with a more vibrant, a more inclusive, a more
    intelligently discussed and more widely, globally appreciated cultural
    scene. The different literary communities, from the graphic novel readers
    and writers, the electronic culture producers and consumers, to the TV,
    film, and new media writers and users, to the academic researchers in all
    fields of the humanities and sciences, across all races and ethnic groups,
    and across all of the arts, would have at their disposal a responsive,
    innovative, interactive forum, a "publication" that would bridge the
    academic and popular, the local and the global, and the traditional and the
    new. LARB will have kept on the cutting edge of any new technologies useful
    to its mission and its readers. LARB will have helped keep alive the fine
    arts of editing, proofreading, and fact-checking, and will continue training
    new generations in them. LARB will have developed multiple platforms for use
    in instruction from the early grades through graduate colleges. The best
    that is being thought and written and produced in 2050 would be finding its
    maximum audience. LARB will have established itself as among the very few
    leading forums for arts and culture in the world. And instead of losing
    ground, as predicted in the GOOD report, Los Angeles, through the vitality
    of its literature, arts, and culture, will have increased its ability to
    enhance human development, both in the city and county, and far beyond.

Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  We collaborate, first and foremost, with the 100s of contributors and our 100s

  work with LAUSD, a pilot program at Animo Pat Brown Charter H.S.
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  There are 5 central measurements we use to assess how we are doing. (1) We
  will measure our readership. Although our most engaged readers are in L.A., we
  now have readers in 150 countries and in all 50 states reading almost a half
  million pieces a month. We hope to double that each year for the next two
  years. Reaching those numbers would constitute success in this area. (2) We
  will measure the diversity of our contributors. We successfully attracted a
  wider range of writers & reviewers than any of the other most important
  reviews of books and culture; in the VIDA survey of women’s participation in
  book reviewing, for instance, our numbers are better, sometimes by a factor of
  two or three, than all the major outlets except the Women’s Review of Books.
  But we want to have much more robust representation of African American,
  Latino/a, Asian American, Persian, and other communities. We would measure our
  success by the rise in those numbers. (3) We will monitor our influence.
  Already we see publishers featuring our reviews on book covers and in
  advertisements, and see references to our pieces in NY Times, New Yorker,
  Slate, Salon, and many other newspapers, magazines, and websites. To see that
  increase would be a measure of our ability to impact the national cultural
  conversation, as would higher Google rankings of our pieces, and mentioned in
  other highlyranked pieces. (4) We will gauge our success by the support we
  receive. Our success so far has been made possible by people’s willingness to
  support the project financially (as well as by their willingness to volunteer
  their time as editors, & by their willingness to donate their writing or write
  for a very nominal sum). Our success going forward can be measured by the
  willingness of people to financially support our project, making the other two
  less necessary. We have roughly doubled our contributions from our 1st year to
  our 2nd, & we would like to double again this year and next. We are starting a
  membership program, & the level of participation in the program will be an
  important measure of our success, as will the total dollars raised. (5) We
  will measure our success in terms of the support we can give to others. We
  believe strongly that writers should get paid for their work, & aim to help to
  reverse the damage done to writers’ livelihood by the decline of print
  periodicals. We will consider it a major success if we raise enough through
  gifts, grants, & auxiliary income to pay writers the rates that print book
  reviews have traditionally paid. We also would measure our success by whether
  we can expand our outreach in community programming & educational services. We
  hope to produce more in the way of radio programming, for instance, to bring
  our curriculum project to more schools, & to bring the intensive editing
  workshops we provide our interns to other high school, college students &
  recent graduates. If we are serving a broad range of L.A. communities we will
  consider ourselves a success.
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  LARB will provide, for the people of Los Angeles, a source of lifetime
  learning, global in scope and yet local in its perspective and in many of its
  concerns. Our website will be a meeting place for everyone interested in
  culture in all its various guises, an open forum for anyone to participate
  in.  Our presence in local media, as in our current collaboration with KCRW
  and our work with KCET in development, will help more people become engaged
  with the literary, artistic, and intellectual life of the city.  Our public
  programming, like our current collaborations with The Broad Stage,
  LiveTalksLA, and LAPL’s ALOUD series, will continue to increase in breadth and
  frequency, bringing a series of newly conceived, multigenre performances to a
  variety of audiences, building on the work being done on our website. And, in
  turn, our national and global presence will help bring readers elsewhere an
  appreciation for L.A.’s contributions to culture; that is, we will post
  podcasts and video digests of these events on our website and our YouTube
  channel.  Our public programming will enhance the offerings the city already
  has, and our partnerships with the arts and culture organizations listed
  below, along with, we hope, partnerships with many more, will help integrate
  our famously fragmented city.  We bring the most recondite and specialized
  research from our major universities, art schools, and colleges and make it
  accessible to anyone in the city.  By placing the writers in the worlds of
  film and television, the literary writers, the popular genre writers, the
  academic writers, and the newspaper and magazine writers, we build bridges
  among tribes that have long kept their distance from one another, with
  benefits in all directions.  Our work with high schools will help engage
  students with culture in many different ways.  We will be a new and vigorous
  and innovative partner with all of the arts and culture organizations in town
  in the project of bringing the world to Los Angeles and Los Angeles to the
  world. We will help recruit, train, and retain the writers and critics
  required to keep Los Angeles the most important city for arts and culture in
  the country.
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  Los Angeles would be a city with a more vibrant, a more inclusive, a more
  intelligently discussed and more widely, globally appreciated cultural scene.
  The different literary communities, from the graphic novel readers and
  writers, the electronic culture producers and consumers, to the TV, film, and
  new media writers and users, to the academic researchers in all fields of the
  humanities and sciences, across all races and ethnic groups, and across all of
  the arts, would have at their disposal a responsive, innovative, interactive
  forum, a "publication" that would bridge the academic and popular, the local
  and the global, and the traditional and the new. LARB will have kept on the
  cutting edge of any new technologies useful to its mission and its readers.
  LARB will have helped keep alive the fine arts of editing, proofreading, and
  factchecking, and will continue training new generations in them. LARB will
  have developed multiple platforms for use in instruction from the early grades
  through graduate colleges. The best that is being thought and written and
  produced in 2050 would be finding its maximum audience. LARB will have
  established itself as among the very few leading forums for arts and culture
  in the world. And instead of losing ground, as predicted in the GOOD report,
  Los Angeles, through the vitality of its literature, arts, and culture, will
  have increased its ability to enhance human development, both in the city and
  county, and far beyond.
