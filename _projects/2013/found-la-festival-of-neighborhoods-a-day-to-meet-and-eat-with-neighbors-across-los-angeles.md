  Found LA: Festival of Neighborhoods A Day to Meet and Eat with Neighbors
  Across Los Angeles
indicator: ' Social Connectedness'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >+
  Found LA: Festival of Neighborhoods, October 13, 2013, is a daylong
  celebration of the people and places of Los Angeles providing FREE
  opportunities for people to explore little known parts of the city with locals
  as their guides.  Organized and implemented through the work of volunteers
  from many of the areas to be explored, the project provides rich and varied
  options for people to interact across the divides that make it difficult for
  Angelenos to develop trust.  In addition to discovering attractions in each of
  the 40 neighborhoods on offer, an essential component of each experience is
  sharing a locally prepared meal.  Food is the great connector, providing a
  visceral way to get to know previously unknown neighbors based on the sharing
  of comfort through a wellprepared meal.   Eating together is an invitation to
  socialize and build relationships as barriers to interaction lower with each
  delicious bite eaten.  Seated in a restaurant, a backyard, a community garden
  or a church banquet hall, people from very different parts of Los Angeles come
  together and recognize their connection with others and feel more a part of
  the city.



  Harvard scholar, Robert Putnam, writes on the value of “social capital,” or
  the benefits that derive from the cooperation between individuals and groups
  including a lessening of social isolation.  From “Better Together,” “The arts
  can nurture social capital by strengthening friendships, helping communities
  to understand and celebrate their heritage, and providing a safe way to
  discuss and solve difficult social problems. The arts provide a powerful way
  to transcend the cultural and demographic boundaries that divide us and to
  find deeper spiritual connections with those like us.” 



  Found LA 2013 will be the third year of the festival. In 2011, 15 tours were
  held in neighborhoods across Los Angeles, from West Hollywood to San Pedro,
  from Santa Monica to Highland Park. Tour guides ranged from LA City
  Councilmember Eric Garcetti (Atwater Village) to food blogger Namju Cho
  (Koreatown) to youth organizers from Chuco’s Justice Center (Inglewood/South
  LA). In Leimert Park, artist Karen Collins shared her African American Museum
  of Miniatures. The surprising Museum is comprised of shadow boxes created with
  found objects depicting scenes from the history of the African American
  community—from the royalty of Egypt to Martin Luther King and Mohammed Ali.
  The following year, 2012, the festival included 14 tours, and participation
  increased by 23%. Our goal for 2013 is to host 50 tours.


What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >+
  Since programming activities began in 2003, LA Commons has developed
  grassroots projects and initiatives in 10 lowincome neighborhoods: MacArthur
  Park, Koreatown, Expo Park, Chinatown, MidCity, Sylmar, East Hollywood, Palms,
  Leimert Park and Highland Park. These programs have brought together 70
  artists and 400 youth, along with 3825 community members in an innovative
  process of grass roots artistic and cultural discovery. 



  Now in our tenth year, we have grown from a small to a midsize arts
  organization with one full time executive director and four parttime staff. 
  Over the past several years, LA Commons has developed a robust neighborhood
  tour program, Trekking LA, to leverage the rich content generated in our
  community arts projects; received contracts with the MTA and Community
  Redevelopment Agency (CRALA) and funding from The California Endowment, James
  Irvine Foundation, and Annenberg Foundation; and created partnerships with
  UCLA Department of Urban Planning, City Council offices, GOOD Magazine, Sony,
  and dozens of communitybased nonprofits.  In recognition of the important role
  played by the organization, Executive Director Karen Mack has been appointed
  to two city commissions and various boards.

Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: "Evaluation will measure quantitative and qualitative outcomes via tour goer surveys distributed at tours and online post event, feedback session with tour guides and volunteers, and a database that will track numbers of participants.\n\n\nQuantitative:\n\n\n\tNumber of participating tour guides, volunteers, and neighborhoods\n\n\n\tNumber of partners\n\n\n\tNumber of tour goers\n\n\n\tMedia coverage received about event\n\n\n\tSocial media interaction related to event\n\n\nQualitative:\n\n\n\tQuality of responses from tour goers, e.g. exposure to new parts and people in the city, interest in returning to tour locations or other LA Commons events\n\n\n\tQuality of responses from tour guides and volunteers, e.g. level of interest from tour goers, authentic connections formed, level of satisfaction in planning and implementation process.\n\n\n\tTypes of media coverage, e.g. feature stories highlighting specific people and neighborhoods, interviews with tour guides and tour goers.\n\n\n"
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
  Found LA: Festival of Neighborhoods will benefit Los Angeles by offering
  Angelenos the opportunity to discover and rediscover their city through
  authentic connections with neighborhoods, their residents, and cultural
  treasures. At last year’s festival, Jamie Kim led a group on a tour of the
  Kwanumsa Buddhist Temple in Koreatown. She said, “It was a fantastic
  opportunity for the temple to open its doors to a nonKorean speaking audience.
  It's when people come together that ideas become real and understanding
  deepens. That's very magical and I see that as one of the most important
  aspect of these neighborhood tours. So many people from the temple came up to
  me to tell me how happy and proud they were of the tour!”



  Angelenos can participate as volunteers and/or as tour goers. Volunteers will
  be recruited to lead, organize and support tours. A planning committee made up
  of individuals from across the city will work together to plan and promote the
  event beginning in May 2013. Funding from LA 2050 can support an enhanced
  marketing and public relations campaign to share the event and its benefits
  with a wide audience. The campaign would allow time for building interest in
  the festival through promotional materials (videos, print materials, etc.)
  highlighting the benefits of Angelenos engaging more deeply with their city. A
  strong focus will be on the food component of the Festival. Images and
  anecdotes of dishes, restaurants, and chefs (amateur and professional) will be
  used in the promotional materials. Volunteers from each participating
  neighborhood will be engaged to create buzz among their social networks —
  online and offline. All of these levels of participation will support to the
  goal of social connectedness.


What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  Rates of volunteerism across all social strata have increased based on greater
  access to relevant opportunities to volunteers.  People report feeling more
  socially connected to each other and their city. More positive feedback on
  neighborhood offerings, hidden treasures, etc. Greater awareness of ethnic and
  social diversity of Los Angeles. People report greater interest in interacting
  and exploring parts of the city outside of their own neighborhoods. Greater
  sense of ownership and desire to contribute to the city.
