title: The Big Draw LA
project_summary: "Our idea is to build on our Big Draw LA campaign, which entails organizing a month-long series of inclusive, highly participatory public drawing experiences across Los Angeles at traditional and non-traditional venues. Through the month of October, we create and promote community drawing events at a diverse pool of venues such as museums, libraries, senior centers, restaurants, bars, parks, science centers, retail stores, or any other establishments that can help us get the public drawing! The Big Draw LA initiative, which we are presenting for the fourth year, will build community, entice non-professionals to make art, and encourage the public to value drawing as a tool for their own creative expression. When Ryman Arts first launched The Big Draw LA in 2010, it was an experiment. Based on our experience, we now see that this initiative has deepened our involvement with the larger community and broadened our own program’s students' experience, thus strengthening our core program while at the same time cultivating the well-being and quality of life for our fellow Los Angelenos. \r\n\r\nThe BDLA also includes our organization’s flagship event, “Make Your Mark in the Park” where both our students and alumni encourage and engage the public to make art. A fun-filled, creative afternoon, we celebrate the act of drawing by welcoming thousands of Angelenos to draw together on paper rolled out along the length of an iconic Los Angeles park. After, the drawing is photographed and showcased as a scrolling panorama online. Last year’s event was held at Grand Park in downtown Los Angeles where thousands captured the spirit of Grand Park and downtown Los Angeles. Students from our Ryman Arts program were on site to provide the public with art supplies and encouragement.\r\n\r\nThe Big Draw LA ensures that we can continue to educate young artists on the value of community engagement, build awareness of the value of art making, and increase opportunities for artistic participation among the greater Los Angeles public. All of these lead to an increase in public participation, and appreciation of both formal and informal arts events, and impact on Los Angeles’ role as a leader in the arts. We hope to reach as many Los Angelenos as possible at our proposed BDLA events, allowing a broader mix of the public to engage directly with making art in their specific LA communities.  Funding will allow us to try more unusual venues, work with smaller community organizations that need more support to develop their BDLA events, and develop new tools to link events with online components—ultimately, increasing access to the project. \r\n"

  description1: "Having spearheaded The Big Draw LA since inception in Los Angeles in 2010 and participated in the international Big Draw Conference in London in 2009, Ryman Arts is excited to be in its fourth year presenting The Big Draw LA with the support of a two-year grant from the James Irvine Foundation. Ryman Arts executive director Diane Brigham and our staff have a strong commitment to the philosophical underpinnings of the initiative and gained unparalleled experience in both producing large scale public drawing events in complex collaborations, and coordinating the efforts of numerous and varied groups who produce their own BDLA events. Our organization has engaged over 65 organizations in The Big Draw LA, leading to over a hundred public drawing events. Approximately 8,000 members of the community have participated in The Big Draw LA flagship events, “Make Your Mark in the Park”. The success of The Big Draw LA initiative mirrors the success of its presenter, Ryman Arts. \r\n\r\nRecently named a National Program of Excellence by the President’s Committee on the Arts & Humanities, Ryman Arts harnesses the talent and promise of Southern California youth who would otherwise not have access to advanced art education to help these teens reach their high potential. Ryman Arts believes that through the arts, youth can learn essential skills for both creative expression and life. Ryman Arts fosters students’ artistic development and personal confidence, and provides the knowledge and resources they need to pursue higher education and careers in the arts. Ryman Arts offers free intensive studio classes taught by master teaching artists, college and career planning, field trips, support services, and community engagement opportunities--all free of charge. Beginning with a single drawing class for 12 students in 1990, Ryman Arts has grown to 30 classes for 450 students annually, engaged 4,500+ Southern California teens in its core program, and provided outreach activities to 7,500+ inner city students. Classes are held on Sundays at the studios of Otis College of Art & Design in Los Angeles, and as of January 2013, we have expanded to offer classes on Saturdays at a second location on the campus of California State University, Fullerton in Orange County.\r\n\r\nAt our recent College Day, 23 universities and art schools met with students and reviewed portfolios of their work. The Spring Career program includes a panel for students and their parents, a “Packaging Yourself” workshop, and behind the scenes tours at studios including Disney and DreamWorks Animation. Since 2005, the annual Ryman Arts student exhibition and graduation has been held at the California African-American Museum. We ensure broad access to the program with specialized outreach to underserved, low-income neighborhoods, including workshops at Title 1 high schools. There were over 225 applications for the Spring 2013 semester—the highest number of applications in years.\r\n"
  success: "We will evaluate The Big Draw LA based on our objectives and expected outcomes. Our objectives are to encourage varied community organizations to organize events, and coordinate the overall presentation and marketing of at least 100 audience participatory drawing events designed especially for non-professional artists for the The Big Draw LA (BDLA) month of October; produce 1 \"flagship\" BDLA community art-making event in October reaching at least 3,000 people; support the development of engaging informal drawing activities that will involve the public actively in art-making by providing at least 40 planning events in advance that are geared to non-arts organizations and/or non-traditional arts venues; and foster the interaction of community artists with non-professional participants.\r\n\r\nWe expect outcomes such as increased participation in direct drawing experiences by at least 14,000 non-professionals from the Los Angeles area; at least 150 community groups, particularly non-arts focused groups, will have received program support to plan their own public drawing event, and will be inclined to use participatory art making experiences with their audiences to draw business; and awareness of the value of community arts engagement and active non-professional art making will increase among Los Angeles area leaders and artists.\r\n\r\nWe will also evaluate our success through: tracking the number of people who participate in individual BDLA events; tracking the number of users of our online and mobile resources; and tracking the number of community groups who register public BDLA events along with an analysis of the type of organizations presenting BDLA events.\r\n\r\nWe plan to assess qualitative factors through debriefing sessions with the advisory group, post –event facilitated discussions with event organizers, and an analysis of participating demographics.\r\n"

  description: "By using both traditional and non-traditional venues such as parks, public libraries, community centers, city streets, parking lots, theaters and train stations, we are able to reach underserved Los Angeles populations that may not seek or view art in their day-to-day activities, and engage them in the act of creation. Participating in art making and cultural activities leads to a stronger community and enhances human development at the individual level.\r\n\r\nAs before, we expect that numerous museums, schools, cultural organizations, galleries, and even retail outlets will participate this October in The Big Draw LA. By having all the events marketed jointly, participants who participate in an event in their own neighborhoods first may be enticed to visit an unfamiliar venue for another event later in the month. By further diversifying the array of presenting venues, we want to be sure there are drawing events close to residents from across the Los Angeles region. While one may not expect to see a drawing activity at a park or on a local street during daily activities (commuting through a transit station, a weekend shopping day, a race or other sports activity, a farmers market), its ease of access may encourage people to stop and participate. The benefits of unique sites can work both ways. Our organization would like the extra resources to provide all art materials, resource guides, and other public awareness materials to our Los Angeles partners—making it as easy and accessible as possible for a traditional or non-traditional venue to host a Big Draw LA event for their surrounding communities. \r\n\r\nFor many people, the notion of drawing can be intimidating. Most do not consider themselves to be artists; yet we know that drawing is something rewarding everyone can do. The informality of the highly participatory experiences, the familiarity of the venues, and the thoughtful planning of the presenters fosters a positive experience. In our previous three years of BDLA, we found that many participants simply discovered our flagship “Make Your Mark in the Park” event while walking through Exposition Park or Grand Park to get somewhere else.  These people stayed and seemed delighted to have discovered the opportunity to “get back to drawing,” and were willing to not just watch their children draw, but to draw with them, and happily took a sketchbook to “do more” as they left. By bringing activities close to home, and in many cases, integrated as an extension of other activities the family is already engaged with, it is more likely that they will choose to participate, and feel it was a fulfilling experience worth repeating. We hope that this will bring active participation in cultural and artistic activities to the many pockets of the Los Angeles area.\r\n"

    Over 65 organizations have partnered with The Big Draw LA in previous years
    ranging from LA public libraries to schools to shops. Additionally, we
    collaborate with numerous institutions (e.g. Active Arts at the Music
    Center), parks (e.g. Exposition Park and Grand Park), museums (e.g. The
    Huntington Library, The Getty, Craft and Folk Art Museum) and additional
    non-traditional facilities to expand the program’s reach to the widest
    geographic and broadest demographic possible. Over the past two years we
    have formed an informal advisory group made up of individuals who have
    demonstrated particular expertise and leadership in conceptualizing Big Draw
    LA activities. It is through these collaborations that we’ve been able to
    expand our reach.

    For The Big Draw LA, we define our competition as other cultural
    organizations that are promoting active public arts participation (such as
    Active Arts at the Music Center), institutions that offer informal learning
    experiences (such as museums and libraries), and even social entertainment
    venues like restaurants and youth recreation centers.  Because The Big Draw
    LA is so inclusive, our relationship model is to work collaboratively to
    create exciting public arts participation experiences for all. For example,
    we worked closely with Active Arts at the Music Center and Grand Park to
    produce Make Your Mark in the Park in 2012.
  vision: >-
    The Big Draw LA encourages participants to rediscover the power of drawing
    as both a tool and as a way of seeing the world.  In 2050, the phrase “I
    can’t draw” would be removed from our collective rhetoric.  Drawing, like
    speaking, writing and mathematics, would be a ubiquitous language of
    communication among all people.  Drawing would be a basis for social
    interactions and understanding.  Just as penmanship is secondary to the idea
    conveyed through language, one’s skill in drawing would be secondary to the
    concept being explored or exchanged with others.  Tablet technologies, with
    their numerous drawing and collaborative whiteboard applications, are
    currently blurring the line between artist and non-artist and expanding the
    definition of drawing into a form of communication.   Additionally the
    global connectivity of the internet allows us to share or even collaborate
    on drawings with people who speak different languages. With the Big Draw LA
    initiative, we hope that the year 2050 will be one of open, accessible, and
    welcomed participation in artistic and cultural activities without any
    feelings of unfamiliarity or intimidation for members of the Los Angeles
    community. This will also link directly with active engagement at our city’s
    many artistic and cultural offerings at both traditional venues (e.g.
    museums) and non-traditional venues (e.g. your local café or Laundromat).
    Overall, we will uphold the positive economic impact of these activities
    within our greater Los Angeles.

  advisory group made up of individuals who have demonstrated particular
  expertise and leadership in conceptualizing Big Draw LA activities. It is
  through these collaborations that we’ve been able to expand our reach.
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >+
  We will evaluate The Big Draw LA based on our objectives and expected
  outcomes. Our objectives are to encourage varied community organizations to
  organize events, and coordinate the overall presentation and marketing of at
  least 100 audience participatory drawing events designed especially for
  nonprofessional artists for the The Big Draw LA (BDLA) month of October;
  produce 1 "flagship" BDLA community artmaking event in October reaching at
  least 3,000 people; support the development of engaging informal drawing
  activities that will involve the public actively in artmaking by providing at
  least 40 planning events in advance that are geared to nonarts organizations
  and/or nontraditional arts venues; and foster the interaction of community
  artists with nonprofessional participants.






  We expect outcomes such as increased participation in direct drawing
  experiences by at least 14,000 nonprofessionals from the Los Angeles area; at
  least 150 community groups, particularly nonarts focused groups, will have
  received program support to plan their own public drawing event, and will be
  inclined to use participatory art making experiences with their audiences to
  draw business; and awareness of the value of community arts engagement and
  active nonprofessional art making will increase among Los Angeles area leaders
  and artists.






  We will also evaluate our success through: tracking the number of people who
  participate in individual BDLA events; tracking the number of users of our
  online and mobile resources; and tracking the number of community groups who
  register public BDLA events along with an analysis of the type of
  organizations presenting BDLA events.






  We plan to assess qualitative factors through debriefing sessions with the
  advisory group, post —event facilitated discussions with event organizers, and
  an analysis of participating demographics.


How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
  By using both traditional and nontraditional venues such as parks, public
  libraries, community centers, city streets, parking lots, theaters and train
  stations, we are able to reach underserved Los Angeles populations that may
  not seek or view art in their daytoday activities, and engage them in the act
  of creation. Participating in art making and cultural activities leads to a
  stronger community and enhances human development at the individual level.






  As before, we expect that numerous museums, schools, cultural organizations,
  galleries, and even retail outlets will participate this October in The Big
  Draw LA. By having all the events marketed jointly, participants who
  participate in an event in their own neighborhoods first may be enticed to
  visit an unfamiliar venue for another event later in the month. By further
  diversifying the array of presenting venues, we want to be sure there are

  shopping day, a race or other sports activity, a farmers market), its ease of
  access may encourage people to stop and participate. The benefits of unique
  sites can work both ways. Our organization would like the extra resources to
  provide all art materials, resource guides, and other public awareness
  materials to our Los Angeles partners—making it as easy and accessible as
  possible for a traditional or nontraditional venue to host a Big Draw LA event
  for their surrounding communities. 






  For many people, the notion of drawing can be intimidating. Most do not

  engaged with, it is more likely that they will choose to participate, and feel
  it was a fulfilling experience worth repeating. We hope that this will bring
  active participation in cultural and artistic activities to the many pockets
  of the Los Angeles area.
