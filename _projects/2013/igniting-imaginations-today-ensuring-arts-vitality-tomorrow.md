title: Igniting Imaginations Today Ensuring Arts Vitality Tomorrow
project_summary: "<p>Levitt Pavilions envisions a LA 2050 in which the community as a whole—parents, children, young adults, seniors—comes together in welcoming outdoor settings to experience the joy of arts experiences open to all. We believe that access to high quality arts experiences shouldn’t be reserved for those who can afford to buy tickets—but should be made available to everyone. We have already made tremendous strides to achieve our vision—each summer over 100,000 Angelenos of all ages and backgrounds enjoy 100+ free concerts at Levitt Los Angeles in MacArthur Park (www.levittla.org) and Levitt Pasadena in Memorial Park (www.levittpavilionpasadena.org), adding vitality to public spaces that were once neglected and nurturing an appreciation for the arts in this great city we call home. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, in the wake of drastic funding cuts to arts education in Los Angeles-area public schools, Levitt believes we could – and must – do more. Tens of thousands of youth are missing out on opportunities to engage more deeply with the arts—compromising an invaluable part of their overall growth as individuals and members of society. Levitt Pavilions proposes to help fill this void by greatly enhancing Levitt L.A. and Levitt Pasadena’s popular free children’s series. Through the introduction of a hands-on arts learning experience before each children’s show, consisting of free, interactive workshops taught by highly skilled teaching artists in a welcoming and supportive environment, children will gain a deeper appreciation of that day’s performance inspiring their overall interest in the arts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both Levitt L.A. and Levitt Pasadena have had amazing success with the children’s series presented as part of the overall Levitt concert seasons, reaching 20,000 children every summer. The beauty of Levitt’s children’s series is that it encourages active participation. Because each Levitt performance venue is located in a welcoming, outdoor setting featuring a grassy lawn, children run freely, dance and express themselves. Every Levitt concert is a reason to celebrate community and to appreciate the rich culture of music that thrives within greater Los Angeles. Our mission of “community through music” is most often on display at Levitt L.A. and Levitt Pasadena’s children’s concerts. It’s heartwarming to witness the sheer joy of children as they run up to the stage to be closer to Levitt artists. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The My LA 2050 grant will give Levitt Pavilions the opportunity to extend and deepen children’s Levitt experiences through weekly pre-concert workshops from late June through August 2013—on Wednesday nights in Pasadena and Sunday afternoons in MacArthur Park. These hour-long workshops will offer a fun and hands-on way for children to learn about music and opportunities for self-expression.  Teaching artists will present interactive programs that are in sync with the program being presented on the stage that day.  We envision that the 20 children’s concerts (10 concerts at each venue) will represent moments in a child’s life when they begin to foster a sense of appreciation for music and experience the joy of creating and experiencing music in a communal setting. Through making an instrument, trying out cultural dances, creating murals, learning a new song and singing along with others, this supplemental interactive experience will add a rich new dimension to children’s lives. Based upon the attendance at the children’s programs in previous years, we anticipate that approximately 20,000 Los Angeles children will benefit from this program in 2013. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our project best fits in the Arts and Cultural Vitality indicator, yet we also heavily impact the area of Social Connectedness and even Environmental Quality. Each Levitt venue is located in a city park, enlivening the communities the Levitt program serves by transforming neglected outdoor spaces into cherished destinations. We recognize that live music has always been a social connector, and that free, live music in welcoming, outdoor settings possesses the unique power to break social and economic barriers. By providing hands-on arts experiences for children and their families, Levitt will foster an appreciation for the arts and demonstrate the value of the arts as an integral component of vibrant cities. These experiences will inspire future generations to ensure the arts remain a vital part of Los Angeles. </p>"

  success: "<p>We will evaluate the success of the children’s series and pre-concert arts workshops in the following key ways. First, we will measure the number of participants attending each of the 20 children’s concerts and the number of children attending the pre-concert workshops. Based upon past seasons of children’s programming, we anticipate that over the course of the summer, this program will serve over 20,000 children and an additional 10,000 adults. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, following each children’s workshop, Levitt professional staff and teaching artists will debrief and determine how to enhance participation, refine logistics and evaluate responses to specific outreach efforts. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, to measure success in participation, we will collect qualitative data from a random sample of the participants.

  budget explanation: "<p>Artist Fees, $40,000, Average of $2,000 per show X 20\r\nMarketing and Promotion, $10,000, Average of $500 per show X 20\r\nTeaching Artists, $10,000, $500 per show X 20\r\nSupplies and Materials, $20,000,$1,000 per show X 20\r\nAdministrative Oversight, $20,000\t\r\nTotal, $100,000</p>\r\n<p>Artist Fees–Artists chosen for this program represent a wide variety of performers, ranging from acclaimed, emerging talent to seasoned, award-winning artists. Examples of artists who will appear on local Levitt stages this summer include Oscar Award-winning puppeteer Bob Baker and his marionettes, the Emmy nominated theatre performers of Pushcart Players, the puppet shows and kiddie rock concerts of Kiddle Karoo, and the clowns and comedians of Funky Punks. Levitt Pavilions will pay the fee for the artists presented as part of the children’s programs as a budget expense of this grant.</p>\r\n<p>Marketing and Promotion–The Levitt children’s programs are established and well attended. Marketing of the program will clearly state that the experiential workshops are a new element. We will create promotional materials in Spanish and English to ensure we reach the diverse L.A. population. Street teams will distribute flyers and brochures to encourage a broad range of participation. We will make efforts to get the information about the program into local community centers and schools (we traditionally beginning as early as May). The program will be publicized on local Levitt website and on the Levitt Pavilions’ national website. Through Levitt’s radio advertisements on KPCC and KCRW, we will promote the program to a wide audience.</p>\r\n<p>Teaching Artists–Artists with a focus that aligns with each scheduled performance will create interactive activities for the children present.  The teaching artists will lead the activities they develop specifically for the day, prior to the scheduled performance. The activities may involve creating something that the child will keep, such as an instrument shaker or a puppet, or may involve a “lesson” on an instrument provided to the children.</p>\r\n<p>Supplies & Materials–Based upon attendance counts from previous children’s concerts, supplies will be purchased for approximately 1,000 children per concert. Anticipating the program is likely to be quite successful, we will purchase materials & supplies for 20,000 participants to use in creating their arts experience. This may include purchasing instruments to distribute, such as recorders, flutaphones or portable drums, or purchasing materials to an art project. All of the materials will have the ability to be branded with the Levitt logos to remind the children about their positive arts experience, something that will instill a sense of pride & will be cherished for years to come.</p>\r\n<p>Administrative Oversight & Coordination–Staff at Levitt Pavilions will work closely with the professional staff at each Levitt venue to ensure that the program is well run & meets the program objectives.</p>"

Thought leaders in education and government officials agree.\r\n\r\nToday’s educators, politicians and business leaders spend a great deal of time and resources discussing the pressing need for a trained future workforce in the fields of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) in order for the country to remain competitive in tomorrow’s economy. However, many astute leaders know that a letter is missing in this equation, the letter A (Art and Design), to spell STEAM. The arts are the lynchpin to success in building the workforce of 2050 simply because through the arts, students learn creative problem solving, effective communication, innovative thinking and the ability to navigate complex situations. They become better citizens and professionals across all fields and industries, as well as more thoughtful contributors to society, because they are able to more effectively express themselves and think creatively. As the former Chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, Rocco Landesman said at the Arts Education Partnership National Forum in April 2010, “The arts provide us with new ways of thinking, new ways to draw connections…and they help maintain our competitive edge by engendering innovation and creativity.” United States Education Secretary Arne Duncan also added, “The arts can no longer be treated as a frill… arts education is essential to stimulating the creativity and innovation that will prove critical to young Americans competing in a global economy.” \r\n\r\nIn the midst of arts funding cuts in public schools, the Levitt program offers a meaningful solution.  All Levitt programming is free of charge and family friendly. We create value across the board because our Los Angeles and Pasadena venues are accessible, conveniently located near public transit, and available to all who wish to participate. By offering first-hand involvement in the arts, Levitt’s program will help build the Los Angeles leaders of tomorrow by providing rich arts learning experiences, and in turn helping to build a better Los Angeles for the next generation.\r\n\r\nWhile the Levitt program is nationwide, two of our six pavilions are located in Los Angeles County – Pasadena (Memorial Park) and Los Angeles (MacArthur Park). A total of 100+ concerts are presented from mid-June to the end of August each year in the greater Los Angeles area – free of charge. The wildly popular children’s programs reach tens of thousands each season, and many families attend these concerts on a regular and often weekly basis. By adding an educational and interactive component to the children’s programming, we will have the ability to engage more youth in Levitt’s work and have them leave the concerts with not only a memory of the interactive activities and concert but also possess an increased appreciation for the arts."

  description1: "<p>Levitt Pavilions has developed an innovative program model, leveraging public/private partnerships in cities across the country to transform neglected public spaces into welcoming destinations through the power of free, live music. While all performances are free, all Levitt artists are paid a competitive fee to perform, ensuring excellence. Levitt venues serve as catalysts for change in a community by reclaiming green spaces, activating underused public spaces, & breaking social & economic barriers that often preclude access to the arts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are now six state-of-the-art Levitt pavilions in places as diverse as Los Angeles & Pasadena; Memphis, Tenn.; Arlington, Texas; Westport, Conn.; & Bethlehem, Pa. Each Levitt Pavilion is a community destination.  Levitt’s open lawn settings encourage people to mingle, strengthening social connections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it wasn’t always this way. Consider what Levitt locations used to be:\r\nthe nation’s largest brownfield; a problematic landfill; crime-ridden & abandoned parks; & a dormant downtown with little economic activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, the Levitt network serves more than half a million people each year through 300+ free concerts nationwide. Pavilions are currently in development in Denver, Sioux Falls & Houston, & we are in conversations with nearly a dozen other cities across the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The L.A. region is home to two Levitt venues. Levitt Pasadena opened in 2003, reviving an abandoned, WPA-era band shell in the once troubled Memorial Park. The national Levitt organization approached city officials with the idea to renovate the pavilion & create an annual series of free performances featuring acclaimed, emerging talent to seasoned, award-winning artists, using the arts as a vehicle to transform the park. Ten years later, Levitt Pasadena is now a treasured community asset & the park is an active & thriving magnet for families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2007, Levitt L.A. opened in MacArthur Park, transforming this once crime-ridden park into a welcoming destination.  The band shell’s renovation served as the catalyst for the overall park’s renewal. Levitt L.A. is the only organization that provides consistent free performing arts programming each year in the Westlake District, one of L.A.’s most densely populated & underserved communities. With 40 percent of the Westlake community living at or below the poverty level, Levitt L.A.’s children’s series gives thousands of underprivileged youth access to exceptional arts programming that would otherwise be cost prohibitive to attend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both Levitt venues in Southern California have a proven track record of success, & every year audiences increase.  In 2012, both Levitt L.A. & Levitt Pasadena were voted “Best Free Summer Concert Series” by LA Weekly, & Levitt Pasadena was voted “Best Live Music Venue” by Pasadena Weekly. The pavilions are both centrally located & accessible by car, bus, Metro & are in walking distance of neighborhoods.</p>"
  description3: "<p>Levitt Pavilions is in a unique position in that we are the only organization to offer 100+ free concerts to the citizens of Los Angeles each year.  While there are other organizations that present open-air performances as part of a summer series—such as the Hollywood Bowl, the Greek Theatre, and the John Anson Ford Amphitheater, what makes the Levitt program special is that our concerts and programs are always presented free of charge. Grand Performances may be considered our closest competitor, but what differentiates us from Grand Performances is our children’s programming. Levitt presents the largest free outdoor concert series in Los Angeles, with a regular and consistent (twice a week during the summer) children’s component.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Levitt Pavilions has good working relationships with our sister presenting organizations, primarily in the area of scheduling and booking. We are active members of California Presenters, which works to foster collaboration between presenting venues across the state and shares best practices in all areas pertinent to successful presenting. Our success and the success of our “competitors” only help to build the awareness of and appreciation for the performing arts in Los Angeles. </p>"
  vision: >-
    For us, success in 2050 would be a Los Angeles with adults (the children of
    today) and their children participating in, attending, and creating art as
    an integral part of their everyday lives.  Our hope is that through our
    efforts today, the next generation will appreciate the value of public
    spaces activated through shared arts experiences.  The seeds planted today
    will be seen in future investments in the arts and the arts will be
    accessible to all, creating a more cohesive society. In 2050, all Angelenos
    will have ample opportunities to participate in high quality performing arts
    experiences. The citizens of Greater Los Angeles will be inspired by and
    appreciate how music and arts participation makes us all better people; more
    tolerant, innovative and engaged. This appreciation and understanding will
    translate into the arts playing a prominent role in our city’s vitality.

  <p>Levitt Pavilions envisions a LA 2050 in which the community as a
  whole—parents, children, young adults, seniors—comes together in welcoming
  outdoor settings to experience the joy of arts experiences open to all. We
  believe that access to high quality arts experiences shouldn’t be reserved for
  those who can afford to buy tickets—but should be made available to everyone.
  We have already made tremendous strides to achieve our vision—each summer over
  100,000 Angelenos of all ages and backgrounds enjoy 100+ free concerts at
  Levitt Los Angeles in MacArthur Park (www.levittla.org) and Levitt Pasadena in
  Memorial Park (www.levittpavilionpasadena.org), adding vitality to public
  spaces that were once neglected and nurturing an appreciation for the arts in
  this great city we call home. </p>






  <p>However, in the wake of drastic funding cuts to arts education in Los
  Angelesarea public schools, Levitt believes we could — and must — do more.
  Tens of thousands of youth are missing out on opportunities to engage more
  deeply with the arts—compromising an invaluable part of their overall growth
  as individuals and members of society. Levitt Pavilions proposes to help fill
  this void by greatly enhancing Levitt L.A. and Levitt Pasadena’s popular free
  children’s series. Through the introduction of a handson arts learning
  experience before each children’s show, consisting of free, interactive
  workshops taught by highly skilled teaching artists in a welcoming and
  supportive environment, children will gain a deeper appreciation of that day’s
  performance inspiring their overall interest in the arts.</p>






  <p>Both Levitt L.A. and Levitt Pasadena have had amazing success with the
  children’s series presented as part of the overall Levitt concert seasons,
  reaching 20,000 children every summer. The beauty of Levitt’s children’s
  series is that it encourages active participation. Because each Levitt
  performance venue is located in a welcoming, outdoor setting featuring a
  grassy lawn, children run freely, dance and express themselves. Every Levitt
  concert is a reason to celebrate community and to appreciate the rich culture
  of music that thrives within greater Los Angeles. Our mission of “community
  through music” is most often on display at Levitt L.A. and Levitt Pasadena’s
  children’s concerts. It’s heartwarming to witness the sheer joy of children as
  they run up to the stage to be closer to Levitt artists. </p>






  <p>The My LA 2050 grant will give Levitt Pavilions the opportunity to extend
  and deepen children’s Levitt experiences through weekly preconcert workshops
  from late June through August 2013—on Wednesday nights in Pasadena and Sunday
  afternoons in MacArthur Park. These hourlong workshops will offer a fun and
  handson way for children to learn about music and opportunities for
  selfexpression.  Teaching artists will present interactive programs that are
  in sync with the program being presented on the stage that day.  We envision
  that the 20 children’s concerts (10 concerts at each venue) will represent
  moments in a child’s life when they begin to foster a sense of appreciation
  for music and experience the joy of creating and experiencing music in a
  communal setting. Through making an instrument, trying out cultural dances,
  creating murals, learning a new song and singing along with others, this
  supplemental interactive experience will add a rich new dimension to
  children’s lives. Based upon the attendance at the children’s programs in
  previous years, we anticipate that approximately 20,000 Los Angeles children
  will benefit from this program in 2013. </p>






  <p>Our project best fits in the Arts and Cultural Vitality indicator, yet we
  also heavily impact the area of Social Connectedness and even Environmental
  Quality. Each Levitt venue is located in a city park, enlivening the
  communities the Levitt program serves by transforming neglected outdoor spaces
  into cherished destinations. We recognize that live music has always been a
  social connector, and that free, live music in welcoming, outdoor settings
  possesses the unique power to break social and economic barriers. By providing
  handson arts experiences for children and their families, Levitt will foster
  an appreciation for the arts and demonstrate the value of the arts as an
  integral component of vibrant cities. These experiences will inspire future
  generations to ensure the arts remain a vital part of Los Angeles. </p>
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  <p>Levitt Pavilions has developed an innovative program model, leveraging
  public/private partnerships in cities across the country to transform
  neglected public spaces into welcoming destinations through the power of free,
  live music. While all performances are free, all Levitt artists are paid a
  competitive fee to perform, ensuring excellence. Levitt venues serve as

  underused public spaces, & breaking social & economic barriers that often
  preclude access to the arts.</p>






  <p>There are now six stateoftheart Levitt pavilions in places as diverse as
  Los Angeles & Pasadena; Memphis, Tenn.; Arlington, Texas; Westport, Conn.; &
  Bethlehem, Pa. Each Levitt Pavilion is a community destination.  Levitt’s open
  lawn settings encourage people to mingle, strengthening social
  connections.</p>






  <p>But it wasn’t always this way. Consider what Levitt locations used to be:



  the nation’s largest brownfield; a problematic landfill; crimeridden &
  abandoned parks; & a dormant downtown with little economic activity.</p>






  <p>Today, the Levitt network serves more than half a million people each year
  through 300+ free concerts nationwide. Pavilions are currently in development
  in Denver, Sioux Falls & Houston, & we are in conversations with nearly a
  dozen other cities across the country.</p>






  <p>The L.A. region is home to two Levitt venues. Levitt Pasadena opened in
  2003, reviving an abandoned, WPAera band shell in the once troubled Memorial
  Park. The national Levitt organization approached city officials with the idea
  to renovate the pavilion & create an annual series of free performances
  featuring acclaimed, emerging talent to seasoned, awardwinning artists, using
  the arts as a vehicle to transform the park. Ten years later, Levitt Pasadena
  is now a treasured community asset & the park is an active & thriving magnet
  for families.</p>






  <p>In 2007, Levitt L.A. opened in MacArthur Park, transforming this once
  crimeridden park into a welcoming destination.  The band shell’s renovation
  served as the catalyst for the overall park’s renewal. Levitt L.A. is the only
  organization that provides consistent free performing arts programming each
  year in the Westlake District, one of L.A.’s most densely populated &
  underserved communities. With 40 percent of the Westlake community living at
  or below the poverty level, Levitt L.A.’s children’s series gives thousands of
  underprivileged youth access to exceptional arts programming that would
  otherwise be cost prohibitive to attend.</p>






  <p>Both Levitt venues in Southern California have a proven track record of
  success, & every year audiences increase.  In 2012, both Levitt L.A. & Levitt
  Pasadena were voted “Best Free Summer Concert Series” by LA Weekly, & Levitt
  Pasadena was voted “Best Live Music Venue” by Pasadena Weekly. The pavilions
  are both centrally located & accessible by car, bus, Metro & are in walking
  distance of neighborhoods.</p>

Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  <p>We will evaluate the success of the children’s series and preconcert arts
  workshops in the following key ways. First, we will measure the number of
  participants attending each of the 20 children’s concerts and the number of
  children attending the preconcert workshops. Based upon past seasons of
  children’s programming, we anticipate that over the course of the summer, this
  program will serve over 20,000 children and an additional 10,000 adults. </p>






  <p>Next, following each children’s workshop, Levitt professional staff and
  teaching artists will debrief and determine how to enhance participation,
  refine logistics and evaluate responses to specific outreach efforts. </p>






  <p>Finally, to measure success in participation, we will collect qualitative
  data from a random sample of the participants.  The pavilions routinely
  collect audience surveys in both English and Spanish and this summer’s surveys
  will include questions about the new interactive programming for children and
  families in order to receive immediate reactions to the project and measure
  its success. The surveys will be tallied and the results will be incorporated

  We believe the arts are essential to creative thinking and participation in
  the arts plays an important role in the development of our children.  Thought
  leaders in education and government officials agree.






  Today’s educators, politicians and business leaders spend a great deal of time
  and resources discussing the pressing need for a trained future workforce in
  the fields of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) in order
  for the country to remain competitive in tomorrow’s economy. However, many
  astute leaders know that a letter is missing in this equation, the letter A
  (Art and Design), to spell STEAM. The arts are the lynchpin to success in
  building the workforce of 2050 simply because through the arts, students learn
  creative problem solving, effective communication, innovative thinking and the
  ability to navigate complex situations. They become better citizens and

  Duncan also added, “The arts can no longer be treated as a frill… arts
  education is essential to stimulating the creativity and innovation that will

  In the midst of arts funding cuts in public schools, the Levitt program offers
  a meaningful solution.  All Levitt programming is free of charge and family

  the arts, Levitt’s program will help build the Los Angeles leaders of tomorrow

  Park). A total of 100+ concerts are presented from midJune to the end of
  August each year in the greater Los Angeles area — free of charge. The wildly
  popular children’s programs reach tens of thousands each season, and many
  families attend these concerts on a regular and often weekly basis. By adding
  an educational and interactive component to the children’s programming, we
  will have the ability to engage more youth in Levitt’s work and have them
  leave the concerts with not only a memory of the interactive activities and
  concert but also possess an increased appreciation for the arts.
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  For us, success in 2050 would be a Los Angeles with adults (the children of
  today) and their children participating in, attending, and creating art as an
  integral part of their everyday lives.  Our hope is that through our efforts
  today, the next generation will appreciate the value of public spaces
  activated through shared arts experiences.  The seeds planted today will be
  seen in future investments in the arts and the arts will be accessible to all,
  creating a more cohesive society. In 2050, all Angelenos will have ample
  opportunities to participate in high quality performing arts experiences. The
  citizens of Greater Los Angeles will be inspired by and appreciate how music
  and arts participation makes us all better people; more tolerant, innovative
  and engaged. This appreciation and understanding will translate into the arts
  playing a prominent role in our city’s vitality.

project_summary_backup: "<p>Levitt Pavilions has developed an innovative program model, leveraging public/private partnerships in cities across the country to transform neglected public spaces into welcoming destinations through the power of free, live music. While all performances are free, all Levitt artists are paid a competitive fee to perform, ensuring excellence. Levitt venues serve as catalysts for change in a community by reclaiming green spaces, activating underused public spaces, & breaking social & economic barriers that often preclude access to the arts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are now six state-of-the-art Levitt pavilions in places as diverse as Los Angeles & Pasadena; Memphis, Tenn.; Arlington, Texas; Westport, Conn.; & Bethlehem, Pa. Each Levitt Pavilion is a community destination.  Levitt’s open lawn settings encourage people to mingle, strengthening social connections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it wasn’t always this way. Consider what Levitt locations used to be:\r\nthe nation’s largest brownfield; a problematic landfill; crime-ridden & abandoned parks; & a dormant downtown with little economic activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, the Levitt network serves more than half a million people each year through 300+ free concerts nationwide. Pavilions are currently in development in Denver, Sioux Falls & Houston, & we are in conversations with nearly a dozen other cities across the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The L.A. region is home to two Levitt venues. Levitt Pasadena opened in 2003, reviving an abandoned, WPA-era band shell in the once troubled Memorial Park. The national Levitt organization approached city officials with the idea to renovate the pavilion & create an annual series of free performances featuring acclaimed, emerging talent to seasoned, award-winning artists, using the arts as a vehicle to transform the park. Ten years later, Levitt Pasadena is now a treasured community asset & the park is an active & thriving magnet for families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2007, Levitt L.A. opened in MacArthur Park, transforming this once crime-ridden park into a welcoming destination.  The band shell’s renovation served as the catalyst for the overall park’s renewal. Levitt L.A. is the only organization that provides consistent free performing arts programming each year in the Westlake District, one of L.A.’s most densely populated & underserved communities. With 40 percent of the Westlake community living at or below the poverty level, Levitt L.A.’s children’s series gives thousands of underprivileged youth access to exceptional arts programming that would otherwise be cost prohibitive to attend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both Levitt venues in Southern California have a proven track record of success, & every year audiences increase.  In 2012, both Levitt L.A. & Levitt Pasadena were voted “Best Free Summer Concert Series” by LA Weekly, & Levitt Pasadena was voted “Best Live Music Venue” by Pasadena Weekly. The pavilions are both centrally located & accessible by car, bus, Metro & are in walking distance of neighborhoods.</p>"
