title: Listening Communication and Conflict Resolution Skills for Los Angeles
indicator: ' Social Connectedness'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  This idea will provide those who wish to learn listening, communication and
  conflict resolution skills the opportunity to do so at multiple locations
  throughout Los Angeles.  Social connections are impacted by how we interact
  with one another.  When conflict occurs, there are opportunities to listen and
  communicate in a way that increases the possibility of resolving disputes, and
  building social connections.  Too few opportunities are available to members
  of the public to learn and apply listening, communication and conflict
  resolution skills.  This will help move Los Angeles toward more effectively
  addressing the inevitable conflict that we encounter in the most constructive
  ways possible.  
What are some of your organizationâ€™s most important achievements to date?: >-
  More than 2,000 members of the public were trained by Avis RidleyThomas in the
  years that I oversaw the Los Angeles City Attorney's Dispute Resolution
  Program of the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney.  Emeritus UCLA
  Professor Buzz Wilms initiated a class at UCLA in 2001, and hundreds of
  undergraduates have been trained as a result of that class.
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  There is a vibrant dispute resolution and dialogue and deliberation community
  in Los Angeles.  All of these collaborators will be made aware and invited to
  participate in this initiative, if it is selected for funding.
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  We will train and work with hundreds of people who want to find better ways of
  communicating and resolving conflict.  They will obtain a better understanding
  of community resources to assist them, and learn to intervene effectively to
  help resolve disputes wherever they occur.
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  It will help advance the mission of "a mediator on every block," allowing
  neighbors, coworkers and family members to better interact and create more
  profound social connections.
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  Listening, communication and mediation skills would be standard curriculum in
  schools, and standard operating procedure at homes and in workplaces
  throughout Los Angeles.  Any persons involved in miscommunication,
  misunderstanding or conflict would get multiple opportunities to resolve the
  matter quickly and constructively.  A culture change would occur in our city,
  resulting in significantly fewer matters which result in violent behavior.
