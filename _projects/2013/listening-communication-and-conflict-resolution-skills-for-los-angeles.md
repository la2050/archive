title: Listening Communication and Conflict Resolution Skills for Los Angeles
project_summary: >-
  This idea will provide those who wish to learn listening, communication and
  conflict resolution skills the opportunity to do so at multiple locations
  throughout Los Angeles.  Social connections are impacted by how we interact
  with one another.  When conflict occurs, there are opportunities to listen and
  communicate in a way that increases the possibility of resolving disputes, and
  building social connections.  Too few opportunities are available to members
  of the public to learn and apply listening, communication and conflict
  resolution skills.  This will help move Los Angeles toward more effectively
  addressing the inevitable conflict that we encounter in the most constructive
  ways possible.

    More than 2,000 members of the public were trained by Avis Ridley-Thomas in
    the years that I oversaw the Los Angeles City Attorney's Dispute Resolution
    Program of the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney.  Emeritus UCLA
    Professor Buzz Wilms initiated a class at UCLA in 2001, and hundreds of
    undergraduates have been trained as a result of that class.
  success: >-
    We will train and work with hundreds of people who want to find better ways
    of communicating and resolving conflict.  They will obtain a better
    understanding of community resources to assist them, and learn to intervene
    effectively to help resolve disputes wherever they occur.

  Organization Name: Institute for Nonviolence in Los Angeles
  description3: >-
    The Institute for Nonviolence in Los Angeles currently works with any and
    all groups who are working for nonviolence and dispute resolution.  We are
    collaborators.
  vision: >-
    Listening, communication and mediation skills would be standard curriculum
    in schools, and standard operating procedure at homes and in workplaces
    throughout Los Angeles.  Any persons involved in miscommunication,
    misunderstanding or conflict would get multiple opportunities to resolve the
    matter quickly and constructively.  A culture change would occur in our
    city, resulting in significantly fewer matters which result in violent
    behavior.
