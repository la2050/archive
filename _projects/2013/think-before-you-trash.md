title: Think Before You Trash
indicator: ' Environmental Quality'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  Grain of Sand  Granito de Arena (in Spanish) is a nonprofit organization run
  by Ernesto Renella, (local business leader, surfer and community volunteer) to
  teach environmental awareness and stewardship to underprivileged children in
  local communities. The mission is to build a healthier environment and educate
  children to create a better world. The program teaches children that their
  daily decisions affect the beaches and marine environment around the world and
  shows them how to connect to nature through environmental awareness and
  surfing.






  “Being in the ocean is a much more personal experience than just looking at it
  from the beach or highway. Surfing is about being physically and mentally
  moved by the power of the ocean. By experiencing its energy   directly
  affecting its own element and environment. Once these kids stand up the first
  time and ride a wave in, they never look at the water the same way again. The
  ocean transforms into something that they need to respect, maintain and
  protect so that future generations can enjoy it as much as they do. The way I
  see it, each person represents a grain of sand, standing alone one might seem
  small and insignificant, but working together with our neighbors we are
  powerful and can create a better future for everyone.”
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  Teach surfing camps — surfing competitions



  Organize Beach Clean ups



  Be recognized by the community and other non profits as a local pro
  environmental organization



  Spearhead educational programs outside the classroom. 



  Bring awareness to nature and environmental issues.

Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  It may be difficult to “measure” the success of my endeavor, because it is
  hard to evaluate the lasting impact that experience, education, awareness has
  on children. One thing I know for certain is that bringing a child, who has
  never been to the beach, to experience the sand and the ocean is something
  that is life changing. This action alone has a lasting and unmeasurable
  impact. Every child who comes through the program learns not just about how to
  take care of the beach and the oceans, but also how small daily efforts can
  impact the environment in a large and positive way. Armed with such knowledge,
  the students in turn learn about the responsibility of teaching others how to
  respect and take care of nature too. And lastly, when children learn about
  water safety and how to surf, they challenge themselves and embrace a
  healthier lifestyle.
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  Grain of Sand  Granito de Arena brings innercity children to the beach, and
  pairs them with local surfers and environmental speakers for a day of
  learning, surfing and beach clean ups. Through fun and mentorship, young
  people understand that the beach is just as much theirs as everyone else’s and
  it's up to them to take care of it. The children develop an understanding of:
  the negative effects of water and land pollution, the impact that individuals
  and communities have on the ocean, the profound effects of recycling programs
  and the importance of wiser buying choices.  Furthermore, exercising in nature
  through surfing encourages children to become more active and healthier. 
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >+
  in light of public opposition over the The Clean Water, Clean Beaches ballot
  measure, that would pay to reduce storm water pollution, Los Angeles County
  supervisors may axe the proposed clean water fee. As it stands, the Clean
  Water, Clean Beaches measure would increase L.A. County resident’s property
  tax bills by about $54 for the typical homeowner and possibly thousands of
  dollars for some commercial property owners. The County spends an outrageous
  amount annually In grooming and cleaning our beaches on a daily basis. This
  fee could be rendered unnecessary altogether if everyone did their part in
  properly recycling trash and helping to keep storm drains free of debris.






  By educating enough people to make environmental friendly consumer purchases,
  responsible trash disposal and to be aware that all storm drains end up in the
  ocean, citizens have the power to not only make a positive environmental
  impact, but also a fiscal impact as well. Instead of spending financial
  resources reacting to current problems, we can instead create a cleaner and
  greener future.
