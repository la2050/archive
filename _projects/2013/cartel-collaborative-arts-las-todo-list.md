title: 'cARTel: Collaborative Arts LAs ToDo List'
project_summary: "Our idea is to solidify our company as a sustainable arts organization whose focus is on emerging arts professionals. We believe that in LA, there are two types of arts events: the heavily funded, well attended, and smoothly run event geared towards established artists and celebrities; and the unsupported, sparsely attended, poorly managed event for emerging artists. Our mission bridges the two: creating artistic opportunities for thrilling and boundary-pushing artists that will allow them to create on a bigger, better supported level. Now is the time for us to take the next step in our mission. Each year, we engage hundreds of artists, creators and collaborators - and in order to fully invest in artist and art administrators potential, we need the funding to be able to support them on a monetary level. \r\n\r\nBut first, a little bit about us: cARTel’s attracts those not interested solely in performing or watching, but rather in sharing the experience of art with one another. Since 2007, we have produced 22 theatrical productions, 6 music and film festivals, several one-day events such as poetry readings and collaborative mixers, and 2 installation art shows featuring the work of over 2000 multimedia LA area artists. Our work has been covered by the LA Times, NBCLA, Huffington Post, LAist, LA Weekly, The Examiner, and countless blogs and digital hubs. Our Artistic Director, Negin Singh, was featured on the White House blog, “Winning the Future: Obama and Young Americans” and was named one of the top 20 Indian-American Entrepreneurs for 2012 in India Currents Magazine. Our company values include:\r\n\r\n-Affordability and accessibility. If we can’t afford the price of a ticket, we don’t put it on. \r\n-We only produce original work by daring artists and promote collaboration as the driving energy behind the creative process. \r\n-The event has to be logistically sound and provide a safe, exciting platform for the artists success.\r\n-Process is as important as product. Throughout the creation and planning process, artists and staff alike need to feel comfortable and pushed with respect, patience and fun!\r\n\r\nWhere we are now: We have succeeded in creating a model that attracts artists and audiences to participate in challenging and exciting art-making that is new and comes with few guidelines. Right now, cARTel administrators and artists need to MAKE time out of their hectic schedules to support the mission, which means that though we do a lot already, we can do a LOT MORE. With appropriate funding, we will focus more of our time on expansion of our core programming, free workshops, mentorship programs, a physical space, as well as experiment with new events!\r\n\r\nOur programs: \r\n\r\nBROKECHELLA MUSIC & ARTS FESTIVAL\r\nWhat began at a coffee house with 50 people has now grown to a street festival for over 2000. Brokechella is a one-day extravaganza that will feature 38 of LA’s finest emerging musical talent chosen from over 300 submissions. Music, gourmet street food, art installations, boutique vendors, games, and more - all for under $10. \r\n\r\nNO BUDGET FILM FESTIVAL\r\nBeg, borrow, collaborate; NBFF takes indie filmmaking back to its roots. A red carpet event at the Downtown Independent, last year’s edition debuted the Bonus Features panel series featuring some of today’s trailblazing voices and industry heavyweights from major networks and film fests. \r\n\r\nGENDER LAB\r\nOur annual ensemble-based production returns in summer 2013 for the multimedia performance 'Gender Lab.' An ensemble of artists will use dance, visual art, poetry, food and more to create a sensory experience that asks the question, \"How much of a wo/man are you?\"\r\n\r\nSOUND/STAGE\r\nA quarterly live recording series at El Cid, cARTel revives the lost art of the radio play in a swanky cocktail setting. Sustainable storytelling infused with old Hollywood glamour, the LAist hailed Sound/Stage for \"...resurrect[ing] all of the allure and sultry romanticism of Old Hollywood.\" \r\n\r\nLIVING ROOM TOUR\r\nThe Living Room Tour is a touring theatre series that commissions original work and thrusts it straight into your living room. Since 2007, LRT has hit up living rooms from Hollywood to Orange County to the Valley to Monrovia and everywhere in between. The 2013 show will tour in October as the first Halloween-themed edition of LRT.\r\n\r\nEVERYBODY NOSE \r\ncARTel’s performance clown troupe creates highly collaborative theater pieces through fully-dimensional, silent clowns. Using both physical comedy and intense character work through an organic realization process, we have trained over 1000 clowns to date. Additional support will ensure free workshops for people of all ages, as well as create a new holiday work for December 2013. \r\n\r\nWe have set a fundraising goal of $200,000 for this calendar year to help us sustain our growing organization which will provide for full-time staff, part-time and freelance coordinators and as a means to sustain our standard of artistic excellence."

  description1: "Our greatest achievements have grown out of the people and artists with whom we are privileged to work.  Our ensemble of dedicated artists has grown over the years into a dedicated, well-rounded staff.  In addition to our core team, we have worked with and showcased over 2000 artists over the past five years -- in successful productions and events that span several mediums of art including film, theatre, music, art and more.\r\n\r\nWhile operating with very little money, we’ve been creative and efficient with our resources, so perhaps our biggest achievement has been the fact that we’ve kept it all going!  We have been fortunate to be able to do a lot with very little, never stopping, never settling and constantly taking on new challenges with vigor.  For example, our Brokechella and No Budget festivals -- which today stand as our most far-reaching and well-attended events -- started very small.  Brokechella started in a coffee shop, and in April 2013, 2000 people will join us downtown for a day of music, food, and art (we’ve literally had to shut down an entire street in order to accommodate everyone and everything).  No Budget began in a 50-person theater with no curating process and 16 videos submitted by friends and fans; it now is in its fourth year and has a red carpet, panel discussions led by arts professionals, a sold-out 300-person theater and has been a launchpad for young artists to create work and launch meaningful relationships within the film industry.  The winners of the very first No Budget festival just released a trailer for a series based on their winning film, and many past Brokechella bands have been featured as “bands” to watch and have developed large local followings.  The growth is so exciting to watch and defines what success means to us."

  description: "With support from grants like this, we will be able to expand each of our programs to become year-long projects that last beyond the day of the event with dedicated staffs to each.  We can create new hubs for lovers of film, music, theatre and art to experiment without worrying about the bottom line.  We can be the premiere place where experimentation and collaboration is key, which is wildly important in a city where art can sometimes get lost in the Hollywood hustle.  For example, we would love to add an extension to our No Budget Film Festival program by creating a monthly called “First Cut” where artists can show the first cut of their new film to a group of smart and creative individuals who can provide feedback.  For Brokechella, we could create industry showcases for the artists we’ve worked with in the past to ensure they are getting the attention they deserve. In this way, we can ensure that all of the artists that come through our doors can receive help and constructive attention AFTER the day of the event.\r\n\r\nIf the arts are our passion, then Los Angeles is indeed our canvas.  With an aging population, we believe that it is absolutely crucial to continue creating opportunities for younger, emerging artists -- and not just to continue at our current rate, but to increase and expand opportunities across the board.  Los Angeles is already a destination for so many young arts professionals, but we believe that our organization can be part of the effort to elevate L.A. as a true artistic community -- taking the “cool” factor of our local arts scene and making it possible for young artists to truly envision and experience a sustainable career in our city.\r\n\r\nWe want to be able to sustain our city’s thriving arts and culture scene -- and to create opportunities that cut across existing social and economic divides.  All of our projects support emerging artists who are trying to make a name for themselves, and we make our events as affordable and accessible as possible, so that young people interested in being part of our community will be able to do so.  Los Angeles is an arts town, and a destination -- but too often it feels as if there is too much of a gap between the young and the established, and that many of the opportunities that exist here do not exist for everyone.  cARTel is dedicated to giving people those opportunities.  If people come to us with ideas, we listen.  If people come to us wanting to help out or participate, we find a place for them.  Our focus is truly on the collaborative and communal potential of art, and we feel that this philosophy can absolutely benefit the sometimes-fragmented communities of 21st century Los Angeles."
  collaborators: >-
    We are supported by an advisory board of arts professionals, including
    producers Brian Udovich, Nick Scaramuzzo, Joe and Lisa LaMattina,
    filmmaker/programmer Terrie Samundra and marketing specialist Marcella
    Misserian. Our administrative and artistic ensembles are made up of dozens
    of young Angeleno artists. We are also currently reaching out to City
    Councilmembers, as our next goal is to leave a LASTING impact on the city
    through public works projects that can make LA a better place. We are not a
    company that wants to go into a theater to create theater; we want to take
    over a dump and better it and create theater in it. We want to form
    partnerships with small businesses to collaborate and spread the word about
    them through our art.
  Organization Name: 'cARTel: Collaborative Arts LA'
  success: "Our biggest metric of success is our fundraising goal of $200,000.  If we reach this, it means our audiences were bigger and that our events received more recognition than in 2012.  Larger audience means our projects were more accessible.  Starting with the expansion of Brokechella in April 2013, it means more artist-to-audience-to-artist engagement. \r\n\r\nSuccess will also be measured by how many arts administrators we can afford paying an appropriate wage to.  Right now, our administrative core is made up of 11 dedicated individuals who give up their time whenever they can because they are passionate and believe in the mission.  Though they receive paid stipends, it is simply not enough to be able to fully focus on the tasks at hand.  With support, we would be able to expand each of our programs and devote even more time to the creation and production process. \r\n\r\nAt the end of the year, we will ask collaborators about their experience and how we can improve.  cARTel’s focus is on investing in young artists, and working with them to create art, events, experiences and an overall culture that is sustainable and long-lasting.  When you go to one of our events, you see both artists that have been with us since the beginning, and ones who responded to our call to submissions just weeks before.  This is because we are more interested in a strong, sturdy foundation that we can build over the course of five to ten years.  A survey will enable us to see if we are on the right track.\r\n\r\nIn addition, success will be measured by how well we establish working relationships with other arts organizations, partners that might normally be viewed as competition.  We will evaluate our collaborations to see how they benefit the arts scene of Los Angeles and the city as a whole."
  description3: >-
    We don’t view good producers and creators, or other art organizations, as
    “competition.”  If we like what someone is doing, our philosophy is to reach
    out and try and partner or get them involved with opportunities for
    showcasing their work.  It’s not who has the best idea in the room; it’s
    someone who can pick up on what the best idea is and collaborate and
    execute.  For example, with our Sound/Stage event, we invite playwrights and
    directors from different companies to create work with us for a night.  We
    have in the past (and will continue to do so) partnered with Deaf West
    Theater to create exciting clowning opportunities and collaborations.  Other
    partners include The Planetary Society, daqri, Brownies and Lemonade, Shifty
    Rhythms, The Illyrian Players, Fugitive Kind Theater and more.
  vision: "Success in 2050 is a thriving, durable, democratic Los Angeles arts & culture scene that is truly collaborative and provides opportunities for all types of emerging artists who want to build careers and lives in our city.  cARTel wants to show artists that contrary to popular belief, there IS A WAY to make a career out of art-making and passionate collaboration! The creation of art is not limited by venue, by galleries, theatres, and stages. The foundation that cARTel and our partners set in 2013 will encourage emerging artists to be innovative, to collaborate rather than silo themselves away. \r\n\r\nTo put it in a “big dream” sort of way: We want to make Los Angeles VISIBLY better.  We want you to be able to pass by our project on your way to work, and to be able to participate in one of our events without having to look too hard to find us.  We want art-making as a way of life to become a possibility for more and more people, and we believe that cARTel is the right vehicle to make that happen.\r\n\r\nMany of us in cARTel are not native Angelenos, but we all were drawn to this city by the enduring promise that this is a place where a young person can come to make his or her dreams come true.  We are reminded of a scenic overlook on Mulholland Drive, high above the city, looking east toward downtown Los Angeles, and a placard referring to L.A. as “The City That Dreams Built.”   As Los Angeles moves through the 21st century, we face many challenges as a city and an arts community.  But this age-old promise -- the “City of Dreams” -- remains. Thousands of people will flock here in 2050 because of that promise. Their art won’t be held back by lack of funds or sponsorship. They will have developed the tools to go out there and make art no matter how little resources they think they have. "

  about_you: 'Los Angeles, CA'
  Does your project impact Los Angeles County?: 'yes'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  Our idea is to solidify our company as a sustainable arts organization whose
  focus is on emerging arts professionals. We believe that in LA, there are two
  types of arts events: the heavily funded, well attended, and smoothly run
  event geared towards established artists and celebrities; and the unsupported,
  sparsely attended, poorly managed event for emerging artists. Our mission
  bridges the two: creating artistic opportunities for thrilling and
  boundarypushing artists that will allow them to create on a bigger, better
  supported level. Now is the time for us to take the next step in our mission.
  Each year, we engage hundreds of artists, creators and collaborators  and in
  order to fully invest in artist and art administrators potential, we need the
  funding to be able to support them on a monetary level. 






  But first, a little bit about us: cARTel’s attracts those not interested
  solely in performing or watching, but rather in sharing the experience of art
  with one another. Since 2007, we have produced 22 theatrical productions, 6
  music and film festivals, several oneday events such as poetry readings and
  collaborative mixers, and 2 installation art shows featuring the work of over
  2000 multimedia LA area artists. Our work has been covered by the LA Times,
  NBCLA, Huffington Post, LAist, LA Weekly, The Examiner, and countless blogs
  and digital hubs. Our Artistic Director, Negin Singh, was featured on the
  White House blog, “Winning the Future: Obama and Young Americans” and was
  named one of the top 20 IndianAmerican Entrepreneurs for 2012 in India
  Currents Magazine. Our company values include:






  Affordability and accessibility. If we can’t afford the price of a ticket, we
  don’t put it on. 



  We only produce original work by daring artists and promote collaboration as
  the driving energy behind the creative process. 



  The event has to be logistically sound and provide a safe, exciting platform
  for the artists success.



  Process is as important as product. Throughout the creation and planning
  process, artists and staff alike need to feel comfortable and pushed with
  respect, patience and fun!






  Where we are now: We have succeeded in creating a model that attracts artists
  and audiences to participate in challenging and exciting artmaking that is new
  and comes with few guidelines. Right now, cARTel administrators and artists
  need to MAKE time out of their hectic schedules to support the mission, which
  means that though we do a lot already, we can do a LOT MORE. With appropriate
  funding, we will focus more of our time on expansion of our core programming,
  free workshops, mentorship programs, a physical space, as well as experiment
  with new events!






  Our programs: 






  BROKECHELLA MUSIC & ARTS FESTIVAL



  What began at a coffee house with 50 people has now grown to a street festival
  for over 2000. Brokechella is a oneday extravaganza that will feature 38 of
  LA’s finest emerging musical talent chosen from over 300 submissions. Music,
  gourmet street food, art installations, boutique vendors, games, and more  all
  for under $10. 






  NO BUDGET FILM FESTIVAL



  Beg, borrow, collaborate; NBFF takes indie filmmaking back to its roots. A red
  carpet event at the Downtown Independent, last year’s edition debuted the
  Bonus Features panel series featuring some of today’s trailblazing voices and
  industry heavyweights from major networks and film fests. 






  GENDER LAB



  Our annual ensemblebased production returns in summer 2013 for the multimedia
  performance 'Gender Lab.' An ensemble of artists will use dance, visual art,
  poetry, food and more to create a sensory experience that asks the question,
  "How much of a wo/man are you?"






  SOUND/STAGE



  A quarterly live recording series at El Cid, cARTel revives the lost art of
  the radio play in a swanky cocktail setting. Sustainable storytelling infused
  with old Hollywood glamour, the LAist hailed Sound/Stage for
  "...resurrect[ing] all of the allure and sultry romanticism of Old
  Hollywood." 






  LIVING ROOM TOUR



  The Living Room Tour is a touring theatre series that commissions original
  work and thrusts it straight into your living room. Since 2007, LRT has hit up
  living rooms from Hollywood to Orange County to the Valley to Monrovia and
  everywhere in between. The 2013 show will tour in October as the first
  Halloweenthemed edition of LRT.






  EVERYBODY NOSE 



  cARTel’s performance clown troupe creates highly collaborative theater pieces
  through fullydimensional, silent clowns. Using both physical comedy and
  intense character work through an organic realization process, we have trained
  over 1000 clowns to date. Additional support will ensure free workshops for
  people of all ages, as well as create a new holiday work for December 2013. 






  We have set a fundraising goal of $200,000 for this calendar year to help us
  sustain our growing organization which will provide for fulltime staff,
  parttime and freelance coordinators and as a means to sustain our standard of
  artistic excellence.
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  Our greatest achievements have grown out of the people and artists with whom
  we are privileged to work.  Our ensemble of dedicated artists has grown over
  the years into a dedicated, wellrounded staff.  In addition to our core team,
  we have worked with and showcased over 2000 artists over the past five years 
  in successful productions and events that span several mediums of art
  including film, theatre, music, art and more.






  While operating with very little money, we’ve been creative and efficient with
  our resources, so perhaps our biggest achievement has been the fact that we’ve
  kept it all going!  We have been fortunate to be able to do a lot with very
  little, never stopping, never settling and constantly taking on new challenges
  with vigor.  For example, our Brokechella and No Budget festivals  which today
  stand as our most farreaching and wellattended events  started very small. 
  Brokechella started in a coffee shop, and in April 2013, 2000 people will join
  us downtown for a day of music, food, and art (we’ve literally had to shut
  down an entire street in order to accommodate everyone and everything).  No
  Budget began in a 50person theater with no curating process and 16 videos
  submitted by friends and fans; it now is in its fourth year and has a red
  carpet, panel discussions led by arts professionals, a soldout 300person
  theater and has been a launchpad for young artists to create work and launch
  meaningful relationships within the film industry.  The winners of the very
  first No Budget festival just released a trailer for a series based on their
  winning film, and many past Brokechella bands have been featured as “bands” to
  watch and have developed large local followings.  The growth is so exciting to
  watch and defines what success means to us.
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  We are supported by an advisory board of arts professionals, including

Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  Our biggest metric of success is our fundraising goal of $200,000.  If we
  reach this, it means our audiences were bigger and that our events received
  more recognition than in 2012.  Larger audience means our projects were more
  accessible.  Starting with the expansion of Brokechella in April 2013, it
  means more artisttoaudiencetoartist engagement.

  In addition, success will be measured by how well we establish working
  relationships with other arts organizations, partners that might normally be
  viewed as competition.  We will evaluate our collaborations to see how they
  benefit the arts scene of Los Angeles and the city as a whole.
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  With support from grants like this, we will be able to expand each of our
  programs to become yearlong projects that last beyond the day of the event
  with dedicated staffs to each.  We can create new hubs for lovers of film,
  music, theatre and art to experiment without worrying about the bottom line. 
  We can be the premiere place where experimentation and collaboration is key,
  which is wildly important in a city where art can sometimes get lost in the
  Hollywood hustle.  For example, we would love to add an extension to our No
  Budget Film Festival program by creating a monthly called “First Cut” where
  artists can show the first cut of their new film to a group of smart and
  creative individuals who can provide feedback.  For Brokechella, we could
  create industry showcases for the artists we’ve worked with in the past to
  ensure they are getting the attention they deserve. In this way, we can ensure
  that all of the artists that come through our doors can receive help and
  constructive attention AFTER the day of the event.






  If the arts are our passion, then Los Angeles is indeed our canvas.  With an
  aging population, we believe that it is absolutely crucial to continue
  creating opportunities for younger, emerging artists  and not just to continue
  at our current rate, but to increase and expand opportunities across the
  board.  Los Angeles is already a destination for so many young arts
  professionals, but we believe that our organization can be part of the effort
  to elevate L.A. as a true artistic community  taking the “cool” factor of our
  local arts scene and making it possible for young artists to truly envision
  and experience a sustainable career in our city.






  We want to be able to sustain our city’s thriving arts and culture scene  and
  to create opportunities that cut across existing social and economic divides. 
  All of our projects support emerging artists who are trying to make a name for
  themselves, and we make our events as affordable and accessible as possible,
  so that young people interested in being part of our community will be able to
  do so.  Los Angeles is an arts town, and a destination  but too often it feels
  as if there is too much of a gap between the young and the established, and
  that many of the opportunities that exist here do not exist for everyone. 
  cARTel is dedicated to giving people those opportunities.  If people come to
  us with ideas, we listen.  If people come to us wanting to help out or
  participate, we find a place for them.  Our focus is truly on the
  collaborative and communal potential of art, and we feel that this philosophy

  Angeles.
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  Success in 2050 is a thriving, durable, democratic Los Angeles arts & culture

  not limited by venue, by galleries, theatres, and stages. The foundation that
  cARTel and our partners set in 2013 will encourage emerging artists to be
  innovative, to collaborate rather than silo themselves away. 






  To put it in a “big dream” sort of way: We want to make Los Angeles VISIBLY
  better.  We want you to be able to pass by our project on your way to work,
  and to be able to participate in one of our events without having to look too
  hard to find us.  We want artmaking as a way of life to become a possibility
  for more and more people, and we believe that cARTel is the right vehicle to
  make that happen.






  Many of us in cARTel are not native Angelenos, but we all were drawn to this
  city by the enduring promise that this is a place where a young person can
  come to make his or her dreams come true.  We are reminded of a scenic
  overlook on Mulholland Drive, high above the city, looking east toward
  downtown Los Angeles, and a placard referring to L.A. as “The City That Dreams
  Built.”   As Los Angeles moves through the 21st century, we face many
  challenges as a city and an arts community.  But this ageold promise  the
  “City of Dreams”  remains. Thousands of people will flock here in 2050 because
  of that promise. Their art won’t be held back by lack of funds or sponsorship.
  They will have developed the tools to go out there and make art no matter how
  little resources they think they have.
