title: 'Smart Growth for All: Affordable Housing Near Public Transit'
indicator: ' Housing'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  Imagine the Los Angeles of 2050. Will it still have trafficchoked freeways,
  everincreasing pollution, and neighborhoods divided by lines of wealth and
  poverty? Or will it have smogbusting transit and bike lanes, playgrounds and
  parks, and housing that everyone can afford? 






  Public Counsel is using its legal muscle to help create a future for LA that
  is greener, more prosperous, and more livable. For the past few years, we have
  been focusing on ensuring that plans for the city’s public transit system
  include affordable housing, so that lowincome residents can benefit as public
  transit reshapes the regional landscape.






  With an unprecedented influx in transit investment taking place in LA, the key
  question facing our communities is: how can development happen so that
  everyone benefits, and nobody is left behind? Transit corridor and
  transitoriented development (TOD) is an increasingly popular strategy to
  improve our built environment while reducing carbon emissions.






  Thanks to the passage of three critical pieces of legislation—Assembly Bill
  32, Senate Bill 375, and LA County Measure R—TOD is becoming a reality in LA.
  City planners estimate that 80% of new development in the city will be
  transitadjacent, and the Mayor has appointed a Transit Corridors Cabinet to
  plan for dense, walkable, mixeduse neighborhoods near transit.






  But with transit development comes both opportunity and risk, especially for
  existing lowincome residents of transit areas. Mounting evidence shows that
  TOD can actually work against many of its stated goals, resulting in rising
  land value and housing costs, displacement of lowerincome residents by
  higherincome residents with higher rates of vehicle ownership, and
  therefore—paradoxically—declining transit ridership.   






  The need for affordable housing near transit is especially urgent in Los
  Angeles. LA is the most economically segregated metropolitan area in the
  country. Residents in the city’s existing station areas have median household
  incomes of less than $30,000 a year, significantly lower than the regional
  median. Nearly threequarters of station area residents are renters and more
  vulnerable to displacement.






  Another reason for the urgency of equitable TOD in LA is the dissolution of
  California’s redevelopment agencies in 2012, which resulted in the loss of $64
  million in annual economic development in LA alone. Public Counsel
  demonstrated the power of legal strategies to effect systemic change when it
  recently challenged the State’s attempt to take redevelopment funds targeted
  for affordable housing in eastern LA County. At a hearing, the judge asked
  Public Counsel’s pro bono attorney how losing such funding would cause
  immediate harm. The attorney provided sworn declarations showing, for example,
  that without funding for affordable housing, many families will be on the
  street or forced to remain in transitional shelters for a year or longer. One
  mother of three described how her family is packed into a single room where
  they have trouble sleeping, the kitchen is too small to cook an adequate meal,
  her 5yearold daughter has to attend an unfamiliar school, and she lacks the
  permanent address she needs to find a job. At the end of the hearing, the
  judge granted a preliminary injunction protecting $38 million in affordable
  housing funds.






  Against the backdrop of this crisis in redevelopment funding, TOD is being
  touted as “Redevelopment 2.0.” But TOD can only help redevelop lowincome
  neighborhoods to the benefit of existing residents if we put policies in place
  to make that happen, and ensure that those policies are effectively
  implemented.






  That’s where Public Counsel’s legal muscle comes in. Too often, resident and
  community voices are left out of major decisions affecting the build out of
  their neighborhoods. Too often, plans are made but not implemented. We have
  used our legal expertise in the past to ensure an open and accessible public
  process, and we have worked with our nonprofit clients to develop innovative
  policies that advance the interests of local residents.






  Building on our prior successes in South LA, the Cornfield Arroyo Seco
  specific plan area north of downtown, the 15 mile radius surrounding the City
  of Industry, and the southeast cities, Public Counsel will:






  (1) Advocate for the development and preservation of affordable housing and
  antidisplacement policies near transit;






  (2) Advance land use plans that represent the needs of vulnerable residents;
  and






  (3) Provide indepth, oneonone legal and policy assistance to nonprofit
  affordable housing developers, and to communitybased organizations
  representing lowincome residents, to help them participate in community
  planning processes.






  Working together, Public Counsel and our partners can ensure that
  transitoriented development works for lowincome communities, for the smart
  growth goals of the city, and for the environmental aspirations California
  shares with so many people throughout the world.
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  For the past two years, Public Counsel has worked with the Southeast Asian
  Community Alliance to develop a groundbreaking new land use plan for the
  transitrich Cornfields Arroyo area north of downtown. The campaign focused on
  obtaining incentives for increased affordable housing, environmental justice,
  and good jobs. As a result of our efforts in providing lead legal and policy
  support, along with the efforts of other community partners, the plan is
  expected to be an effective tool for producing affordable housing in the area
  and for preventing displacement of existing residents. The plan is being
  touted as a model for transit planning throughout LA.






  Public Counsel won a preliminary injunction this year, preventing the State
  from taking $38 million in affordable housing funds from the LA County Housing
  Authority. Acting on behalf of the Southern California Association of
  Nonprofit Housing, we protected these funds that are designated for affordable
  housing for lowincome seniors, people who are homeless, families, and
  transitionage youth within 15 miles of the City of Industry, which includes
  many areas around transit.






  Our staff attorneys led a team of lawyers in reaching an agreement, in 2011,
  with the developer of the Lorenzo project in South LA, in which the developer
  agreed to concessions worth $9.5 million. The Lorenzo project is the largest
  of its kind along the city’s planned Expo Line extension. The agreement
  delivered a wide range of community benefits, including 7,500 square feet,
  rent free, dedicated to communitybased health care services, and 5% of the
  units built to be made affordable to people who earn less than 50% of the area
  median income.






  With Public Counsel’s leadership, the Alliance for Community TransitLos
  Angeles engaged in a strategic planning process; finalized its vision,
  mission, and principles; solidified its membership base of 20 diverse
  organizations; strengthened its infrastructure; and developed the key
  parameters of a citywide equitable TOD campaign.






  Public Counsel represented the interests of lowincome tenants whose affordable
  housing was at risk of being lost in Los Angeles’ rapidly gentrifying coastal
  zone, which already had a limited supply of affordable housing. In 2011, we
  reached a historic settlement with HUD and the owners of the Holiday Venice
  apartment complex that provides for 20 years of affordability provisions and
  protects current tenants from being displaced.  






  We are engaged in a longterm campaign in the southeast cities (Bell, Bell
  Gardens, Cudahy, Huntington Park, Maywood, and South Gate) to increase
  families’ access to child care and green space through changes to those
  cities’ general plans and zoning codes.






  Public Counsel is providing legal advocacy to preserve a 400bed homeless
  shelter that is at risk of being shut down or forced to relocate by the 710
  freeway expansion.
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  The communitybased organizations we will work with include East LA Community
  Corporation, Southeast Asian Community Alliance, Little Tokyo Service Center,
  and SAJE. We will also work on TOD planning strategies with the Southern
  California Association of Nonprofit Housing.






  In addition, Public Counsel is a founding member of the Alliance for Community
  TransitLos Angeles, a coalition of 20 groups working to ensure that all
  residents and workers in the city have a seat at the table as TOD plans are
  developed and implemented.






  Finally, we partner with the California Affordable Housing Law Project, and
  with major law firms like Katten Muchin Rosenman that donate pro bono legal
  services to our efforts, in order to maximize our impact.
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  We expect to complete the following work plan for this project:






  (1) Advocate for the production and preservation of affordable housing, along
  with antidisplacement policies, near transit in LA County.






  (2) Mobilize at least 10 other organizations and coalitions to advocate for
  the production and preservation of affordable housing near transit in LA
  County.






  (3) Provide indepth, oneonone TODrelated policy assistance to at least 5
  communitybased organizations working in lowincome neighborhoods in LA County.






  (4) Provide indepth, oneonone general (transactional) legal services to at
  least 20 nonprofit organizations working for affordable housing or shelter for
  people who are homeless or lowerincome, including in TOD.






  Public Counsel uses a comprehensive case and data tracking program—the ProLaw
  database—to track a wide variety of quantifiable measures of effectiveness and
  efficiency.






  In addition, after closing every legal matter, we ask our clients to evaluate
  our work. The best measure of our success will be that our clients, community
  partners, and residents will report a stronger voice in shaping the
  communities they live in and serve.






  Finally, the TOD plans with which we are engaged will contain language
  advancing affordable housing and antidisplacement, and the legal matters we
  work on will result in increased or preserved funding for affordable housing.
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  Our project will use legal and policy tools to help lift up the voices of
  residents and community organizations engaged in planning for transitoriented
  development in Los Angeles. If the process of developing TOD plans
  meaningfully incorporates such voices, those plans will result in documented
  benefits of equitable TOD, including affordable housing for residents with low
  income around major transit stops; increased community access to jobs,
  healthcare, and fresh food; increased public transportation ridership;
  increased public investment and economic activity; and reduced traffic
  congestion, greenhouse gas emissions, and commuting times. Most of all, as Los
  Angeles develops its transit infrastructure, it will do so in a manner that
  allows it to retain its socioeconomic, racial, and cultural diversity, and
  that does not push out existing communities and residents.






  A number of affordable housing advocates and communitybased organizations have
  sought our legal assistance in influencing local TOD planning processes and in
  advancing affordable housing and antidisplacement policies near transit in
  South and East LA. Particularly after our success in achieving innovative
  policies to advance affordable housing and economic development in the
  Cornfields Arroyo, there is great momentum to achieve similar innovations in
  other local plans and in citywide planning processes.


   


  Specifically, through this project:






  *  Organizations working to advance affordable housing near transit will have
  legal tools and increased capacity to shape the development of their
  neighborhoods;






  *  The views of communitybased organizations serving lowincome people in Los
  Angeles will be represented in TOD planning processes; and






  *  Proposed California transit legislation will contain language that supports
  lowincome communities.
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  If we are successful in achieving our goals for equitable transitoriented
  development in 2050, Los Angeles will preserve its stock of quality housing
  that is affordable for lowincome residents, and will use the transit build out
  as an opportunity to build even more affordable housing. Public TOD planning
  processes will be transparent, and will include input from lowincome community
  advocates at all stages. Most importantly, no person will live on the streets
  or in substandard or overcrowded conditions due to a lack of affordable
  housing, and no one will be displaced as a result of transit development.
  Existing residents will benefit along with new residents from equitable TOD.






  We envision healthy communities where residents are not segregated
  economically, where there is equal access to affordable housing located near
  jobs, and where schools, healthcare, groceries, and other essential services
  are within walking distance. And we envision a Los Angeles that is an
  environmental leader, with cleaner air and reduced carbon emissions.

Finally, as the largest pro bono law office in the nation, Public Counsel leverages our impact by recruiting over 5,000 volunteer attorneys, law students, and paralegals every year to provide free legal services to our clients.\r\n\r\nTo our knowledge, the only other public interest law firm in the Los Angeles area that has a Community Development Project is the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles (LAFLA). We view LAFLA as a collaborator, rather than a competitor. Our two programs worked closely together, for example, in advocating for community benefits in connection with the Lorenzo project. And Public Counsel and LAFLA have been collaborating with community organizations working to advance an equitable transit plan in South and Southeast LA.\r\n\r\nWe collaborate with other legal service organizations as well. For example, we have been working closely with the Western Center on Law & Poverty to advance legislation to bring new affordable housing funds into the state."

If the process of developing TOD plans meaningfully incorporates such voices, those plans will result in documented benefits of equitable TOD, including affordable housing for residents with low income around major transit stops; increased community access to jobs, healthcare, and fresh food; increased public transportation ridership; increased public investment and economic activity; and reduced traffic congestion, greenhouse gas emissions, and commuting times. Most of all, as Los Angeles develops its transit infrastructure, it will do so in a manner that allows it to retain its socio-economic, racial, and cultural diversity, and that does not push out existing communities and residents.\r\n\r\nA number of affordable housing advocates and community-based organizations have sought our legal assistance in influencing local TOD planning processes and in advancing affordable housing and anti-displacement policies near transit in South and East LA. Particularly after our success in achieving innovative policies to advance affordable housing and economic development in the Cornfields Arroyo, there is great momentum to achieve similar innovations in other local plans and in citywide planning processes.\r\n \r\nSpecifically, through this project:\r\n\r\n•  Organizations working to advance affordable housing near transit will have legal tools and increased capacity to shape the development of their neighborhoods;\r\n\r\n•  The views of community-based organizations serving low-income people in Los Angeles will be represented in TOD planning processes; and\r\n\r\n•  Proposed California transit legislation will contain language that supports low-income communities."

    answer: "The community-based organizations we will work with include East LA Community Corporation, Southeast Asian Community Alliance, Little Tokyo Service Center, and SAJE. We will also work on TOD planning strategies with the Southern California Association of Nonprofit Housing.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Public Counsel is a founding member of the Alliance for Community Transit-Los Angeles, a coalition of 20 groups working to ensure that all residents and workers in the city have a seat at the table as TOD plans are developed and implemented.\r\n\r\nFinally, we partner with the California Affordable Housing Law Project, and with major law firms like Katten Muchin Rosenman that donate pro bono legal services to our efforts, in order to maximize our impact."

    answer: "We expect to complete the following work plan for this project:\r\n\r\n(1) Advocate for the production and preservation of affordable housing, along with anti-displacement policies, near transit in LA County.\r\n\r\n(2) Mobilize at least 10 other organizations and coalitions to advocate for the production and preservation of affordable housing near transit in LA County.\r\n\r\n(3) Provide in-depth, one-on-one TOD-related policy assistance to at least 5 community-based organizations working in low-income neighborhoods in LA County.\r\n\r\n(4) Provide in-depth, one-on-one general (transactional) legal services to at least 20 nonprofit organizations working for affordable housing or shelter for people who are homeless or lower-income, including in TOD.\r\n\r\nPublic Counsel uses a comprehensive case and data tracking program—the ProLaw database—to track a wide variety of quantifiable measures of effectiveness and efficiency.\r\n\r\nIn addition, after closing every legal matter, we ask our clients to evaluate our work. The best measure of our success will be that our clients, community partners, and residents will report a stronger voice in shaping the communities they live in and serve.\r\n\r\nFinally, the TOD plans with which we are engaged will contain language advancing affordable housing and anti-displacement, and the legal matters we work on will result in increased or preserved funding for affordable housing."

    answer: "For the past two years, Public Counsel has worked with the Southeast Asian Community Alliance to develop a groundbreaking new land use plan for the transit-rich Cornfields Arroyo area north of downtown. The campaign focused on obtaining incentives for increased affordable housing, environmental justice, and good jobs. As a result of our efforts in providing lead legal and policy support, along with the efforts of other community partners, the plan is expected to be an effective tool for producing affordable housing in the area and for preventing displacement of existing residents. The plan is being touted as a model for transit planning throughout LA.\r\n\r\nPublic Counsel won a preliminary injunction this year, preventing the State from taking $38 million in affordable housing funds from the LA County Housing Authority. Acting on behalf of the Southern California Association of Nonprofit Housing, we protected these funds that are designated for affordable housing for low-income seniors, people who are homeless, families, and transition-age youth within 15 miles of the City of Industry, which includes many areas around transit.\r\n\r\nOur staff attorneys led a team of lawyers in reaching an agreement, in 2011, with the developer of the Lorenzo project in South LA, in which the developer agreed to concessions worth $9.5 million. The Lorenzo project is the largest of its kind along the city’s planned Expo Line extension. The agreement delivered a wide range of community benefits, including 7,500 square feet, rent free, dedicated to community-based health care services, and 5% of the units built to be made affordable to people who earn less than 50% of the area median income.\r\n\r\nWith Public Counsel’s leadership, the Alliance for Community Transit-Los Angeles engaged in a strategic planning process; finalized its vision, mission, and principles; solidified its membership base of 20 diverse organizations; strengthened its infrastructure; and developed the key parameters of a citywide equitable TOD campaign.\r\n\r\nPublic Counsel represented the interests of low-income tenants whose affordable housing was at risk of being lost in Los Angeles’ rapidly gentrifying coastal zone, which already had a limited supply of affordable housing. In 2011, we reached a historic settlement with HUD and the owners of the Holiday Venice apartment complex that provides for 20 years of affordability provisions and protects current tenants from being displaced.  \r\n\r\nWe are engaged in a long-term campaign in the southeast cities (Bell, Bell Gardens, Cudahy, Huntington Park, Maywood, and South Gate) to increase families’ access to child care and green space through changes to those cities’ general plans and zoning codes.\r\n\r\nPublic Counsel is providing legal advocacy to preserve a 400-bed homeless shelter that is at risk of being shut down or forced to relocate by the 710 freeway expansion."

    answer: "Defining our competition requires us to first describe how we define ourselves. Public Counsel’s Community Development Project builds foundations for healthy communities, employing legal tools, policy advocacy, and capacity building services to help community-based organizations and residents participate in the decisions that affect their neighborhoods. We specialize in affordable housing, child care, economic development, and assistance to nonprofits serving low-income communities. Finally, as the largest pro bono law office in the nation, Public Counsel leverages our impact by recruiting over 5,000 volunteer attorneys, law students, and paralegals every year to provide free legal services to our clients.\r\n\r\nTo our knowledge, the only other public interest law firm in the Los Angeles area that has a Community Development Project is the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles (LAFLA). We view LAFLA as a collaborator, rather than a competitor. Our two programs worked closely together, for example, in advocating for community benefits in connection with the Lorenzo project. And Public Counsel and LAFLA have been collaborating with community organizations working to advance an equitable transit plan in South and Southeast LA.\r\n\r\nWe collaborate with other legal service organizations as well. For example, we have been working closely with the Western Center on Law & Poverty to advance legislation to bring new affordable housing funds into the state."

    answer: "If we are successful in achieving our goals for equitable transit-oriented development in 2050, Los Angeles will preserve its stock of quality housing that is affordable for low-income residents, and will use the transit build out as an opportunity to build even more affordable housing. Public TOD planning processes will be transparent, and will include input from low-income community advocates at all stages. Most importantly, no person will live on the streets or in substandard or overcrowded conditions due to a lack of affordable housing, and no one will be displaced as a result of transit development. Existing residents will benefit along with new residents from equitable TOD.\r\n\r\nWe envision healthy communities where residents are not segregated economically, where there is equal access to affordable housing located near jobs, and where schools, healthcare, groceries, and other essential services are within walking distance. And we envision a Los Angeles that is an environmental leader, with cleaner air and reduced carbon emissions."
