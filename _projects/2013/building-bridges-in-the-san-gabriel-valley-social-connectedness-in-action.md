title: 'Building Bridges in the San Gabriel Valley: Social Connectedness in Action'
project_summary: "St. John the Baptist Social Service has a long history of involvement in the community, aiding those in need. The program has been meeting the many economic, physical, and societal needs of the community and successfully adjusting to changes in the area since 194.\r\n\r\nIn the past few years, the program has also sought to increase linkages between different parts of society. Baldwin Park and surrounding cities have had some issues with having government, business, organizations, and the population working together such as with redevelopment issues. \r\n\r\nAn example is the start of the Cesar Chavez Interfaith Breakfast, which for the first time brought together community leaders, business owners, labor leaders, clergy from several denominations, public sector employees, and politicians together in a non-formal gathering. The event allows people to meet others while also hearing different perspectives, such as a rabbi who worked with Cesar Chavez to a local graduate who has become principal of one of the city’s high schools.  Attendees leave with new contacts and possibilities.\r\n\r\nThere has been great success in having community voices heard with more influence at city hall. After a fatal traffic accident, the program teamed with LA Voice and other congregations to seek a solution to an ongoing danger.  This combined campaign led to a rapid decision by the city to install a new traffic light, which is now in service. The campaign prompted local officials to act far faster than normal.\r\n\r\nAn ongoing success has been getting community members much more involved in local issues. An example is the city’s study of whether to retain the local police department or contract with the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department. Now, community members are attending hearings, giving their opinions and staying informed of events in the debate. In previous years this process would largely have been ignored by the public and not been influenced by their views. The local officials now know their decisions are being monitored. Creating public accountability is a major gain for this area.\r\n\r\nA significant achievement has been making connections to more effectively serve those in need, something that before was more provincial. The Social Services program has adjusted the annual Thanksgiving food drive to partner with the school district and their family liaison officers to identify people in need. This has led to a much better evaluation of the needs of the community and reduced fraud. Now, verified families in need have Thanksgiving food boxes delivered to their homes. This partnership is helping both parties ensure aid is effective to maximize results. \r\n\r\nThe Social Services program has been developing greater and deeper linkages in the community to provide better delivery of resources. This project will take this process even further to yield wonderful dividends. The foundation of social connectedness has been established; now, the program looks to grow the structure.\r\n"

  success: "This project is not solely a project where simple headcounts or signatures on a page are the signs of success; this project will be accountable beyond statistics.\r\n\r\nSome successes will be easy to measure. Were the proposed additional equipment purchased? A “Yes” means the project has successfully increased capacity significantly for communication. Here a “headcount” for PowerPoint projectors is obviously an easy task. Likewise, telephone upgrades are easily quantifiable to see that capacity has increased for phone banks and similar events. Laptops again are quantifiable and quickly add mobility and capacity to communication. A scanner is quantifiable and will boost connectedness by adding electronic capabilities to presentations and communications.\r\n\r\nIn less quantifiable area, the results will still exist and be more oriented towards “people power” and “soft power.”  The effects though will be profound.\r\n\r\n+ Success for Asian-Pacific Islander-Hispanic dialogue will be measured in creating a sustainable series in the region. Establishing the foundation for this dialogue will be the first success, especially as it will be novel in the area. \r\n+ Second, holding the events and workshops will be quantifiable. The results are less numeric and more long-term; but, attendance should create grounds for success and improve the region as demographics change.\r\n+Third, seeing results for the expansion of the LA Voice presence will be ongoing. The project sees LA Voice growing from one congregation in the San Gabriel Valley to a substantial presence across the region and in a range of faiths. Success sees local organizing committees being established and active, connecting people in new ways and increasing their ability to promote change in their communities. \r\n+ Fourth, the events part of the project again will yield less quantifiable results. These planned events will result in greater connectedness among disparate parts of society: youth, adults, non-profits, business, government and congregations. Success in this segment will see less animosity, greater trust, and greater awareness of opportunities for individual growth as well as partnerships. Currently, there is a significant amount of animosity among many of the groups that is affecting areas such as employment and education.\r\n\r\nTraining will be a success with staff and others gaining capabilities and expanding knowledge bases. Learning of new “best practices” can boost even the most best operation. In addition, training can help in evaluating existing projects and looking at future projects for improvement and/or implementation.\r\n\r\nIn all these segments, there will also be evaluation by users. The project sees constant feedback from those involved. For example, attendees at dialogue workshops will be asked for their opinions of the event and for suggestions. Success will be taking the existing regional “human capital” and growing and improving it to make a huge asset for the future.\r\n"
  Indicator: ' Social Connectedness'
  brief: "The San Gabriel Valley currently lacks solid social connectedness; this project aims to change this dynamic.\r\n\r\nFirst, the area, like much of Los Angeles is experiencing demographic changes. This is definitely true in the San Gabriel Valley as newly arriving Latinos and Asian-Pacific Islanders mix with existing 2nd-5th Generation Latinos. This project seeks to alleviate some of the tensions change can bring by starting dialogues and workshops led by established professional facilitators. These dialogues seek to bring different cultures with very different experiences and expectations for life in the San Gabriel Valley and Los Angeles together in order to connect and work together, rather than exist in clusters individually. The idea is to use methods similar to successful “black-brown” projects in Los Angeles and make them relevant to the region and its needs. The dialogues would be adapted for language needs. This segment will be aided by previous experience working with NCCJ (National Conference for Community & Justice). The first step in growing connectedness is to have different groups actually connect; this project begins those linkages.\r\n\r\nThe second area of the project to expand social connectedness is to partner with LA Voice in expanding the region. Currently, LA Voice has many strong clusters in Los Angeles; but, it has a lone operation in the San Gabriel Valley (in Baldwin Park).  This project sees the formation of a regional base and expansion into many more congregations. \r\n\r\nLA Voice’s expansion would greatly aid social connectedness. In individual congregations, it would create opportunities for individuals to learn how to gain influence and change their communities.  Regional meetings would bring these congregations together in actions and planning sessions, which grow area connectedness. LA Voice’s network across Los Angeles provides further opportunities for connectedness at meetings and actions.  This effect is further amplified with statewide conferences of the PICO Network which will allow San Gabriel Valley residents to develop ideas and learn from other Californians beyond relying on emails or news reports. \r\n\r\nThe third segment is the hosting of events to grow social connectedness. For example, preparations are underway for a higher education presentation that would include universities, counselors, immigration assistance, and local successful graduates, including a commitment from a locally-raised government official currently working in Washington, D.C. With ongoing budget cuts and cultural issues, an event held independently of school has very significant promise to connect a wide pool of potential candidates to resources needed to attend higher education. Hosting “get acquainted” meetings for local businesses, politicians, and leaders is designed to provide non-confrontational opportunities for contact among what has been at time a contentious environment rather than confrontational or negotiating situations. The project also sees quarterly men’s and women’s contact group meetings to discuss issues they feel are pertinent. Citizenship events are another key component. These events help residents move from residency through the application process and examinations to full Unietd States citizenship. The citizenship steps also introduce people to “the system” and strongly encourage voting and voter awareness of issues. These events ranging from higher education awareness to more regular contact sessions and promote new linkages for the area.\r\n\r\nThe fourth area is training to improve social connectedness. Training will make presentations, events, and communications more effective. The training will include making sue of technology to improve presentations. Staff development will also help the program deal with the community changes already discussed. The project also plans to send teens to leadership development training. In this area youth leadership is often not fully nourished; the goal of the training is to have youth involved and to prepare them for greater success.\r\n\r\nThe fifth area to improve social connectedness is capability upgrades through technology and equipment. Currently, the Social Services program relies on “low tech” communications. This project sees program gaining a major boost in long-term capability to connect with society through laptop computers, a scanner, PowerPoint projectors, significantly upgraded telephones to allow for more efficient phone banks, and data transfer equipment. The equipment upgrades will make communications more effective. For example, a bilingual PowerPoint presentation in Asian-Pacific Islander-Hispanic dialogues will now be possible. Likewise, non-partisan voting telephone reminders will be far easier to perform with upgrades. Communication improvements will literally boost social connectedness.\r\n\r\nSocial Connectedness is a complex concept; improving social connectedness is even more challenging. This project  faces the challenge.\r\n"

  description: "This project boosts social connectedness in the San Gabriel Valley, an area of Los Angeles County trailing in linkages. Away from many economic and government power centers, the region has been semi-isolated among its own cities and regionally. Like in a body, an atrophied region is a problem for an area; this project looks to add muscle and flexibility to an underdeveloped part of the Greater Los Angeles body.\r\n\r\nThe project rapidly boosts communications capabilities for the existing Social Services program. The upgrades will greatly aid in communicating to diverse audiences and increases effectiveness through technology.  Adding PowerPoint capabilities and laptops for mobility will boost the effectiveness of project contacts.\r\n\r\nIt aims to help smooth the regional transition as more Asian-Pacific Islanders arrive along with newly arrived Latinos amid existing native and immigrant Latino populations. A faith-based organization that has begun building cross-cultural bridges can be very successful in building the connections and trust needed for dialogue and growth. With the rapidly growing Asian-Pacific population throughout Los Angeles, this component can be a model for other areas as demographics change.\r\n\r\nThe project’s expansion of the LA Voice operation in the San Gabriel Valley creates many new opportunities for connectedness and growth. Rather than being the current outlier in the LA Voice/PICO network, the San Gabriel Valley organization will function as a hub, linked together, regionally, and statewide and nationally through the PICO networks. The strengthening of local links also benefits Greater Los Angeles by yielding a more involved and aware region.\r\n\r\nThe events in the project will promote connectedness among residents, businesses, and local governments. The area has a history of disconnectedness and at times, distrust, among the different sectors. These events are designed to provide new opportunities for residents and also rebuild communication links between government, the private sector, and citizens through contact.  The Los Angeles area gains when different parts of the community are in closer contact and cooperation.\r\n\r\nTraining will allow for ongoing returns in the future. Staff development will allow for more creativity and awareness in addressing needs. Training also creates opportunities for residents, in particular youth, to learn and ideally develop into solid community leaders. The formation of national connections will also benefit the region and Los Angeles with new ideas and opportunities for additional resources.\r\n\r\nSocial connectedness is a complex process. This project sees the challenges and uses a variety of activities to create opportunities for growth in a region that has lacked cohesiveness for years. The benefits for the region will also benefit Greater Los Angeles as the area becomes more integrated and serves as a model for other underserved areas. Improving the region betters all of Los Angeles. \r\n"
  collaborators: "The project seeks to use diverse partnerships to improve its reach and effectiveness.\r\n\r\n1)\tLA Voice, established in 2000, aids congregations throughout Los Angeles in forming leaders to improve their communities. It is also a member of the national PICO network.\r\n\r\n     2)   Baldwin Park Unified School District\t already works with the program in areas such as identifying families in crisis and advancing education for youth and teens. This project would use school liaisons to make the planned activities as well-known as possible.\r\n\r\n     3)   The project will involve other congregations in the area.

  description3: "Competition for the St. John the Baptist Social Services project is not in the form of other groups or organizations. Yes, there are other groups seeking funding from the same sources and yes there are organizations looking to boost resources for their area; but, Social Services sees these others more as “friendly competitors” motivating and encouraging improvement rather than fierce rivals. The true competition for Social Services is apathy, reluctance to change, lack of knowledge, and inertia.\r\n\r\nThis project seeks to reduce apathy. The area at times has a sense of “That’s just the way things are,” regardless of “the way it is” is good or can improve.  The project’s plans to increase contacts, communications, and capabilities to give people the ability to seek and make changes in society, be it at the government level, personally, or in society. LA Voice for example helps people see they can care and affect change. Seeing higher quality presentations can motivate.\r\n\r\nThis project also seeks to counter reluctance to change. It is normal for people to feel they have their minds set and for institutions to also become set in their processes; this project seeks to encourage people and institutions to reexamine views and processes and see if there are ways to improve. For example, training can show new methods to create success. Dialogues with government can help residents express their desires more effectively. \r\n\r\nLack of knowledge is a major competitor for Social Services and this project. This project is offering educational opportunities. The higher education event is designed to help young adults and teens see how they can qualify for admission, financial aid, etc., all opportunities they often are not aware of or not fully aware of having.  LA Voice also seeks to educate leaders on how to organize, work in the community, meet different parts of society, and research needs.\r\n\r\nInertia is always a competitor. The laws of physics show “force” is needed to move a mass and it is the same with people and organizations. This plan will not use physical “force” obviously; it will use motivational and educational force. The training, improved communications, non-confrontational dialogues and meetings, and expansion of LA Voice are all planned to motivate and create the energy to counter inertia.\r\n\r\nThe Social Services Program does not see United Way, First 5 LA, or any of the many other nonprofits in Los Angeles as competitors. Each is seeking to make society better in its own way and in its own niche(s). Instead, Social Services sees this proposals countering the competition from inertia, lack of knowledge, reluctance to change and apathy in improving the San Gabriel Valley. It can be likened to taking a dulled stone and polishing and smoothing it to create a functional tool or piece of art. The dulled stone is not a competitor; it is a challenge. It may take time and effort; but, the results are incredible.\r\n\r\n"
  vision: "The San Gabriel Valley is a much more socially connected area in 2050 than the 2010s. The region maintains its distinctiveness while now also being much more linked to the rest of Greater Los Angeles. This social connectedness has made for a more involved and aware populace, more efficient and transparent government, and for greater economic opportunity.\r\n\r\nThanks to an Asian-Pacific Islander-Hispanic dialogue program that began in 2013, transitioning communities have been pleased with increased cooperation and reductions in tensions among residents.  The workshops and dialogue series has been copied throughout Los Angeles and California. Facilitators have trained new facilitators for locations throughout the valley to ensure discussions are ongoing and available as widely as possible.\r\n\r\nL.A. Voice is now well-established in the San Gabriel Valley, reaching the San Bernardino County and Orange County lines.  The presence of an interfaith umbrella organization with national and state links to PICO has boosted the influence of area congregations.  Its area activity which had been solely in Baldwin Park is now a force all along the I-10 corridor.  Previously neglected areas now have their voices heard in downtown Los Angeles and Sacramento, and within their own city government buildings. The local congregations have strongly bonded and now can address local and valley-wide issues effectively. It is a substantial change from when the San Gabriel Valley was more of an isolated outpost for citizenry and interfaith congregational involvement.\r\n\r\nThe original social connectedness project helped create a great tradition of participatory events for the community.  The events are now eagerly anticipated annual highlights and held at multiple locations throughout the area. The higher education events create many opportunities for students to learn about college as well as gain financial aid, scholarships, and career planning. The community contact sessions have greatly improved relationships between local government, businesses, congregations, and non-profits. Held at neutral sites, the sessions have opened many new lines of communications and greatly reduced distrust among the parties. The small group quarterly meetings have been replicated across the region giving participants a chance to meet others in a less formal environment. Citizenship fairs are also helping people move from legal residency to being United States citizens.\r\n\r\nTraining and staff development remains an important objective in 2050.  Greater public involvement in government and greater emphasis on intellectual property for employers meant additional learning becoming very valuable. The sharing of ideas has helped make involved people more efficient and effective. “Lifetime learning” is now more than a slogan or vague concept; it is reality.\r\n\r\nLos Angeles is improved in 2050. While there will always be room for improvement, the changes started 37 years ago yielded a better society. \r\n"

What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >+
  The San Gabriel Valley currently lacks solid social connectedness; this
  project aims to change this dynamic.






  First, the area, like much of Los Angeles is experiencing demographic changes.
  This is definitely true in the San Gabriel Valley as newly arriving Latinos
  and AsianPacific Islanders mix with existing 2nd5th Generation Latinos. This
  project seeks to alleviate some of the tensions change can bring by starting
  dialogues and workshops led by established professional facilitators. These
  dialogues seek to bring different cultures with very different experiences and
  expectations for life in the San Gabriel Valley and Los Angeles together in
  order to connect and work together, rather than exist in clusters
  individually. The idea is to use methods similar to successful “blackbrown”
  projects in Los Angeles and make them relevant to the region and its needs.
  The dialogues would be adapted for language needs. This segment will be aided
  by previous experience working with NCCJ (National Conference for Community &
  Justice). The first step in growing connectedness is to have different groups
  actually connect; this project begins those linkages.






  The second area of the project to expand social connectedness is to partner
  with LA Voice in expanding the region. Currently, LA Voice has many strong
  clusters in Los Angeles; but, it has a lone operation in the San Gabriel
  Valley (in Baldwin Park).  This project sees the formation of a regional base
  and expansion into many more congregations. 






  LA Voice’s expansion would greatly aid social connectedness. In individual
  congregations, it would create opportunities for individuals to learn how to
  gain influence and change their communities.  Regional meetings would bring
  these congregations together in actions and planning sessions, which grow area
  connectedness. LA Voice’s network across Los Angeles provides further
  opportunities for connectedness at meetings and actions.  This effect is
  further amplified with statewide conferences of the PICO Network which will
  allow San Gabriel Valley residents to develop ideas and learn from other
  Californians beyond relying on emails or news reports. 






  The third segment is the hosting of events to grow social connectedness. For
  example, preparations are underway for a higher education presentation that
  would include universities, counselors, immigration assistance, and local
  successful graduates, including a commitment from a locallyraised government
  official currently working in Washington, D.C. With ongoing budget cuts and
  cultural issues, an event held independently of school has very significant
  promise to connect a wide pool of potential candidates to resources needed to
  attend higher education. Hosting “get acquainted” meetings for local
  businesses, politicians, and leaders is designed to provide nonconfrontational
  opportunities for contact among what has been at time a contentious
  environment rather than confrontational or negotiating situations. The project
  also sees quarterly men’s and women’s contact group meetings to discuss issues
  they feel are pertinent. Citizenship events are another key component. These
  events help residents move from residency through the application process and
  examinations to full Unietd States citizenship. The citizenship steps also
  introduce people to “the system” and strongly encourage voting and voter
  awareness of issues. These events ranging from higher education awareness to
  more regular contact sessions and promote new linkages for the area.

  make presentations, events, and communications more effective. The training
  will include making sue of technology to improve presentations. Staff
  development will also help the program deal with the community changes already
  discussed. The project also plans to send teens to leadership development
  training. In this area youth leadership is often not fully nourished; the goal
  of the training is to have youth involved and to prepare them for greater
  success.






  The fifth area to improve social connectedness is capability upgrades through
  technology and equipment. Currently, the Social Services program relies on
  “low tech” communications. This project sees program gaining a major boost in
  longterm capability to connect with society through laptop computers, a
  scanner, PowerPoint projectors, significantly upgraded telephones to allow for
  more efficient phone banks, and data transfer equipment. The equipment
  upgrades will make communications more effective. For example, a bilingual
  PowerPoint presentation in AsianPacific IslanderHispanic dialogues will now be
  possible. Likewise, nonpartisan voting telephone reminders will be far easier
  to perform with upgrades. Communication improvements will literally boost
  social connectedness.






  Social Connectedness is a complex concept; improving social connectedness is
  even more challenging. This project  faces the challenge.


What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >+
  St. John the Baptist Social Service has a long history of involvement in the
  community, aiding those in need. The program has been meeting the many
  economic, physical, and societal needs of the community and successfully
  adjusting to changes in the area since 194.






  In the past few years, the program has also sought to increase linkages
  between different parts of society. Baldwin Park and surrounding cities have
  had some issues with having government, business, organizations, and the
  population working together such as with redevelopment issues. 






  An example is the start of the Cesar Chavez Interfaith Breakfast, which for
  the first time brought together community leaders, business owners, labor
  leaders, clergy from several denominations, public sector employees, and
  politicians together in a nonformal gathering. The event allows people to meet
  others while also hearing different perspectives, such as a rabbi who worked
  with Cesar Chavez to a local graduate who has become principal of one of the
  city’s high schools.  Attendees leave with new contacts and possibilities.






  There has been great success in having community voices heard with more
  influence at city hall. After a fatal traffic accident, the program teamed
  with LA Voice and other congregations to seek a solution to an ongoing
  danger.  This combined campaign led to a rapid decision by the city to install
  a new traffic light, which is now in service. The campaign prompted local
  officials to act far faster than normal.






  An ongoing success has been getting community members much more involved in
  local issues. An example is the city’s study of whether to retain the local
  police department or contract with the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department. Now,
  community members are attending hearings, giving their opinions and staying
  informed of events in the debate. In previous years this process would largely
  have been ignored by the public and not been influenced by their views. The
  local officials now know their decisions are being monitored. Creating public
  accountability is a major gain for this area.






  A significant achievement has been making connections to more effectively
  serve those in need, something that before was more provincial. The Social
  Services program has adjusted the annual Thanksgiving food drive to partner
  with the school district and their family liaison officers to identify people
  in need. This has led to a much better evaluation of the needs of the
  community and reduced fraud. Now, verified families in need have Thanksgiving
  food boxes delivered to their homes. This partnership is helping both parties
  ensure aid is effective to maximize results. 






  The Social Services program has been developing greater and deeper linkages in
  the community to provide better delivery of resources. This project will take
  this process even further to yield wonderful dividends. The foundation of
  social connectedness has been established; now, the program looks to grow the
  structure.


Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: "The project seeks to use diverse partnerships to improve its reach and effectiveness.\n\n\n\n\n\n1)\tLA Voice, established in 2000, aids congregations throughout Los Angeles in forming leaders to improve their communities.

Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >+
  This project is not solely a project where simple headcounts or signatures on
  a page are the signs of success; this project will be accountable beyond
  statistics.






  Some successes will be easy to measure. Were the proposed additional equipment
  purchased? A “Yes” means the project has successfully increased capacity
  significantly for communication. Here a “headcount” for PowerPoint projectors
  is obviously an easy task. Likewise, telephone upgrades are easily
  quantifiable to see that capacity has increased for phone banks and similar
  events. Laptops again are quantifiable and quickly add mobility and capacity
  to communication. A scanner is quantifiable and will boost connectedness by
  adding electronic capabilities to presentations and communications.






  In less quantifiable area, the results will still exist and be more oriented
  towards “people power” and “soft power.”  The effects though will be profound.






  + Success for AsianPacific IslanderHispanic dialogue will be measured in
  creating a sustainable series in the region. Establishing the foundation for
  this dialogue will be the first success, especially as it will be novel in the
  area. 



  + Second, holding the events and workshops will be quantifiable. The results
  are less numeric and more longterm; but, attendance should create grounds for
  success and improve the region as demographics change.



  +Third, seeing results for the expansion of the LA Voice presence will be
  ongoing. The project sees LA Voice growing from one congregation in the San
  Gabriel Valley to a substantial presence across the region and in a range of
  faiths. Success sees local organizing committees being established and active,
  connecting people in new ways and increasing their ability to promote change
  in their communities. 



  + Fourth, the events part of the project again will yield less quantifiable
  results. These planned events will result in greater connectedness among
  disparate parts of society: youth, adults, nonprofits, business, government
  and congregations. Success in this segment will see less animosity, greater
  trust, and greater awareness of opportunities for individual growth as well as
  partnerships. Currently, there is a significant amount of animosity among many
  of the groups that is affecting areas such as employment and education.






  Training will be a success with staff and others gaining capabilities and
  expanding knowledge bases. Learning of new “best practices” can boost even the
  most best operation. In addition, training can help in evaluating existing
  projects and looking at future projects for improvement and/or implementation.






  In all these segments, there will also be evaluation by users. The project
  sees constant feedback from those involved. For example, attendees at dialogue
  workshops will be asked for their opinions of the event and for suggestions.
  Success will be taking the existing regional “human capital” and growing and
  improving it to make a huge asset for the future.


How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
  This project boosts social connectedness in the San Gabriel Valley, an area of
  Los Angeles County trailing in linkages. Away from many economic and
  government power centers, the region has been semiisolated among its own
  cities and regionally. Like in a body, an atrophied region is a problem for an
  area; this project looks to add muscle and flexibility to an underdeveloped
  part of the Greater Los Angeles body.






  The project rapidly boosts communications capabilities for the existing Social
  Services program. The upgrades will greatly aid in communicating to diverse
  audiences and increases effectiveness through technology.  Adding PowerPoint
  capabilities and laptops for mobility will boost the effectiveness of project
  contacts.






  It aims to help smooth the regional transition as more AsianPacific Islanders
  arrive along with newly arrived Latinos amid existing native and immigrant
  Latino populations. A faithbased organization that has begun building
  crosscultural bridges can be very successful in building the connections and
  trust needed for dialogue and growth. With the rapidly growing AsianPacific
  population throughout Los Angeles, this component can be a model for other
  areas as demographics change.






  The project’s expansion of the LA Voice operation in the San Gabriel Valley
  creates many new opportunities for connectedness and growth. Rather than being
  the current outlier in the LA Voice/PICO network, the San Gabriel Valley
  organization will function as a hub, linked together, regionally, and
  statewide and nationally through the PICO networks. The strengthening of local
  links also benefits Greater Los Angeles by yielding a more involved and aware
  region.






  The events in the project will promote connectedness among residents,
  businesses, and local governments. The area has a history of disconnectedness
  and at times, distrust, among the different sectors. These events are designed
  to provide new opportunities for residents and also rebuild communication
  links between government, the private sector, and citizens through contact. 
  The Los Angeles area gains when different parts of the community are in closer
  contact and cooperation.






  Training will allow for ongoing returns in the future. Staff development will
  allow for more creativity and awareness in addressing needs. Training also
  creates opportunities for residents, in particular youth, to learn and ideally
  develop into solid community leaders. The formation of national connections
  will also benefit the region and Los Angeles with new ideas and opportunities
  for additional resources.






  Social connectedness is a complex process. This project sees the challenges
  and uses a variety of activities to create opportunities for growth in a
  region that has lacked cohesiveness for years. The benefits for the region
  will also benefit Greater Los Angeles as the area becomes more integrated and
  serves as a model for other underserved areas. Improving the region betters
  all of Los Angeles. 


What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >+
  The San Gabriel Valley is a much more socially connected area in 2050 than the
  2010s. The region maintains its distinctiveness while now also being much more
  linked to the rest of Greater Los Angeles. This social connectedness has made
  for a more involved and aware populace, more efficient and transparent
  government, and for greater economic opportunity.






  Thanks to an AsianPacific IslanderHispanic dialogue program that began in
  2013, transitioning communities have been pleased with increased cooperation
  and reductions in tensions among residents.  The workshops and dialogue series
  has been copied throughout Los Angeles and California. Facilitators have
  trained new facilitators for locations throughout the valley to ensure
  discussions are ongoing and available as widely as possible.






  L.A. Voice is now wellestablished in the San Gabriel Valley, reaching the San
  Bernardino County and Orange County lines.  The presence of an interfaith
  umbrella organization with national and state links to PICO has boosted the
  influence of area congregations.  Its area activity which had been solely in
  Baldwin Park is now a force all along the I10 corridor.  Previously neglected
  areas now have their voices heard in downtown Los Angeles and Sacramento, and
  within their own city government buildings. The local congregations have
  strongly bonded and now can address local and valleywide issues effectively.
  It is a substantial change from when the San Gabriel Valley was more of an
  isolated outpost for citizenry and interfaith congregational involvement.






  The original social connectedness project helped create a great tradition of
  participatory events for the community.  The events are now eagerly
  anticipated annual highlights and held at multiple locations throughout the
  area. The higher education events create many opportunities for students to
  learn about college as well as gain financial aid, scholarships, and career
  planning. The community contact sessions have greatly improved relationships
  between local government, businesses, congregations, and nonprofits. Held at
  neutral sites, the sessions have opened many new lines of communications and
  greatly reduced distrust among the parties. The small group quarterly meetings
  have been replicated across the region giving participants a chance to meet
  others in a less formal environment. Citizenship fairs are also helping people
  move from legal residency to being United States citizens.






  Training and staff development remains an important objective in 2050. 
  Greater public involvement in government and greater emphasis on intellectual
  property for employers meant additional learning becoming very valuable. The
  sharing of ideas has helped make involved people more efficient and effective.
  “Lifetime learning” is now more than a slogan or vague concept; it is reality.






  Los Angeles is improved in 2050. While there will always be room for
  improvement, the changes started 37 years ago yielded a better society.
