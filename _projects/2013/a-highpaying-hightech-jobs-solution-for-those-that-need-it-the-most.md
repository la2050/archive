title: A HighPaying HighTech Jobs Solution For Those That Need It The MOST
indicator: ' Income & Employment'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  Sabio will train unemployed, underemployed and underrepresented individuals
  from LA, via an accelerated learning program, to enter the technology sector
  so that they can participate in today's hightech economy. We will utilize an
  immersive boot camp environment to create a workforce that sets the standard
  for entry level technologists. Sabio’s training program will simultaneously
  serve to cure the current imbalance in the existing technology workforce,
  which suffers from a largely homogeneous make up. 



  This training can be completed in as little as 3 months. Other areas of the
  country are having great success in producing employable talent in this same
  time. With Sabio, LA can have a program of its own.



  Just 7 years from now there will be 1 Million technology jobs that will go
  unfilled because we do not have a properly trained workforce. This represents
  $500 Billion in wages that Sabio will bring to LA by training Los Angelinos to
  fill these jobs. The Bay Area Council Economic Institute’s Local Jobs
  Multiplier indicates that for every 1 hightech job created 4.3 other jobs are
  created. Therefore, developing and strengthening the area’s hightech sector
  will have a significant impact in the local economy by promoting growth.



  However, we do not have to wait 7 years to start taking advantage of the
  lucrative salaries in the hightech sector. In fact, we do not even have wait
  the years it takes colleges and universities to produce this talent. Sabio
  graduates can fill the many currently available positions.



  Sabio’s training staff will be seasoned professionals currently exercising
  their programming skills. More specifically, they will also have a proven
  history of successfully mentoring entry level programmers. 



  Our training will be conducted in a format that is best described as a
  “bootcamp.” This format will approximate the intensive nature of a startup and
  prepare our trainees for the most rigorous environments. Our official training
  hours will be conducted 5 days a week and over the course of three to four
  months.



  Another key differentiating aspect of the Sabio program is its immersive
  environment. Our training facility will be colocated with other hightech
  startups. Throughout the training program the trainees will be deliberately
  exposed to real world professionals, allowing them to build their network of
  contacts and be uniquely prepared to enter the tech workforce.



  By training unemployed, underemployed, and underrepresented individuals that
  live in LA, Sabio directly impacts all the metrics noted in the LA2050 Report
  for employment and income.  Many careers in technology have starting salaries
  that are higher than the median income for individuals. This is more
  pronounced when comparing the median incomes of Latinos and African Americans.
  In these cases, an entry level tech salary can match that of an entire
  household of said group.



  These salaries allow one working adult to earn approximately 164% of the
  income need to live comfortably in a household of one. This one adult will
  also be able to support a family of four within 23 years of completing the
  Sabio training program. This is possible because of the unique advancement
  opportunities in the hightech sector that place Sabio trainees on a path to
  earn $100,000 a year within 5 years of completing the program.



  Another aspect of the hightech sector that is important to consider is its
  extremely low unemployment rate. Varying reports indicate that the
  unemployment rate for the hightech sector is between 2% and 4%, which is
  approximately half the national unemployment rate, and 33% of LA County’s.
  Building an economy whose job base is concentrated in a sector with low
  unemployment naturally brings the overall unemployment rate down.



  The nature of the services we will provide will directly decrease the
  unemployment and underemployment rates in LA. Our strong focus on the bottom
  quintile of the wealth distribution graph will have a great impact in the area
  as we will be serving to raise the lowest end of the spectrum. Sabio graduates
  will enter the high skilled workforce, move off the unemployment rolls and
  secure an economically advantageous career.



  Furthermore, a survey from the Kauffman Foundation found that Latinos and
  African Americans are highly inclined to start new businesses at a rate of 64%
  and 63% respectively. Therefore, in empowering our trainees with the technical
  skills necessary to build and execute on their ideas, we will actually be
  complimenting their already established desires to start new businesses. 



  The technical training that will be provided by Sabio will allow Latinos,
  African Americans and women to overcome some of the existing barriers that
  they face in starting a new business. Facilitating their success in building
  their own businesses will create a synergistic and positive cyclical affect in
  creating more technology based, minority owned and minority driven companies
  that create more high quality jobs in LA
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  <p>Sabio is a brand new organization and has therefore had little opportunity
  to record many achievements. However, our most noteworthy achievement is that
  we have already received inquiries from potential candidates for our bootcamp,
  including actual signups. This has been accomplished through simple messaging
  on Twitter and with no marketing spend.</p>



  <p>In addition, we are happy to report that we have attracted attention from a
  number of key contacts not only in Los Angeles, but also Silicon Valley and
  other technology hubs. This includes some high level government agencies.</p>



  <p>We have also organized an initial board under our California entity made up
  of the following individuals: </p>



  <p>Christian Sanz: CTO and Founder of geekli.st</p>



  <p>Jesse Saucedo: Project Coordinator, Los Angeles Housing Departments</p>



  <p>Chantelle Silveira CoFounder of Stealth Startup</p>
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >+
  The following partners have indicated that they are willing to interview our
  trainees should they have a need for entry level developers:



  Crowd Smart — Santa Monica



  Security Frameworks — Marina Del Rey



  Putnam Recruiting Group — El Segundo



  Marsko — Palos Verdes



  Stealth Startup  Chantelle Silveira, CoFounder



  In addition, we have a number of local tech community members identified that
  we will reach out to for mentorship.   We have also secured speakers to
  discuss specific topics that relate to tech startups, such as securing venture
  capital, product development, design, quality assurance, and interview
  preparation.


Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >+
  The nature of our project lends itself to a set of simple success metrics.



  1) The number of trainees completing our training program: This number will
  tell us how well our selection and screening process is progressing.



  2) The number of trainees receiving offers of employment from companies in the
  tech industry: This number will reflect the quality of our training.



  3) The ability of our trainees to retain employment in the tech industry: This
  will reflect the quality of our training as well as our postgraduation
  mentorship.



  We are expecting to graduate approximately 90% of the people accepted into the
  program with 80% of original trainees receiving offers of employment.



  At a more detailed and micro level we will:



  1)Gather feedback from our trainees at least every week



  2)Gauge trainee performance at project milestones to ensure they are actually
  learning the subject material 


How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
  Highlights: 



  Decrease the poverty rate by having more of our citizens not only employed but
  also employed in high paying careers



  Decrease the unemployment & underemployment rate in LA by training the current
  population to fill existing jobs



  Increase the number of companies & investors that choose LA as the home for
  their business



  Increase the number of new tech jobs



  Increase the median household income



  Wealth distribution is significantly more balanced across households



  Wealth distribution & median income increases leads to more revenue & business
  for other sectors of the economy



  More tax dollars are collected



  Each high tech jobs creates up to 4 other accompanying jobs



  The lines that defined the bifurcated economic system that exists in LA are
  reduced and diminished



  Currently, the greater LA metro area is striving to become the next Silicon
  Valley. In doing so, it is creating a large demand for high skilled technology
  workers. This makes it a critical period for the technology industry in LA.
  This industry cannot thrive unless there is an ample supply of qualified
  technical talent.  Failure to support this industry will not only have a
  negative result on the number of tech jobs available in the area but also the
  number of companies that look to staff their tech departments in LA.



  As things stand, a variety of tech based positions will go unfilled in the
  coming years due to the current shortage of qualified workers. This shortage
  is only expected to get worse.



  A large STEM effort has been unleashed in the K12 class rooms, including
  community colleges and four year universities. However, technology companies
  need trained technical staff today, not 4 to 12 years from now.  Sabio will
  meet these demands by training individuals from LA to become entry level web
  programmers within 4 months.



  This approach is practical and feasible and currently in place in other
  regions of the US. The benefits to the city and area are numerous. Providing a
  healthy pool of technical candidates for companies will encourage them to stay
  & at the same time incentivize entrepreneurs and capital, of many different
  sources, to start their new companies here.



  Five years after graduating our target trainees are expected to be earning
  ~$100K/yr and contributing ~$58K/yr more into local economy and paying ~250%
  more taxes than in their previous career. Multiplying this number by 45, the
  number of estimated trainees in year 1, we can estimate that Sabio trainees
  will contribute close to $2.6M to the local economy.  



  Finally, the Local Jobs Multiplier chart, produced by the BACEI, captures a
  measure of the impact any one job has on the local economy by means of
  supporting other local job creation. High tech jobs have been found to create
  jobs at a rate of 4.3, meaning that any 1 high tech job will create 4.3 other
  jobs. Referencing this multiplier we can estimate that Sabio will help fill 45
  jobs and create, indirectly, 193 other jobs yearly.


What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  <p>In the year 2050, the economic impact of the high technology sector of Los
  Angeles dwindles that of the entertainment industry.  Los Angeles is now the
  new center of technology in the United States. It is not only the home of the
  largest concentration of technologist, it is also the most diverse and
  therefore most innovative. </p>



  <p>Outside business and Venture Capital consider Los Angeles first when
  starting new endeavors. Meanwhile, a strong entrepreneurial culture pervades
  the region. The largely Latino and African American population is empowered
  with the technical skills needed to start and build their small
  businesses.</p>



  <p>After nearly 40 years of stressing technology literacy, Los Angeles now
  attracts the most talented individuals to the region. The migration of talent,
  young and old, out of Los Angeles, is a memory. This serves to further
  solidify our future economic standing in the nation.  </p>



  Our continued focus on maintaining a welltrained and diverse hightech
  workforce has erased most of the bifurcations that existed along ethnic or
  racial boundaries.  The hightech workforce now strongly mirrors the area’s
  demographics.  The large number of technology jobs has also spurred a growth
  in supporting sectors, which serve to provide significant employment
  opportunities for the rest of the population.



  <p>This wealth of jobs across all sectors balances wealth distribution and
  raises the standard of living across the board. This is reflected in the
  lowest unemployment and poverty rates in the nation.</p>

  budget explanation: "Sabio’s primary goal is to deliver top quality training and produce an entry level candidate that sets a new standard for entry level software developers. To meet this goal our training will be conducted by highly experienced and seasoned senior level software developers. In addition, our trainee to trainer ratio is very low: five to one. We recognize that this may be aggressively low, but we would rather err on this side and produce top quality candidates than to fall short of our goals. This is without a doubt the variable that we will look to optimize as much as possible as we grow. Being able to increase this number will allow us to both optimize our revenue but also minimize the cost of the program. \r\nThe next largest cost in our project are legal fees. This budget will allow us to draft contracts with the trainees primarily, and help formalize our legal documents.\r\nReal estate leasing costs are unfortunately high since we cannot commit to long lease terms. Co-working spaces at least provide all inclusive fees and already provide all the services we would need. We have opted for this type of office space as it will give our trainees access to active tech entrepreneurs.\r\nWhen considering the cost of these facilities one must consider the nature of the training. The training will be all day sessions that run at least 5 days per week. Running our program at a higher training capacity would allow us to improve our real estate leasing fees and at the same time benefit from some simple economies of scale that would make this line item significantly smaller.\r\nOffice furniture (tables, chairs etc...) and notebook computers are provided for 1 trainer and 5 trainees. These computers will be able to be re-used for a number of “semesters” which will reduce future costs. We are making rooms for this capital expenditure because we are purposefully targeting people who may not have had the resources to purchase a computer, never mind a new computer required for software development.\r\nOther office furniture and equipment include white boards and at 1 projector from which to conduct presentations.\r\nThe award amount will allow us to run a small version of our bootcamp which includes 5 trainees. Our year one plan had accounted for a class size of 15 but with 3 full time senior training staff.\r\nLine Item Name\t\tUnit Count\tMonthly Amount\tTotal Cost \r\nTechnical Trainer\t5\t\t$11,000 \t\t$55,000 \r\nOffice Lease\t\t4\t\t$4,500\t\t\t$18,000 \r\nOffice Furniture\t\t\t\t$4,000\t\t\t$4,000 \r\nComputers\t\t6\t\t$1,500\t\t\t$9,000 \r\nOffice Equipment\t\t\t$2,000\t\t\t$2,000 \r\nLegal\t\t\t\t\t$10,500 \t\t$10,500 \r\nMisc\t\t\t\t\t$1,500 \t\t\t$1,500\r\n"

  description3: "There are approximately a dozen bootcamp development organizations throughout the country; however, none are currently operating in Los Angeles. The cost of the programs that most closely approximate the proposed Sabio format cost approximately $10,000 to $20,000 and are located in San Francisco, Denver and Chicago. These programs are run under a for-profit model and seem to make little efforts to make themselves accessible to those that cannot afford these high costs. Most of the scholarship dollars we have seen have come from third party sponsors.\r\nOther programs that offer a less intensive training with more of a traditional class-like structure currently offer technical services ranging from the high hundreds of dollars to $5,000. \r\nThese high costs are very similar to the current for profit institutions of higher learning and vocational training institutions. However, none of the current “bootcamp” programs have established themselves in formal or accredited manner that would allow for applicants to benefit from existing federal and state grants or loan programs. With no established financing options available, the average individual would be reliant on personal resources to cover the cost of the training programs. Consequentially, the newer training programs are not accessible to Sabio’s targeted trainees: the unemployed, underemployed and underrepresented.\r\nOur currently planned student to teacher ratio of 5-1 is also a significant differentiating characteristic of our program. Other programs’ ratios are much higher ranging from 15/25-1. In addition, some rely on local volunteers to provide extra mentorship and training to compliment the formal training provided by staff. While, we believe in the mentorship programs we will provide it as a supplementary component to our staff led training.\r\nAnother key differentiating aspect of the Sabio program is its immersive environment. Our training facility will be co-located with other high tech startups. Throughout the training program the trainees will be deliberately exposed to real world professionals allowing them to build their network of contacts and be uniquely prepared to enter the tech workforce.\r\nIn summary we differ from our competitors in the following way:\r\nOur ability to impact the underserved communities is factored into our success metrics\r\nWe make our program accessible to those that cannot pay the high, upfront costs\r\nWe have a “pay for success” model that only 2 other programs have, which are not located in LA (we will not collect fees until the trainees are extended job offers)\r\nOur current relationship with these competitors is very informal. Since we believe this type of training is so important we often recommend people visit these other sites so that they can educate themselves about the options available to them. We outline many options on our own site, Sabio.la.\r\n"

Building an economy whose job base is concentrated in a sector with low unemployment naturally brings the overall unemployment rate down.\r\nThe nature of the services we will provide will directly decrease the unemployment and underemployment rates in LA. Our strong focus on the bottom quintile of the wealth distribution graph will have a great impact in the area as we will be serving to raise the lowest end of the spectrum. Sabio graduates will enter the high skilled workforce, move off the unemployment rolls and secure an economically advantageous career.\r\nFurthermore, a survey from the Kauffman Foundation found that Latinos and African Americans are highly inclined to start new businesses at a rate of 64% and 63% respectively. Therefore, in empowering our trainees with the technical skills necessary to build and execute on their ideas, we will actually be complimenting their already established desires to start new businesses. \r\nThe technical training that will be provided by Sabio will allow Latinos, African Americans and women to overcome some of the existing barriers that they face in starting a new business. Facilitating their success in building their own businesses will create a synergistic and positive cyclical affect in creating more technology based, minority owned and minority driven companies that create more high quality jobs in LA"

    answer: "Sabio’s primary goal is to deliver top quality training and produce an entry level candidate that sets a new standard for entry level software developers. To meet this goal our training will be conducted by highly experienced and seasoned senior level software developers. In addition, our trainee to trainer ratio is very low: five to one. We recognize that this may be aggressively low, but we would rather err on this side and produce top quality candidates than to fall short of our goals. This is without a doubt the variable that we will look to optimize as much as possible as we grow. Being able to increase this number will allow us to both optimize our revenue but also minimize the cost of the program. \r\nThe next largest cost in our project are legal fees. This budget will allow us to draft contracts with the trainees primarily, and help formalize our legal documents.\r\nReal estate leasing costs are unfortunately high since we cannot commit to long lease terms. Co-working spaces at least provide all inclusive fees and already provide all the services we would need. We have opted for this type of office space as it will give our trainees access to active tech entrepreneurs.\r\nWhen considering the cost of these facilities one must consider the nature of the training. The training will be all day sessions that run at least 5 days per week. Running our program at a higher training capacity would allow us to improve our real estate leasing fees and at the same time benefit from some simple economies of scale that would make this line item significantly smaller.\r\nOffice furniture (tables, chairs etc...) and notebook computers are provided for 1 trainer and 5 trainees. These computers will be able to be re-used for a number of “semesters” which will reduce future costs. We are making rooms for this capital expenditure because we are purposefully targeting people who may not have had the resources to purchase a computer, never mind a new computer required for software development.\r\nOther office furniture and equipment include white boards and at 1 projector from which to conduct presentations.\r\nThe award amount will allow us to run a small version of our bootcamp which includes 5 trainees. Our year one plan had accounted for a class size of 15 but with 3 full time senior training staff.\r\nLine Item Name\t\tUnit Count\tMonthly Amount\tTotal Cost \r\nTechnical Trainer\t5\t\t$11,000 \t\t$55,000 \r\nOffice Lease\t\t4\t\t$4,500\t\t\t$18,000 \r\nOffice Furniture\t\t\t\t$4,000\t\t\t$4,000 \r\nComputers\t\t6\t\t$1,500\t\t\t$9,000 \r\nOffice Equipment\t\t\t$2,000\t\t\t$2,000 \r\nLegal\t\t\t\t\t$10,500 \t\t$10,500 \r\nMisc\t\t\t\t\t$1,500 \t\t\t$1,500\r\n"

    answer: "Highlights: \r\nDecrease the poverty rate by having more of our citizens not only employed but also employed in high paying careers\r\nDecrease the unemployment & underemployment rate in LA by training the current population to fill existing jobs\r\nIncrease the number of companies & investors that choose LA as the home for their business\r\nIncrease the number of new tech jobs\r\nIncrease the median household income\r\nWealth distribution is significantly more balanced across households\r\nWealth distribution & median income increases leads to more revenue & business for other sectors of the economy\r\nMore tax dollars are collected\r\nEach high tech jobs creates up to 4 other accompanying jobs\r\nThe lines that defined the bifurcated economic system that exists in LA are reduced and diminished\r\nCurrently, the greater LA metro area is striving to become the next Silicon Valley. In doing so, it is creating a large demand for high skilled technology workers. This makes it a critical period for the technology industry in LA. This industry cannot thrive unless there is an ample supply of qualified technical talent.  Failure to support this industry will not only have a negative result on the number of tech jobs available in the area but also the number of companies that look to staff their tech departments in LA.\r\nAs things stand, a variety of tech based positions will go unfilled in the coming years due to the current shortage of qualified workers. This shortage is only expected to get worse.\r\nA large STEM effort has been unleashed in the K-12 class rooms, including community colleges and four year universities. However, technology companies need trained technical staff today, not 4 to 12 years from now.  Sabio will meet these demands by training individuals from LA to become entry level web programmers within 4 months.\r\nThis approach is practical and feasible and currently in place in other regions of the US. The benefits to the city and area are numerous. Providing a healthy pool of technical candidates for companies will encourage them to stay & at the same time incentivize entrepreneurs and capital, of many different sources, to start their new companies here.\r\nFive years after graduating our target trainees are expected to be earning ~$100K/yr and contributing ~$58K/yr more into local economy and paying ~250% more taxes than in their previous career. Multiplying this number by 45, the number of estimated trainees in year 1, we can estimate that Sabio trainees will contribute close to $2.6M to the local economy.  \r\nFinally, the Local Jobs Multiplier chart, produced by the BACEI, captures a measure of the impact any one job has on the local economy by means of supporting other local job creation. High tech jobs have been found to create jobs at a rate of 4.3, meaning that any 1 high tech job will create 4.3 other jobs. Referencing this multiplier we can estimate that Sabio will help fill 45 jobs and create, indirectly, 193 other jobs yearly.\r\n"

    answer: "There are approximately a dozen bootcamp development organizations throughout the country; however, none are currently operating in Los Angeles. The cost of the programs that most closely approximate the proposed Sabio format cost approximately $10,000 to $20,000 and are located in San Francisco, Denver and Chicago. These programs are run under a for-profit model and seem to make little efforts to make themselves accessible to those that cannot afford these high costs. Most of the scholarship dollars we have seen have come from third party sponsors.\r\nOther programs that offer a less intensive training with more of a traditional class-like structure currently offer technical services ranging from the high hundreds of dollars to $5,000. \r\nThese high costs are very similar to the current for profit institutions of higher learning and vocational training institutions. However, none of the current “bootcamp” programs have established themselves in formal or accredited manner that would allow for applicants to benefit from existing federal and state grants or loan programs. With no established financing options available, the average individual would be reliant on personal resources to cover the cost of the training programs. Consequentially, the newer training programs are not accessible to Sabio’s targeted trainees: the unemployed, underemployed and underrepresented.\r\nOur currently planned student to teacher ratio of 5-1 is also a significant differentiating characteristic of our program. Other programs’ ratios are much higher ranging from 15/25-1. In addition, some rely on local volunteers to provide extra mentorship and training to compliment the formal training provided by staff. While, we believe in the mentorship programs we will provide it as a supplementary component to our staff led training.\r\nAnother key differentiating aspect of the Sabio program is its immersive environment. Our training facility will be co-located with other high tech startups. Throughout the training program the trainees will be deliberately exposed to real world professionals allowing them to build their network of contacts and be uniquely prepared to enter the tech workforce.\r\nIn summary we differ from our competitors in the following way:\r\nOur ability to impact the underserved communities is factored into our success metrics\r\nWe make our program accessible to those that cannot pay the high, upfront costs\r\nWe have a “pay for success” model that only 2 other programs have, which are not located in LA (we will not collect fees until the trainees are extended job offers)\r\nOur current relationship with these competitors is very informal. Since we believe this type of training is so important we often recommend people visit these other sites so that they can educate themselves about the options available to them. We outline many options on our own site, Sabio.la.\r\n"
