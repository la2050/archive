title: Central Educational Network Based On The Apprenticeship Model
indicator: ' Education'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  <p>At the Los Angeles Makerspace we are built on the premise of connected
  learning and the need to reimagine learning. An important part of the learning
  process involves both mentorship and social support in order to guide people
  towards knowledge and expertise. Research has shown repeatedly that when
  people have more access to expert peers, mentors, and coaches, learning is
  much more effective and resilient. Additionally, teaching and helping others
  can be one of the best ways to learn more too, independent of one’s current
  level of expertise.</p>









  <p>Our idea is to extend LA Makerspace from a weekend tinkering space to a
  central educational network based on the apprenticeship model with weekday
  afterschool programs. We want to develop our space into a rich environment
  where students can create peer mentoring groups and have access to experts in
  the community to establish mentoring relationships through projectbased
  learning.</p>









  <p>In the spirit of sharing with everyone in LA and beyond, we will be sharing
  our learning practices and curriculum licensed under Creative Commons CC BYSA
  hosted on P2PU.org, an online educational platform and community. Our goal is
  to provide passionate learners, both those traditionally designated as
  teachers and students, with civicallyengaged projectbased learning
  opportunities tied to STEAM subjects. The P2PU platform gives anyone in the
  world an opportunity to learn about topics they might not otherwise have
  access to, connect with others who share the same interests both online in the
  P2PU class, and create their own communities around a project. In addition, we
  are linking STEAMrelated learning to citizen action by enabling people to
  mobilize science and engineering to make an impact in their neighborhood and
  around the world. Learning from the ground up from the basics of how to
  construct electronics to how to calibrate gathered data to how to test
  theories and develop other models. The opportunities presented are for these
  learners to connect with the research and advocacy communities around Los
  Angeles and beyond, learning how to both be scientifically literate and apply
  science, technology, engineering, art and mathematics in a meaningful way.</p>









  <p>Our idea will impact the Education Indicator through higher test scores
  from our participating students, a more diverse population joining STEAM
  majors, an increased percentage of college graduates, highly competent
  citizens ready to compete with a highlyeducated workforce and a really
  passionate and fun community to be.</p>
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >+
  <p>We are incredibly proud of the achievements our organization has made in
  the past year. We could not have done it without a passionate board of
  directors (4 women, 3 men) and an extremely supportive community. </p>









  <p>In less than one year we have opened a space in downtown LA, hired two
  staff members and programmed more than 40 successful events and workshops
  including programming, design, citizen science, film, woodworking and food
  science hacking.</p>









  <p>We have had a lot of support and attention localling in Los Angeles and
  nationally. The White House  Office of Science and Technology Policy wrote
  about our incredible efforts:
  http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/12/12/makingmakerslosangeles</p>









  <p>We ran a successful Kickstarter campaign and reached our goal in the first
  30 hours, proving that there is demand and interest in the maker movement and
  projectbased learning.</p>









  <p>We have developed and have begun running a student research program whereby
  students are mentored in the development of their own research projects as
  well as getting them involved with current research projects.  Our current
  partners are the environmental monitoring group Safecast, the American Physics
  Society, the West Side Science Club, the Natural History Museum of Los
  Angeles, University of Southern California, and the California Institute of
  Technology.</p>

Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >+
  <p>The ultimate goal for LA Makerspace is to connect students to the larger
  world of research, design, and development.  In the process providing the
  academic and professional support needed for a meaningful connection between
  students and research partners.  To this end LA Makerspace seeks to accomplish
  three goals:</p>









  <p>LA Makerspace seeks to improve students’ abilities in the STEAM (Science,
  Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) fields as measured by
  traditional metrics such as an increase in the participating schools’ average
  California Standards Test scores in math and science, as well as a
  corresponding increase in math and science scores for Advanced Placement
  exams. </p>









  <p>We seek to increase student interest in STEAM fields, particularly from
  traditionally underrepresented populations, as evidenced by an increase in the
  percentage of students from participating schools choosing to major in such
  fields after graduation from high school. </p> 









  <p>LA Makerspace seeks to strengthen the academic and professional skills
  needed to succeed in college, particularly within a STEAM major, as evidenced
  by an increase in the percentage of students from participating schools who
  graduate from college with a STEAM major.</p>


How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  The LA Makerspace is committed to fostering innovation and embracing
  community. We chose Downtown LA / South LA as our neighborhood as it is
  conveniently within reach of public transportation, providing ready access to
  a variety of neighborhoods independent of their socioeconomic status.









  LA Makerspace provides shared physical resources otherwise unaffordable or
  attainable by an individual or family. It provides a fluid workspace in order
  to facilitate the collaboration, inspiration and encouragement of others. The
  maker movement, as it pertains to education, seeks to build the confidence,
  analytic skills, and creativity of those involved by establishing an
  environment centered on the creative act. This collaborative and projectbased
  approach to learning runs counter to the current trend in education of
  defining academic success in terms of standardized tests, especially at the
  cost of handson programs such as shop, art, and laboratory science. It is a
  place to learn about engineering, design, and research through both organized
  classes as well as openended projects.









  As an educational endeavor LA Makerspace provides a community meeting point
  for projects ranging from robotics to filmmaking, as well as a shared lab
  space for community members to develop their own projects and work with
  partnered research institutions within our citizen science program.  This
  community of practice also includes the running of teacher workshops whereby
  current educators meet, with students and professionals, to design and test
  various projects to run in and outside the traditional classroom.









  LA Makerspace bridges the gap between academia and the communityatlarge by
  establishing a peertopeer mentorship network and giving members the chance to
  apprentice into a whole variety of fields ranging from industrial design to
  data analysis. The ultimate goal for LA Makerspace is to foster productive
  community members.
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  <p>Ultimately success would be LAUSD incorporating our methods and practices
  directly into their schools because they recognized that we have successfully
  met our key performance indicators of higher test scores from our
  participating students, a more diverse population joining STEAM majors, an
  increased percentage of college graduates and highly competent citizens ready
  to compete with a highlyeducated workforce.</p>









  <p>Through our mentorship network and community of researchers, designers, and
  other professionals we will also develop Los Angeles’ reputation as an
  innovation center in fields beyond entertainment through the crosspollination
  of various fields.  Research institutions in Los Angeles will improve the
  practice of education through the establishment of apprenticeship programs in
  affiliated research and development work.  Custom manufacturing centers, built
  around newlyaffordable technologies such as 3D printing and laser cutting,
  will allow the design and retail to occur together in near real time
  throughout the city.  Finally, the students who participate in this project,
  being creators as well as consumers of education, will create a far more
  dynamic city in their adulthood.</p>
