project_summary: "Kids Progress Inc. (KPI), the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles' (HACLA) non-profit, recognizes the urgent need to guide our youth, under age 18, who represent over 41 percent of our 14 public housing communities, toward obtaining the education and skills to achieve economic independence by adulthood.

GMiS’ education programs provide underserved and underrepresented pre-college students an avenue for college and career awareness in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM).  \r\n\r\nIt is in this spirit that KPI and GMiS are joining forces in a 2013 pilot Estrada Courts STEM Summer Program that targets students in 4th - 12th grade, living in the Estrada Courts public housing community, in Los Angeles.

  vision: >-
    KPI has the goal of continuing this program annually starting in 2013. We
    are determined to inspire consecutive generations of youth toward careers
    that improve the Los Angeles economy, raise employment in careers with
    proven growth potential and reduce the numbers of children in public housing
    who remain on government support far into adulthood.  By 2050, the latest
    class of graduates will be leaders at growing organizations currently
    evolving and to be established in the future.
