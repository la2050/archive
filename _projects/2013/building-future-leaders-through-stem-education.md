title: Building Future Leaders through STEM Education
indicator: ' Education'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >+
  Kids Progress Inc. (KPI), the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles'
  (HACLA) nonprofit, recognizes the urgent need to guide our youth, under age
  18, who represent over 41 percent of our 14 public housing communities, toward
  obtaining the education and skills to achieve economic independence by
  adulthood.  We hope to provide a pathway to a selfsufficient life to select 45
  youth to help them become the nation’s next generation of engineers,
  scientists, and technologists as they enter careers that offer opportunities
  for upward social and economic mobility.






  Great Minds in STEM™ (GMiS) understands that investing in education and the
  workforce of tomorrow is a top priority for the nation.  GMiS’ education
  programs provide underserved and underrepresented precollege students an
  avenue for college and career awareness in science, technology, engineering
  and math (STEM).  






  It is in this spirit that KPI and GMiS are joining forces in a 2013 pilot
  Estrada Courts STEM Summer Program that targets students in 4th  12th grade,
  living in the Estrada Courts public housing community, in Los Angeles.  This
  program will stimulate interest and achievement in math, science, engineering,
  technology, and computer science, and provide the awareness for students to
  optinto pursuing STEM college and career pathways.


What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: "KPI received the following grants and has leveraged inkind funding to offset programmatic costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\tChildren’s Institute, Inc. $300,000 over three years for Project Fatherhood, a men’s support group on parenting ($100,000 for 2013)\n\n\n*\tThe AntiRecitivism Coalition (ARC) provided a $30,000 sponsorship of the Canyon Creek Camp for youth and their parents (March 2013)\n\n\n*\tLA Men’s Center will sponsor 15 fathers and youth for a Fathers & Sons mentoring Retreat in April 2013\n\n\n*\tInner City Arts provided a $25,000 grant to fund a Performing Arts program at Jordan Downs public housing community (Spring 2013)\n\n\n*\tForgiving for Living, Inc. provided a $10,000 grant for a SelfEsteem building program at Jordan Downs (Spring 2013)\n\n\n*\t$500.00 Jill and Steve Edwards (General KPI Donation)\n\n\nTotal: $172,400 (2013) plus $500,000 in leveraged funding for the SHIELDS For families, Inc.

Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  Success will be measured by:






  1) The number of youth who participate and complete the program.



  2) Changes in academic interest of all youth at their respective elementary,
  middle and high schools.



  3) College admissions for highschool youth.



  4) Jobs and income levels achieved by participants as students and later as
  professionals.






  The performance of participants will be tracked for at least five years
  following program graduation. 
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  Our proposed program aims to keep Los Angeles competitive within
  technologybased sectors and industries by fostering a skilled, educated group
  of lowincome youth currently living in public housing communities. Building
  Future Leaders Through STEM Education will:






  1) Expose Los Angeles youth in public housing, grades four through twelve, to
  local industries that rely on engineers and other scientists as a chief source
  of innovation.



  2) Provide 45 youth participants with inclass training led by leading
  professionals at local firms and schools.



  3) Provide paid internships for youth within collaborating companies and
  government agencies.



  4) Produce quantifiable results within a model program that may be duplicated
  within other lowincome communities within Los Angeles. 






  KPI's program is a pioneering collaboration with local STEMbased corporations,
  federal agencies and universities with the longterm goal of fostering academic
  and career development by harnessing the abilities of underserved residents in
  public housing.  This program has the dual effect of improving and expanding
  the Los Angeles economy and breaking the cycle of poverty and costly
  government entitlements for today's youth and young adults and their
  families. 
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  KPI has the goal of continuing this program annually starting in 2013. We are
  determined to inspire consecutive generations of youth toward careers that
  improve the Los Angeles economy, raise employment in careers with proven
  growth potential and reduce the numbers of children in public housing who
  remain on government support far into adulthood.  By 2050, the latest class of
  graduates will be leaders at growing organizations currently evolving and to
  be established in the future.
