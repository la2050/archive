  brief: "Kids Progress Inc. (KPI), the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles' (HACLA) non-profit, recognizes the urgent need to guide our youth, under age 18, who represent over 41 percent of our 14 public housing communities, toward obtaining the education and skills to achieve economic independence by adulthood.  We hope to provide a pathway to a self-sufficient life to select 45 youth to help them become the nation’s next generation of engineers, scientists, and technologists as they enter careers that offer opportunities for upward social and economic mobility.\r\n\r\nGreat Minds in STEM™ (GMiS) understands that investing in education and the workforce of tomorrow is a top priority for the nation.

    KPI has the goal of continuing this program annually starting in 2013. We
    are determined to inspire consecutive generations of youth toward careers
    that improve the Los Angeles economy, raise employment in careers with
    proven growth potential and reduce the numbers of children in public housing
    who remain on government support far into adulthood.  By 2050, the latest
    class of graduates will be leaders at growing organizations currently
    evolving and to be established in the future.

  Great Minds in STEM™ (GMiS) understands that investing in education and the
  workforce of tomorrow is a top priority for the nation.  GMiS’ education
  programs provide underserved and underrepresented precollege students an
  avenue for college and career awareness in science, technology, engineering
  and math (STEM).  






  It is in this spirit that KPI and GMiS are joining forces in a 2013 pilot
  Estrada Courts STEM Summer Program that targets students in 4th  12th grade,
  living in the Estrada Courts public housing community, in Los Angeles.  This
  program will stimulate interest and achievement in math, science, engineering,
  technology, and computer science, and provide the awareness for students to
  optinto pursuing STEM college and career pathways.
