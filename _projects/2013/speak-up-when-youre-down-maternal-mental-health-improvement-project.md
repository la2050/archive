indicator: ' Health'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  The mission of the Los Angeles County Perinatal Mental Health Task Force is to
  remove barriers to the prevention, screening and treatment of prenatal and
  postpartum depression in Los Angeles County. Common barriers include lack of
  screening, inaccessibility of informed treatment, stigma and lack of
  reimbursement from payors. In order to address these barriers and increase
  access to depression screening and treatment services for medically
  underserved pregnant and postpartum women, the Task Force has been working in
  partnership with USCEisner Family Medicine Clinic on the Maternal Mental
  Health Improvement project  a pilot project that embeds maternal mental health
  care in a primary care setting.






  USCEisner FMC is a federally qualified nonprofit community health center
  dedicated to improving the physical, social, and emotional wellbeing of people
  in Metro, South and South Central Los Angeles, regardless of their ability to
  pay. Its patient population includes highrisk, uninsured, underinsured and
  otherwise medically underserved women and their infants. According to the 2008
  LAMB survey, 23.1% percent of new mothers in the catchment area served by
  USCEisner FMC reported depression during pregnancy and 58.2% reported some
  level of depression postpartum  a rate roughly twice that of pregnant women
  nationwide. In addition, many struggle with financial stress, poor social
  support and chronic illnesses such as diabetes, hypertension and thyroid
  disease. Additional risks include linguistic barriers, immigration status,
  lack of health insurance, obstacles to care such as transportation and
  childcare, and lack of access to mental health services.






  As part of the Maternal Mental Health Improvement project, which is based on
  the IMPACT model, all prenatal and postpartum patients are screened for
  perinatal mood and anxiety disorders at each visit. Patients who screen
  positively (10 or more on the PHQ9 or 4 or more on the Edinburgh 3) are
  connected with an onsite social worker, social work intern and/or occupational
  therapist, who conducts a full assessment of the patient. These cases are
  referred to the New Family Care Team, which consists of primary care
  physicians, social workers, occupational therapists, psychologists and case
  managers at USCEisner FMC, as well as a consulting perinatal mental health
  psychiatrist, psychologist, licensed marriage family therapist and a social
  worker. Members of the New Family Care Team meet on a weekly basis to discuss
  patients who have presented as high or medium risk for perinatal depression,
  provide expertise from members' respective disciplines and construct an
  optimal treatment plan for each case. Treatment options may include individual
  or group therapy, psychiatric care, medication, cognitive behavioral therapy,
  interpersonal psychotherapy and/or psychodynamic psychotherapy, social support
  and intensive case management with warm referrals to community resources.






  Since January 2012, 420 pregnant and postpartum women have been screened for
  perinatal depression at USCEisner FMC. Positive screens, which account for
  approximately 33% of all women, are given an extensive intake assessment using
  a tool developed by the Task Force. The intake/assessment tool includes a
  comprehensive psychosocial history, including risk factors such as past trauma
  and loss, domestic violence, substance abuse, immigration status and social
  support, as well as a complete psychiatric differential diagnosis. Thus far,
  the intervention appears to be creating a medical home for women and their
  children, potentially lowering rates of fragmented medical and mental health
  care and addressing the physical and mental health needs of women and
  children. The most important observation thus far has been that time and time
  again, women express reluctance to being given a referral outside of the
  clinic, but are willing to connect with an "emotional support person" who is
  on the premises. In this way, women are far less likely to fall through the
  cracks.






  The Task Force is currently actively fundraising for the Maternal Mental
  Health Improvement project so that it can design a data dashboard that will
  track the project's outcomes. Data sets that will be collected through the
  dashboard will be used to inform conclusions about the efficiency and
  costeffectiveness of the IMPACT model of collaborative mental health care as
  applied to maternal depression.
What are some of your organizationâ€™s most important achievements to date?: >+
  The Los Angeles County Perinatal Mental Health Task Force was founded in
  February 2007 by Special Counsel/Legislative Analyst, Kimberly Wong, following
  her personal experience with severe postpartum depression. The Task Force is a
  coalition composed of over 35 public and private nonprofit agencies as well
  community leaders, research partners, advocates for mothers, infants, and
  families, survivors of maternal depression and affected family members.
  Through its programs and initiatives, the Task Force aims to: (1) Raise public
  awareness of the disorder so that women who are suffering are not ashamed or
  embarrassed to seek help; (2) Increase perinatal depression screening and
  referral rates among community and health care providers; and (3) Advocate for
  legislation that supports the identification and treatment of perinatal
  depression.  






  Since its inception, the Task Force has:






  *Obtained the dedication of May of every year as Perinatal Depression
  Awareness Month throughout Los Angeles County and the state of California. 



  *Distributed over 800,000 Speak Up When You're Down: Six Things Every New Mom
  and MomtoBe Should Know About Maternal Depression posters and brochures
  (available in 7 languages).



  *Developed a Training & Technical Assistance program that has delivered
  tailored perinatal mood disorder trainings to over 1,500 health care and
  communitybased providers.



  *Published a Community Providers Perinatal Mental Health Toolkit, which
  includes information and handouts on the signs, symptoms, risk factors,
  effects, screening, assessment, prevention, and intervention for perinatal
  depression and related mood and anxiety disorders for providers. 



  *Launched an innovative, first of its kind, pilot project with USCEisner
  Family Medicine to implement an IMPACT model in which perinatal mental health
  is embedded in primary care visits both for screening and intervention. 



  *Cosponsored ACR 53 (Hernandez), the Kelly Abraham Martinez Act, which urges
  hospital providers, mental health care providers, health plans, and insurers
  to invest resources to educate women about perinatal depression risk factors
  and triggers. 






  The Task Force is a project of 501(c)3 fiscal sponsor, Community Partners.


Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  The Task Force will work with the following partners on its Speak Up When
  You're Down: Maternal Mental Health Improvement project: 






  *USCEisner Family Medical Center, a federally qualified nonprofit community
  health center dedicated to improving the physical, social, and emotional
  wellbeing of people in Metro, South and South Central Los Angeles, regardless
  of their ability to pay.






  *The Magnolia Place Community Initiative (MPCI), a groundbreaking model for
  large scale community mobilization and transformation where children, living
  in the most vulnerable neighborhoods, break all records of success in their
  education, health milestones, the nurturing they receive from their family,
  and the economic stability of their family. 
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  The Task Force will contract with an external evaluator to conduct a
  comprehensive evaluation of the Speak Up When You're Down: Maternal Mental
  Health Improvement project, including qualitative and quantitative indicators
  of project success.  Qualitative measures may include feasibility and
  implementation challenges and successes within the participating clinic and
  program, as well as program milestone achievements.  Quantitative measures may
  include descriptive baseline measures of outcomes related to screening and
  access to care, implementation of screening and intervention protocols and
  demographic, clinical and psychosocial variables of the patients seen during
  the research project.  Data elements will include date of birth; marital
  status; ethnicity; family income; insurance status; age of first prenatal
  visit; history of mental health; immigration status; evidence of substance
  abuse, domestic violence, etc.  Other data will include maternal and birth
  outcomes.  






  Benchmarks that will be tracked over the project's life include:






  *Number of prenatal and postpartum women at USCEisner FMC to be screened for
  perinatal mood and anxiety disorders;



  *Percentage of screened patients to be provided warm referrals to treatment;



  *A cost per patient for embedded maternal mental health care at USCEisner FMC
  is established;



  *A cost per patient for maternal mental health care at comparison site is
  established;



  *Quality outcomes of embedded maternal mental health care at USCEisner FMC are
  identified;



  *Quality outcomes of maternal mental health care at comparison site are
  identified.






  A summative evaluation of progress towards achieving the project's intended
  objectives will be measured annually through a data dashboard consisting of
  tracking outputs of participation, attendance, as well as practice outcomes of
  screening, referring and access to care in representative clinical settings. 
  The Task Force will utilize these evaluations to regularly revisit the
  project's goals and strategies and to revise them, if necessary.  
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  Perinatal or maternal depression encompasses a range of mood disorders that
  can affect a woman during pregnancy and around the time of birth.  Mothers who
  suffer from perinatal depression are atrisk of delivering a preterm baby, a
  lowbirth weight baby and/or a baby with elevated stress hormones. They are
  also less likely breastfeed, use car seats, electrical outlet covers or smoke
  detectors, place her baby on his/her back to sleep, or talk, play or show
  books to her baby on a daily basis.  A mother suffering from postpartum
  depression is also more likely to abuse drugs and/or alcohol, display anger
  and disengagement with her baby and use corporal punishment.  Children of
  women who are suffering from perinatal depression may display poor weight
  gain, low selfesteem and behavioral problems.  Most importantly, depression in
  the postpartum period interrupts healthy bonding between mother and child,
  leading to impaired cognitive, behavioral, and emotional development in early
  childhood and beyond.






  Of the approximately 150,000 live births occurring in Los Angeles County each
  year, over 22,000 women experience clinical perinatal depression.  Women who
  live in disadvantaged populations are particularly susceptible.  Recent
  studies have demonstrated that in households below the federal poverty
  threshold, as many as one in four mothers of infants is experiencing moderate
  to severe levels of depressive symptoms. The most recent Los Angeles Mother
  Baby (LAMB) Survey results identified close to 40% of Hispanic and
  AfricanAmerican women as experiencing some degree of perinatal depression. 






  Highly treatable and often preventable, perinatal depression and related mood
  disorders are often not diagnosed and/or treated due to lack of screening and
  inaccessibility of informed treatment.  In fact, 19 percent of women in Los
  Angeles rate their mental health as fair or poor during their pregnancy, yet
  42 percent of new mothers were not asked about feeling depressed during their
  hospital stays, well baby appointments or 6 weeks postpartum check ups.  






  Through its Speak Up When You're Down: Maternal Mental Health Improvement
  Project, the Los Angeles County Perinatal Mental Health Task Force will
  increase awareness of maternal depression and its impact on the mother, child,
  family and community at large amongst pregnant and postpartum women, health
  care and community providers and county policy makers.  As a result, by 2050
  all pregnant and postpartum women will be screened for maternal depression
  during their prenatal visits and postpartum check up and all women who are
  highrisk for maternal depression will receive treatment. 
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  Success will that all pregnant and postpartum women are screened for perinatal
  mood and anxiety disorders during prenatald and postpartum visits by health
  care and other community providers, and that 100% of high risk patients are
  provided with a warm referral to an organization or agency that can help them.

As a result, by 2050 all pregnant and postpartum women will be screened for maternal depression during their prenatal visits and postpartum check up and all women who are high-risk for maternal depression will receive treatment.

    answer: "The Task Force will contract with an external evaluator to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the Speak Up When You're Down: Maternal Mental Health Improvement project, including qualitative and quantitative indicators of project success.  Qualitative measures may include feasibility and implementation challenges and successes within the participating clinic and program, as well as program milestone achievements.  Quantitative measures may include descriptive baseline measures of outcomes related to screening and access to care, implementation of screening and intervention protocols and demographic, clinical and psycho-social variables of the patients seen during the research project.  Data elements will include date of birth; marital status; ethnicity; family income; insurance status; age of first prenatal visit; history of mental health; immigration status; evidence of substance abuse, domestic violence, etc.  Other data will include maternal and birth outcomes.  \r\n\r\nBenchmarks that will be tracked over the project's life include:\r\n\r\n*Number of prenatal and postpartum women at USC-Eisner FMC to be screened for perinatal mood and anxiety disorders;\r\n*Percentage of screened patients to be provided warm referrals to treatment;\r\n*A cost per patient for embedded maternal mental health care at USC-Eisner FMC is established;\r\n*A cost per patient for maternal mental health care at comparison site is established;\r\n*Quality outcomes of embedded maternal mental health care at USC-Eisner FMC are identified;\r\n*Quality outcomes of maternal mental health care at comparison site are identified.\r\n\r\nA summative evaluation of progress towards achieving the project's intended objectives will be measured annually through a data dashboard consisting of tracking outputs of participation, attendance, as well as practice outcomes of screening, referring and access to care in representative clinical settings.  The Task Force will utilize these evaluations to regularly revisit the project's goals and strategies and to revise them, if necessary.  "

      Postpartum Support International (PSI), a national organization dedicated
      to helping women suffering from perinatal mood and anxiety disorders,
      including postpartum depression, the most common complication of
      childbirth, is the Task Force's closest 'competition'.  Since PSI works on
      a national scale, it really serves as a complementary organization to the
      Task Force.  The Task Force will often refer women suffering from PMADs
      and/or therapists working with clients suffering from PMADs to PSI for
      resources.  In addition, the Task Force and PSI often support each other
      on various policy and advocacy initiatives.
