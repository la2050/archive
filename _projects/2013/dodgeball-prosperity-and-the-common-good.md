title: Dodgeball Prosperity and the Common Good
indicator: ' Health'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  <p>During our journey, The Yacht Club has seemingly stumbled upon a way to
  completely reimagine the traditional nonprofit model in a way that potentially
  solves one of the greatest struggles in the nonprofit sector: How do we
  motivate people to volunteer?</p>



  <p>It turns out...it’s dodgeball.</p>



  <p>The Yacht Club utilizes the nostalgia of dodgeball to reinvigorate
  struggling city parks while providing tailor made youth programming to the
  children of the surrounding community  Our idea is to expand our efforts &
  programming to 3 additional LA City Rec & Parks centers in the disadvantaged
  neighborhoods of LA.</p>



  <p>We started The Yacht Club as a social experiment in 2008. Once a week, we
  would ask dodgeballdeprived Angelenos to complete a different philanthropic
  task in exchange for an hour or two of (slightly) organized dodgeball. They’d
  swing by a drugstore as they made their way to the Highland Park Rec Center to
  pick up a toothbrush, box of tampons, or any other needed item. By the end of
  the two hour dodgeball workout, we’d have a bag full of goodies to drop off at
  any number of local charities (the Downtown Women’s Shelter, Humane Society,
  LA Food Bank & others). It was our way of doing a little good while having a
  little fun.</p>



  <p>As The Yacht Club’s vision became clearer, our efforts to achieve the
  common good followed suit. We began to focus our attention on the kids at
  these parks whose programs were being slashed due to budget cuts. Now, we
  began asking these same dodgeball players to hide eggs on Easter, to hand out
  toys with Santa on Christmas, & to spend their Friday nights playing dodgeball
  with kids. Suddenly, three years had blown by when we received a letter from
  the IRS…</p>



  <p>"Dear Applicant: We are pleased to inform you that upon review of your
  application for tax exempt status,  we have determined that you are exempt
  from Federal income tax under under section 501(c) (3) of the Internal Revenue
  Code…"</p>



  <p>Sure, we were excited, but this would mean that The Yacht Club would need
  to evolve.  So we assembled a Board of Directors, acquired an office, & got to
  work.</p>



  <p>Now, as we head into our 5th year, we bring roughly 500 adults and 100 kids
  into LA City Rec & Parks centers each week with chapters in Glassell Park,
  Venice, & North Hollywood.  In addition to their donation of time and goods,
  participant league fees received from the adult dodgeball pay for permit fees,
  equipment and helps fund our customized kids programs. Using the resources
  from our adult league participants, every week, we use the game of dodgeball
  to significantly impact at least 6 of LA2050's 8 indicators:</p>



  <p>1. Health: The Yacht Club uses dodgeball to encourage kids and adults to
  run, jump, duck, throw, catch, block, laugh, smile and banter for a couple of
  hours each week. </p>



  In addition, The Yacht Club chapters in Venice & Glassell Park partnered with
  Whole Foods to create Yacht Grub — a free cooking class for kids that focuses
  on the education & benefits of healthy eating.</p>



  <p>2. Education: Once we've used kid’s dodgeball to establish relationships &
  build trust with our kids, we work with LA City Rec & Parks’ staff &
  coordinators to create workshops & classes designed to bridge the gap between
  traditional schooling & extracurricular activities. We focus on critical
  thinking & artistic expression through photography and kids cooking &
  gardening workshops.</p>



  <p>3. Social Connectedness: Whether it’s kids or adults, dodgeball plays a key
  part in the development of the social skills necessary to become a productive
  and proactive part of our communities.  We're working to create a muchneeded
  social outlet for kids and young professionals by providing opportunities to
  get involved in their local community, to forge new relationships & to
  volunteer in unique ways that directly benefit their neighborhood.</p>



  <p>4. Public Safety:  The Yacht Club changes the perceptions of our
  communities by creating safe, alternative spaces for kids to spend their
  time.  The work we do encourages positive experiences & interactions in LA
  City Parks & Rec centers.</p>



  <p>5. Environmental Quality:  The Yacht Club increases access to open spaces &
  parks by creating positive experiences & maximizing utilization of LA City Rec
  & Parks centers.  Additionally, we introduce our participants to community
  gardens in the areas served.</p>



  <p>6. Arts & Cultural Vitality: Cultural and artistic activities run rampant
  in our programs. For example, Yacht Pix is a pilot program in our Venice
  chapter that puts cameras in the hands of teens. This scavenger huntstyle
  class aims to teach basic photography skills, to encourage critical thinking,
  & to help kids expand their artistic talents.



  This winning formula creates a catalyst for real change in the youth &
  communities of LA & a grant from the Goldhirsh Foundation & Good Worldwide
  will enable us to expand our efforts to 3  additional parks by the end of
  2013.</p>
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  <p>To date, The Yacht Club has successfully transformed 500+ dodgeball players
  into engaged, sociallyconscious Angelenos by creating a diverse number of
  opportunities for participants to volunteer directly in their communities, in
  addition to adding roughly 1300+ hours of physical activity for kids and
  adults.  This has been achieved through the following programming efforts:</p>



  <p>Creative Fundraising: One example would be our 3rd Annual Valentine's Day
  Tournament. We worked with private local and national companies to create a
  unique themed event. This was an incredibly successful fundraising effort with
  proceeds going towards ongoing activities for kids, including Kids dodgeball,
  Yacht Grub, Yacht Plot, Yacht Pix and forthcoming programs.</p>



  <p>Kids Dodgeball: Friday nights from 7:309 PM: Continuing our efforts to
  create positive experiences & growth for the youth of Glassell Park & Venice
  (& starting the program this spring in North Hollywood), we host our Kids
  Dodgeball League on Friday nights. This program was started under the Mayor's
  Summer Night Lights initiative over two years ago, which we used as a platform
  to gauge interest & create an ongoing program. We are very proud that this
  informal league has helped us build relationships with kids in the
  neighborhood, which has furthered our ability to create new efforts &
  programs.</p>



  <p>Yacht Plot:  We have firmly planted ourselves in a new spot in Glassell
  Park  The Drew St. Community Garden. The Yacht Club volunteers, along with
  helpful neighborhood kids, maintain the garden a few times each weekroutinely
  watering, weeding, tidying up, monitoring plant growth, & dealing with
  challenges presented by seasonal change. Once mature, the plot’s produce will
  supplement the culinary needs of the Yacht Grub kids cooking class. To assist
  in supplementing the needs of our gardening crew, our adult dodgeball league
  rallied & donated our wish list of kid's gardening tools.</p>



  <p>Kids Cooking Classes: In 2012, we formed Yacht Grub in collaboration with
  Whole Foods, creating a cooking & nutrition class for atriskteens associated
  with recreation centers in Venice & Glassell Park. The goal of this six week
  course is to give students confidence in the kitchen while they learn healthy
  cooking, practical nutrition information, basic knife skills & complete
  awareness of how to read ingredient labels. 810 students learn two new recipes
  each week in this 2 hour class.</p>



  <p>Yacht Pix, an introduction to photography course for kids at the Oakwood
  Rec Center in Venice. The goal of the class is to learn a variety of
  techniques & ways of shooting, honing the students’ critical thinking skills.
  Guest photographers showcase their work, allowing students to see how
  photography can be a profession. At the end of the session, the students work
  is hung for a ‘gallery opening’ where one photo is chosen as the winner based
  on skills learned, directions followed, & positive behavior displayed.</p>
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  <p>LA Department of Recreation & Parks:



  Directors & staff are vital partners in our project  their commitment &
  understanding of the impact we can have at the parks & communities are
  essential to our success. We work to identify & define the specific needs of
  each park, funneling resources & volunteers to reach those goals.</p>



  <p>Teachers, Stakeholders, Community Leaders & City Officials:



  Our leadership teams work with community leaders & educators to establish
  common goals & collaborate on solving specific problems in the neighborhoods
  we serve. i.e., due to budget shortfalls, the Glassell Park Community Pool had
  been slated for closure in the fall of 2012. Our local chapter worked to
  ensure the pool stayed open year round.</p>
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  <p>Currently our growth and success is built on word of mouth. The Yacht Club
  started with 10 players and volunteers and has grown to nearly 500, all from
  players encouraging friends and strangers to get involved. By people
  continuing to step up through our adult programming and get involved in The
  Yacht Club, their desire to take the helm and start new projects that benefit
  their community is one measurement of success.</p>






  <p>Success will also be measured by our ability to address specific needs of
  Los Angeles parks. For instance, in the summer of 2012, The Yacht Club
  launched our Quick and Dirty dodgeball series, the goal of which was to
  identify a specific problem at a local recreation center, host a one day
  tournament to raise funds and donate to the cause. To date, we raised funds
  for the following causes:</p>






  <p>* $800 to send 7 lowincome kids to summer camp at Oakwood Rec in Venice. 



  * $800 for the Save Glassell Pool campaign



  * $800 to ensure the Glassell rec center stays open on Sundays



  * $750 to make much needed repairs to the North Hollywood Rec Center’s gym
  floors.</p>






  <p>Another major indicator of our success will be the retention and return
  rate for program participants. Success will come in both large and small
  forms. Whether a child returns to Yacht Grub for example, continues their
  culinary education, encourages others to do so or potentially sparking
  interest in what could become a profession would all be monumental measures of
  success.</p>






  <p>Some of these pilot programs are less than a year old, so retention and
  recidivism are still being analyzed, but to date we've noticed that 75% of
  kids who began these programs have returned on a regular basis. The hope is to
  increase both the raw number of local children participating in the program by
  offering a more diverse array of classes and to maximize our retention rate by
  perfecting the instruction models we have begun.</p>






  <p>We’ll also use the feedback we receive from our partners, community
  leaders, and kids in our programs to identify our strengths and weaknesses and
  grow a stronger Yacht Club.</p>
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
  We believe a more physically active Los Angeles means a healthier Los Angeles,
  but exercise is just one of many benefits and advantages The Yacht Club can
  bring to the neighborhoods that need it most. We also offer a safe and fun
  place for kids to hangout by creating positive experiences and engaging
  activities, helping LA City Rec and Parks centers to become a living and
  breathing part of the community and a focal point for those living within it.
  Additionally, the art and educational programs we offer are designed to build
  vital skills that enhance human development, such as: confidence, critical
  thinking and an entrepreneurial spirit, which studies show results in more
  engaged young people that are more likely to avoid the juvenile court system,
  stay in school, and even go to college. 






  In addition to health benefits, The Yacht Club offers Los Angeles a host of
  other benefits, from improved public safety and social connectedness to
  environmental quality. While many people living in Los Angeles have the desire
  and the good intentions to get out and help their community, many feel so
  removed from the problem that they don’t ever rustle up the determination to
  get involved. The Yacht Club has developed a system to draw them into the LA
  City Rec and Parks centers to understand the need, to experience the sense of
  community, and to engage in a movement of change, ultimately creating a sense
  of investment in their own neighborhoods  we’re shedding light on how vital it
  is that participants get involved in shaping our surroundings.


What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  <p>By 2050, we hope that there will be a drastic reduction in the rates of
  obesity in our communities.  We hope the kids in our program have retained a
  lifelong commitment to exercise, nutrition, civic engagement and volunteerism.
  Additionally, we hope they have led by example and their kids will also have
  lifelong commitments to the same.  We hope that The Yacht Club will teach them
  to also be educators  leading  the classes they used to be students in,
  understanding and pushing for the skills that were so pivotal in shaping them
  into adulthood. Their own children will be helping to shape new programs at LA
  City Rec and Parks centers which have, once again, become the touchstones of
  our communities  the place where neighbors meet, kids play, and communities
  grow together.</p>






  <p>The importance of fostering healthy, productive, civicminded youth will
  mean that services are being added to LA City Rec and Parks programs instead
  of taking them away. In our vision for 2050, The Yacht Club’s programs will be
  present in every LA City Rec and Parks center in Los Angeles, engaging kids
  and adults as productive and active community members.  The Yacht Club’s
  comprehensive programs   Yacht Plot, Yacht Grub, Yacht Pix, Dodgeball, and the
  other programs we have the capacity to develop  will become part of Los
  Angeles’ vernacular, and funding for these programs will be automatically
  included in the Mayor’s budget as part of a comprehensive program to address
  the health of Angelenos. The desire to solve health problems with a single
  pill will be longgone, and conventional wisdom will be clear — not only are
  exercise and diet key to living a long happy life, but the internal sense of
  selfworth and accomplishment that comes from giving back to your community
  through volunteerism is paramount to your overall health.</p>
