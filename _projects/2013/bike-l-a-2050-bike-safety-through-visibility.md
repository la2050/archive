title: Bike L.A. 2050  Bike Safety Through Visibility
indicator: ' Public Safety'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  Bike L.A. 2050 would like to make biking a safer, healthier option for
  commuting in L.A. through the use of highly visible public monitoring of bike
  traffic. To launch the project, bike counters with digital displays will be
  installed in high traffic locations in Los Angeles to improve awareness of the
  number of bicyclists using the streets and bike lanes. These digital counters
  have been installed with much success in cities like Seattle, Portland and in
  several European cities in Sweden, Denmark and Germany. They are highly
  visible beacons that have proven successful in broadcasting awareness to
  drivers, pedestrians and other bikers and help improve the visibility and
  safety of bicyclists on city streets.
What are some of your organizationâ€™s most important achievements to date?: >-
  We have been involved in a number of projects focusing on urban mobility and
  the interface with cities and the built environment. Marc Alt was founding
  Executive Director of the Green Parking Council, a nonprofit organization
  which is seeking to transform parking into a platform for innovation to
  support bike sharing, car sharing, electric car charging infrastructure, green
  building standards and reinventing parking as a force for good in cities. Marc
  has also worked with some of the leading companies in the automotive,
  architecture and engineering fields on urban mobility projects, including the
  launch of electric vehicles and charging infrastructure.
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  We would like to partner with numerous bicycling advocacy groups working in
  L.A. on various aspects of bicycle transportation and urban planning,
  community advocacy, access and safety. We would also like to partner with L.A.
  City, L.A. County Department of Public Works, the L.A. County Bicycle
  Coalition, LADOT, CicLAvia and many of the other advocacy groups that are
  passionate about raising awareness about bicycling safety and improving access
  to safe biking on city and county streets.
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  Using measuring devices from companies such as Eco Counter, actual metrics of
  increases in numbers of bicyclists on city roads will be captured and
  reported. Baseline and target metrics will be established in partnership with
  the city and county's master plans for bicycling.
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  Increasing the visibility of bicyclists will improve the safety of biking in
  L.A. and will in turn lead to more people feeling comfortable choosing to
  commute via bicycle.
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  By 2050, a large network of monitoring devices and sensors would be installed
  throughout the L.A. region, both stationary counting devices and mobile
  sensing devices via bikemounted sensors, mobile apps on cellphones and other
  open source counting, measuring and monitoring devices. This open data would
  be aggregated and made available to the public and to L.A. County to integrate
  into existing and future smart city traffic monitoring programs, allowing
  bicycle traffic to be included in city and countywide realtime traffic
  monitoring programs.






  The biggest success indicator would be increase in public awareness of bike
  safety, a measurable reduction of bicycling accidents involving vehicles,
  improvements in human health and wellbeing due to increased outdoor activity,
  reduced vehicle miles, improved air quality and a sense of wellbeing and
  community that has been documented in cultures that use bicycles for
  commuting.

  budget explanation: "70% of the budget funds would be allocated to installing technology from Eco Sensor, specifically the Eco Totem bike counter which is a highly visual beacon used to publicly record the number of bikers on busy thoroughfares. The Eco-Totem has been successfully installed in the cities of Seattle, Portland and cities in Sweden and Germany.
