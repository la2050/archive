title: 'Future Leaders Initiative  Listen to the Leaders of Tomorrow. '
indicator: ' Social Connectedness'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: "<p>By 2050, the youth of today will be the generation that inherits Los Angeles. They will be the ones making decisions about the city's economy, transportation, housing, education, and everything that impacts Los Angelenos 37 years from now. One of them may even be the mayor in 2050. So why are we not listening to them?    </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Youth Speak Collective (YSC) will address this issue of social connectedness and apathy using our Future Leaders Initiative, a youthdriven leadership training campaign that pairs high school students throughout the City of Los Angeles with business and community professionals. Over the course of six months, each student will participate in an intensive training, mentoring and civic learning curriculum with their paired professional, in preparation to be one of Los Angeles's future 2050 leaders. Students will learn about civic engagement, social entrepreneurship, and creative leadership from their mentoring professionals, culminating in a servicelearning project where each youth/adult pair work together to solve a Los Angeles community issue.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>It is our belief that youth are simply not given enough credit. When given the opportunity, they have the drive and ability to surprise us with amazing ideas. Through genuine listening , strategic mentoring and engaged coaching, we can tap into the fresh outlook and wisdom of youth in our currently estranged communities. The guidance and mentorship of invested, caring adults can help transform Los Angeles into a socially connected, civically active community.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The following outline briefly summarizes the actions steps of the Future Leaders Initiative.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>*\tPair 50 high school students and 50 professionals from the five core areas in Los Angeles: South Los Angeles, East Los Angeles, Central Los Angeles, West Los Angeles, and San Fernando Valley</p>\n\n\n<p>*\tProfessionals will mentor, train, and coach youth for six months using a “Community Impact” curriculum</p>\n\n\n<p>*\tProfessionals will meet with the youth for at least eight hours a month</p>\n\n\n<p>*\tStudents will be tasked with selecting a real world problem in their community to solve through a service learning project</p>\n\n\n<p>*\tAfter completion of curriculum, students will be required to select a nonprofit partner that is working to address the community problem they have selected to resolve in order to leverage outreach and implementation of their service learning project</p>\n\n\n<p>*\tService learning projects will involve local elected offices, small businesses, and community groups to maximize social connectedness and impact </p>\n\n\n<p>*\tProgram will culminate in a Future Leaders conference where all participating students and professionals gather to present their projects and solutions to Los Angeles stakeholders, such as city officials, business executives, and nonprofit leaders. </p>"
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: "<p>YSC's greatest achievement is actually following through on our youthdriven philosophy. We listen carefully to what the youth want and need and work with them to implement their ideas. This youth/adult collaboration has created effective programs that youth gravitate toward and has brought about the following achievements in just seven short years.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>*\tProject Kawazoe  A droughttolerant, Japaneseinspired pocket park in Pacoima, designed and built by students in the community. </p>\n\n\n<p>*\tClub Futbolito  A free club soccer program for atrisk youth, serving over 1000 players </p>\n\n\n<p>*\tPacoima Neighborhood Partnership — A founding member of a community led forum of over 50 community members, nonprofits, forprofits, elected offices, law enforcement, educators and students who meet monthly to discuss community issues and come up with viable solutions</p>\n\n\n<p>*\tCreation of ten murals and developing more in the Northeast San Fernando Valley</p>\n\n\n<p>*\tProject Youth Green  a fouracre community garden and activity space in the heart of Pacoima</p>\n\n\n<p>*\tYouth Speak Media Solutions  A social enterprise that provides youth with jobs in the digital arts and film industry</p>\n\n\n<p>*\tCreation of over twenty marketing films for local businesses and Los Angeles based nonprofits</p>\n\n\n<p>*\tCreative Tech Center  An arts center and open computer lab in the Northeast San Fernando Valley</p>"
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  <p>We plan to work with and actively collaborate with the following nonprofit
  partners: Youth Justice Coalition, Proyecto Pastoral, Boys and Girls Club of
  Venice, and Unusual Suspects Theatre Company. We plan to reach out to other
  organizations throughout Los Angeles in our target communities once the
  campaign is funded. </p>






  <p>We plan to partner also with many excellent and established leadership
  programs: New Leaders Council, HUBLos Angeles, Coro Southern California,
  LURNLeadership for Urban Renewal Now, LA Leadership Network, Executive Service
  Corps and the Center for Nonprofit Management.  Through these prominent
  leadership development organizations we plan to recruit adult allies and
  mentors for our youth across Los Angeles. </p>
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  <p>Social Connectedness attempts to measure the frequency of contact with
  others, quality of personal relationships, and civic and social engagement. We
  project that these short term goals will make a powerful impact throughout Los
  Angeles.</p>






  <p>Outcome #1: One hundred percent of students should be able to demonstrate
  problemsolving and project management skills through the completion of a
  service learning project. Evidence of this will be present in the quality and
  presentation of each servicelearning project at the Future Leaders conference.
  Attending community and business leaders will evaluate the projects at the
  conference. These scores and qualitative comments will be collected and
  aggregated by the Program Coordinator.</p>






  <p>Outcome #2: Eighty percent of both students and adults should feel a desire
  to be more civicminded. At the end of the program, all participants will be
  required to complete a postsurvey evaluating their interest in volunteerism,
  voting and social engagement.</p>






  <p>Outcome #3: Sixty percent of business and community leaders at the Future
  Leaders conference will see the value of the youthdriven solutions presented
  to combat current community issues. This will be evaluated by how many of the
  student solutions are actually integrated and implemented by Los Angeles'
  current leaders.</p>
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
  The Future Leaders Initiative has both an immediate and longterm impact in Los
  Angeles. The 100 individuals initially involved in the program will feel an
  immediate social connectedness to each other and their community. This
  intergenerational relationship building will make a powerful impact across
  generations. The mentorship relationship provides professionals with an
  important volunteer opportunity that has an effect long after the mentorship
  is over. The student finds an adult ally that actually listens and cares about
  what they have to say and contribute. To give voice is to give a stake in the
  public discourse, and that is what the Future Leaders Initiative strives to
  do.









  As adult stakeholders, participating professionals may be inspired to
  volunteer more or become more involved in local government. As young
  stakeholders, students will become more civicminded, attend more volunteer
  events and be motivated to simply vote in order to get their voice heard. And
  with involvement of many community partners throughout the process, we are
  breathing new life into a city where people care, citizens care, and neighbors
  talk to each other.









  In the longterm, the same students who were active in the program may be the
  next business executives, city councilmembers or nonprofit leaders of 2050.
  They already have experience in collaborating and communicating with one
  another due to their work within the Future Leaders Initiative so the social
  connectedness is already present. These are the individuals that others
  follow. If they set a good example and affect change in their social spheres,
  a domino effect of social awareness, civic engagement, and increased
  volunteerism among Los Angelenos citywide is possible. We are simply asking
  for adults to listen and for the youth to take action.


What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  <p>The year 2050 would be characterized by social engagement, strong community
  values and collaborations. They are the keys to connectedness and the weapons
  against apathy. We believe that by connecting youth, adult allies, nonprofits,
  and local businesses, we can tackle all of the LA2050 indicators and link
  parts of Los Angeles through its residents.</p>






  <p>Success in 2050 would be a model for other major cities. We would see more
  engaged citizens, increased voter turnout, and triple the amount of volunteers
  at nonprofits. All businesses would incorporate strong philanthropic values
  into their corporate structure and nonprofits would actively partner with each
  other to continue striving toward social connectedness.</p>






  <p>Success in 2050 means that our youth leaders of today become our next city
  council members of Los Angeles and leading nonprofits and businesses that make
  real lasting impact. They are the next leaders in science, art and social
  welfare who give back to the same communities where they grew up. The year
  2050 would be vibrant with social bonds that also make a community impact,
  whether great or small.</p>
