project_summary: >-
  If it were a district, KIPP LA would be the highest performing in Los Angeles
  County serving a majority of students from low-income communities.  For nearly
  a decade, KIPP LA’s schools have been proving what is possible in raising
  student achievement in traditionally underserved low-income communities. In
  2011-12, KIPP LA’s weighted average Academic Performance Index (API) score was
  892 (800 is the statewide goal), compared to 700 in the neighboring schools of
  South and East Los Angeles. KIPP LA Prep, in Boyle Heights, is the
  highest-performing middle school in Los Angeles Unified School District for
  the second year in a row with an API of 924. Similarly, KIPP Raíces Academy,
  in East LA, outperforms 98 percent of elementary schools in California with an
  API of 961. According to the national norm-referenced SAT-10 test, 96 percent
  of KIPP LA’s kindergarteners and 94 percent of our first graders scored at or
  above the national average in English language arts. Finally, 96 percent of
  KIPP LA alumni are attending high-performing, college-prep high schools, and
  nearly 85 percent are currently enrolled in college.

  brief: >-
    At KIPP LA Schools (KIPP LA), we believe that the real achievement gap is
    not the differences in test scores or high school graduation rates between
    our richest and poorest communities. Rather, we see the true achievement gap
    as the difference in college graduation rates among these populations.
    High-income students graduate college at ten times the rate of low-income
    students - 80% versus 8% on average. At KIPP LA, we are committed to
    supporting both our current students and our alumni on their journey <b>to
    and through</b> college. We seek to create and build partnerships that will
    support our students as they transition from our schools at the end of 8th
    grade to high-performing high schools and on to selective
    colleges.</br></br>KIPP LA's KIPP Through College (KTC) program does just
    that by providing one-on-one support to our alumni as they enter high
    school, apply to college, and make their way through higher education and
    the workforce. KTC team members ensure that KIPP LA's 8th graders
    matriculate to a high-performing college preparatory high school that will
    prepare them for success in college. KTC's high school placement
    coordinators travel among our middle school sites to support our existing
    360 7th and 8th grade students. Our students receive personalized assistance
    with high school selection and applications, financial aid and scholarships,
    and the high school transition process. In 2012, KIPP LA placed 96% of our
    8th grade students in college-preparatory charter, magnet, independent day,
    parochial, and boarding schools.</br></br>From there, KTC stays with our
    students throughout high school, providing help with coursework selection,
    college planning services, and individual and family counseling. As our
    alumni approach high school graduation, KTC staff support them as they
    identify and apply to colleges, seek financial aid, and prepare to enter the
    college environment. Once our alumni are in college, KTC college retention
    advisors provide the necessary support services to see our alumni through
    college graduation. This includes making site visits whenever possible,
    sending care packages, providing academic support, helping students secure
    study abroad opportunities, and assisting with the community college and
    university transfer process if necessary.</br></br>KTC also strives to
    prepare our students for their future careers and instill an understanding
    of and excitement for these goals. This preparation may include a range of
    mentoring-based activities, such as summer internships, work study programs,
    resume writing, and interview workshops with career mentors, organizations
    and community allies.</br></br>In addition to personalized services, KTC
    hosts an annual high school fair for our students, gathering representatives
    from Los Angeles' highest performing high schools to answer enrollment
    questions. KTC also hosts a "Mocktail Party" for our alumni, providing an
    opportunity to practice networking and share their future ambitions with
    career professionals. Further, the KTC team leads college visits for our
    alumni to competitive schools across the country, and operates a 12th Grade
    Application Bootcamp that provides intensive support with college
    applications. Finally, KTC provides college scholarships to students with
    high academic potential, a strong record of community service, and
    demonstrated financial need. KIPP LA believes that this unique program
    serves as a model for others working to help students from underserved
    communities earn college degrees and lead fulfilling lives.</br></br>The KTC
    team is comprised of a director, three college access advisors, one college
    retention advisor, and two high school placement coordinators. Each KTC team
    member has a deep commitment to helping underserved students succeed in high
    school, college, and the competitive world beyond. Now in its third year,
    KTC has established a proven track record of success in preparing KIPP LA
    alumni for their journey to and through college.</br></br>Currently, KTC
    serves approximately 740 KIPP LA alumni, of which 520 are in high school and
    220 are persisting in college. Our alumni are spread across 140 high schools
    that KTC staff have deemed to provide a rigorous and college-preparatory
    education. Additionally, nearly 85% of our oldest alumni cohorts, the
    Classes of 2011 and 2012, are enrolled in 81 colleges and universities
    across the country. Next year, KTC will serve 910 alumni, including 540 high
    school students and 370 college students.</br></br>With the unwavering
    support of KIPP LA’s KTC program, 84% of our alumni are persisting in
    college, whereas in South and East Los Angeles, only 4% of students graduate
    college. As KTC continues to serve more KIPP LA alumni, we anticipate that
    we will increase the number of college graduates in these neighborhoods by
    50%.  In the long term, this will mean dramatic increases in academic
    attainment in some of Los Angeles’ most underserved communities.

    The neighborhoods of South and East Los Angeles, where KIPP LA students and
    alumni live, face astonishingly high levels of illiteracy, drug abuse, gang
    violence, and juvenile crime. Schools are overcrowded and underperforming;
    virtually all traditional public middle and high schools are failing
    according to No Child Left Behind. Overall, fewer than 10 percent of
    students in these neighborhoods attend a four-year college or university
    after graduating high school and only 4 percent go on to obtain a
    degree.</br></br>Today more than ever, students in underserved communities
    need an outstanding education to prepare them for success in life and to
    overcome the cycle of poverty. Research suggests that by 2018, 63 percent of
    jobs will require some higher education. By comparison, only 36 percent of
    jobs will be available to those with a high school degree or lower, leaving
    those without higher degrees access to even fewer jobs than they have today.
    Over the course of a lifetime, college graduates will earn on average $1.6
    million more than those without a degree.</br></br>Unfortunately, the youth
    of South and East Los Angeles are highly unlikely to graduate high school
    college-ready or go on to graduate college. According to The Education Trust
    West, only 22 percent of LAUSD students graduate with the requirements
    necessary to enroll in a University of California institution. This is the
    case for only 16 percent of Latino students. Research suggests that just
    over half of these students will matriculate to college and only 41 percent
    of them will graduate. Based on these figures, we estimate that only 4
    percent of students in South and East Los Angeles actually obtain a college
    degree within six years.</br></br>KIPP LA, on the other hand, is succeeding
    at helping students from underserved communities “climb the mountain” to and
    through college. With the unwavering support of KIPP LA’s KTC team, 96
    percent of our alumni are attending 140 high-performing, college-prep high
    schools, and nearly 85 percent are currently attending over 80 colleges and
    universities across the country. We foresee that our alumni – as
    self-directed, purposeful college graduates – will also work to improve
    educational and economic opportunities across Los Angeles. This will mean
    stronger economic outcomes, such as lifetime earnings and employment rates,
    in the city’s currently most underserved areas. Thus, supporting KIPP LA is
    not only an investment in underserved students’ education and preparation
    for college; it is an investment in the future of our city and country. 
  collaborators: >-
    KIPP LA and the KTC team work closely with high schools, colleges, and
    universities that our alumni attend to ensure that they are succeeding on
    their journeys to and through college. KTC is also working to formalize
    these partnerships with select local institutions of higher education to
    create supportive communities for our alumni. In the long term, we believe
    college partnerships will identify strategies that educational institutions
    can implement to help close the achievement gap for all students of color
    and first-generation college students.

    Boyle Heights, is the highest-performing middle school in Los Angeles
    Unified School District for the second year in a row with an API of 924.
    Similarly, KIPP Raíces Academy, in East LA, outperforms 98 percent of
    elementary schools in California with an API of 961. According to the
    national norm-referenced SAT-10 test, 96 percent of KIPP LA’s
    kindergarteners and 94 percent of our first graders scored at or above the

    In a city where there are over 240 charter schools, KIPP LA recognizes that
    demand is growing for high-quality education alternatives in traditionally
    underserved communities in Los Angeles. While the number of high quality
    options is growing – more charter management organizations are expanding
    their impact – demand for a high quality education for all students in LA is
    in higher demand than ever before. Thousands of students in Los Angeles
    still attend low-performing traditional and charter schools in every part of
    the city. It is vital that high-performing charter schools work together to
    create a cohesive and supportive environment for our students that encourage
    parents to seek out the best options for their children.</br></br>In
    partnership with high-performing charter schools and LAUSD, KIPP LA aims to
    construct a sustainable environment of collaboration focused on promoting
    excellence in public education. Remaining true to our mission, KIPP LA
    continually looks for innovative ways to improve our academic, financial,
    and operational results. For example, our school leaders and teachers are
    constantly communicating with other schools in Los Angeles about how to best
    integrate instructional technology into lesson planning. As we expand our
    regional network of individualized schools, KIPP LA hopes to identify more
    opportunities to collaborate with LAUSD and other charter school operators
    in Los Angeles to share best practices that will help us create a model of
    excellence for urban education.</br></br>Because KIPP LA’s schools serve
    students in kindergarten through eighth grade, we place many of our
    graduating middle school students in other high quality charter, magnet,
    private, and parochial high schools. In this way, we rely on these schools
    to provide a rigorous, college-preparatory education for our alumni. By
    working together to best serve our students, we will ensure that more of Los
    Angeles’ underserved children succeed on the path <b>to and through</b>
    college.
  vision: >-
    In 2050, success in education would mean that every student in Los Angeles,
    regardless of their zip code or demographics, attends a high-quality,
    college-preparatory school from kindergarten through 12th grade. Ultimately,
    all students in Los Angeles will never face the achievement gap and will be
    instilled with the belief that every day they can and <b>will</b> succeed in
    college and life. Classrooms will reflect the 21st century reality of the
    global workforce, preparing students for careers that may not yet exist
    through constant access to technology, project-based learning, and
    opportunities for critical thinking and creative problem
    solving.</br></br>Teachers will be dedicated to and passionate about their
    craft, providing a nurturing and rigorous learning environment for their
    students. Schools will become true communities of best practice, sharing
    lessons learned and helping improve the quality of education across the
    city. School leaders will be empowered as instructional leaders to build
    their schools to best align with the communities and students they
    serve.</br></br>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, students from
    underserved communities will matriculate to and graduate from competitive
    colleges and universities both in California and across the nation at the
    same rates as their more advantaged peers. They will enter the college
    application process without reservations, certain that they are prepared for
    the rigors and challenges of higher education. They will be educated about
    the financial aid options available to them and able to access them easily.
    They will be accepted to a wide variety of schools and will have the freedom
    to choose the one that will provide them with the best opportunities. And
    ultimately, all students will have a high quality, rigorous higher education
    experience and graduate with the degrees they need to succeed in the
    competitive world.
