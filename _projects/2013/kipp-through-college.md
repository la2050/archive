title: KIPP Through College
indicator: ' Education'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  At KIPP LA Schools (KIPP LA), we believe that the real achievement gap is not
  the differences in test scores or high school graduation rates between our
  richest and poorest communities. Rather, we see the true achievement gap as
  the difference in college graduation rates among these populations. Highincome
  students graduate college at ten times the rate of lowincome students  80%
  versus 8% on average. At KIPP LA, we are committed to supporting both our
  current students and our alumni on their journey <b>to and through</b>
  college. We seek to create and build partnerships that will support our
  students as they transition from our schools at the end of 8th grade to
  highperforming high schools and on to selective colleges.</br></br>KIPP LA's
  KIPP Through College (KTC) program does just that by providing oneonone
  support to our alumni as they enter high school, apply to college, and make
  their way through higher education and the workforce. KTC team members ensure
  that KIPP LA's 8th graders matriculate to a highperforming college preparatory
  high school that will prepare them for success in college. KTC's high school
  placement coordinators travel among our middle school sites to support our
  existing 360 7th and 8th grade students. Our students receive personalized
  assistance with high school selection and applications, financial aid and
  scholarships, and the high school transition process. In 2012, KIPP LA placed
  96% of our 8th grade students in collegepreparatory charter, magnet,
  independent day, parochial, and boarding schools.</br></br>From there, KTC
  stays with our students throughout high school, providing help with coursework
  selection, college planning services, and individual and family counseling. As
  our alumni approach high school graduation, KTC staff support them as they
  identify and apply to colleges, seek financial aid, and prepare to enter the
  college environment. Once our alumni are in college, KTC college retention
  advisors provide the necessary support services to see our alumni through
  college graduation. This includes making site visits whenever possible,
  sending care packages, providing academic support, helping students secure
  study abroad opportunities, and assisting with the community college and
  university transfer process if necessary.</br></br>KTC also strives to prepare
  our students for their future careers and instill an understanding of and
  excitement for these goals. This preparation may include a range of
  mentoringbased activities, such as summer internships, work study programs,
  resume writing, and interview workshops with career mentors, organizations and
  community allies.</br></br>In addition to personalized services, KTC hosts an
  annual high school fair for our students, gathering representatives from Los
  Angeles' highest performing high schools to answer enrollment questions. KTC
  also hosts a "Mocktail Party" for our alumni, providing an opportunity to
  practice networking and share their future ambitions with career
  professionals. Further, the KTC team leads college visits for our alumni to
  competitive schools across the country, and operates a 12th Grade Application
  Bootcamp that provides intensive support with college applications. Finally,
  KTC provides college scholarships to students with high academic potential, a
  strong record of community service, and demonstrated financial need. KIPP LA
  believes that this unique program serves as a model for others working to help
  students from underserved communities earn college degrees and lead fulfilling
  lives.</br></br>The KTC team is comprised of a director, three college access
  advisors, one college retention advisor, and two high school placement
  coordinators. Each KTC team member has a deep commitment to helping
  underserved students succeed in high school, college, and the competitive
  world beyond. Now in its third year, KTC has established a proven track record
  of success in preparing KIPP LA alumni for their journey to and through
  college.</br></br>Currently, KTC serves approximately 740 KIPP LA alumni, of
  which 520 are in high school and 220 are persisting in college. Our alumni are
  spread across 140 high schools that KTC staff have deemed to provide a
  rigorous and collegepreparatory education. Additionally, nearly 85% of our
  oldest alumni cohorts, the Classes of 2011 and 2012, are enrolled in 81
  colleges and universities across the country. Next year, KTC will serve 910
  alumni, including 540 high school students and 370 college
  students.</br></br>With the unwavering support of KIPP LA’s KTC program, 84%
  of our alumni are persisting in college, whereas in South and East Los
  Angeles, only 4% of students graduate college. As KTC continues to serve more
  KIPP LA alumni, we anticipate that we will increase the number of college
  graduates in these neighborhoods by 50%.  In the long term, this will mean
  dramatic increases in academic attainment in some of Los Angeles’ most
  underserved communities.
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  If it were a district, KIPP LA would be the highest performing in Los Angeles
  County serving a majority of students from lowincome communities.  For nearly
  a decade, KIPP LA’s schools have been proving what is possible in raising
  student achievement in traditionally underserved lowincome communities. In
  201112, KIPP LA’s weighted average Academic Performance Index (API) score was
  892 (800 is the statewide goal), compared to 700 in the neighboring schools of
  South and East Los Angeles. KIPP LA Prep, in Boyle Heights, is the
  highestperforming middle school in Los Angeles Unified School District for the
  second year in a row with an API of 924. Similarly, KIPP RaÃ­ces Academy, in
  East LA, outperforms 98 percent of elementary schools in California with an
  API of 961. According to the national normreferenced SAT10 test, 96 percent of
  KIPP LA’s kindergarteners and 94 percent of our first graders scored at or
  above the national average in English language arts. Finally, 96 percent of
  KIPP LA alumni are attending highperforming, collegeprep high schools, and
  nearly 85 percent are currently enrolled in college.
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  KIPP LA and the KTC team work closely with high schools, colleges, and
  universities that our alumni attend to ensure that they are succeeding on
  their journeys to and through college. KTC is also working to formalize these
  partnerships with select local institutions of higher education to create
  supportive communities for our alumni. In the long term, we believe college
  partnerships will identify strategies that educational institutions can
  implement to help close the achievement gap for all students of color and
  firstgeneration college students.
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  A key ingredient to KIPP LA’s success is our commitment to datadriven
  decisionmaking and transparency. The KTC team regularly evaluates both
  quantitative and qualitative data to ensure that we are having the greatest
  impact possible on our students’ lives. This includes the number of students
  who matriculate to highperforming high schools, the number of students who
  participate in KTC support services such as financial aid assistance and
  counseling, and the number of students who enter, persist in, and graduate
  from selective colleges and universities.</br></br>In the coming year, KIPP LA
  and KTC will strive to meet the following goals and objectives:</br></br>



  *  Each year, KIPP LA’s middle schools will place 95 percent of eighth graders
  in collegepreparatory high schools (high schools that provide college
  counseling for all students, offer the “AG” courses the University of
  California requires, and have an Academic Performance Index score of
  800+).</br>



  *  At least 80 percent of KIPP LA middle school alumni will enroll in college
  each year.</br>



  *  At least 10 percent of KIPP LA alumni in grades 912 will attend a summer or
  enrichment program.</br>



  *  At least 15 percent of KIPP LA alumni in grades 912 will participate in KTC
  enrichment programs, (such as the alumni volunteer program, internship
  program, job shadowing, career networking party, college partnership summer
  programs, college tours/fairs, and application boot camps).</br>



  *  At least 80 percent of KIPP LA alumni will persist in college. 
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  The neighborhoods of South and East Los Angeles, where KIPP LA students and
  alumni live, face astonishingly high levels of illiteracy, drug abuse, gang
  violence, and juvenile crime. Schools are overcrowded and underperforming;
  virtually all traditional public middle and high schools are failing according
  to No Child Left Behind. Overall, fewer than 10 percent of students in these
  neighborhoods attend a fouryear college or university after graduating high
  school and only 4 percent go on to obtain a degree.</br></br>Today more than
  ever, students in underserved communities need an outstanding education to
  prepare them for success in life and to overcome the cycle of poverty.
  Research suggests that by 2018, 63 percent of jobs will require some higher
  education. By comparison, only 36 percent of jobs will be available to those
  with a high school degree or lower, leaving those without higher degrees
  access to even fewer jobs than they have today. Over the course of a lifetime,
  college graduates will earn on average $1.6 million more than those without a
  degree.</br></br>Unfortunately, the youth of South and East Los Angeles are
  highly unlikely to graduate high school collegeready or go on to graduate
  college. According to The Education Trust West, only 22 percent of LAUSD
  students graduate with the requirements necessary to enroll in a University of
  California institution. This is the case for only 16 percent of Latino
  students. Research suggests that just over half of these students will
  matriculate to college and only 41 percent of them will graduate. Based on
  these figures, we estimate that only 4 percent of students in South and East
  Los Angeles actually obtain a college degree within six years.</br></br>KIPP
  LA, on the other hand, is succeeding at helping students from underserved
  communities “climb the mountain” to and through college. With the unwavering
  support of KIPP LA’s KTC team, 96 percent of our alumni are attending 140
  highperforming, collegeprep high schools, and nearly 85 percent are currently
  attending over 80 colleges and universities across the country. We foresee
  that our alumni — as selfdirected, purposeful college graduates — will also
  work to improve educational and economic opportunities across Los Angeles.
  This will mean stronger economic outcomes, such as lifetime earnings and
  employment rates, in the city’s currently most underserved areas. Thus,
  supporting KIPP LA is not only an investment in underserved students’
  education and preparation for college; it is an investment in the future of
  our city and country. 
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  In 2050, success in education would mean that every student in Los Angeles,
  regardless of their zip code or demographics, attends a highquality,
  collegepreparatory school from kindergarten through 12th grade. Ultimately,
  all students in Los Angeles will never face the achievement gap and will be
  instilled with the belief that every day they can and <b>will</b> succeed in
  college and life. Classrooms will reflect the 21st century reality of the
  global workforce, preparing students for careers that may not yet exist
  through constant access to technology, projectbased learning, and
  opportunities for critical thinking and creative problem
  solving.</br></br>Teachers will be dedicated to and passionate about their
  craft, providing a nurturing and rigorous learning environment for their
  students. Schools will become true communities of best practice, sharing
  lessons learned and helping improve the quality of education across the city.
  School leaders will be empowered as instructional leaders to build their
  schools to best align with the communities and students they
  serve.</br></br>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, students from
  underserved communities will matriculate to and graduate from competitive
  colleges and universities both in California and across the nation at the same
  rates as their more advantaged peers. They will enter the college application
  process without reservations, certain that they are prepared for the rigors
  and challenges of higher education. They will be educated about the financial
  aid options available to them and able to access them easily. They will be
  accepted to a wide variety of schools and will have the freedom to choose the
  one that will provide them with the best opportunities. And ultimately, all
  students will have a high quality, rigorous higher education experience and
  graduate with the degrees they need to succeed in the competitive world.
