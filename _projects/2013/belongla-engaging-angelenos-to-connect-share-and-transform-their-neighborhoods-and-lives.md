  BelongLA — Engaging Angelenos to connect share and transform their
  neighborhoods and lives
indicator: ' Social Connectedness'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  <p>How do you belong?  Belonging is the deepest sense of being socially
  connected and research shows that belonging can lead to Community WellBeing. 
  We are sparking a community movement to belong and much more.  Through the
  collective effort of organizations and people working together, we will change
  the destiny for all children, families and their neighborhoods, particularly
  the most vulnerable ones.  We are creating a “Belong” model/framework that can
  be replicated by other diverse neighborhoods in Los Angeles and beyond using
  their unique assets!</p>



  <p>What if all of us belong and we work to create communities where we would
  want to belong?  We want to belong to neighborhoods where kids are healthy and
  educationally successful.  We want to belong to neighborhoods where parents
  can be nurturing parents and economically secure and where the
  institutions/organizations in a community work to nurture success and
  belongingness. </p>



  <p>Could this concept of Belong become a Community Movement? Could this happen
  by strengthening one’s ties to their neighbors? Could we nurture this by
  supporting a cadre of volunteer community ambassadors?  These ambassadors will
  be champions for belonging, champions for kids and families to succeed. 
  Ambassadors will connect people to people, to community groups, to important
  information, and to critical resources.  What if a community ambassador on
  every block eventually grew into EVERYONE on the block feeling like they
  belong and contributing to the health and well being of everyone who lives
  near them?  And, what if the organizations and institutions in a community
  learn how to nurture this?</p>



  <p>We are starting this movement in 500 blocks in metropolitan Los Angeles
  where children and parents are struggling to overcome the many challenges of
  isolation and generational poverty.  We are engaging a diverse network of over
  75 organizations of all types to create a community where people want to
  belong.  These public and private partners have a shared vision that the
  35,000 children living in the neighborhoods within a 500 block catchment area
  will break all records of success in their education, health, and the quality
  of nurturing care and economic stability they receive from their families and
  community.  Our ultimate dream is to not only transform these 500 blocks, but
  to also develop a scalable and replicable framework that other communities can
  use to achieve a population level change.</p>



  <p>The Belong movement has started with 25 Community Ambassadors who are
  volunteering their time to increase and improve social connections in their
  neighborhoods.  We are training the ambassadors, and our organizational
  partners, to incorporate and promote the protective factors in their efforts. 
  Protective Factors such as social connections, concrete support in times of
  need, and personal resilience have been shown to lead to stronger families and
  communities.  </p>



  <p>With an LA2050 grant, our Belong movement plans to recruit a Community
  Ambassador for every block in the catchment area.   We will employ 3
  Initiative Representatives and a Belong Campaign Manager to increase social
  connections leading to an overall improvement in community wellbeing. The
  representatives will engage community groups, recruit and support Community
  Ambassadors, and facilitate a series of weekly discussion sessions offered in
  multiple settings throughout the 500 blocks with the goal of helping residents
  create new social connections, increase ties to neighbors, and encourage
  neighbors to actively participate in community events.  All Community
  Ambassadors will be trained so that they too can lead the series of
  discussions to expand our reach and impact.</p>



  <p>We will also employ social media tools on the ground level to advance the
  movement. Children’s Bureau will partner with Wondros, an internationally
  recognized communications and social media agency, to create a 5 minute
  YouTube video and mobile app that will inspire the community residents,
  community organizations and local businesses to Belong. The mobile app will be
  used to help the 75 partner organizations involved in the initiative assist
  families, parents and adults in identifying and connecting with local
  community groups and with locating critical resources in the community.</p>



  <p>The Belong movement and resulting campaign will strengthen social
  connections and promote civic engagement by increasing community belonging,
  ownership of and access to information about their community, and mobilizing
  neighbors to support one another.</p>
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  <p>For over 100 years, Children’s Bureau has been a leader and innovator of
  child abuse treatment and prevention in Southern California. With a focus on
  young children, we were one of the first professional providers of foster care
  in the nation. Children’s Bureau was a vital partner in establishing the
  Community Chest, a precursor to United Way and played a key role in
  establishing the USC School of Social Work. In the 1980’s we transitioned from
  focusing on treatment and moving on to prevention as a key means of keeping
  children safe from harm.  Our successes in the critical battle to prevent
  child abuse earned us a highly regarded reputation.  The California Department
  of Social Services’ Office of Child Abuse Prevention awarded Children’s Bureau
  a grant to form the Family Resource Center Technical Training and Support Team
  which acts as a training model for other organizations.  Children’s Bureau
  continues to be awarded numerous contracts and grants to implement county
  programs designed to protect vulnerable children and enhance their lives. We
  are one of a small group of agencies in Los Angeles County nationally
  accredited by the Council on Accreditation of Services for Families and
  Children, Inc. </p>






  <p>Our NuParent program received international recognition in Spring 2012 with
  an invitation to present the program, measurement tools and results at the 8th
  Annual British Association for the Study and Prevention of Child Abuse and
  Neglect. </p>






  <p>In 2008, we successfully completed a $22 million capital campaign and
  opened our new headquarters in one of the poorest, most densely populated
  neighborhoods in Los Angeles. From this center we launched the Magnolia
  Community Initiative  a groundbreaking model for large scale community
  mobilization where children, especially those under age 5 living in the most
  vulnerable neighborhoods, break all records of success in their education and
  health milestones and in the nurturing they receive.  </p>






  <p>Our Magnolia Community Initiative has rapidly gained the attention and
  recognition of national leaders, policymakers and funders including members of
  the U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, The Tides Foundation, United Way
  Worldwide, Gates Foundation and East LA Initiative.  Through our work with the
  UCLA Center for Healthier Children, Families and Communities, we have
  collected and mapped the school readiness of young children in a 500 block
  area of Los Angeles.  We are using this mapping data to help local communities
  map their needs and service gaps on a highly localized basis and engaging the
  community to improve these outcomes.</p>






  <p>With an operating budget of $30 million and actively involved boards of
  directors and trustees, Children’s Bureau has the demonstrated depth of
  capacity, experience, relationships, and leadership to effect a communitywide
  transformation in Los Angeles.</p>
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  Children’s Bureau has engaged 75 public and private partner organizations as
  well as individual community members who all have a shared vision for the
  transformation of this community through a collaborative alliance. Each of our
  diverse partners brings their own area of expertise to help shape the shared
  holistic outcome of strengthening communities. In particular, we will work
  closely with Children’s Nature Institute, LIFTLos Angeles, and UCLA Center for
  Healthier Children, Families and communities.  Together we will promote the
  Belong Campaign and work to address four pillars that are key to healthy
  neighborhoods: health, school readiness, nurturing parenting, and economic
  stability.  
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  <p>The Magnolia Community Initiative currently measures progress and success
  through a measurement strategy that captures outcomes at the neighborhood,
  family and child levels. This is already established and involves capturing
  data on neighborhood and family conditions on a quarterly, annual and biannual
  basis. As part of the measurement strategy, the Initiative conducted resident
  surveys in 2009 and 2011. These Community Belonging Survey results show
  significant need for improvement in social connectedness and social support.
  For example, in 2011, 66% of residents had at least one neighbor with whom
  they could discuss a personal problem, 31% of residents know their neighbors
  and feel as if they care about the neighborhood; and 24% of residents
  participate in neighborhood activities. We are capturing data on social
  connections, ties to neighbors, perceptions of community, community belonging
  and civic participation.</p>



  <p>Data is also displayed on a community dashboard that informs community
  residents and organizational staff what children and families are experiencing
  — in their neighborhoods and in their interactions with service systems. This
  is accompanied with ongoing support with problem solving and learning about
  how to improve or what we call “move the dot”. </p>



  <p>We will be administering the Community Belonging Survey again in the Fall
  of this year, 2013. This provides for us a community trend line for us to
  understand if our strategies being introduced within the Belong Campaign have
  contributed to a change in social connectedness at the community level.</p>
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
  The pioneering work of Belong with its development of a neighborhood social
  movement will have significant benefit to Los Angeles.  Belong will bring
  about a holistic community transformation by galvanizing and supporting
  neighborhood residents to create their own community response to improving
  their neighborhoods/communities and contributing to safe and supportive
  environments for their and the neighborhood’s children.  






  In a county as large as Los Angeles, it is virtually impossible for programs
  to keep up with service demand for individuals and families.  Many of our
  neighborhoods and the people who live there are at great risk of the major
  social ills that concern us all:  poverty, education failure, poor health,
  mental illness, violence, and domestic violence.  There will continue to be
  limited government and philanthropic resources to address these large scale
  problems for the foreseeable future.  And, the strategies that we do have as a
  society are relatively ineffective and too costly because they start too late
  when much of the damage has left scars in people’s lives. The harnessing of
  volunteer community ambassadors who will become champions for belonging and
  connecting people to social groups and critical resources is the breakthrough
  we need.  






  Belongingness is a deep level of social connections.  And, based on research,
  belonging leads to community wellness.  The development and implementation of
  such a strategy within a 500 block urban community of Los Angeles will serve
  as a laboratory for the development of a scalable and replicable model
  framework.  This model framework that will be developed with this grant
  funding will be usable by the diverse communities of Los Angeles and beyond
  who wish to replicate using their own unique assets.


What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  Success in 2050 for Social Connectedness would mean that residents will take
  pride in and have a sense of belonging to the Los Angeles community. 
  Neighbors will know neighbors and can rely on each other for daily support and
  in times of crisis or need.  They will voluntarily work together to not only
  identify and voice concerns, but they will know how to work together to solve
  community problems.  Through the process of becoming volunteer Community
  Ambassadors, residents will develop their leadership skills so they know how
  to engage local businesses, officials and other community members.   In
  building these connections and social bonds, levels of trust among and between
  these groups will grow.  They will gain a deeper understanding of the
  importance of investing in the early years in order to improve our children’s
  educational and economic outcomes thereby making Los Angeles a place where
  residents and businesses will thrive.

  budget explanation: "The goals of the Belong campaign are to build a community movement to foster social connection, cooperation and collective action of community residents, groups and organizations through the use of belong community discussions, recruitment of volunteer community ambassadors, community organizing, events, social media, and a belong marketing/outreach community campaign.\r\n\r\nAn award from the LA2050 will be used through December 2013 to develop and implement the campaign on the ground level within a specific 500 block area of Metropolitan L.A. Children’s Bureau has identified a creative partner, Wondros, to create a 5 minute YouTube video and mobile app that will inspire the community residents, community organizations and local businesses to Belong at a cost of  $32,000 ($25,000 for video and $7,000 for mobile app.)  The mobile app will be used to help the 75 partner organizations involved in the initiative assist families, parents and adults in identifying and connecting with local community groups locating critical resources in the community.\r\n\r\nThe grant will also fund one full-time Belong Campaign Manager and 3 Initiative Representatives each working 1/3rd time on the funded project.  The Initiative Representatives will identify community groups, community ambassadors, and offer the Belong series of community discussions.  The Belong Campaign Manager will help develop the Belong Campaign strategy and Belong Series curriculum.  The staffing costs during the grant period will be approximately $68,000 including benefits.\r\n\r\nThis budget is part of a larger Belong Campaign budget of approximately $200,000 through the end of 2013 which includes additional personnel costs of a Magnolia Community Initiative Director, Community Representatives, and consulting work by UCLA to guide the learning process of the Belong Campaign.  Children's Bureau will conduct fundraising to provide the balance of the funding needed during this time period. \r\n"

Children’s Bureau uses a holistic, multi-faceted approach to reduce the likelihood that abuse or neglect will occur in the first place.  While we offer programs that deal with the aftermath of abuse (Mental Health, Foster Care, and Adoption), our approach is unique in that most of our programs are preventative.

The staffing costs during the grant period will be approximately $68,000 including benefits.\r\n\r\nThis budget is part of a larger Belong Campaign budget of approximately $200,000 through the end of 2013 which includes additional personnel costs of a Magnolia Community Initiative Director, Community Representatives, and consulting work by UCLA to guide the learning process of the Belong Campaign.  Children's Bureau will conduct fundraising to provide the balance of the funding needed during this time period. \r\n"

    answer: "The pioneering work of Belong with its development of a neighborhood social movement will have significant benefit to Los Angeles.  Belong will bring about a holistic community transformation by galvanizing and supporting neighborhood residents to create their own community response to improving their neighborhoods/communities and contributing to safe and supportive environments for their and the neighborhood’s children.  \r\n\r\nIn a county as large as Los Angeles, it is virtually impossible for programs to keep up with service demand for individuals and families.  Many of our neighborhoods and the people who live there are at great risk of the major social ills that concern us all:  poverty, education failure, poor health, mental illness, violence, and domestic violence.  There will continue to be limited government and philanthropic resources to address these large scale problems for the foreseeable future.  And, the strategies that we do have as a society are relatively ineffective and too costly because they start too late when much of the damage has left scars in people’s lives. The harnessing of volunteer community ambassadors who will become champions for belonging and connecting people to social groups and critical resources is the breakthrough we need.  \r\n\r\nBelongingness is a deep level of social connections.  And, based on research, belonging leads to community wellness.  The development and implementation of such a strategy within a 500 block urban community of Los Angeles will serve as a laboratory for the development of a scalable and replicable model framework.  This model framework that will be developed with this grant funding will be usable by the diverse communities of Los Angeles and beyond who wish to replicate using their own unique assets.\r\n"

      Children’s Bureau has engaged 75 public and private partner organizations
      as well as individual community members who all have a shared vision for
      the transformation of this community through a collaborative alliance.
      Each of our diverse partners brings their own area of expertise to help
      shape the shared holistic outcome of strengthening communities. In
      particular, we will work closely with Children’s Nature Institute,
      LIFT-Los Angeles, and UCLA Center for Healthier Children, Families and
      communities.  Together we will promote the Belong Campaign and work to
      address four pillars that are key to healthy neighborhoods: health, school
      readiness, nurturing parenting, and economic stability.

    answer: "<p>The Magnolia Community Initiative currently measures progress and success through a measurement strategy that captures outcomes at the neighborhood, family and child levels. This is already established and involves capturing data on neighborhood and family conditions on a quarterly, annual and biannual basis. As part of the measurement strategy, the Initiative conducted resident surveys in 2009 and 2011. These Community Belonging Survey results show significant need for improvement in social connectedness and social support. For example, in 2011, 66% of residents had at least one neighbor with whom they could discuss a personal problem, 31% of residents know their neighbors and feel as if they care about the neighborhood; and 24% of residents participate in neighborhood activities. We are capturing data on social connections, ties to neighbors, perceptions of community, community belonging and civic participation.</p>\r\n<p>Data is also displayed on a community dashboard that informs community residents and organizational staff what children and families are experiencing – in their neighborhoods and in their interactions with service systems. This is accompanied with ongoing support with problem solving and learning about how to improve or what we call “move the dot”. </p>\r\n<p>We will be administering the Community Belonging Survey again in the Fall of this year, 2013. This provides for us a community trend line for us to understand if our strategies being introduced within the Belong Campaign have contributed to a change in social connectedness at the community level.</p>"

    answer: "<p>For over 100 years, Children’s Bureau has been a leader and innovator of child abuse treatment and prevention in Southern California. With a focus on young children, we were one of the first professional providers of foster care in the nation. Children’s Bureau was a vital partner in establishing the Community Chest, a precursor to United Way and played a key role in establishing the USC School of Social Work. In the 1980’s we transitioned from focusing on treatment and moving on to prevention as a key means of keeping children safe from harm.  Our successes in the critical battle to prevent child abuse earned us a highly regarded reputation.  The California Department of Social Services’ Office of Child Abuse Prevention awarded Children’s Bureau a grant to form the Family Resource Center Technical Training and Support Team which acts as a training model for other organizations.

    answer: "<p>There are several other organizations in Los Angeles that are doing similar work in the field of child welfare.  Children’s Institute, Inc., which has four locations in Los Angeles, primarily focuses on treatment programs.  Para Los Niños has as its core purpose helping underserved and abused children bridge the academic achievement gap.  Children’s Bureau uses a holistic, multi-faceted approach to reduce the likelihood that abuse or neglect will occur in the first place.  While we offer programs that deal with the aftermath of abuse (Mental Health, Foster Care, and Adoption), our approach is unique in that most of our programs are preventative.  By investing in prevention in the early years, the children and families benefit by stopping abuse and society benefits through savings to the educational, health care, criminal justice and welfare systems.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the agency that sparked and launched the Magnolia Community Initiative, Children’s Bureau views similar organizations and other non-profits as our allies in achieving our shared vision.  In fact, Para Los Niños and Children’s Institute, Inc. are partners with us in this Initiative.  Children’s Institute, Inc. is part of the Initiative’s practice change team and played a key role in the development of a universal referral and tracking form used by all the Initiative partners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Together with our partners, we feel passionately about each of our areas of expertise. We are all benefiting from a collaborative network where we can learn from each other, share and build upon best practices, reduce duplication of effort, all while positively impacting the social determinants of health and child welfare in Los Angeles.</p>"

      Success in 2050 for Social Connectedness would mean that residents will
      take pride in and have a sense of belonging to the Los Angeles community. 
      Neighbors will know neighbors and can rely on each other for daily support
      and in times of crisis or need.  They will voluntarily work together to
      not only identify and voice concerns, but they will know how to work
      together to solve community problems.  Through the process of becoming
      volunteer Community Ambassadors, residents will develop their leadership
      skills so they know how to engage local businesses, officials and other
      community members.   In building these connections and social bonds,
      levels of trust among and between these groups will grow.  They will gain
      a deeper understanding of the importance of investing in the early years
      in order to improve our children’s educational and economic outcomes
      thereby making Los Angeles a place where residents and businesses will
      thrive.
