title: Chinatown Food Hub
indicator: ' Environmental Quality'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: "Despite living in an agriculturerich state, much of the food we eat in California is imported by large corporations from all across the world, traveling 1,5002,500 miles on average. This adds 250,000 tons of greenhouse gases to our air every year — equal to the emissions from 40,000 cars.  The impact of this has led to:\n\n\n\n\n\n <p>\n\n\n*\tNearly 1,000 cases of asthma\n\n\n <p>\n\n\n*\t16,870 missed school days\n\n\n <p>\n\n\n*\t37 premature deaths\n\n\n <p>\n\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast, local farmers struggle to find sales outlets for their produce. Many rely on farmers markets as their primary source of income, despite the widely acknowledged fact that farmers markets are highly unstable revenue sources. On a bad day, a farmer might make only $100 in sales — not nearly enough to cover the cost of gas and wages. At the same time, many small businesses in Los Angeles, such as the many familyowned small businesses in Chinatown, struggle to provide high quality produce at prices that local residents can afford. \n\n\n\n\n\n <p>\n\n\nSSG/Asian Pacific Islander Obesity Prevention Alliance (APIOPA) proposes to connect small, local farmers to small businesses in Chinatown and transform it into a regional food hub.  By cutting out the middleman, we would reduce overhead costs to small businesses and customers,   and guarantee a steady source of income for the small farmers, all the while reducing our food miles and greenhouse gas emissions. In other words, our idea is to establish a regional food hub that would serve as a model for systemic change to how food supply lines currently work. Creating such a mass infrastructure change in Chinatown requires a lot of planning, which is why our proposal is to use the allotted funding to develop a sound and detailed business plan, utilizing our grant period to do the necessary research, marketing analysis, branding, and strategic planning.\n\n\n\n\n\n <p>\n\n\nIn Chinatown, we can successfully create a food hub by tapping into the current local small business community, and their knowledge of local markets and the community, to create a business model that not only provides healthy and affordable produce for residents, but also preserves the heart and soul of Chinatown. We will work directly with local Hmong and Filipino small farmers residing in Central California. These farmers generally grow Asian produce and make the trek down to Southern California once a week to sell at Farmers’ Markets. Under our regional food hub model, we would coordinate with the farmers to purchase their crops in bulk, and have this delivered to one central location in Chinatown. The idea is that if we create a regional food hub, we can then control some of the supply lines, therefore driving down prices for produce that may regularly be more expensive.  \n\n\n\n\n\n <p>\n\n\nThe beauty of this model is that we already have the supply (local Asian farmers) and the demand (residents, small businesses) for fresh Asian produce; what we need is funding to develop the logistics and implementation of the regional food hub, which includes the creation of a detailed business plan, technology and customer service development, and marketing/branding. With the funding, we would invest heavily in researching and developing these logistics because they are the key to establishing a successful and sustainable regional food hub. \n\n\n"
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: "SSG/APIOPA\n\n\n <p>\n\n\n*\tEstablished an Asian CommunitySupported Agriculture program, working with local Hmong farmers and selling in Downtown Los Angeles and Historic Filipinotown. We have sold out all of our subscriptions. \n\n\n <p>\n\n\n*\tImplemented a program called SAFE for APIs with the policy goal of helping children maintaining a healthy weight through the improvement of public park facilities. The program addresses health disparities by seeking to increase access to physical activity in neighborhoods where Pacific Islander (PI) populations are the densest.  Our program works with local government agencies, to adopt standards for safety, cleanliness, and culturally competent family programming to promote active and healthy lifestyles. \n\n\n\n\n\n <p>\n\n\n <p>\n\n\nSEACA\n\n\n <p>\n\n\n*\tTrained hundreds of students to become leaders in LA and our work with youth, as profiled in Hector Tobar's column for the LA times\n\n\n <p>\n\n\n*\tWorked with youth and policy experts to craft a community development policy  described as \"A Model of LA Planning,\" which will set strong environmental and equity protections for local residents \n\n\n"
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  One of our key partners will be the Southeast Asian Community Alliance
  (SEACA). SEACA is a nonprofit organization based in Chinatown, whose mission
  is to empower Southeast Asian youth in their community. SEACA is an integral
  partner because not only do they have connections to youth and residents in
  Chinatown, but also have experience organizing small business owners in the
  community as well as local, regional, and national environmental organizations
  that can provide us with technical assistance.
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  We will measure the success of our project through the completion of our
  deliverables. More specifically, by the end of the grant period, all research
  will be completed and we will have a finished business plan, which includes
  technology, marketing, branding, and other aspects we need to successfully
  implement the regional food hub. 
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: "Our vision is to have a triple bottom line: support local businesses and farms, provide vital sustenance to local communities, and support a greener environment. \n\n\n\n\n\n <p>\n\n\nChinatown is home to over 15 markets that sell Asian produce. Currently many of these markets are getting the last pick of produce from suppliers because they cannot compete with the big box retailers; according to the owners, the profit margins are extremely narrow. With the regional food hub model, we would directly source to these markets and corner stores at an affordable rate while simultaneously reducing a key contributer to LA's pollution problem.\n\n\n <p>\n\n\nBy connecting local businesses directly to local farmers, we have the ability to improve economic, health, and environmental outcomes in our community in the following ways:\n\n\n\n\n\n <p>\n\n\n*\tFor every $100 spent at a local business, $45 stays in the  community, compared to only $13 if the money is spent at a national chain store.\n\n\n\n\n\n <p>\n\n\n*\tMost chain stores source their produce from thousands of miles away, whereas our model will be sourcing produce from 200 miles away, significantly lowering our carbon footprint.\n\n\n\n\n\n <p>\n\n\n*\tImproving the type and quality of produce available will increase access, consumption, and demand of healthy, high quality, locally grown food by residents.\n\n\n\n\n\n <p>\n\n\nThe regional food hub not only supports and grows the capacity of local small businesses, but it also helps do the same for the farmers we will work with. The regional food hub will invest funds early to developing our small business partners within the community. Workshops and capacity building for the local farmers and the small business owners we will be working with will be crucial in how well this model performs. By having stronger small businesses, Los Angeles will see great benefits not only from greater access to healthy food,  but also from greater economic output and cleaner air. If we succeed in reducing just 0.01% of our food miles we will have 25 tons fewer of global warming gases in LA.\n\n\n\n\n\n <p>\n\n\nHere are some of the current facts about health in LA County: \n\n\n <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n*\tIn LA City Council District 1, which includes Chinatown, adult obesity rates are at 23.3% and childhood obesity rates are at 27.8%. (CCPHA, Obesity and Mortality Report, 2011)\n\n\n\n\n\n <p>\n\n\n*\tAsians across Los Angeles County have low rates of eating 5 servings of fruits and vegetables a day; only 35.9% of Asians eat the recommended amount of produce in a given day. (CHIS, UCLA 2009)\n\n\n\n\n\n <p>\n\n\n*\t53.9% of Chinatown residents are not eating the recommended 5 fruits and vegetables a day. (CHIS, UCLA 2005)\n\n\n"
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  Our vision for 2050 is to create a healthy and thriving system of locally
  sourced food in Chinatown that can serve as a model of sustainability for the
  rest of the City.  By following through on our business plan and creating the
  actual Chinatown food hub, we will be connecting local farmers to local
  businesses and residents. We will be creating an alternative system that would
  ensure fair prices for consumers,  fair wages for farmers and workers, and
  better air quality for the whole city. It is also our hope that because we are
  sourcing food locally, we would rebuild the connections between growers and
  consumers that have been largely abandoned by a more industrial food sourcing
  system.

    One of the goals of this project is to give small businesses a chance
    against the mega-corporations that import their food from across the globe.
    Rather than allow big conglomerates, such as Walmart, to dominate the future
    of Chinatown, this project will instead create a regional food hub that will
    create healthy, thriving local communities where we can support residents,
    local businesses/farmers, AND the environment. This model is about
    self-determination -- both for the residents and small business owners of
    Chinatown, as well as for small local farmers to grow what they want and
    sell for prices that are fair for all, but also to not have to sacrifice our
    lungs because we are unable to afford local food. Our food hub model
    provides small corner stores an alternative source for fresh, healthy Asian
    vegetables. Our model cuts out the middleman and passes the savings to the
    farmers, residents, and  small business store owners, all the while reducing
    greenhouse gases.

With the regional food hub model, we would directly source to these markets and corner stores at an affordable rate while simultaneously reducing a key contributer to LA's pollution problem.\r\n <p>\r\nBy connecting local businesses directly to local farmers, we have the ability to improve economic, health, and environmental outcomes in our community in the following ways:\r\n\r\n <p>\r\n•\tFor every $100 spent at a local business, $45 stays in the  community, compared to only $13 if the money is spent at a national chain store.\r\n\r\n <p>\r\n•\tMost chain stores source their produce from thousands of miles away, whereas our model will be sourcing produce from 200 miles away, significantly lowering our carbon footprint.\r\n\r\n <p>\r\n•\tImproving the type and quality of produce available will increase access, consumption, and demand of healthy, high quality, locally grown food by residents.\r\n\r\n <p>\r\nThe regional food hub not only supports and grows the capacity of local small businesses, but it also helps do the same for the farmers we will work with. The regional food hub will invest funds early to developing our small business partners within the community. Workshops and capacity building for the local farmers and the small business owners we will be working with will be crucial in how well this model performs. By having stronger small businesses, Los Angeles will see great benefits not only from greater access to healthy food,  but also from greater economic output and cleaner air. If we succeed in reducing just 0.01% of our food miles we will have 25 tons fewer of global warming gases in LA.\r\n\r\n <p>\r\nHere are some of the current facts about health in LA County: \r\n <p>\r\n\r\n•\tIn LA City Council District 1, which includes Chinatown, adult obesity rates are at 23.3% and childhood obesity rates are at 27.8%. (CCPHA, Obesity and Mortality Report, 2011)\r\n\r\n <p>\r\n•\tAsians across Los Angeles County have low rates of eating 5 servings of fruits and vegetables a day; only 35.9% of Asians eat the recommended amount of produce in a given day. (CHIS, UCLA 2009)\r\n\r\n <p>\r\n•\t53.9% of Chinatown residents are not eating the recommended 5 fruits and vegetables a day. (CHIS, UCLA 2005)\r\n"

      One of our key partners will be the Southeast Asian Community Alliance
      (SEACA). SEACA is a nonprofit organization based in Chinatown, whose
      mission is to empower Southeast Asian youth in their community. SEACA is
      an integral partner because not only do they have connections to youth and
      residents in Chinatown, but also have experience organizing small business
      owners in the community as well as local, regional, and national
      environmental organizations that can provide us with technical assistance.

      We will measure the success of our project through the completion of our
      deliverables. More specifically, by the end of the grant period, all
      research will be completed and we will have a finished business plan,
      which includes technology, marketing, branding, and other aspects we need
      to successfully implement the regional food hub.

      One of the goals of this project is to give small businesses a chance
      against the mega-corporations that import their food from across the
      globe. Rather than allow big conglomerates, such as Walmart, to dominate
      the future of Chinatown, this project will instead create a regional food
      hub that will create healthy, thriving local communities where we can
      support residents, local businesses/farmers, AND the environment. This
      model is about self-determination -- both for the residents and small
      business owners of Chinatown, as well as for small local farmers to grow
      what they want and sell for prices that are fair for all, but also to not
      have to sacrifice our lungs because we are unable to afford local food.
      Our food hub model provides small corner stores an alternative source for
      fresh, healthy Asian vegetables. Our model cuts out the middleman and
      passes the savings to the farmers, residents, and  small business store
      owners, all the while reducing greenhouse gases.

      Our vision for 2050 is to create a healthy and thriving system of locally
      sourced food in Chinatown that can serve as a model of sustainability for
      the rest of the City.  By following through on our business plan and
      creating the actual Chinatown food hub, we will be connecting local
      farmers to local businesses and residents. We will be creating an
      alternative system that would ensure fair prices for consumers,  fair
      wages for farmers and workers, and better air quality for the whole city.
      It is also our hope that because we are sourcing food locally, we would
      rebuild the connections between growers and consumers that have been
      largely abandoned by a more industrial food sourcing system.
