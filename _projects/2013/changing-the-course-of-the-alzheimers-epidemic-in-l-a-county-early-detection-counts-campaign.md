El Portal has been replicated in numerous locations throughout the state and beyond.  It has also been replicated in African American, Chinese, Vietnamese, Filipino, and Japanese communities.  The Chapter’s program for Asian Americans with Alzheimer’s disease and their caregivers was awarded the 2006 Met Life Foundation/National Center for Caregiving award for innovation in education and Alzheimer’s disease and the 2011 Rosalynn and Arthur Gilbert Foundation’s Caregiving Legacy Award.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The challenge of delivering quality health care to people with dementia has also been addressed successfully by this chapter of the Association.

  brief: "<p>Los Angeles County is sorely underprepared for the aging of our region’s population.  The number of older adults in this area is growing dramatically and this has ramifications for our health care system, our families, our schools, and our businesses. Never before have so many lived such long lives.  Over the past 100 years, our society has addressed many root causes of early mortality – infectious diseases like polio and TB have declined dramatically. More recently, we’ve seen a dramatic fall in mortality rates from chronic health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers. A diagnosis of cancer of AIDS is no longer a death notice.  We’ve learned ways to decrease risk for diabetes and heart disease and to better manage their care.  Now we are seeing the rise of the scourge of the 21st Century, and that is Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. </p> \r\n\r\n<p>Currently, in Los Angeles County there are 165,000 people living with Alzheimer’s disease and more with related disorders.  By 2050, this number is expected to triple.  Our region will have more people living with Alzheimer’s disease than the entire current population of the cities of Sacramento or Long Beach.  Due to poorer health care access and rapidly aging populations, the numbers of local Latinos and Asians with cognitive impairment is going to increase even more quickly.  Yet, we know that fewer than 25% of people with Alzheimer’s disease or a related dementia ever get a diagnosis and if a disease isn’t recognized, it cannot be treated.  These conditions are the silent epidemic of the new century.</p>  \r\n\r\n<p>If this epidemic is not checked and care is not improved, then:</p>\r\n<p>•\tCognitive impairment will complicate the care of all other chronic conditions, putting a tremendous financial burden on hospitals, on public programs like Medicare and MediCal and on families.</p>\r\n<p>•\tCaregiving families will be forced to make stark sacrifices, financially and emotionally, to care for their loved ones.</p>\r\n<p>•\tChildren in these families will not receive the attention and resources they need to thrive as families dedicate time and money to keep impaired loved ones at home.</p>\r\n<p>•\tFamilies will be forced to provide complex care on their own as there will be insufficient health care and community care providers to meet the epidemic level of need.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, all is not bleak.  Due to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) there are opportunities to address this emerging epidemic through our re-organized health care system.  This year, for the first time, the federal government has begun to mandate an Annual Wellness Visit for all Americans.  A required part of this medical visit will be a screen for cognitive impairment.  If implemented successfully, this new benefit will result in the systematic and early identification of people with cognitive impairment.  It will also mean that cognitively impaired people will be referred for diagnosis so that reversible forms of dementia can be identified and treated.  For those diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease or a related condition, it will mean that minimally, their other co-existing conditions (like diabetes and heart disease) will be cared for more appropriately, cutting unnecessary patient suffering, family burden, and health care costs.  As more effective treatments for Alzheimer’s come to market, earlier detection will mean that these treatments reach patients earlier in the disease, when they can have a more significant effect.</p>  \r\n\r\n<p>To impact the health of Angelenos in this first half of the 21st Century, the Alzheimer’s Association, California Southland Chapter proposes to leverage the new Annual Wellness Visits mandated through the ACA to reach L.A.’s physicians and other health care providers with information and tools about: </p>\r\n<p>1.\tHow to screen their patients for cognitive impairment;</p>\r\n<p>2.\tHow to manage these conditions both medically and through family support.</p>\r\n<p>Collaborating with local health care provider associations and health care organizations, the Association will disseminate a brief one-page document that can be distributed as a centerfold in medical providers’ newsletters, posted on their websites, or distributed by health insurers.  Following up on this written communication, the Alzheimer’s Association will develop a cadre of volunteers to make office calls and visits to reinforce the importance of early detection and emphasize the availability of training and resources to support providers, patients and caregivers.</p>\r\n"

Better care and access to community supports may also reduce expensive and unnecessary stays in nursing homes.

    The Alzheimer’s Association California Southland Chapter works closely and
    often in collaboration with its competitors.  We face competition from
    Alzheimer’s Research Centers at local universities when we raise funds to
    support research.  However, our competitors are also some of our greatest
    supporters.  They collaborate with the Association by serving on our Board
    of Directors, our Medical and Scientific Advisory Council and as media
    spokespersons.  Numerous local non-profits also serve people with
    Alzheimer’s disease and their families.  While we compete with these
    organizations for funding, we also work closely with them to develop and
    implement services.  Some of our closest allies and competitors include
    Jewish Family Services, Partners in Care Foundation, St. Barnabus Senior
    Center, OPICA, AltaMed , Little Tokyo Service Center and Leeza’s Place.  If
    funded, these “competitors” will be given the opportunity to join us in
    implementing the Early Detection Counts campaign.  
  vision: "<p>As a result of an investment in the Early Detection Counts campaign there will be a change in the course of the Alzheimer’s epidemic in Los Angeles County. Our vision is a community in which:</p>\r\n<p>•\tIndividuals with cognitive impairment will be screened and if appropriate, sent for a diagnostic work-up.</p>\r\n<p>•\tAll diagnosed people with a dementing disease will have access to treatment for the disease and high quality management of co-morbid illnesses.</p>\r\n<p>•\tPeople living with dementia and their families will be connected to community services for support, disease education, and care planning to optimize their lives.</p>\r\n<p>•\tPeople living with dementia will receive appropriate community-based care and not receive inappropriate institutional care in hospitals or nursing homes.</p>\r\n<p>•\tMediCal dollars will be preserved rather than squandered inappropriately.</p>\r\n"
