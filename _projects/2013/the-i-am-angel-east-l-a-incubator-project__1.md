title: 'THE i.am.angel EAST L.A. INCUBATOR PROJECT '
indicator: ' Income & Employment'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >+
  We want to build a startup incubator program in East LA to foster
  entrepreneurship in underserved communities that have low access to technology
  and startup resources. ****** Los Angeles has been ranked the #3 startup city
  in the world, behind San Francisco and Tel Aviv! However, the LA tech
  ecosystem is concentrated in more affluent areas such as Santa Monica, Venice
  and West Hollywood.  Meanwhile, East LA is an area with a rich history of
  makers and creators, and with just as much entrepreneurial spirit.  Yet it
  lacks the resources needed to tap into the local tech startup scene. ****** By
  bringing this startup incubator program to East LA, we are fostering local
  talent and providing topnotch education and mentorship from successful
  entrepreneurs. This will bring valuable jobs and job skills to underserved
  communities.  Not only does this help to uplift a struggling neighborhood, but
  it creates a better overall startup ecosystem for the entire city of Los
  Angeles — by creating a larger pool of talent coming from diverse backgrounds
  and walks of life. ****** Our startup incubator program will provide the
  following to East LA communities: ****** EDUCATION: Provide classes in
  entrepreneurship (such as how to formulate a business plan, how to pitch a VC,
  how to use social media, legal and accounting seminars etc) and relevant tech
  skills such as coding, web development, UX design, graphic design and more. 









  ****** MENTORSHIP:  Provide a forum for mentorship between local aspiring
  entrepreneurs and experienced business experts. Our team is wellconnected to
  the LA tech, entertainment, and investment communities, which will provide an
  endless source of mentorship. 









  ****** PROFESSIONAL NETWORKING:  We hope to create a network of skilled
  professionals who are capable of joining or creating jobs in tech and
  startups.  We will provide a platform for networking with each other, and with
  tech companies and startups from all over LA. 









  ****** WORK SPACE: Provide coworking/office space at low cost to
  locallyfocused startups. Our facility will be the historic Casa Del Mexicano
  building in Boyle Heights, East LA.  The i.am.angel Foundation is currently
  renovating the building to turn it into a stateoftheart community center,
  which will also house other programs in STEM and Arts education. It will be a
  perfect space for the crosspollination of ideas that leads to innovation!









  ****** CAPITAL: Provide seed funding for startups that fit certain criteria,
  such as startups that are focused locally on the East LA community, or
  startups that promote social good.  By the end of 2013, we hope to identify
  and support 5 local startups in East LA with $10,000 each in seed funding. 


What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >+
  The i.am.angel Foundation seeks to transform lives through education,
  opportunity and inspiration.  We have spearheaded several programs that are
  transforming lives in East LA, particularly the Boyle Heights community. Here
  are our biggest and most successful programs: ****** i.am College Track ******
  College Track is a national educational organization that empowers students
  from underserved communities to reach their dreams of a college degree.
  College Track actively engages students over the course of eight years, from
  the summer before high school through college graduation. 100% of College
  Track seniors graduate from high school, more than 90% are admitted to a
  fouryear university, and 75% of College Track students are currently enrolled,
  or have graduated from, college. Over 85% of College Track students will be
  the first person in their family to earn a college degree.  The i.am College
  Track program serves 50 ambitious new students from Roosevelt High School
  every year, and continues to work with them over an 8 year cycle. ****** i.am
  Home ****** In 2010, during the height of the foreclosure crisis, the i.am
  Home program was launched. The program works with effective partner
  organizations to promote financial literacy education and provide home owner
  assistance grants to support qualifying families in need.  To date i.am Home
  has provided more than $400,000 in home owner assistance grants. ****** i.am
  Scholarship ****** The i.am Scholarship program was launched in 2009. The
  program works with effective partner organizations like Oprah Winfrey’s Angel
  Network, Scholastic America and College Track to identify qualifying students
  in need of financial support. i.am angel selects students with a proven record
  of accomplishment and gives them the opportunity to chase their dreams through
  scholarship.  To date the i.am Scholarship program has directly invested more
  than $500,000 in America’s future.


Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >+
  We will work with an education partner such as General Assembly L.A.
  (https://generalassemb.ly/locations/losangeles), which provides a network of
  qualified instructors in entrepreneurship and tech skills.  The i.am.angel
  Foundation will make sure the classes will be affordable for the East LA
  communities.  We also work closely with ELACC, the East LA Community
  Corporation (http://www.elacc.org/), who are our partners at the Casa Del
  Mexicano.  They will also provide valuable outreach to the East LA community. 


Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  1. We will look closely at attendance of the program’s classes and events.  We
  will survey participants of their experience, aiming for value, diversity and
  crosspollination.  2. We will track success stories and chronicle them in our
  website and other social media platforms. We will write blogs and produce
  video content. 3.  We will monitor socioeconomic effects on the community,
  looking at factors such as the creation of local businesses and jobs. 4. We
  will evaluate the performance of the 5 local startups chosen to receive seed
  funding from this program.  
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
  An East LA incubator project will benefit ALL of Los Angeles, not just the
  east side. Here’s WHY: 





          Our incubator program creates a better overall startup ecosystem for the entire city of Los Angeles, by creating a LARGER and more DIVERSE pool of entrepreneurial talent. The future needs solutions that involve EVERYONE.





          Our incubator program will foster entrepreneurship in struggling communities that are often burdened with crime, violence, and unemployment.  By providing education and opportunity, we will enable people to start successful legitimate businesses, or gain the highdemand and highpaying skills needed to work in tech, rather than doing illegal things.





  This has a halo effect on so many other factors.  Not only could it boost the
  local economy, creating jobs for local young people, but they will also be
  more likely to stay in the neighborhoods and continue to improve them.  It
  could reduce crime and violence, and increase safety in these struggling
  neighborhoods and surrounding areas.  The East LA incubator program can serve
  as a model for other similar communities around the world.   





          Our incubator program will give seed funding, supporting the creation of startups that provide value to the local community, especially those focusing on social good. Our project could be funding the future hottest LA startups promoting arts & cultural vitality, education, environmental quality, health, housing, income & employment, public safety, and social connectedness.


What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >+
  In the year 2050, the LA tech and startup communities will look a lot more
  like LA itself:  culturally diverse, rich in differing talent, opinions,
  backgrounds, and walks of life. LA will be a true breeding ground for
  innovation.  There will also be greater focus on companies that produce
  sustainable and social good.  LA will also be home to stronger communities
  with vibrant local economies that match the unique culture of each.  Our
  vision is that the i.am.angel incubator model will have hubs in various
  communities all over Los Angeles.
