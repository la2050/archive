    The app will collect metrics on its users, not just in recording social
    actions but in how and when users use the app. By analyzing this data, we
    can determine if users have engaged enough with the game, and see if their
    actions have raised the social network profile of Los Angeles locations and
    landmarks through measured check-ins and other game activity.

  What is the future of LA in 2050?  The evolve.la mobile social game lets the
  citizens of Los Angeles decide for themselves, while discovering LA in an
  immersive and participatory way using their iOS or Android mobile device.



  </p>






  <p>



  The evolve.la social game consists of two components: 



  </p>






  <p><h4>



  MOBILE SOCIAL GAME



  </h4></p>



  <p>



  The evolve.la app allows users to become activists through the use of
  locationbased social media in order to support 8 causes based on the 8 LA2050
  indicators.



  </p>



  <p>



  By syncing their Facebook accounts with the app, evolve.la scans social
  network activity to score points in one of 8 indicator categories:



  </p>






  <p><b>



  Education:</b>  The state of educational institutions, libraries, and palaces
  of learning.



  </p>






  <p><b>



  Environmental Quality:</b>  Air quality, the state of parks and forests.



  </p>






  <p><b>



  Health:</b>  Access to health care as well as the personal health of Los
  Angelinos.



  </p>






  <p><b>



  Social Connectedness:</b>  Engagement with the community and communication
  with your fellow Los Angelinos.



  </p>






  <p><b>



  Arts & Cultural Vitality:</b>  Museums, theater, street art.



  </p>






  <p><b>



  Income & Employment:</b>  Entrepreneurialism, commerce, and job creation.



  </p>






  <p><b>



  Housing:</b>  Affordable housing, homeless issues.



  </p>






  <p><b>



  Public Safety:</b>  Crime rates, natural disasters.



  </p>






  <p>



  When the user first runs the app, she picks a team aligned with one of the 8
  categories. The user is identified in the game with a badge all players
  belonging to that category have as their avatar.  The app shows a map centered
  on the user’s current location that highlights locations nearby associated
  with one of the 8 indicators.



  </p>



  <p>



  Via monitoring checkins, tagged photos and hashtags, users “vote” with their
  social actions.  By checking in at a Library points will be awarded in the
  Education category, for example. Or, tagging a picture at a farmers market
  scores points in the Health category (for organic food).  Through the course
  of the game, points are tallied up in each of the 8 categories.  At the end of
  the game’s run, a donation will be made to a charity related to the winning
  indicator.



  </p>



  <p><h4>



  LIVE MONTHLY SCAVENGER HUNT



  </h4></p>



  <p>



  To promote competitiveness and encourage personal exploration of the issues in
  realworld locations, users can also participate in live monthly challenges to
  score bonus points for their cause of choice.



  </p>



  <p>



  Each month, the app will launch two quests related to one of the 8 indicator
  categories. These quests will deploy as scavenger hunts in the Los Angeles
  area, showcasing realworld locations. 



  </p>



  <p>



  Using Augmented Reality technology, players scan landmarks, signs, and other
  features at real Los Angeles locations to receive the next clue. Once the
  final clue has been scanned, extra bonus points are awarded to the player’s
  cause.



  </p>



  <p>



  The app encourages the exploration of Los Angeles as well as social
  connections between its citizens.  A message board and Facebook group for
  evolve.la allow players to discuss their favorite causes, strategies for
  completing quests, as well as locations to checkin to.  This fosters a
  community around improving Los Angeles, thus addressing the social
  connectedness indicator.

What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  <p>FLARB LLC is one of the earliest developers and publishers of mobile games
  and content in the West.  In addition to consulting on mobile and social games
  FLARB recently created Camera Birds (www.camerabirds.com), a unique 3D
  birdwatching simulator for iOS and Android that uses Augmented Reality
  technology to bring its virtual birds into the real world.



  </p>



  <p>



  FLARB LLC's mobile games often do not fit the mold of traditional
  entertainment.   One of FLARB's more popular experiments in pushing boundaries
  is Brick Buddies (www.flarb.com/bb), a hilarious satire of social games that
  has been favorably reviewed by such media outlets as The Guardian.  Creating
  apps as a platform for social activism is a natural next step.



  </p>



  <p>



  FLARB LLC has the expertise in the design and development of mobile apps as
  well as the Augmented Reality technology necessary to build this application.

  April Arrglington (www.thearrglingtonjump.com) is a Transmedia Producer
  passionate about interactive design, immersive storytelling, and strategizing
  best points of convergence for intellectual properties, fandom phenomena, and
  multiple platforms. April’s latest project, The Miracle Mile Paradox Alternate
  Reality Game, involved the deployment of an online universe and an ongoing
  live experience that lasted through the Summer of 2012.</p>
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  The app will collect metrics on its users, not just in recording social
  actions but in how and when users use the app. By analyzing this data, we can
  determine if users have engaged enough with the game, and see if their actions
  have raised the social network profile of Los Angeles locations and landmarks
  through measured checkins and other game activity.
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  <p>



  evolve.la creates a conversation around the different social causes, while
  reconnecting to significant places and landmarks in Los Angeles. In addition,
  it engages the community to think about Los Angeles and how we can change the
  city for the better in the future, while encouraging a common goal of
  improving our cultural vitality and shared surroundings.



  </p>



  <p>



  At the end of the game, the winning indicator category raises awareness by
  benefiting a charity of choice relating to its cause. A portion of the budget
  for the game will be devoted to this donation. 



  </p>



  <p>



  In addition, all the data collected from the game will be released in a case
  study that will present the measurable behavior of the users in the present,
  and how new technologies will change the evolution of our social connectedness
  in the future.



  </p>
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  <p>In 2050, we should see large advancements in the indicator that wins at the
  end of this social gaming experiment. The people’s voice has spoken, and
  hopefully it won’t take over 30 years for its actions to be seen.



  </p>






  <p>



  In addition to thiswe should see a continuing conversation fostered by
  improved social connectedness among Los Angelinos about the betterment of the
  city and its indicators.  This can be measured by social media sentiment
  analysis as well as activity in apps such as evolve.la.
