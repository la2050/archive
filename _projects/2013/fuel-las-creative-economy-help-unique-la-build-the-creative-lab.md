title: Fuel LAs Creative Economy Help UNIQUE LA Build The Creative Lab!
project_summary: "UNIQUE LA has helped over 4000 artists/designers/entrepreneurs increase revenues and become sustainable businesses by selling their goods to the public. At the same time we've created a cultural institution and thriving community that supports local art, design, craft. It's time to take the next step in our mission of helping LA's art and design community... Our plan is to open the UNIQUE LA Creative Lab, a co-work & creative event space that would provide the much-needed tools that creative small business owners need in order to become sustainable and grow successfully.\r\n\r\nCreatives who work for themselves (artists, designers, furniture makers, freelancers, film makers, writers, etc.), are actually entrepreneurs and small business owners. They are curious, innovative and visionary... They also have to wear ALL the hats when owning a business - they are in fact their own PR firm, accounting department, marketing engine, HR manager. It's a lot to take on. They need help, guidance and a place to connect with a like-minded community so that they can thrive not just as artists but business owners. Someone who is creative should be able to be great at what they do, and make a great living doing it.\r\n  \r\nUNIQUE LA’s Creative Lab will help ensure LA’s arts and culture community is growing strong, and growing smart. The Creative Lab will achieve this in two ways. First, it will provide a membership-based co-work environment, allowing people to share creative office and studio space (complete with a kitchen, board room, photo studio and more). And second, The Creative Lab will have an event space that will offer a diverse range of monthly and weekly programming, from workshops to a speaker series to parties and special events. All curated to ensure members and the public have access to continuing education, networking opportunities and inspiration. \r\n\r\nEvery month we will feature a keynote speaker from world-famous artists to authors. Monthly workshops will range from “How to Find Investors” to “DIY Public Relations” to “Utilizing Social Media to Increase Profits”. Members will be invited to networking events with editors, to help them gain press attention. Trade show representatives will host How To seminars, helping designers learn how to grow by selling wholesale, instead of direct to consumer. Special events such as fashion shows will celebrate local talent and showcase new design and art. Imagine the amazing impact one space can have, when it TEACHES multiple generations how to be creative and make a living! Even better, it encourages and shows how to become a business that grows to support multiple employees!\r\n\r\nAside from having an astounding impact on Arts & Culture in LA, The Creative Lab will actually touch on and help all eight sectors listed in the Goldhirsh Foundation’s LA2050 Report. Through programming, we will curate meaningful conversation, activities and hands-on workshops surrounding all eight areas – for instance we will host a ‘Volunteer Fair’ where local non-profits (from education to health to arts) can connect with members looking for places to volunteer. \r\n\r\nUNIQUE LA's Creative Lab is a ground-breaking new idea. The 2012 OTIS Report states \"there are more artists, writers, filmmakers, actors, dancers and musicians living and working in LA than any other city at any other time in the history of civilization.\" It's time LA got a space designed to ensure those people - the creatives that are fueling the economy - are well-trained, inspired and ready to grow.   \r\n"

    We expect to include local designers and organizations, as well as some of
    our corporate partners such as West Elm and Square to help us in creating
    the space. We also plan to create a great Board of Directors to help mentor,
    assist with programming and more.

  description3: "The mantra \"We're all in this together\" is very important to UNIQUE LA. We don't view others as competition, rather \"community\". It's in fact part of our mission. Our working relationship with others in our community is really great, and part of what makes us good at our job and why we love what we do. By working together with others we increase our chances of success and reach!\r\n\r\nAt The Creative Lab, we plan to engage others in the co-work community (such as The HubLA) and creative/education community. We will include them in our planning stage and beyond. Once open, we can help one another by working together. Our mission is to help LA's creative economy thrive and to give tools to creatives to ensure their success - doing so involves many people and great local organizations. We're excited to get started!"
  vision: >-
    In the year 2050 the image of "the starving artist" would no longer exist.
    We have grown to educate artists and creatives not just in art theory and
    practice, but also in business. Essentially we've shown creatives how to be
    entrepreneurs, ensuring a successful and thriving creative economy. There
    are more artists and also more small businesses run by artists. When asked
    what they'd like to be when they grow up, children give answers such as
    Furniture Designer and Architect just as often as Doctor and Lawyer. Our
    view of 2050 is that we've grown LA's creative economy to be the best in the
    world, with bright stars and smart business owners. The Artist is no longer
    starving but successful and happy.

  UNIQUE LA’s Creative Lab will help ensure LA’s arts and culture community is
  growing strong, and growing smart. The Creative Lab will achieve this in two
  ways. First, it will provide a membership-based co-work environment, allowing
  people to share creative office and studio space (complete with a kitchen,
  board room, photo studio and more). And second, The Creative Lab will have an
  event space that will offer a diverse range of monthly and weekly programming,
  from workshops to a speaker series to parties and special events. All curated
  to ensure members and the public have access to continuing education,
  networking opportunities and inspiration. 






  Every month we will feature a keynote speaker from world-famous artists to
  authors. Monthly workshops will range from “How to Find Investors” to “DIY
  Public Relations” to “Utilizing Social Media to Increase Profits”. Members
  will be invited to networking events with editors, to help them gain press
  attention. Trade show representatives will host How To seminars, helping
  designers learn how to grow by selling wholesale, instead of direct to
  consumer. Special events such as fashion shows will celebrate local talent and
  showcase new design and art. Imagine the amazing impact one space can have,
  when it TEACHES multiple generations how to be creative and make a living!
  Even better, it encourages and shows how to become a business that grows to
  support multiple employees!






  Aside from having an astounding impact on Arts & Culture in LA, The Creative
  Lab will actually touch on and help all eight sectors listed in the Goldhirsh
  Foundation’s LA2050 Report. Through programming, we will curate meaningful
  conversation, activities and hands-on workshops surrounding all eight areas —
  for instance we will host a ‘Volunteer Fair’ where local non-profits (from
  education to health to arts) can connect with members looking for places to
  volunteer. 






  UNIQUE LA's Creative Lab is a ground-breaking new idea. The 2012 OTIS Report
  states "there are more artists, writers, filmmakers, actors, dancers and
  musicians living and working in LA than any other city at any other time in
  the history of civilization." It's time LA got a space designed to ensure
  those people - the creatives that are fueling the economy - are well-trained,
  inspired and ready to grow.

  amazing successes and have expanded in many ways, but I think these numbers
