title: Fuel LAs Creative Economy Help UNIQUE LA Build The Creative Lab!
indicator: Arts & Cultural Vitality
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >+
  UNIQUE LA has helped over 4000 artists/designers/entrepreneurs increase
  revenues and become sustainable businesses by selling their goods to the
  public. At the same time we've created a cultural institution and thriving
  community that supports local art, design, craft. It's time to take the next
  step in our mission of helping LA's art and design community... Our plan is to
  open the UNIQUE LA Creative Lab, a co-work & creative event space that would
  provide the much-needed tools that creative small business owners need in
  order to become sustainable and grow successfully.






  Creatives who work for themselves (artists, designers, furniture makers,
  freelancers, film makers, writers, etc.), are actually entrepreneurs and small
  business owners. They are curious, innovative and visionary... They also have
  to wear ALL the hats when owning a business - they are in fact their own PR
  firm, accounting department, marketing engine, HR manager. It's a lot to take
  on. They need help, guidance and a place to connect with a like-minded
  community so that they can thrive not just as artists but business owners.
  Someone who is creative should be able to be great at what they do, and make a
  great living doing it.


    


  UNIQUE LA’s Creative Lab will help ensure LA’s arts and culture community is
  growing strong, and growing smart. The Creative Lab will achieve this in two
  ways. First, it will provide a membership-based co-work environment, allowing
  people to share creative office and studio space (complete with a kitchen,
  board room, photo studio and more). And second, The Creative Lab will have an
  event space that will offer a diverse range of monthly and weekly programming,
  from workshops to a speaker series to parties and special events. All curated
  to ensure members and the public have access to continuing education,
  networking opportunities and inspiration. 






  Every month we will feature a keynote speaker from world-famous artists to
  authors. Monthly workshops will range from “How to Find Investors” to “DIY
  Public Relations” to “Utilizing Social Media to Increase Profits”. Members
  will be invited to networking events with editors, to help them gain press
  attention. Trade show representatives will host How To seminars, helping
  designers learn how to grow by selling wholesale, instead of direct to
  consumer. Special events such as fashion shows will celebrate local talent and
  showcase new design and art. Imagine the amazing impact one space can have,
  when it TEACHES multiple generations how to be creative and make a living!
  Even better, it encourages and shows how to become a business that grows to
  support multiple employees!






  Aside from having an astounding impact on Arts & Culture in LA, The Creative
  Lab will actually touch on and help all eight sectors listed in the Goldhirsh
  Foundation’s LA2050 Report. Through programming, we will curate meaningful
  conversation, activities and hands-on workshops surrounding all eight areas —
  for instance we will host a ‘Volunteer Fair’ where local non-profits (from
  education to health to arts) can connect with members looking for places to
  volunteer. 






  UNIQUE LA's Creative Lab is a ground-breaking new idea. The 2012 OTIS Report
  states "there are more artists, writers, filmmakers, actors, dancers and
  musicians living and working in LA than any other city at any other time in
  the history of civilization." It's time LA got a space designed to ensure
  those people - the creatives that are fueling the economy - are well-trained,
  inspired and ready to grow.   


What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  UNIQUE LA has created the largest buy local design show in the country - and
  is the only show to curate and show-off local-made talent. We have brought
  international attention to LA and its great makers (press mentions have
  included Details Magazine, Elle France, Uppercase). In four years we've had
  amazing successes and have expanded in many ways, but I think these numbers
  illustrate the great impact we've had.






  - 232,000 people have attended UNIQUE shows



  - We've provided a platform for sales and exposure for over 8000 independent
  designers + artists



  - Occupied a total of 424,000 square feet! 



  - Produced shows in 3 cities, LA/NYC/SF 



  - An estimated $9.3 million has been spent at UNIQUE shows (all that money
  goes right back into the local economy)
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  We expect to include local designers and organizations, as well as some of our
  corporate partners such as West Elm and Square to help us in creating the
  space. We also plan to create a great Board of Directors to help mentor,
  assist with programming and more.
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: |-
  Success will be measured by how the Unique Creative Lab directly


  affects communities in the LA region.  Indicators will be:


  1) Attendance of workshops and events


  2) Membership to co-work space


  3) Press and media attention already engaging in Unique LA


  4) Evaluation forms to hear from members and participants


  5) Innovative ways to reach the public based on collaborative ideas


  coming from the Unique Creative Lab
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: |-
  The Unique Creative Lab will directly impact Los Angeles is multiple


  ways and will benefit, and further fuel all sectors of the growing


  creative economy:





  1)   By directly increasing the amount of small business owners and


  entrepreneurs in the LA region.





  2)   By providing applicable resources for individuals, groups,


  organizations and communities to see their ideas to fruition.





  3)   By creating a diverse center of collaboration that reflects on


  and includes all demographics necessary in accomplishing a more


  creative and sustainable LA.





  4)   By providing curated programing to the public that will generate


  valuable and innovative discussion at a grassroots level.





  5)   By providing a co-work space available to creative professionals


  from across the US and the world, as allowing them to participate in


  the mission and goals of the Unique Creative Lab.





  6)   By bringing national awareness and media attention to our


  community and the joint mission of LA2050 and the Unique Creative Lab.





  7)   By becoming a successful and inspirational model of action for


  other communities and cities to follow.
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  In the year 2050 the image of "the starving artist" would no longer exist. We
  have grown to educate artists and creatives not just in art theory and
  practice, but also in business. Essentially we've shown creatives how to be
  entrepreneurs, ensuring a successful and thriving creative economy. There are
  more artists and also more small businesses run by artists. When asked what
  they'd like to be when they grow up, children give answers such as Furniture
  Designer and Architect just as often as Doctor and Lawyer. Our view of 2050 is
  that we've grown LA's creative economy to be the best in the world, with
  bright stars and smart business owners. The Artist is no longer starving but
  successful and happy.
