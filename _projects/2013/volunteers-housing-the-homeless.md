title: volunteers housing the homeless
project_summary: >-
  For 25 years the all-volunteer GWHFC has helped the homeless of Hollywood and
  West Hollywood survive life in the street by serving them a fantastic meal
  every night, seven nights a week, which we make entirely from high-end food
  donated to us all over town.  With the GWHFC/UCLA Mobile Clinic, which we
  founded in 2001, we help them take care of their myriad medical and legal
  concerns.  Now, we'd like to focus on getting them OFF the street, one by one,
  into safe, clean, and attractive apartments of their own choosing -- not
  public housing and not slum housing, but apartments which we wouldn't mind
  living in ourselves (just as the meals we serve are planned and prepared to
  our taste, as if we were going to eat them, not they).  Over the past 18
  months we've "housed" twelve chronically homeless "clients" in that way, and
  we've come to realize that we are better at it than any of the dozen or so
  public and private agencies which use up enormous amounts of money in salary
  and overhead to do the same thing.  Why are we better?  Because we are
  volunteers, and we come to know the people we serve organically:  we meet them
  over a really good meal, and little by little they tell us about themselves,
  and we are able to figure out which of them are ready to join us back in the
  mainstream.  We aren't social scientists, and we aren't bureaucrats -- we are
  a cross-section of the community much like they are, and it is no wonder that
  they come to trust us and we come to trust them, because they know we are
  doing what we do out of love for our fellow man and for no other reason.

  success: >-
    We will measure it one homeless person at a time -- who is no longer
    homeless but back with the rest of us:  indoors, with a place to sleep at
    night, a place to wash and keep clean, a place to be warm and safe and to
    store clothes and other things, and a place to receive friends and family,
    as if having friends and family again wasn't just a matter of figuring out
    how to survive but a matter of living and enjoying life.
  description: >-
    Getting fifteen chronically homeless people off the street and into
    permanent housing will (1) vastly reduce the amount of taxpayer money spent
    to take care of them IN the street -- in shelters, in emergency rooms and
    hospitals, in police stations and jails and prisons; (2) since the effort
    will be entirely volunteer and OF the community, it will draw the community
    as a whole into a closer relationship with the homeless generally and help
    to do away with the notion that we live in one world and they live in
    another; (3) it will save fifteen perfectly good people from a downward
    spiral from which most of us would be hard pressed to pull out and, in the
    case of a number of them, it will return them to a position of productivity
    alongside the rest of us:  to jobs, to social and political interactions of
    all kinds, and (sure enough) to VOLUNTEERING to help others who are still on
    the downward spiral.

    Having been called into being as volunteers by the City of West Hollywood in
    1987, we suffered the awful realization just two years later that West
    Hollywood, as a political entity, wasn't ready to defend a group that was
    helping the homeless.  We were accused of perpetuating homelessness,
    encouraging criminal behavior, despoiling the neighborhood, and destroying
    property values -- all this for serving hungry people something to eat once
    a day -- and we were effectively run out of town and into Hollywood,
    suddenly an orphan group of volunteers but with a reputation in the media
    for having fought city hall and survived.  From that point forward we have
    only gotten braver, because little by little we came to know that there were
    a lot of people like us in the community who wanted to do something "good"
    but didn't know where to begin.  We have since fought any number of running
    battles just to keep going -- against neighbors and neighbors' groups,
    against politicians and other "social service agencies," and, just two years
    ago against a company which sued us for creating "a public and a private
    nuisance."  When that happened we were defended pro bono for eight months by
    a partner and four associates of one of the largest law firms in town, and
    at the end of it the judge in the case threw it out with prejuidice.  We are
    now stronger and more effective than we have ever been, and we continue to
    grow stronger still.  We serve an ever-better meal, to between 150 and 200
    people every night.  We have two or three new volunteers coming to us every
    day, and our ability to network in the community at large is nothing short
    of extraordinary.  As far as we know, no other ragtag grass-roots
    organization formed to help the homeless has lasted as long as we have and
    attracted so much support.  And yet we are still at the takeoff point, in
    that every new volunteer who means it has a new idea as to how we can reach
    deeper into the community and how we can avail ourselves of its strength to
    do more for the weakest among us.
  vision: >-
    Success in 2050 would be the citizens of Los Angeles -- not the politicians,
    not the activists, not the social service agencies, but the citizens -- long
    since having awakened to the fact that life is only wonderful if the wonder
    of it can be shared and celebrated as widely as possible for the greater
    good.  In the latter half of the Twentieth Century political and economic
    systems were created ostensibly to make that happen, and it simply didn't. 
    Now we have another chance:  not for ideological reasons or with a view to
    creating yet another enforceable system, but  because there is no greater
    social logic than doing good for its own sake, we should all follow our
    instincts and pitch in.  The number of volunteers who want to join the GWHFC
    is growing in geometric proportions.  By 2050 will they and others like them
    have nothing more to do, because people will no longer be living in the
    street?  Not a chance.  But there is every chance that if we keep going as
    we are going now, we will be able to move the newly homeless off the street
    almost as fast as they come to it, and it will be easier to do it than it is
    now, because most of the community will be engaged with us in the process. 
    We will ALL be volunteers.

Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  We will measure it one homeless person at a time  who is no longer homeless
  but back with the rest of us:  indoors, with a place to sleep at night, a
  place to wash and keep clean, a place to be warm and safe and to store clothes
  and other things, and a place to receive friends and family, as if having
  friends and family again wasn't just a matter of figuring out how to survive
  but a matter of living and enjoying life.
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  Getting fifteen chronically homeless people off the street and into permanent
  housing will (1) vastly reduce the amount of taxpayer money spent to take care
  of them IN the street  in shelters, in emergency rooms and hospitals, in
  police stations and jails and prisons; (2) since the effort will be entirely
  volunteer and OF the community, it will draw the community as a whole into a
  closer relationship with the homeless generally and help to do away with the
  notion that we live in one world and they live in another; (3) it will save
  fifteen perfectly good people from a downward spiral from which most of us
  would be hard pressed to pull out and, in the case of a number of them, it
  will return them to a position of productivity alongside the rest of us:  to
  jobs, to social and political interactions of all kinds, and (sure enough) to
  VOLUNTEERING to help others who are still on the downward spiral.
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  Success in 2050 would be the citizens of Los Angeles  not the politicians, not
  the activists, not the social service agencies, but the citizens  long since
  having awakened to the fact that life is only wonderful if the wonder of it
