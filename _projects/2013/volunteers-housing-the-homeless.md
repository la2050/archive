title: volunteers housing the homeless
project_summary: >-
  Having been called into being as volunteers by the City of West Hollywood in
  1987, we suffered the awful realization just two years later that West
  Hollywood, as a political entity, wasn't ready to defend a group that was
  helping the homeless.  We were accused of perpetuating homelessness,
  encouraging criminal behavior, despoiling the neighborhood, and destroying
  property values -- all this for serving hungry people something to eat once a
  day -- and we were effectively run out of town and into Hollywood, suddenly an
  orphan group of volunteers but with a reputation in the media for having
  fought city hall and survived.  From that point forward we have only gotten
  braver, because little by little we came to know that there were a lot of
  people like us in the community who wanted to do something "good" but didn't
  know where to begin.  We have since fought any number of running battles just
  to keep going -- against neighbors and neighbors' groups, against politicians
  and other "social service agencies," and, just two years ago against a company
  which sued us for creating "a public and a private nuisance."  When that
  happened we were defended pro bono for eight months by a partner and four
  associates of one of the largest law firms in town, and at the end of it the
  judge in the case threw it out with prejuidice.  We are now stronger and more
  effective than we have ever been, and we continue to grow stronger still.  We
  serve an ever-better meal, to between 150 and 200 people every night.  We have
  two or three new volunteers coming to us every day, and our ability to network
  in the community at large is nothing short of extraordinary.  As far as we
  know, no other ragtag grass-roots organization formed to help the homeless has
  lasted as long as we have and attracted so much support.  And yet we are still
  at the takeoff point, in that every new volunteer who means it has a new idea
  as to how we can reach deeper into the community and how we can avail
  ourselves of its strength to do more for the weakest among us.

  success: >-
    We will measure it one homeless person at a time -- who is no longer
    homeless but back with the rest of us:  indoors, with a place to sleep at
    night, a place to wash and keep clean, a place to be warm and safe and to
    store clothes and other things, and a place to receive friends and family,
    as if having friends and family again wasn't just a matter of figuring out
    how to survive but a matter of living and enjoying life.
  Indicator: ' Housing'
  brief: >-
    For 25 years the all-volunteer GWHFC has helped the homeless of Hollywood
    and West Hollywood survive life in the street by serving them a fantastic
    meal every night, seven nights a week, which we make entirely from high-end
    food donated to us all over town.  With the GWHFC/UCLA Mobile Clinic, which
    we founded in 2001, we help them take care of their myriad medical and legal
    concerns.  Now, we'd like to focus on getting them OFF the street, one by
    one, into safe, clean, and attractive apartments of their own choosing --
    not public housing and not slum housing, but apartments which we wouldn't
    mind living in ourselves (just as the meals we serve are planned and
    prepared to our taste, as if we were going to eat them, not they).  Over the
    past 18 months we've "housed" twelve chronically homeless "clients" in that
    way, and we've come to realize that we are better at it than any of the
    dozen or so public and private agencies which use up enormous amounts of
    money in salary and overhead to do the same thing.  Why are we better? 
    Because we are volunteers, and we come to know the people we serve
    organically:  we meet them over a really good meal, and little by little
    they tell us about themselves, and we are able to figure out which of them
    are ready to join us back in the mainstream.  We aren't social scientists,
    and we aren't bureaucrats -- we are a cross-section of the community much
    like they are, and it is no wonder that they come to trust us and we come to
    trust them, because they know we are doing what we do out of love for our
    fellow man and for no other reason. 
  budget explanation: "Assuming that we will be able to move fifteen (15) of our clients off the street on a permanent basis between May 1 and the end of the year, the following is a careful estimate of what it would cost for each:\r\n\r\ntransitional housing in a motel while we search for apartment \r\n(at the rate of $300 a week for ten weeks)                                           3000\r\n           \r\nmove-in money (first month's rent and security)                              2000\r\n\r\nfurniture and appliances (beyond that which is donated \r\n-- which is most of it)                                                                                 1000                       \r\n\r\ntransportation (gasoline for volunteers, bus passes for clients), communications (prepaid phones) and contingent expenses        660                                              \r\n\r\n                                                                         estimated total x 15     $99,900\r\n\r\n"

    Getting fifteen chronically homeless people off the street and into
    permanent housing will (1) vastly reduce the amount of taxpayer money spent
    to take care of them IN the street -- in shelters, in emergency rooms and
    hospitals, in police stations and jails and prisons; (2) since the effort
    will be entirely volunteer and OF the community, it will draw the community
    as a whole into a closer relationship with the homeless generally and help
    to do away with the notion that we live in one world and they live in
    another; (3) it will save fifteen perfectly good people from a downward
    spiral from which most of us would be hard pressed to pull out and, in the
    case of a number of them, it will return them to a position of productivity
    alongside the rest of us:  to jobs, to social and political interactions of
    all kinds, and (sure enough) to VOLUNTEERING to help others who are still on
    the downward spiral.

  description3: >-
    Our competition consists of public and private agencies which operate on an
    entirely different model than we do -- who pay their workers handsomely and
    expect them to work 9 to 5 (and never on the weekends), who use up
    unthinkable amounts of money just maintaining themselves before they can
    spend any of it on the homeless, and who, as awful as it sounds, tend to
    breed a group of helpers who, like the employees of the US Postal Service,
    sooner or later tend to resent the people they are trying to help and for
    the most part to treat them badly, or to neglect them -- or, worst of all,
    to begin to  see them all as the same person, pigeonholed into "homeless" or
    "drug addicted" or "mentally ill" or "criminal," when all they are, as WE
    see them, are people like us who have gotten the worst of all possible
    breaks and have no place to live and, as a result, are stigmatized and cut
    off by the very communities which, in a more perfect world, they would count
    on to embrace them.
  vision: >-
    Success in 2050 would be the citizens of Los Angeles -- not the politicians,
    not the activists, not the social service agencies, but the citizens -- long
    since having awakened to the fact that life is only wonderful if the wonder
    of it can be shared and celebrated as widely as possible for the greater
    good.  In the latter half of the Twentieth Century political and economic
    systems were created ostensibly to make that happen, and it simply didn't. 
    Now we have another chance:  not for ideological reasons or with a view to
    creating yet another enforceable system, but  because there is no greater
    social logic than doing good for its own sake, we should all follow our
    instincts and pitch in.  The number of volunteers who want to join the GWHFC
    is growing in geometric proportions.  By 2050 will they and others like them
    have nothing more to do, because people will no longer be living in the
    street?  Not a chance.  But there is every chance that if we keep going as
    we are going now, we will be able to move the newly homeless off the street
    almost as fast as they come to it, and it will be easier to do it than it is
    now, because most of the community will be engaged with us in the process. 
    We will ALL be volunteers.

      Our competition consists of public and private agencies which operate on
      an entirely different model than we do -- who pay their workers handsomely
      and expect them to work 9 to 5 (and never on the weekends), who use up
      unthinkable amounts of money just maintaining themselves before they can
      spend any of it on the homeless, and who, as awful as it sounds, tend to
      breed a group of helpers who, like the employees of the US Postal Service,
      sooner or later tend to resent the people they are trying to help and for
      the most part to treat them badly, or to neglect them -- or, worst of all,
      to begin to  see them all as the same person, pigeonholed into "homeless"
      or "drug addicted" or "mentally ill" or "criminal," when all they are, as
      WE see them, are people like us who have gotten the worst of all possible
      breaks and have no place to live and, as a result, are stigmatized and cut
      off by the very communities which, in a more perfect world, they would
      count on to embrace them.

      Success in 2050 would be the citizens of Los Angeles -- not the
      politicians, not the activists, not the social service agencies, but the
      citizens -- long since having awakened to the fact that life is only
      wonderful if the wonder of it can be shared and celebrated as widely as
      possible for the greater good.  In the latter half of the Twentieth
      Century political and economic systems were created ostensibly to make
      that happen, and it simply didn't.  Now we have another chance:  not for
      ideological reasons or with a view to creating yet another enforceable
      system, but  because there is no greater social logic than doing good for
      its own sake, we should all follow our instincts and pitch in.  The number
      of volunteers who want to join the GWHFC is growing in geometric
      proportions.  By 2050 will they and others like them have nothing more to
      do, because people will no longer be living in the street?  Not a chance. 
      But there is every chance that if we keep going as we are going now, we
      will be able to move the newly homeless off the street almost as fast as
      they come to it, and it will be easier to do it than it is now, because
      most of the community will be engaged with us in the process.  We will ALL
      be volunteers.
