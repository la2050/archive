title: LOLA the Lifelong Organizational Learning App
indicator: ' Education'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >+
  <P>Impact on the Educational landscape:  inclusive, forward moving,
  digital.<P>






  <p>It’s easy to recall this typical schoolday scene: morning bell rings, kids
  line up, the teacher leads the way into the classroom and students find their
  places. <P>






  <P>For some, however, this is also a time when confusion and isolation begin
  to set in. <P>






  <P>Students’ backpacks unzip, papers, books and pencil cases make their way to
  desktops, as some find themselves stuck in a maze, frozen, without any idea of
  which direction to turn. Each year more and more students in Los Angeles
  classrooms find themselves, as hard as they try, lost in these everyday
  situations.<P>









  <p>These students struggle with executive function.<p>






  <p>How do problems with executive function affect learning? 



  Difficult to: make transitions, remember and retrieve information, solve
  problems, organize thoughts/actions and keep track of more than one thing at a
  time.<p>






  <p>Our solution: LOLA, the Lifelong Organizational Learning App.



  LOLA presents an Appbased solution to the organizational troubles experienced
  by the increasing numbers of students at large. This is a rare opportunity to
  assist children while also including parents and educators in the solution
  process, which, in turn, greatly reduces the time and effort spent supporting,
  often not yielding the progression towards necessary life skills. Through
  these proposed efficiencies, LOLA provides a low cost, high reward framework
  which benefits the entire community involved  but most importantly: the
  development of lifelong organizational capabilities of a child.<p>






  <p>For example:



  The LOLA work system: breaks down activities into manageable customizable task
  systems, which makes creating plans and keeping track of more than one thing
  at once a reality.



  The LOLA timer: uses personalize reminders in the form of light, images and
  vibrations.



  The LOLA messaging buttons: promotes private studenttoteacher communication to
  help:  students ask for help, seek more information when needed, wait to speak
  and remain on task.<p>






  <p>As a result, LOLA, through seamless support and private communication
  between the teacher and student, eliminates any humiliation associated with
  being confused along with the shame that comes with being the struggling
  child. Moreover, other students are spared from the distractions that come
  when a teacher verbally redirects an offtask student; therefore, the entire
  classroom community flows smoothly, focuses on the lessons at hand and
  learning happens.<p>


What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >+
  <P>Achievements in Educational landscape:  pragmatic, innovative,
  collaborative.<p>






  <P>Arguably, the most frustrating situations for educators and parents alike
  include: not being able to support children by giving each child the tools
  he/she needs to navigate through his or her day with confidence and
  independence.<p>






  <P>Our success story: in the fall of 2012, Karen met Lola, a bright,
  kindhearted, eager and willing thirdgrader, the type of student that inspires
  any teaching heart. As the first week of the school year unfolded, Karen
  observed Lola, despite her powers of persistence, struggle consistently with
  recalling/retrieving information that she needed to followed multistep
  directions. <P>






  <P>Karen a veteran third grade teacher, knows that by third grade, kids start
  to take pride in “doing things on their own” and too many reminders by a
  teacher elicit painful embarrassment. Fortunately, she had just participated
  in “Structuring the Learning Environment” a special ed professional
  development series offering strategies to help special needs kids get through
  “tasks”.  Building on what was learned, she began to create work systems on
  strips of paper for Lola that broke done daily routines and academic
  situations into “one step at a time lists” and added a little animal clip for
  Lola to move as she progressed through each step. Karen, in collaboration with
  Lola's Mom, Carrie, formalized these systems for Lola by posting them in her
  planner and empowering her to check off her tasks as she went  allowing her to
  feel far more in control and independent. <P>






  <P>It was almost magical: Lola went from being frozen to completely
  independent, with her “work system” at hand. Building on Lola’s achievement,
  Karen’s principal requested that she share her strategies with other teachers,
  who in turn successfully applied work systems with their struggling students.
  <P>






  <P>The recent course Karen had taken, coupled with the perfect timing of
  having Lola as student along with the professional development she shared with
  other teachers made Karen realize just how many kids would in the future,
  benefit tremendously by a "work system" like she had informally developed for
  Lola, and an idea took root: an App version.<P>


Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >+
  <p>Partnering in the Educational landscape:  social, efficient. <p>






  <p>LOLA will establish a close partnership with Los Angeles schools and
  districts beyond.  Teacher, parents and students will partner in an
  unprecedented way, with technology as the uniting tool. LOLA  provides the
  first known technological tool to help students conquer their organizational
  challenges in such a stepbystep way <P>






  <p>LOLA allows for the practice of customizing and accommodating for students
  with special needs to be standardized through the use of a consistent platform
  thus making the transition to a new classroom from one year to the next much
  smoother.<P>





Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >+
  <P>Evaluating the Educational landscape:  student engagement, goal oriented,
  digital.<p>






  <p>Alignment with National Common Core and Individual Education Plan Goals.



  Measured by: Los Angeles schools student retention/graduation rates, teacher
  effectiveness ratings and district budget reductions within special
  education.<p>






  <p>The creation of LOLA evolved from the urgent need to give students the
  tools that he/she needs in order to perform tasks necessary to everyday
  functioning. As this is the fundamental purpose of LOLA, when schools
  throughout Los Angeles utilize all that LOLA will offer, schools will see an
  increase in student engagement, increase in promotion of students with
  proficient or higher skills and an increase of teacher effectiveness on
  student engagement and classroom management. Consequently, the rate at which
  students graduate from high school, prepared for success in college and the
  workplace will drastically upsurge.<p>






  <p>Also, by putting technology into the hands of students now only better
  prepares them to succeed as the new Common Core State Standards assessments
  which will be given primarily on computers or other digital devices where
  multiple types of items will be used, including computerenhanced items and
  performance tasks, in order to measure the full range of knowledge and skills
  called for in the CCSS. <p>


How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
  <p>A healthier Los Angeles Educational landscape:  digital, efficient, forward
  moving. <p>






  <p>The G o l d h i r s h F o u n d a t i o n has identified in their report
  that: 



  Education received the lowest rating, meaning that is a significant impediment
  to human development. This outcome was based on the fact that the public
  school system in Los Angeles is failing many of its students. Graduation rates
  are low and too many kids throughout the county are not completing the
  necessary college preparatory coursework. Enrollment and investment in
  highquality preschool is also lacking. On top of this, continued cuts at the
  state level are making a bad situation worse. Given that education is such a
  fundamental aspect of human development with farreaching effects, the stark
  disparity in educational opportunities for the county’s students is
  unacceptable.






  Let’s start with this question: what do current special education services
  cost in the United States?



  According to Nathan Levenson, in a study sponsored by the Fordham Institute
  special education represented about 21 percent of all education spending
  across the nation in 2005, or $110 billion, compared with 18 percent in 1996.
  (Layton 2012)






  <p>Who are we talking about in Los Angeles? 



  In LAUSD alone,  approximately 77,000 students currently have Individual
  Education Plans, of which some 50,000 students are identified as having
  trouble with executive function. (Cross & Joftus,2011)<p>






  <p>In an era of budget cuts, can we do better? Yes we can!



  The current implementation of 1:1 aides has not proven effective and so far
  the main tool used when a child needs help —this is tremendously expensive and
  not a solution that works towards increasing independence.<p>






  <p>LOLA, a universal tool, requiring a relatively small investment will yield
  not only a huge learning impact on a large number of students, but also make a
  tremendously positive budgetary impact. <p>






  <p>Think about it: the typical 2013 modernday LA classroom relies heavily on
  inconsistent, ineffective and costly practices such as: paper agendas, paper
  lists, verbal cues and oneonone aides, whereas LOLA creates an individual
  organizational system opportunity, along with a respectful and private
  communication system through digital technologies.<p>


What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >+
  <p>The 2050 Los Angeles Educational landscape:  inclusive, tolerant, digital,
  social, efficient, paperresponsible, pragmatic, forward moving, collaborative,
  optimistic learning communities.<p>






  <p>Imagine a classroom that truly implements technology to assist a student in
  becoming productive and self reliant— far beyond games and fun apps. Imagine a
  tool that could remain with a student for his/her entire day from dawn to dusk
  and transition with him/her from one school year to the next — for a
  lifetime.  Imagine a tool that could address IEP goals all year long. Imagine
  a paperless organizational tool that facilitates all that: LOLA, the Lifelong
  organizational learning app.<p>






  <p>We know technology will change. We know the world we live in will change.
  We know that an individual who has trouble with executive function will
  forever need support in order to navigate through his/her day. The tools that
  LOLA provide will break open and reframe education in 2013 and beyond by
  putting an otherwise nonexistent support tool in the hands of such
  individuals, which, due to customizable capacities, will evolve alongside
  technological advances and societal needs well into the year 2050.<p>
