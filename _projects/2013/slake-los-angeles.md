title: 'Slake: Los Angeles'
project_summary: "Slake: Los Angeles is the first journal of narrative nonfiction, fiction, essay, memoir, photography and poetry in Los Angeles to gain worldwide recognition for its quality and design. Slake is devoted to the art of narrative storytelling in a media landscape where that mission is increasingly difficult and rare, but ever more essential. Storytelling breeds empathy and understanding, which improve community engagement and increase our civic stake.\r\n\r\nSlake will continue to give voice to the intellectual and creative resources of Los Angeles and shows them to the world at a time when Los Angeles is becoming the most important city in America as we move further into the 21st Century. Slake's highly attended readings, events, and Slake After Dark author and musician series will continue rally the literary and arts community to Los Angeles' civic mission. \r\n\r\nMost importantly, Slake will expand it's mission to include a publishing imprint that will bring the projects of underserved LA writers and artists to the world. There is no reason Los Angeles should rely on the permission of New York to get its creative capital disseminated. "

  Most importantly, Slake proved Los Angeles can produce a beautiful, exciting,
  smart journal of arts and letters that bridges the gap between stagnant
  old-world iterations of such and the future of long-form publishing. Slake is
  as intelligent as it as it is lovely and its success belies the myth that
  people don't have time or don't want to engage with more in-depth narrative.
  We've raised expectations for both Los Angeles and for the world as to what we
  should expect from a Los Angeles journal. Meanwhile, we've provided much
  needed gravity around which this often diffused community. 
collaborators: >-
  Our partners will be the universities (USC and Occidental) where we have
  established relationships as well as such cultural programs as The Hammer,
  where we've done successful events, and venues such as The Bootleg Theater and
  many other programming venues throughout the city and Pasadena at which Slake
  has provided rich, exciting events as well as venues such as Track 16 and
  Atwater Crossing to which Slake has brought hundreds to thousands of Angelenos
  for evenings of art, literature and music. We also collaborate with bookstores
  throughout the region, where our readings are often among the best attended.
  Slake has done highly successful programming for social and political events
  such as All in For the 99 and will continue to do so. 
success: >-
  Slake will measure success by increasing subscriptions, sales, event
  attendance and national and international recognitions, such as Cindy
  Carcamo's piece from Slake #2, "Return To Sender" winning international awards
  for immigration reporting and stories by Richard Lange, Joe Donnelly, Harry
  Shannon, Erica Wrightson, Joseph Mattson and others who have been recognized
  by The Best American series. Mostly, though, we'll measure our success by
  sustaining and growing Los Angeles' literary and artistic 
description: "Los Angeles, the gateway to Latin America and the Pacific Rim is criminally disadvantaged when it comes to disseminating and distributing the work of its artists, writers and intellectuals. This is primarily the means of production (and locus of prejudice towards Los Angeles) in publishing remain in New York. In it's brief history, Slake: Los Angeles, A City and its Stories, has competed with the best journalis in the world and won. Slake has been honored by press clubs, Pen Center, Livingston Awards, Franco American Foundation, and the prestigious Best Of American series five times (in two eligible issues). This is a remarkable feat and it's been accomplished because nobody know and can harness LA's talent better than Slake and its editors, Joe Donnelly and Laurie Ochoa. \r\n\r\nLos Angeles needs and deserves a prominent voice and forumn for its creative and intellectual talent to present to the world. Los Angeles is critical to the 21st Century, the privileges and problems of which will unfurl in LA first. "
vision: >-
  Los Angeles, the premiere city of the 21st Century would own its own means of
  production for producing and publishing for broad consumption its
  intellectual, artistic and academic capital.
