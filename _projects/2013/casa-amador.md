title: Casa Amador
indicator: ' Housing'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >+
  Reach For The Top, Inc., (R4TT) is a humanitarian nonprofit organization, our
  goal is to “Provide Hope through Housing”. R4TT, has been serving the
  community since 2005 providing the basic human needs of food, shelter, and
  clothing. In our day to day operations we have encountered many homeless
  single mothers with their children. Casa Amador will assist mothers and their
  children by creating a space where they can thrive and gain the skill set
  necessary to become successful, independent, and permanently housed. 






  Casa Amador is a 27 bed apartment building for formerly homeless women and
  their children. The architectural style combines elements of early twentieth
  century mixed use design with current technology. The building is three
  stories tall on a corner facing Adams Boulevard, and two stories with a
  privacy screen facing the single family dwellings on Palm Grove Avenue in the
  rear. It is designed to provide an open, light filled environment for families
  preparing for the future. The units feature an open living room plan with
  kitchen and either two or three bedrooms and bath. There is a secluded
  interior courtyard. There is a laundry room, private meeting room and outdoor
  children’s play area. At the street level are offices, parking and a
  commercial space. The building and systems are designed to the latest CalGreen
  and stormwater mitigation and pollution prevention standards. Solar panels and
  green roof are designed for the roof top.






  Relationships are built and developed with individuals by creating familiarity
  through repeated interactions using our food distribution program that is done
  every Friday thus creating a climate where information can be provided about
  our program and other social services. 






  By successfully rehabilitating, training, and assisting homeless women and
  children in the Los Angeles, R4TT would be providing our impoverished
  community with the tools to become selfsufficient and permanently housed.


What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >+
  Currently R4TT has one lot with three households. On average we work with 30
  individuals per month. This our biggest achievement. Every time one of our
  residents moves into stable permanent housing we have accomplished our goal. 
  Successful reintegration into society is our top priority. 





Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >+
  For this project we will be working with the Emergency Housing and Assistance
  Program Capital Development and the Community Development Block Grant Program.
  Both have contributed money, and brought us to the beginning of construction.






  We are also involved in food delivery to multiple groups who provide food to
  those that need it. We work with the Midnight Mission and the Mildred Cursh
  Foundation for food distribution. We also work with World Visions who provides
  supplies needed to support our facilities. We will continue to maintain our
  positive relationships with these groups.


Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  The plan is to produce a quarterly or biannual report on the programs
  effectiveness using a spreadsheet software to statistically plot our success
  rate and number of homeless that have become selfsufficient. Future data
  collected will include measurements of outcome such as the percentage of
  residents who are sober at discharge or who have become involved in local
  addiction recovery programs as well the percentage who become employed and/or
  establish permanent housing.
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  The mission of Reach for the Top, Inc., is to address the plight of homeless
  and provide the support necessary for them to attain the highest level of
  independence and selfsufficiency to become to become permanently housed. Reach
  for the Top, Inc., provides transitional housing where clients can stabilize
  in a safe, nurturing, environment while receiving the assistance necessary to
  access the services that lead to permanent housing. Our goal is to send
  healthy, selfconfident, competent persons back into society. 






  This program will help reduce the tax money used to care for the chronically
  homeless. Our residents will no loner be in jails, Emergency Rooms, or
  shelter. They will be in their new home, stable, safe and supported. We will
  assist them in finding permanent housing.






  The proposed location of Casa Amador, 4801 West Adams was involved in the
  civil unrest of 1992. Almost 84% of commercial structures and 83% of
  residential structures were in need of repair, according to a California
  Redevelopment Association survey done in 1995. By developing this lot, it will
  aesthetically change the characteristics of this blighted area, encourage
  outside investment and provide much needed services to a neglected
  community.  






  Providing stable transitional housing for the chronically homeless population
  that will also offer resources so residents can learn new skills, find
  employment, and finally find permanent housing will benefit the area greatly.
  These individuals will be supported so that they can succeed. Their success
  will bring hope to the neighborhood and elevate the entire area. 






  This project specifically deals with women and children. For the children
  living at our facility they  will have a better start to their day; providing
  them with the foundation to succeed in school and life. this will set them on 
  the track to grow into conscientious citizens. 






  Lastly our community center will be open to all individuals looking to
  participate or learn something new. This center will provide a place for
  people who might be on the edge of poverty. We would provide help to those who
  need it, keeping the potential homeless in their homes. 
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >+
  Our new facility will be a prototype of successful environmentally
  sustainable, affordable housing. Hopefully by this time there will be
  facilities even move advanced and comfortable than ours, that are providing a
  safe place for homeless. They will be stewards of environmentalism and
  innovative ways of alleviating homelessness.  The residents of the facilities
  and previous residents will be thriving citizens, impacting our society in
  positive ways. 






  More importantly, the children who came with their mother's to our facility
  will be grown adults, potentially with children of there own. With the life
  skills and support provided by us they will be able to successful in their
  adult lives. They will be socially and environmentally aware helping other as
  they, themselves were helped. Our future is these children and with our
  facility it should be a bright one.
