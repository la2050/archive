title: 'Craft Meets Impact: Hub LA Media Lab'
indicator: Arts & Cultural Vitality
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  <p>What if there were a place in LA where artists, media makers, social
  entrepreneurs, and individual citizens could come together under one roof and
  collaborate? What if artists had more customized support and were able to
  explore new ways to get their projects made and participate in creating media
  that mattered?</p>






  <p>Imagine a collaborative community anchored by a physical gathering place in
  Los Angeles which brings visual artists together with social entrepreneurs to
  create meaningful change. A place that equips artists and creative
  professionals with the enterprising tools needed to create their work and
  sustain themselves. A place that is home to a diverse community that:</p>






  <p>Brings forth disruptive new ideas and technologies



  Changes distribution dramatically



  Redefines a service and product



  Focuses the disorganized and connects the disconnecte



  Challenges the infrastructure, changes the rules and the flow of information



  Democratizes access and directs gains to the creator



  Honors the individual AND the community



  Takes the lead on new ethics, a new business model that cares for not just
  profit but also people and the planet</p>






  <p>That place and community exists now.</p>






  <p>Hub LA opened in September 2012 as a new kind of gathering place in the
  Arts District in Downtown LA.  With near 200 members and growing, Hub LA uses
  collaborative consumption and communitysourcing to provide the space,
  resources, and relationships individuals and teams need to launch and scale
  their projects.  It is the place for professionals of all disciplines who are
  dedicated to making a better world and cocreating our new economy. To
  accomplish this vision, we know we must design a place that includes artists
  and creative professionals, and amplify the role of arts and culture in
  building a more just economy.</p>






  <p>After being open six months, we are launching a Media Lab that will be a
  physical resource of 3200 square feet with additional programming for media
  makers, storytellers, and visual artists of all kinds because we believe
  building this kind of infrastructure and institution will do three key things
  to spur innovation in the arts and culture sector in a way we haven’t seen
  before.</p>






  <p>1) Social good startups will have access to cutting edge talent to tell the
  stories that set these new companies apart. These stories are critical for
  social entrepreneurs to attract capital and tap into loyal customers looking
  to buy from sustainable, prosocial brands;</p>






  <p>2) Artists will have access to entrepreneurial energy and startup resources
  along side ongoing critique from a curated community of peers. Equipping
  artists and creative professionals with the business acumen and tools to
  produce their own work will allow more people to make a viable living from
  their creative pursuits; and</p>






  <p>3) Be a home for the disruptive companies that are leading the way towards
  a “New Hollywood.” Startups that are democratizing access to production,
  distribution, and funding; collectives of creative professionals launching new
  design businesses; and storytellers who are creating meaningful, different,
  yet entertaining work: we want this to be your headquarters.</p>






  <p>Hub LA’s Media Lab aims to build a world in which artists and social
  entrepreneurs collaborate and combine storytelling with new media to create
  social change and in turn provide entrepreneurial tools for artists to sustain
  themselves.</p>






  <p>Anchored by a physical space equipped with the necessary technical
  equipment for multimedia creation, the Media Lab will:</p>






  <p>Make new media equipment accessible, thereby attracting local independent
  artists in need of affordable professional facilities;</p>






  <p>Cultivate a talent pool of modern artists through programs built around
  design thinking, data visualization, and brandbuilding; and</p>






  <p>Develop new mediums and channels for content distribution through
  partnerships with content distributors in the multimedia industries; and</p>






  <p>Provide the enterprising training and new models of collaborative funding
  that will lead to a more sustainable arts and culture sector in Los
  Angeles.</p>









  <p>Our Media Lab will serve as a platform for connecting storytellers,
  photographers, videographers, designers, programmers, visual artists, and
  social entrepreneurs in a media facility fully equipped with preproduction,
  production, and postproduction equipment. This space will benefit the
  creation, dissemination, and support of LA’s next generation creative artists
  and provide a new model that’s part institution, part campus, and part
  innovation lab to spur Arts and Culture in Los Angeles.</p>
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  <p>Hub LA has building the social enterprise community in Los Angeles since
  2009 and had a physical gathering place since September 2012.  Since then we
  have built a community of 175 members...and growing!</p>






  <p>These members fall across 12 Change Sectors including: Art and Design,
  Clean Tech/Renewable Energy, Community Development, Education, Environmental
  Sustainability, Impact Investing, International Development, Local Food, Media
  and Entertainment, Public Health and Tech Services for Change; Roughly 70% of
  members categorizing themselves as social entrepreneurs; the largest sector
  represented is Media and Entertainment followed by Community Development and
  Education.</p>






  <p>We have constructed and created 4500 square feet of creative work, meeting,
  and event space.</p>






  <p>We have built out an additional 3200 square feet to create the Media
  Lab</p>


      


  <p>Sponsorship and partnership of over 50 events to date supporting
  organizations such as GOOD, Acumen Fund, AIGA, Praxis Labs, Dell Women’s
  Network for Entrepreneurship, Green Festival, Social Justice Institute to name
  a few.</p>
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  <p>Hub Los Angeles, since opening in 2012 has partnered and collaborated with
  over 30 organizations from media and entertainment to civic, tech, education
  and importantly, social enterprise. Our near 200member community in LA as well
  as the 10,000+ Hub members around the world serves as a spine of support as we
  build the Media Lab programming & community.</p>



  <p>As of this date, the Media Lab has official support with partners from Film
  Independent, Los Angeles Film Festival, KUSC, SciArc, AIGA, Taproot
  Foundation, LA Opera & professionals/mentors to help build programming, events
  & residencies from CAA, Universal Pictures, NBC Universal, Focus Features,
  Media Rights Capital, Paramount Pictures, 20th Century Fox Studios, Sony
  Motion</p>
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  <p>First and foremost, success for the Media Lab will be measured by the
  number and quality of members that we will build in this burgeoning community.
  We are successful if we can attract a crossdisciplinary group of creative
  professionals who are dedicated to creating content that sits at the
  intersection of message and meaning.  Media Lab success will be determined
  by:</p>






  <p>Finding Media professionals looking to bring their expertise to new
  projects that make a difference and operate outside the traditional ‘studio
  system’</p>






  <p>Creating a community of Content Creators, and Pro Amateurs unable to
  complete their work because they lack access to affordable technical
  facilities and likeminded community.</p>






  <p>Anyone looking to gain, and share, multimedia skills through training and
  educational programs. Our members will be accomplished, and will have both
  something to offer and to learn from the community.</p>






  <p>Graduate 10 members/year from Hub LA Media Lab Media Acclerator Program</p>






  <p>Contribute to Diversity Programs across town including: Project Involve,
  Sundance Labs, Fox Diversity Program, Universal Pictures Diversity Writers
  Program, Disney Writing Programs, USC and UCLA Film School programs, Tribeca
  Film Festival Social Innovators</p>






  <p>By 2014, create programming, labs and events for community outreach to look
  and foster diverse talent and content creators looking to create media for
  social change.</p>






  <p>By 2014, all Media Lab members will have participated in mentorship
  programs, office hours, business acceleration services seeded through Hub
  LA.</p>






  <p>By 2014, create an ArtistinResidence program dedicated to building a
  library of data visualizations and furthering how digital artists can help
  foster social innovation; specific focus on education and environmental
  justice.</p>






  <p> Monthly events/salons/panels to discuss future of media, disruption,
  community values and create a safe harbour for new innovation, white papers,
  discussion and collaboration to grow.</p>






  <p>By 2014, Hub LA will pilot a prosocial production company model beginning
  in fall 2013 that will identify and seek out opportunities to produce
  meaningful projects across a widerange of disciplines including:</p>






  <p>Advocacy Campaigns/PSAs



  TV, Film, Scripts, Literary Arts



  Digital Art, Performance Art, and Data Visualization</p>









  <p>By 2015, we will have created a measurably diverse community of 300 Media
  Lab members comprised of a number of individuals, startups, and growth
  organizations/companies who share a common value of creating positive social
  and environmental change in the world through contentcreation.</p>






  <p>By 2015, 75% of Hub Media Lab members will be contributing to the ”impact
  economy” of Los Angeles through all manners of media, adding to arts and
  culture first through LA and then spreading globally.</p>
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  The Hub LA Media Lab provides solutions based on these three core assumptions:






  Meaningful storytelling creates change.  Stories connect people. Storytelling
  is the single most powerful way to move people towards empathy and action. For
  a social entrepreneur, storytelling expresses the “why” and sets a brand apart
  in the marketplace, expanding  impact, audience, and reach.






  Topdown Hollywood Studio model is becoming less relevant.  Audiences are
  hungry for meaningful, authentic stories and original content. Studios are
  designed to prioritize the bottom line over content, reducing all projects to
  profit maximizing endeavors.






  New disruptive models are changing the entertainment industry.  Whether it is
  more accessible technology to create content or new platforms to distribute
  and consume media, the entertainment industry and the studio model is in flux.
  New distribution models and ideas will soon need to be embraced.






  IDENTIFIED NEED:



  After surveying a significant sample of LA’s multimedia professionals, we’ve
  found three critical roadblocks impeding them from attaining their full
  potential:






  High costs associated with production & postproduction facilities



  Limited access to talented collaborators for feedback & peer review



  Difficulty reaching appropriate distribution channels 






  MEDIA LAB SOLUTION



  Anchored by a physical space with the needed technical equipment to create
  multimedia and visual arts projects, and hosting a community of independent
  artists and social entrepreneurs, the Media Lab space will be a new beacon for
  the Arts and Culture sector and allow Angelenos to:





      Access professional facilities and equipment as well as a dedicated community diverse enough to provide for all talent required when producing a project;





      Expand the impact of the social entrepreneurs and changemakers through visual media and storytelling resources and thereby amplify Los Angeles creative and social good sectors, thus attracting new talent from around the world;





      Explore how the artists and professional content creators, when connected with social entrepreneurs and sociallyminded investors, gain the skills needed to sustain themselves and accelerate the creation and dissemination of their own projects; and





      Through the Global Hub Network, connect with new national and global models of collaborative funding and legal structures being tested such as Seed and Spark and TrustArt that spur arts and culture. 





  Media Programs will include:



  ArtistinResident program dedicated to building a library of data
  visualizations and furthering how digital artists can help foster social
  innovation; specific focus on education and environmental justice.





      Diversity Programing that include mentorship from across town including: Project Involve, Sundance Labs, Fox Diversity Program, Universal Pictures Diversity Writers Program, Disney Writing Programs, USC and UCLA Film School programs, Tribeca Film Festival Social Innovators





      
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: |2-
    <p>By 2050, Hub LA Media Lab will be an anchor institution within the Arts and Culture sector and be the place Angelenos look to for social innovation in Los Angeles.  By 2050, Hub LA Media Lab will be true to its name by being a hub that:</p>
