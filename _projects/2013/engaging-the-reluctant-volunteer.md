title: Engaging the Reluctant Volunteer
project_summary: "We got Max Geller to volunteer. Max is a nice guy who never volunteers for anything. No reason why. On the 10th anniversary of September 11, Big Sunday hosted a food drive and community breakfast. It started at 6:00 a.m., to coincide with the time of the attacks. We collected thousands of pounds of food for pantries, which was nice, but what was great was that the more than 500 helpers included corporate groups; school groups; groups from churches, temples, and a mosque; fraternities and clubs; vets; residents from group homes, including people in recovery and homeless people; and individuals and families. Everyone helped sort and pack the food, and then we all broke bread together. We had a great, donated buffet, and lots of tables set up, with loads of people inside and out, enjoying one another's company on that sad and somber day. And Max turned up. He jumped right in and was great company for everyone he talked. He had a wonderful time, too. Getting Max, the world's most reluctant volunteer to participate, was an excellent achievement. (Next time, we'll get him to bring some food, too.)\r\n\r\nAlso: Since 1999, we've engaged and empowered more than 250,000 people of all ages and backgrounds in thousands of community services projects throughout California. For many, helping at Big Sunday is the beginning of a longterm commitment to a nonprofit, whether it's Big Sunday or another group. We have worked with hundreds of nonprofits, both local and national. We have made major capital improvements at all kinds of nonprofit sites, including Phoenix House, The Venice Family Clinic, North Valley Rescue Mission, Operation Ready Families and many more. We have collected and donated tens of thousands of books; tens of thousands of pounds of food; truckloads of clothing; roomsful of furniture. We started as a single day or service and now have a year-round community calendar listing more than 1000 ways to help each year; Monthly on Melrose, which is a different special event for a different nonprofit, every month; our annual holiday giving list, with more than 150 ways to help at the holidays; Youth In Action, a special toolkit for civic-minded kids; The End of the Month Club, our monthly food drive to fight hunger; theBIGlist, our cool online wish list for nonprofits and donors; theARTlist, our upcoming list for all kinds of artists of all ages to publicize their work; and our ability to fill emergency needs by reaching out to the Big Sunday community.\r\n\r\nWe have won all kinds of awards, and been cited and recognized by all kinds of nice and impressive groups.\r\n\r\nTruly, though, our most important achievement lies not in how much we've done, but the spirit in which we've done it. We are proud that we've brought many people to a new part of town, be it South Central or Beverly Hills, for the first time. We're proud of our ability to cross racial, religious, age, and socio-economic lines to bring nice people together to enjoy one another in all kinds of ways.\r\n\r\n"

  success: "Big Sunday already has a number of these programs going. This grant would allow us to not just expand those programs, but add new ones, too.\r\n\r\nWe would evaluate the project in numerous ways:\r\n\r\n1) Re-creating Big Sunday's Community Calendar to be a area-wide listing of events. Success would be measured by: a) creation of online calendar, b) creation of printed calendar, c) creation of common website, d) how many events are listed e) if the listings increased attendance or success for the listee, f) amount of traffic, g) if this led to any kind of ongoing relationship between the helper and the nonprofit, h) becoming self-sustaining through sponsorships and/or advertising, i) whether it led to cooperation between nonprofit groups, j) if it becomes a model for other cities or regions\r\n\r\n2) Counting all participants; indetifying repeat and 1st-time participants.\r\n\r\n3) Identifying continued civic participation and interaction with people and/or organizations through a connection first made at a Big Sunday event.\r\n\r\n4) theBIGlist -- a) how many items are listed to be given away, b) how many matches are actually made, c) amount of traffic, d) becoming self-sustaining through sponsorships and/or advertising\r\n\r\n5) theARTlist -- a) how many events are listed , b) how listing affects attendance at events and, if applicable, sales, c) amount of traffic, d) growth, e) becoming self-sustaining through sponsorships and/or advertising\r\n\r\n5) Monthly on Melrose -- a) continued success of the program as measured against mission of each event, b) attendance, c) repeat attendance, d) if attendees develop an ongoing relationship with others they've meet, e) if attendees maintain a relationship with the nonprofit they've helped, f) testimonials of participants, g) growth of the initiative, either through increasing the scope or frequency of the project\r\n\r\n6) Continued support and growth of existing programs such as The Big Sunday Holiday List (ways to help at the holidays); The End of the Month Club (our monthly food drive); Everyone Eats, Everyone Wins (community meals at ethnic restaurants throughout town); The Big Sunday Chill Out Express (a party bus that everyone is welcome on and the price of admission is something from the Big Sunday Wish List to help another nonprofit); See Your City Tours (field trips to all different parts of town, and including tours by foot, bike, boat, bus and on horseback)\r\n\r\n7) Ability to introduce new initiatives, such asThe Big Sunday Emergency Fund (to meet emergency needs) and W.H.O. (Who Helps Out), an online biography of inspiring unsung people in the community.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
  Indicator: ' Social Connectedness'
  brief: "<p>Actually, our title is a misnomer. We don't see people as volunteers. That suggests \"haves and have-nots.\" At Big Sunday, we think EVERYONE has some way they can help, and that the world is  full of \"haves and have-mores.\" That's why our target audience is... everyone. And they're not volunteers, they're participants. Helpers. From homeless people to CEOs, all treated and valued the same. Sometimes the line between who is giving or receiving help is blurred, and we think that's great. And our speciality, it seems, is the reluctant person - the one who thinks they don't have the time, or the talent, or the money, or perhaps even the inclination to help.</p>\r\n<p>We do this by providing all kinds of ways to help. By making it as easy or difficult as someone wants. To make everything inclusive. To focus on what unites us, not what divides us. To bring people together. And to make it fun.</p>\r\n<p>Thus, our idea is to create a clearinghouse of giving and helping.</p>\r\nWe are already on the road to doing that. Big Sunday sponsors and promotes all kinds of traditional volunteering experiences, from beach clean-ups to feeding the hungry. We also offer many giving opportunities, whether it's school supplies in August, toys at Christmas or ongoing needs like food or clothing. Some people seek a one-time helping experience while others are looking for something long-term. While many people have skills to offer - be it plumbing, legal expertise, hairdressing or medicine - for many, their gift is their friendly demeanor, or ability to make anyone feel wanted and needed. As such, we host all kinds of community dinners, parties, field-trips and outings for people to get to meet and known one another. </p>\r\n<p>We want to start by doing it right here in L.A.. And, while we like to think as big as anyone, and have benefitted first-hand from the power of social media, we treasure the interaction between people - something which hopefully be as cherished in 2050 as it is today - so we will at first focus on the greater L.A. area.</p>\r\n<p>The truth is, people in L.A. are very engaged. For instance, during the 8 week period we are now in, here are just some of the events taking place in the area: the L.A. Marathon, The L.A. Times Book Fair, CivLAVia, Coachella, the Israel Festival, Earth Day, Fiesta Broadway, ShareFest, the Annual FoLAR River Clean-Up, City Lights, and Big Sunday Weekend, plus all kinds of walks and runs and fairs and festivals for all kinds of good causes. Between the events listed above, more than 1,000,000 people will be engaged. That's a lot of people. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. For sure, anyone who has ever driven in L.A. has, at some point, been blocked by the masses of people enjoying one of these events. People want to be involved. They just need to know where they're wanted and needed. </p>\r\n<p>What can get more problemmatic is when many worthy groups are vying for people, dollars, and attention.</p>\r\n<p>We'd start by reaching out to the many nonprofit & service organizations, plus festivals and events in town and create a common calendar so that both the public and all agencies would know what the other is doing and thus maximizing everyone's effectiveness and output (while minimizing time wasted as different organizations work hard to do the same thing). We'd build a common website (with links to each group's individual website), as well an annual printed brochure (e.g., like that of the Hollywood Bowl, so that people could see all their options at once).</p>\r\n<p>If a nonprofit needs something - be it new crayons for their students, new furniture for residents, warehouse space, a new executive director, or cash for any of the above, they can go to one site to see what it needed. Last year, Big Sunday started an initiative like this called theBIGlist. Since then we have made matches for everything from Subzero refrigerators to trees to a basset hound.</p>\r\n<p>We'd continue & grow our Monthly on Melrose program of concerts, movie screeings, singalongs and parties, designed not just to help people, but to bring them together. These events usually include a meal, where people come knowing the mission is to not just join friends & family, but to mix it up - these events usually include not just regular volunteers, but invited guests such from group homes, shelters, or senior or vets' organizations.</p>\r\n<p>We want to help get rid of the idea of \"the other.\" If someone is an \"other\" it can create fear, anxiety, resentment, or misunderstanding. \"The other\" is often an idea. It's a person, or a type of person that we've heard about or read about, maybe even seen, but never looked in the eye and had a conversation. The \"other\" is often someone we thing we're working at cross-purposes with, but have never tried to, or had to, engage in something together - even if that something is as simple as counting cans in a food drive painting a classroom, enjoying a game of bingo, or sharing a laugh.</p>"
  budget explanation: "Our budget is simple:\r\n\r\n1) $25,000 for important and necessary website upgrades. Our website looks nice (mostly), but there are back end issues that slow things down for both staff and users. We'd like to completely update the community calendar to make it more user-friendly, more comprehensive, more interactive, more fun, and prettier. We 'd also like to add numerous new elements to our website. This would also include the creation of a communal website.\r\n2) $35,000 for a part-time programming coordinator on staff \r\n3) $15,000 for marketing, promotion and outreach \r\n4) $12,000 to cover a monthly community dinner for up to 200 people\r\n5) $10,000 for printing and graphic design\r\n6) $3,000 transportation (e.g., for groups like vets, seniors, those in group homes who want to participate but cannot get there) and other miscellaneous costs"
  description: "<p>Our project will benefit L.A. by making helping easy, accessible and inclusive. More than that, by bringing people of different worlds together in the name of helping, and focusing on what we have it common, it will be clear what we can accomplish when we work together. Finally, by working to make events impactful, rewarding and fun, we will help build a culture of helping and civic engagement.</p>\r\nAlong the way, we will fill food pantries, stock classrooms, tend gardens, fix buildings, raise money for worthy causes, and engage, empower, validate and bring together people of all ages, backgrounds and means throughout LA.</p>\r\n<p>We are reluctant to give numbers because then the tail can start wagging the dog. Of course, we understand that goals are important: so we can promise to next year give away 20,000 books or 25,000 pounds of food or 5000 bags of clothing; provide 2500 Christmas toys, or raise thousands of dollars to send kids to camp, fight cancer, or respond to a natural disaster. Host a community dinner for 200 every month, create an annual art show and pet adoption and concert. Hold beautification days at 50 different schools. Make large scale capital improvements at shelters, afterschool facilities, or homes for vets or seniors. Engage 50,000 people a year. All are doable, and we've done them and more.</p>\r\n<p>Here's the thing: Big Sunday is, perhaps, not the youngest or hippest organization out there. And, while we see how important it is to engage young people, we think people can still help after they're 34. Or 54. Or 94. Big Sunday is nothing if not inclusive, reaching out to and including people of all ages and backgrounds and at all socio-economic levels, letting them know that they're wanted and needed, getting them involved, and bringing them together with other good-hearted people.</p>\r\n<p>Full disclosure: We'd considered coming up with some very specific project for this proposal. But having been around for a number of years, we believe that there is no silver bullet. Change comes about through an ongoing, concerted effort. We are proud of the work we do and have done, and an opportunity like this would allow us to continue and expand it. When we started years ago, we said we wanted to be a group that brings people together to make the world a better place, not in response to a catastrophe, or because of a single compelling incident, but because it's the right thing to do. We like to think that we, through the ongoing generosity, goodwill, hard work, humor, dirty hands and big hearts of many, have accomplished that.</p>\r\n<p>Then again, by creating an easily navigated system to both meet and fulfill needs, and by helping to bring together our terrific brethren in L.A.'s helping world, we can greatly expand this culture of caring, concern and compassion, and engage even more people in the process of making life better and easier for all Angelenos.</p>"
  collaborators: "At Big Sunday our target audience is everyone. Kind of broad, we know. Then again, we already work with hundreds of partners all over Los Angeles -- schools (all ages, public and private, religious and secular), faith groups, businesses, elected officials, neighborhood councils, civic groups, clubs, alumni groups, teams, nonprofits, and more. Big Sunday has no religious or political agenda and reaches out to and embraces the participation of all groups, provided it's done in a spirit of generosity, understanding, open-mindedness and tolerance.\r\n\r\nWe've built and fostered strategic alliances of all sorts to reach out to engage people in many communities, from the mayor's office to the archdiocese to the Girl Scouts. We'll continue to do so."

  description3: "We don't think we have any competition. \r\n\r\nTo be sure, there are others groups that engage people and empower them to help and volunteer. They are all wonderful groups - L.A. Works, Volunteer L.A., City Year, ShareFest, UCLA Volunteers, City Lights, Hike It Up, and many more - and we have happily worked (or are working) with all of them, and are glad and honored for the opportunity. Similarly, there are other incredible groups working hard to bring people together, and we've worked with as many of them as we can, too. We don't see them as competition; we get much more accomplished when we work with them. That's why we view them as partners.\r\n\r\nWe also have worked with hundreds of other nonprofits, with many of whom we share funders. Whenever possible, we try and share costs. Some of our nonprofit partners look to us to help provide things they couldn't otherwise afford. Whenever possible, we are happy to oblige.\r\n\r\nWe are constantly reaching out to new groups, limited usually only by time and resources.\r\n\r\nHowever, Los Angeles is an enormous place, with millions of things to be done, and millions of people able to help. There are two big impediments to success: 1) competition for dollars and 2) competition for people's attention. The competition for dollars is with others fighting for all the good causes out there, and is particularly difficult among L.A.'s funders, especially corporate and foundation funders, large and small. The competition for attention is not only with other funders, but everything else vying for people's attention, whether it's helping other nonprofits; their job; their kids; studing for the SAT's; or reading about Lindsey Lohan. It's all extremely time-consuming, exhausting, and often frustrating, especially because our time could be better spent elsewhere - like working to fulfill our mission of engaging people to help!\r\n\r\nBy creating a clearinghouse, everyone - nonprofits, funders, participants (helpers or those needing help) - could more clearly see who does what, and when they do it. They could see where their energies and money are best spent, and then approach both funders and participants to help meet more specific needs. This would foster more cooperation and less competitiveness. By leveraging complementary talents and resources, each of these groups, starting with Big Sunday, would be bigger than the sum of their parts and have much more impact. "
  vision: "There would be an actual space (picture, say, The Beverly Center) devoted to improving the world. It would include social service agencies; places for people of all ages, as well as groups to volunteer; a food pantry for those who need food and those who want to donate it; what is now Macy's would be a department-store sized high-end thrift store of items of all kinds providing items for both those in need and those wanting a bargain, as well as revenue for a syndicate of nonprofits and jobs for those looking for work; non-profit stores (such as the craft store at the Downtown Women's Center) and for-profit stores (such as Tom's) with a social action mission; restaurants like The Homeboy Cafe, where people who need a second chance to have a good job; the space now housing The Grand Lux would be set up like a German beer hall, with family-style tables where locally grown and raised food would be served to people family style and where people could meet someone new; exhibit and performance spaces for nonprofits, schools and individuals to show their work; gathering spaces for people of all walks of life to congregate not just with their friends, but with different people of all ages and backgrounds for events like concerts or singalongs; a no-kill rescue for stray animals; a rooftop sustainable vegetable garden; classrooms and a lecture hall; and a full programming schedule with ways for people to help, both onsite and throughout the city. This would not be a place for rich people to help poor people. It would be a destination spot, welcoming to all, where people could go knowing they would be able to do their part, large or small, to make the world a better place.\r\n\r\nThere would be smaller branches around town, so different neighborhoods could host events. Because people would now be so used to interacting, no one would have to be afraid of going to a new neighborhood. Instead, people could enjoy meeting new people; discovering a neighborhood's history; celebrate the talents of those in a new neighborhood; help maintain the neighborhood's community garden or park; provide company to the area's elderly or infirm.\r\n\r\nBecause people will have spent more time interacting, face to face, with people from worlds different than their own, there would be less fear or suspicion and more understanding. People would see firsthand the inequities that poor people face (lesser schools, fewer shopping options, dirtier streets) and be more inclined to do something about it. Because they'd have more interaction with the disenfranchised and lonely (seniors, the ailing, vets), more people would take the time to be sure that these people had more company, and more attention paid. Finally, people who have greater means, would have the opportunity to be seen not just as helpers or donors, but as people with their own hopes, fears and disappointments.\r\n\r\nSuccess would be the elimination of the \"other.\" It would not be us vs. them; Los Angeles would just be a city of \"us.\""

What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >+
  We got Max Geller to volunteer. Max is a nice guy who never volunteers for
  anything. No reason why. On the 10th anniversary of September 11, Big Sunday
  hosted a food drive and community breakfast. It started at 6:00 a.m., to
  coincide with the time of the attacks. We collected thousands of pounds of
  food for pantries, which was nice, but what was great was that the more than
  500 helpers included corporate groups; school groups; groups from churches,
  temples, and a mosque; fraternities and clubs; vets; residents from group
  homes, including people in recovery and homeless people; and individuals and
  families. Everyone helped sort and pack the food, and then we all broke bread
  together. We had a great, donated buffet, and lots of tables set up, with
  loads of people inside and out, enjoying one another's company on that sad and
  somber day. And Max turned up. He jumped right in and was great company for
  everyone he talked. He had a wonderful time, too. Getting Max, the world's
  most reluctant volunteer to participate, was an excellent achievement. (Next
  time, we'll get him to bring some food, too.)






  Also: Since 1999, we've engaged and empowered more than 250,000 people of all
  ages and backgrounds in thousands of community services projects throughout
  California. For many, helping at Big Sunday is the beginning of a longterm
  commitment to a nonprofit, whether it's Big Sunday or another group. We have
  worked with hundreds of nonprofits, both local and national. We have made
  major capital improvements at all kinds of nonprofit sites, including Phoenix
  House, The Venice Family Clinic, North Valley Rescue Mission, Operation Ready
  Families and many more. We have collected and donated tens of thousands of
  books; tens of thousands of pounds of food; truckloads of clothing; roomsful
  of furniture. We started as a single day or service and now have a yearround
  community calendar listing more than 1000 ways to help each year; Monthly on
  Melrose, which is a different special event for a different nonprofit, every
  month; our annual holiday giving list, with more than 150 ways to help at the
  holidays; Youth In Action, a special toolkit for civicminded kids; The End of
  the Month Club, our monthly food drive to fight hunger; theBIGlist, our cool
  online wish list for nonprofits and donors; theARTlist, our upcoming list for
  all kinds of artists of all ages to publicize their work; and our ability to
  fill emergency needs by reaching out to the Big Sunday community.






  We have won all kinds of awards, and been cited and recognized by all kinds of
  nice and impressive groups.






  Truly, though, our most important achievement lies not in how much we've done,
  but the spirit in which we've done it. We are proud that we've brought many
  people to a new part of town, be it South Central or Beverly Hills, for the
  first time. We're proud of our ability to cross racial, religious, age, and
  socioeconomic lines to bring nice people together to enjoy one another in all
  kinds of ways.

  At Big Sunday our target audience is everyone. Kind of broad, we know. Then
  again, we already work with hundreds of partners all over Los Angeles  schools
  (all ages, public and private, religious and secular), faith groups,
  businesses, elected officials, neighborhood councils, civic groups, clubs,
  alumni groups, teams, nonprofits, and more. Big Sunday has no religious or
  political agenda and reaches out to and embraces the participation of all
  groups, provided it's done in a spirit of generosity, understanding,
  openmindedness and tolerance.






  We've built and fostered strategic alliances of all sorts to reach out to
  engage people in many communities, from the mayor's office to the archdiocese
  to the Girl Scouts. We'll continue to do so.
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >+
  Big Sunday already has a number of these programs going. This grant would
  allow us to not just expand those programs, but add new ones, too.






  We would evaluate the project in numerous ways:






  1) Recreating Big Sunday's Community Calendar to be a areawide listing of
  events. Success would be measured by: a) creation of online calendar, b)
  creation of printed calendar, c) creation of common website, d) how many
  events are listed e) if the listings increased attendance or success for the
  listee, f) amount of traffic, g) if this led to any kind of ongoing
  relationship between the helper and the nonprofit, h) becoming selfsustaining
  through sponsorships and/or advertising, i) whether it led to cooperation
  between nonprofit groups, j) if it becomes a model for other cities or regions






  2) Counting all participants; indetifying repeat and 1sttime participants.






  3) Identifying continued civic participation and interaction with people
  and/or organizations through a connection first made at a Big Sunday event.






  4) theBIGlist  a) how many items are listed to be given away, b) how many
  matches are actually made, c) amount of traffic, d) becoming selfsustaining
  through sponsorships and/or advertising






  5) theARTlist  a) how many events are listed , b) how listing affects
  attendance at events and, if applicable, sales, c) amount of traffic, d)
  growth, e) becoming selfsustaining through sponsorships and/or advertising






  5) Monthly on Melrose  a) continued success of the program as measured against
  mission of each event, b) attendance, c) repeat attendance, d) if attendees
  develop an ongoing relationship with others they've meet, e) if attendees
  maintain a relationship with the nonprofit they've helped, f) testimonials of
  participants, g) growth of the initiative, either through increasing the scope
  or frequency of the project






  6) Continued support and growth of existing programs such as The Big Sunday
  Holiday List (ways to help at the holidays); The End of the Month Club (our
  monthly food drive); Everyone Eats, Everyone Wins (community meals at ethnic
  restaurants throughout town); The Big Sunday Chill Out Express (a party bus
  that everyone is welcome on and the price of admission is something from the
  Big Sunday Wish List to help another nonprofit); See Your City Tours (field
  trips to all different parts of town, and including tours by foot, bike, boat,
  bus and on horseback)






  7) Ability to introduce new initiatives, such asThe Big Sunday Emergency Fund
  (to meet emergency needs) and W.H.O. (Who Helps Out), an online biography of
  inspiring unsung people in the community.








How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  <p>Our project will benefit L.A. by making helping easy, accessible and
  inclusive. More than that, by bringing people of different worlds together in
  the name of helping, and focusing on what we have it common, it will be clear
  what we can accomplish when we work together. Finally, by working to make
  events impactful, rewarding and fun, we will help build a culture of helping
  and civic engagement.</p>



  Along the way, we will fill food pantries, stock classrooms, tend gardens, fix
  buildings, raise money for worthy causes, and engage, empower, validate and
  bring together people of all ages, backgrounds and means throughout LA.</p>



  <p>We are reluctant to give numbers because then the tail can start wagging
  the dog. Of course, we understand that goals are important: so we can promise
  to next year give away 20,000 books or 25,000 pounds of food or 5000 bags of
  clothing; provide 2500 Christmas toys, or raise thousands of dollars to send
  kids to camp, fight cancer, or respond to a natural disaster. Host a community
  dinner for 200 every month, create an annual art show and pet adoption and
  concert. Hold beautification days at 50 different schools. Make large scale
  capital improvements at shelters, afterschool facilities, or homes for vets or
  seniors. Engage 50,000 people a year. All are doable, and we've done them and
  more.</p>



  <p>Here's the thing: Big Sunday is, perhaps, not the youngest or hippest
  organization out there. And, while we see how important it is to engage young
  people, we think people can still help after they're 34. Or 54. Or 94. Big
  Sunday is nothing if not inclusive, reaching out to and including people of
  all ages and backgrounds and at all socioeconomic levels, letting them know
  that they're wanted and needed, getting them involved, and bringing them
  together with other goodhearted people.</p>



  <p>Full disclosure: We'd considered coming up with some very specific project
  for this proposal. But having been around for a number of years, we believe
  that there is no silver bullet. Change comes about through an ongoing,
  concerted effort. We are proud of the work we do and have done, and an
  opportunity like this would allow us to continue and expand it. When we
  started years ago, we said we wanted to be a group that brings people together
  to make the world a better place, not in response to a catastrophe, or because
  of a single compelling incident, but because it's the right thing to do. We
  like to think that we, through the ongoing generosity, goodwill, hard work,
  humor, dirty hands and big hearts of many, have accomplished that.</p>



  <p>Then again, by creating an easily navigated system to both meet and fulfill
  needs, and by helping to bring together our terrific brethren in L.A.'s
  helping world, we can greatly expand this culture of caring, concern and
  compassion, and engage even more people in the process of making life better
  and easier for all Angelenos.</p>
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  There would be an actual space (picture, say, The Beverly Center) devoted to
  improving the world. It would include social service agencies; places for
  people of all ages, as well as groups to volunteer; a food pantry for those
  who need food and those who want to donate it; what is now Macy's would be a
  departmentstore sized highend thrift store of items of all kinds providing
  items for both those in need and those wanting a bargain, as well as revenue
  for a syndicate of nonprofits and jobs for those looking for work; nonprofit
  stores (such as the craft store at the Downtown Women's Center) and forprofit
  stores (such as Tom's) with a social action mission; restaurants like The
  Homeboy Cafe, where people who need a second chance to have a good job; the
  space now housing The Grand Lux would be set up like a German beer hall, with
  familystyle tables where locally grown and raised food would be served to
  people family style and where people could meet someone new; exhibit and
  performance spaces for nonprofits, schools and individuals to show their work;
  gathering spaces for people of all walks of life to congregate not just with
  their friends, but with different people of all ages and backgrounds for
  events like concerts or singalongs; a nokill rescue for stray animals; a
  rooftop sustainable vegetable garden; classrooms and a lecture hall; and a
  full programming schedule with ways for people to help, both onsite and
  throughout the city. This would not be a place for rich people to help poor
  people. It would be a destination spot, welcoming to all, where people could
  go knowing they would be able to do their part, large or small, to make the
  world a better place.






  There would be smaller branches around town, so different neighborhoods could
  host events. Because people would now be so used to interacting, no one would
  have to be afraid of going to a new neighborhood. Instead, people could enjoy
  meeting new people; discovering a neighborhood's history; celebrate the
  talents of those in a new neighborhood; help maintain the neighborhood's
  community garden or park; provide company to the area's elderly or infirm.






  Because people will have spent more time interacting, face to face, with
  people from worlds different than their own, there would be less fear or
  suspicion and more understanding. People would see firsthand the inequities
  that poor people face (lesser schools, fewer shopping options, dirtier
  streets) and be more inclined to do something about it. Because they'd have
  more interaction with the disenfranchised and lonely (seniors, the ailing,
  vets), more people would take the time to be sure that these people had more
  company, and more attention paid. Finally, people who have greater means,
  would have the opportunity to be seen not just as helpers or donors, but as
  people with their own hopes, fears and disappointments.






  Success would be the elimination of the "other." It would not be us vs. them;
  Los Angeles would just be a city of "us."
