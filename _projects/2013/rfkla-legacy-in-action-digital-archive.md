title: RFKLA (Legacy in Action) Digital Archive
indicator: ' Education'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >+
  To create and manage a studentcentric online multimedia library, social media
  forum and digital media hub focused on social justice themes: The RFKLA
  Archive. The Archive is designed to help make the concepts of human rights and
  civil rights personally relevant to students, thereby inspiring them to become
  agents for change and engaged members of the Los Angeles Community.  






  The Archive is the central project of RFKLA (Legacy in Action), a 501(c)(3)
  inspired by the democratic vision of Robert F. Kennedy.  As a model for 21st
  century participatory learning, the mission of RFKLA is to foster a more just
  society by educating young people to use evolving media technologies for
  positive social change. 






  The RFKLA Archive is a collaborative effort with the students and teachers of
  the New Open World Academy High School (NOW). NOW is located on the Los
  Angeles School District’s RFK Community Schools campus in midtown Los Angeles.
  It is being developed as a rich media repository of the works of social
  justice leaders past, present and future, as well as a social networking site
  and portfolio platform for students’ social justicethemed works. 






  The RFKLA Archive will provide teachers with comprehensive, interdisciplinary
  student centered lesson plans with a democratic pedagogical emphasis linked to
  the U.S. Common Core Standards. Students will produce and publish fieldrelated
  products, projects and artifacts, including investigative essays,
  documentaries and multimedia demonstrations that connect knowledge acquired in
  school with field research and community outreach activities. 






  By offering a learning management system cocreated by teachers and students,
  on which information can be easily shared and constructed, combined with a
  robust data aggregator, the RFKLA Archive Project will help transform the way
  in which teachers teach and students learn. The Archive is intended to not
  only enhance all aspects of students’ academic careers, but to benefit the
  greater community by expanding students’ media literacy skills to discover
  their individual voices, to explore the world more fully from a social justice
  perspective and to contribute real value to their society.


What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >+
  During it's first year and a half, RFKLA conducted three major projects:






  *    The Participatory Learning and You Program (PLAY!) was a joint program
  between RFKLA and the USC Annenberg School’s Innovation Lab.  Under the
  supervision of RFKLA’s lead academic partner, Henry Jenkins, Provost’s
  Professor of Communication, Journalism, Cinematic Arts and Education, LAUSD
  teachers and students, as well as invited nonprofit organizations, provided a
  year long training and research program on the application of 21st century new
  media literacies in the classroom. 



  *    Partnering with USC Annenberg, RFKLA provided after school programs with
  community outreach nonprofits, including among others: KCET’s Departures
  Program; Laughter for a Change; and Animaction.



  *    Conducted an international educational game program: a semesterlong,
  synchronous game played between the 5th grade math class at RFK Community
  Schools’ Ambassador School of Global Leadership and a 5th grade math class in
  Seoul Korea. The program was led by Professor Jong H., Wi, internationally
  recognized “serious game” designer and visiting Professor at CRESST UCLA
  school of education. 


Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: "*  Dr. Chuck Flores, Principal of the New Open World Academy (K   thru 12) at the Robert \tF. Kennedy Community Schools\n\n\n*  Themistocles Sparangis, Ed.D., Chief Technology Director, Educational Technology, \n\n\n*  Dr. Lynne Goldfarb, Professor USC's Rossier School of Education.\n\n\n*  Mike Reich, President Seabourne Consulting (providers of information management tools and expertise)\n\n\n*  The JFK Library\n\n\n"
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >+
  RFKLA plans to conduct a longitudinal research study with its USC Partners,
  collecting qualitative data regarding each developmental stage of the
  project.  


   


  Success will be determined by a series of empirical measurements to be
  designed to evaluate individual student’s performances, as well as determine
  how well the overall program is performing. 






  Teachers will also be regularly surveyed to determine how well the Project
  supports their work, specifically in integrating social justice and civil
  rights themes across content areas aligned to the Common Core Standards. 






  Teachers will also be periodically queried on how effective the project is in
  providing lesson plans in which alternative forms of assessments are utilized
  to encourage student creativity and student voice.






  RFKLA, with its partner Seabourne Consulting will use sophisticated Web
  analytics to measure and analyze the data collected by the Archives in order
  to optimize usage.


How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
  1. The RFKLA Archive Project will amplify 21st Century learning opportunities
  for students throughout the LAUSD






  2. Through a social justice lens, the Archive will promote connectivity
  between students and with the larger Los Angeles community by: 






  *    Using the social networking component of the RFKLA Archive to engage
  young people in dialogues throughout the LAUSD



  *    Introducing students to diverse and multicultural perspectives, thereby
  creating a more cohesive community of learners



  *    Promoting a shared vision of social responsibility across the LAUSD
  student community



  *    Chronicling the lives and stories of Los Angeles residents, for
  distribution on the RFKLA Archive site



  *    Serving as a hub for conversations with the Los Angeles community and
  beyond, the archives will become a “prestige” project to enhance Los Angeles’
  reputation as a city of 21st Century educational excellence 


What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >+
  By 2050 the RFKLA Archive technology platform and learning management system
  will be freely available to any interested school system or educational
  institution.  The Archive platform will be the standard mechanism through
  which students create materials demonstrating capabilities learned in school.
  As a universally accepted learning tool based on a rigorously validated set of
  technologies, the RFKLA Archive’s learning technology will have a worldwide
  impact by advancing students’ understanding of and capability to use
  technology, while also quantitatively improving learning and performance by
  increasing interest and engagement. 






  By 2050, the RFKLA Archive will be seamlessly integrated across all subject
  areas throughout the LAUSD schools. Students attending LAUSD schools will be
  fully media literate and adept at producing media rich content for a global
  audience. Having gained diverse perspectives through their work, RFKLA Archive
  contributors will become role models for others. The alumni of the RFKLA
  Archive Program will become civicminded leaders in Los Angeles and engaged
  world citizens.
