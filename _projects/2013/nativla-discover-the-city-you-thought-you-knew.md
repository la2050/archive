indicator: ' Environmental Quality'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  NativLA is a geolocation mobile app that will provide a YELPlike experience
  for users eager to explore our city’s wild side. Utilizing photography and
  video to unveil and document experiences with urban nature, users can share as
  well as search for experience by region, using categories such as “wildlife”,
  “seasonal” and “kidfriendly” as filters.  As a social network, a placebased
  educational tool and an urban nature guide, NativLA will inspire environmental
  stewardship and foster a citywide understanding of how nature sustains life.
  Los Angeles is the place without a sense of place, famous for sprawl and
  overdevelopment, and defined by its carclogged freeways.  It might seem
  inhospitable to efforts to connect with nature and community.  But this city
  is rich in nature's amenities — the ocean, mountains, diverse habitats and
  ecosystems, with a Mediterranean climate.  The City of Los Angeles has 15,710
  acres of parkland, including 4,217 acres in Griffith Park, the largest
  municipal park in the United States.  L.A. has nine lakes and an urban forest
  of one million trees. Approximately 70 community gardens are growing in Los
  Angeles County, serving 3,900 families and dozens of commercial urban farms
  are taking root within city limits. There are three core modes to the NativLA
  app: Spottings, Nativ Ambassadors and Location Based Field Guilds. Spottings
  are experiences with nature that can be shared and accessed by everyone.  Snap
  a photograph or shoot video of a nature activity or wildlife sighting, select
  the appropriate category, confirm your location, add some descriptive tags or
  comments and submit it.   In Upper Fryman Canyon, off Mulholland Drive in the
  Hollywood Hills, a mother and her two sons record a chorus of frogs in the
  rainswelled stream beneath a Eucalyptus grove.  A torrent of comments follows,
  which identify the creatures as Southern Mountain YellowLegged Frogs, and
  claiming that February and March are the best viewing months.  Further east in
  Hollywood’s Bronson Park, a guide from Urban Outdoor Skills photographs lush
  swaths of California sagebrush, mugwort and bay leaves, includes tips on how
  to gather and preserve them and provides a link to the organization.  In
  Culver City, a father uploads video of his daughter “foraging” for guavas in
  the trees lining the Ralphs parking lot and, like a true Nativ, cautions her
  to pick only as much as she can carry.  Nativ Ambassadors are urban farmers,
  homesteaders and environmental groups such as Los Feliz Eco Village and The
  Institute for Urban Ecology, who are willing to open their operations to
  Angelenosatlarge for the purpose of exploration and education.  For example,
  an urban commercial farm in West LA, called Wybrandt Farm, uploads pictures of
  their 3,000 square foot vegetable garden, posts information about tours and
  provides a link to local farmer’s markets where they sell their produce.  In
  Koreatown, The Los Angeles EcoVillage, designed to demonstrate lower
  environmental impact and higher quality of living in an urban environment,
  uploads video of their greywater and solar panel systems with a link to tours
  (lunch optional) and garden hours.  The Locationbased Field Guide is an
  opportunity to see what kind of eco adventures are occurring near you and
  learn more about them. Search through a map view, list view or grid view of
  recent Spottings and Ambassador posts all based on your location.  You may
  also search through personalized Field Guides, rated by popularity, in which
  individuals or organizations have mapped out tours through specific
  neighborhoods or highlighted “best of” destinations.  To aid in your search,
  you can filter by categories to find what you are most interested in. 
  Categories include: Wildlife, Urban Farming, Foraging, Eco Adventures
  (adventures in sustainable alternative living i.e. art and design), Farmers’
  Markets, Hikes & Walks, Kidfriendly and Seasonal. NativLA Field Trips: Los
  Angeles has experienced severe cuts in supplemental learning excursions from
  elementary through high school. Schools used to be able to take children on
  three district approved field trips per class, per year. Now budget cuts have
  forced the school to cut out field trips completely. Even the lure of free
  admission to a venue or experience isn’t enough — teachers have no way of
  providing transportation since the schools have to pay for the buses. NativLA
  Field Trips, a component of the LocationBased Field Guild, are built right
  into the application and web presence, and will allow teachers throughout Los
  Angeles to access information about free and accessible outings. Teachers will
  find many activities they can walk to right from school and there will be
  public transportation routes to NativLA Field Trips taking place across the
  city. According to the Center for Eco Literacy, placebased learning encourages
  students to experience the natural world and better understand the places
  where we live, work and learn. 
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  Though NativLA does not yet exist, it will coalesce my years of experience
  with nature and the environment.  While earning a BA in Journalism at the
  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, I created the show Habitat for
  UNCCH Cable TV on the abundance of nature found on campus.  I spent summers
  interning at 60 Minutes, The New York Times and studying with the Wildlands
  Studies Program through San Francisco State University.  My first job out of
  college was shadowing an environmental reporter at CBS affiliate WRALTV in
  Durham, NC where I put together a reel which landed me my first job reporting,
  at NBC affiliate KIEMTV in Eureka, CA.  As morning and then evening anchor, I
  wrote, produced and filmed dozens of stories on the local environment,
  including a threepart special on Coho salmon and their plight, and stories on
  the headwaters of the old growth coastal redwoods in Humboldt County. After
  moving to Los Angeles, I wrote and produced nature documentaries for
  television, including Earth’s Fury, Storm Warning and The Top 10 Environmental
  Disasters.  When I chose to leave the workforce and start a family, I created
  my own company called Dutch Touch Art designing and commissioning a series of
  handpainted oils for the design industry, based on the Netherland’s Golden Age
  and their iconic depictions of nature in the wild.  Currently, I am Chair of a
  nonprofit organization called Friends of Wonderland, which raises over $450K
  annually for Wonderland Elementary School in Laurel Canyon.  We provide the
  enrichment programs that Los Angeles United School District (LAUSD) no longer
  funds, including PE, library, music and art.  We also ask, where field trips
  are concerned, that the parents carpool and pay for all admission fees. 
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >+
  Partnering with mobile app company Inside.com, NativLA’s unique interface for
  both mobile and tablet users will be easy to touch, navigate and share.  Core
  modes such as Spottings and the Locationbased Field Guide will be easy to see
  and access.  The focus will be on images, icons to represent actions and
  clean, crisp typography.  There will be easy access to search and sharing
  features making for a great user experience.

Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >+
  Success will be measured in three phases: Now, Middle Future and Future






  Right now we have a lot of ground to cover, 4,084 square miles to be exact. 
  This first phase of the project will serve as a proof of concept.  Success
  will mean a fully developed mobile application and web presence, with an
  enticing brand and clear message for the citizens of Los Angeles to engage, be
  informed and interact with their urban nature.  






  Right now students all over this city are trapped in classrooms without any
  field trips on the school calendar. A test run of NativLA Field Trips needs to
  be activated as part of this initial phase.  By focusing on elementary schools
  in a test district such as South LA, we will populate the map with nature and
  wildlife destinations, as well as have Nativ Ambassadors ready to open their
  urban operations to educate and inspire.   Additionally we will provide the
  sample online materials that will allow teachers and students to delve deeper
  into each destination. 






  The middle future is to determine the business model that will sustain the
  project.  Forprofit methods include approaching investors, integrated
  advertising and charging for each app download.  Another approach will be
  taking the proof of concept to an existing mobile app company like YELP and
  pitching the concept as their nonprofit entity.  Nativ could be “powered by
  Yelp” or something similar. 






  In the future, NativLA will serve as a proving ground for an approach to urban
  nature that will be duplicated in every metropolitan city throughout the
  United States and the world.   And in combining a full featured webpresence
  with the mobile app, every user, regardless of their socioeconomic standing,
  will have complete access to all Nativ has to offer citizenscientists around
  the globe. 


How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
  According to the LA2050 report, the environment where people live, work and
  play is a key component of quality of life.  But in the City of L.A., only 8%
  of the land surface is public parks and only 29% of L.A. residents live within
  a quartermile of a public park, leaving more than 600,000 children without
  access.






  While the city strives to create more equitable greenspaces, NativLA’s mission
  will be to connect all Angelenos to urban nature opportunities in every
  neighborhood in the city, inspiring environmental stewardship and fostering a
  citywide understanding of how nature sustains life. 






  According The Center for Eco Literacy, nature is our teacher, sustainability
  is a community practice, and sustainable living is rooted in a deep knowledge
  of place.  






  “When people acquire a deep knowledge of a particular place, they care about
  what happens to the landscape, creatures, and people in it. When they
  understand its ecology and diversity, the web of relationships it supports,
  and the rhythm of its cycles, they develop appreciation and a sense of kinship
  with their surroundings. Places known deeply are deeply loved, and wellloved
  places have the best chance to be protected and preserved for future
  generations.” — Center for Eco Literacy


What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >+
  Every community throughout Los Angeles will have a myriad of userprovided
  spottings and guides encouraging interaction with our city’s immense
  biodiversity.   Placebased learning in the form of Nativ Field Trips will be
  an integrated part of LAUSD curriculum.






  Today’s Elementary school children raised with NativLA will be fluent in their
  city’s diverse natural habitat.  Inspired by community farming, foraging and
  urban homesteading, this generation will have long benefited from placebased
  learning and will be a living example of a true Nativ: one who advances
  environmental stewardship and civic engagement, and who understands there is a
  unique opportunity to connect with the city every time you walk out your front
  door. 






  Much as YELP provides us with the ability to make spontaneous and often
  adventurous choices regarding our next meal, allowing us to delve deeper into
  the various cultures of our cities, Nativ will create stewards of our city’s
  natural diversity.  Nativs will shape their days around experiencing urban
  nature and caring about what happens to the creatures, landscape and people in
  it.

    We don’t see any direct competition in the marketplace today but rather
    invaluable sources of inspiration. NativLA will combine elements from
    existing apps that concentrate on specific aspects of this proposal, such as
    Localmind.  Similar to FourSquare, Localmind is an app that allows users to
    check in with other locals about the status of establishments such as
    restaurants, museums et al, and determine how long of a wait there is etc. 
    The Noah Project is a crowd-sourced wild life database that helps nature
    lovers discover local wildlife, and aspiring citizen-scientists contribute
    to current research projects. National Parks, by National Geographic, has
    interactive maps with filters.  And then, of course, Yelp.

      Trips: Los Angeles has experienced severe cuts in supplemental learning
      excursions from elementary through high school. Schools used to be able to
      take children on three district approved field trips per class, per year.
      Now budget cuts have forced the school to cut out field trips completely.
      Even the lure of free admission to a venue or experience isn’t enough –
      teachers have no way of providing transportation since the schools have to
      pay for the buses. NativLA Field Trips, a component of the Location-Based
      Field Guild, are built right into the application and web presence, and
      will allow teachers throughout Los Angeles to access information about
      free and accessible outings. Teachers will find many activities they can
      walk to right from school and there will be public transportation routes
      to NativLA Field Trips taking place across the city. According to the
      Center for Eco Literacy, place-based learning encourages students to
      experience the natural world and better understand the places where we
      live, work and learn.

    answer: "According to the LA2050 report, the environment where people live, work and play is a key component of quality of life.  But in the City of L.A., only 8% of the land surface is public parks and only 29% of L.A. residents live within a quarter-mile of a public park, leaving more than 600,000 children without access.\r\n\r\nWhile the city strives to create more equitable greenspaces, NativLA’s mission will be to connect all Angelenos to urban nature opportunities in every neighborhood in the city, inspiring environmental stewardship and fostering a city-wide understanding of how nature sustains life. \r\n\r\nAccording The Center for Eco Literacy, nature is our teacher, sustainability is a community practice, and sustainable living is rooted in a deep knowledge of place.  \r\n\r\n“When people acquire a deep knowledge of a particular place, they care about what happens to the landscape, creatures, and people in it. When they understand its ecology and diversity, the web of relationships it supports, and the rhythm of its cycles, they develop appreciation and a sense of kinship with their surroundings. Places known deeply are deeply loved, and well-loved places have the best chance to be protected and preserved for future generations.” – Center for Eco Literacy\r\n"

    answer: "Success will be measured in three phases: Now, Middle Future and Future\r\n\r\nRight now we have a lot of ground to cover, 4,084 square miles to be exact.  This first phase of the project will serve as a proof of concept.  Success will mean a fully developed mobile application and web presence, with an enticing brand and clear message for the citizens of Los Angeles to engage, be informed and interact with their urban nature.  \r\n\r\nRight now students all over this city are trapped in classrooms without any field trips on the school calendar. A test run of NativLA Field Trips needs to be activated as part of this initial phase.  By focusing on elementary schools in a test district such as South LA, we will populate the map with nature and wildlife destinations, as well as have Nativ Ambassadors ready to open their urban operations to educate and inspire.   Additionally we will provide the sample online materials that will allow teachers and students to delve deeper into each destination. \r\n\r\nThe middle future is to determine the business model that will sustain the project.  For-profit methods include approaching investors, integrated advertising and charging for each app download.  Another approach will be taking the proof of concept to an existing mobile app company like YELP and pitching the concept as their non-profit entity.  Nativ could be “powered by Yelp” or something similar. \r\n\r\nIn the future, NativLA will serve as a proving ground for an approach to urban nature that will be duplicated in every metropolitan city throughout the United States and the world.   And in combining a full featured web-presence with the mobile app, every user, regardless of their socio-economic standing, will have complete access to all Nativ has to offer citizen-scientists around the globe. \r\n"

      Though NativLA does not yet exist, it will coalesce my years of experience
      with nature and the environment.  While earning a BA in Journalism at the
      University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, I created the show Habitat
      for UNC-CH Cable TV on the abundance of nature found on campus.  I spent
      summers interning at 60 Minutes, The New York Times and studying with the
      Wildlands Studies Program through San Francisco State University.  My
      first job out of college was shadowing an environmental reporter at CBS
      affiliate WRAL-TV in Durham, NC where I put together a reel which landed
      me my first job reporting, at NBC affiliate KIEM-TV in Eureka, CA.  As
      morning and then evening anchor, I wrote, produced and filmed dozens of
      stories on the local environment, including a three-part special on Coho
      salmon and their plight, and stories on the headwaters of the old growth
      coastal redwoods in Humboldt County. After moving to Los Angeles, I wrote
      and produced nature documentaries for television, including Earth’s Fury,
      Storm Warning and The Top 10 Environmental Disasters.  When I chose to
      leave the workforce and start a family, I created my own company called
      Dutch Touch Art designing and commissioning a series of hand-painted oils
      for the design industry, based on the Netherland’s Golden Age and their
      iconic depictions of nature in the wild.  Currently, I am Chair of a
      non-profit organization called Friends of Wonderland, which raises over
      $450K annually for Wonderland Elementary School in Laurel Canyon.  We
      provide the enrichment programs that Los Angeles United School District
      (LAUSD) no longer funds, including PE, library, music and art.  We also
      ask, where field trips are concerned, that the parents carpool and pay for
      all admission fees.

      We don’t see any direct competition in the marketplace today but rather
      invaluable sources of inspiration. NativLA will combine elements from
      existing apps that concentrate on specific aspects of this proposal, such
      as Localmind.  Similar to FourSquare, Localmind is an app that allows
      users to check in with other locals about the status of establishments
      such as restaurants, museums et al, and determine how long of a wait there
      is etc.  The Noah Project is a crowd-sourced wild life database that helps
      nature lovers discover local wildlife, and aspiring citizen-scientists
      contribute to current research projects. National Parks, by National
      Geographic, has interactive maps with filters.  And then, of course,
      Yelp.

    answer: "Every community throughout Los Angeles will have a myriad of user-provided spottings and guides encouraging interaction with our city’s immense biodiversity.   Place-based learning in the form of Nativ Field Trips will be an integrated part of LAUSD curriculum.\r\n\r\nToday’s Elementary school children raised with NativLA will be fluent in their city’s diverse natural habitat.  Inspired by community farming, foraging and urban homesteading, this generation will have long benefited from place-based learning and will be a living example of a true Nativ: one who advances environmental stewardship and civic engagement, and who understands there is a unique opportunity to connect with the city every time you walk out your front door. \r\n\r\nMuch as YELP provides us with the ability to make spontaneous and often adventurous choices regarding our next meal, allowing us to delve deeper into the various cultures of our cities, Nativ will create stewards of our city’s natural diversity.  Nativs will shape their days around experiencing urban nature and caring about what happens to the creatures, landscape and people in it. \r\n\r\n“When they understand its ecology and diversity, the web of relationships it supports, and the rhythm of its cycles, they develop appreciation and a sense of kinship with their surroundings.
