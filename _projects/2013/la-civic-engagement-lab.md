title: LA Civic Engagement Lab
project_summary: "<p>The CCIP aims to diffuse innovation in California local governments through researching and recommending organizational and emerging practices that enable the creation and adoption of innovative policies, technology, and programs that deepen community engagement and accelerate civic innovation.

The City of Vallejo will invite residents to decide how to spend over $3.4 million in sales tax revenue. Through a year-long PB process, thousands of residents will engage in critical discussions and decisions about the future of the city. The process aims to generate more informed spending, develop new grassroots leaders, build stronger communities, educate the public, expand civic participation, and forge deeper connections between government officials and citizens.  CCIP serves as a research partner on this project because we are interested in the numerous impacts participatory budgeting can have in a community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- In September 2012, CCIP began an exploration of how innovation spreads in local government, through a study of how local governmental leaders use formal and informal networks to share information. The project uses a diverse set of methodologies -- from conversations with experts on networks and city administration, to surveys and interviews with public servants and city government associations, to documentation of knowledge sharing practices in several innovative projects undertaken by cities and counties in California. Together, these methods will allow us to explain how city staffers currently receive and disseminate information related to innovation, the barriers to more effective diffusion of ideas and approaches, and the ways in which existing formal networks might be modified to promote better collaboration and communication. We hope that the study will build on successes in the civic innovation space by helping to institutionalize the spread of innovation within and between cities. We seek to provide a roadmap to formal networks for effective modification and replication of successful projects. Our findings report will be released the week of April 1st.</p>"

  brief: "<p>The National Day of Civic Hacking (NDCH) is a national event, sponsored by the White House, taking place in over 50 cities across the country on June 1st and 2nd. It gives citizens an opportunity to do what is most quintessentially American: roll up our sleeves, get involved and work together to improve our society. We plan to kick off the National Day of Hacking with an event focused not on coding, but rather on developing ideas and prototypes to make government transparency efforts lead to better civic engagement. Community ideas and prototypes could range from things as simple as better signage for navigating City Hall and government offices, to developing a system that alerts the public when particular issues of personal concern appear before City Council. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This event is a creative, productive, and exciting way for Los Angelenos to volunteer while promoting civic and social engagement. Our target audience for NDCH is local government officials in cities throughout Los Angeles County, community leaders, citizen hacktivists, designers, and ordinary residents interested in finding ways to make local governmental transparency meaningful and engaging for the people of Los Angeles.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Over the three months following the NDCH, CA Civic Innovation (CCIP) staff will lead small workshops at which community members and local government staffers will more fully develop and vet prototypes in preparation for their use within government. The CCIP will work with local governments to implement the concepts, whether they be process improvements, technologies, or policies aimed at improving civic engagement through transparency. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Phase 1: National Day of Civic Hacking Event - LA Civic Lab launch (June 1, 2013)</p>\r\n<p>The event will bring together participants from various sectors to collaborate on idea generation and prototyping civic tools to make government more transparent and engaging. Civic tools can range from policy improvements aimed at making information more engaging, to participatory projects like participatory budgeting, and could also include technology to easily enable collaborative writing of rules, policies, or guides. We expect that a variety of ideas and prototypes will surface that reflect the needs and desires of the community, and these tools will not be limited to only technology solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Phase 2: Prototyping Workshops (June - August 2013)</p>\r\n<p>Three to five small workshops will be held in Los Angeles to fully develop ideas and prototypes generated during the NDCH event. The workshops will be small scale, hands-on, two or three hour sessions.  Teams or individuals that developed prototypes will receive and provide feedback, mentoring, and any additional support they might need. The goal is to ensure that the prototypes meet the needs of the community and can be supported by local governments. Prototypes resulting from the NDCH could include draft amendments to local policies, or a new SMS tool to connect neighbors and send alerts. Because of the short time frame, we do not expect fully functional, feature-rich tools to emerge from this process, but we will aim for prototypes that can be tested by local governments and residents.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Phase 3: Implement in Los Angeles County (September - November 2013)</p>\r\n<p>CCIP will select two or three cities within Los Angeles County to implement the community prototypes. To ensure the projects represent community needs, the CCIP hopes to work closely with community members, organizations like Strategic Concepts in Organizing & Policy Education (SCOPE) and the Department of Neighborhood Empowerment, and the local government prior, during and post implementation.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Phase 4: Best Practices Reporting (December 2013)</p>\r\n<p>This initiative will stimulate new collaboration by community stakeholders in the exploration and adoption of new civic tools, so documenting the best practices and other learnings from the process is of value to the region internally and externally. The projectâ€™s best practices will also be shared through the CCIPâ€™s network of local governments and community organizations throughout California, and through existing networks of local government professional associations, in hopes that the model can be adapted to other communities. The visually engaging report will be released at the conclusion of the project. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Social connectedness is a determinant of a community's quality of life, and bringing people together to share ideas, ask questions, and co-create has the potential to establish long lasting relationships beyond the initial gathering. By creating a space where local government staff and the community can interact and collaborate, the NDCH event will lead to stronger networks between residents and government, resulting in longer-term civic and social engagement.</p>"

  description: "Our overarching goal is to use this integrated ideation, prototype and deployment process to significantly change citizen interactions with each other and government in ways that deepen people's connection to and investment in Los Angeles communities.\r\n\r\nOver 500 volunteer hours will be dedicated to the NDCH, through participation in the day long event. This project will give those who might not traditionally volunteer an opportunity to use their skills as community organizers, designers, developers, or subject matter experts, to contribute to improving the future of Los Angeles.  By partnering with local community organizations, we also hope to attract populations who are distrustful of Los Angelesâ€™ government, or who have had no previous exposure to the inner workings of local government.  These might include undocumented immigrants, formerly incarcerated people, youth, low-income people, non-native English speakers, and minorities.  Engaging these communities in the process of government, providing them with contacts at City Hall, and ensuring that government services are directed toward these groups is vitally important for a city that continues to struggle with enormous racial and economic divides, and in which many residents harbor deep resentment toward local government agencies.\r\n\r\nIn addition to volunteering, the participants will leave the event with new connections and relationships with other community members, and those connections will be nurtured through the prototyping workshops, where teams that formed during the NDCH will continue to meet, collaborate, and create together. The ideas discussed and prototyped during from the NDCH will be geared toward social connectedness, producing greater involvement in the community by residents.  This, in turn, will lead to community input at City Hall that is more representative than what is typically received, resulting in solutions that respond more directly to community needs.  But we also expect that relationships formed during the process of Civic Lab will be valuable to participants as they seek to establish networks that can later assist in everything from public safety to childcare to finding a job.  By bringing diverse groups of people together, the Civic Lab will create bonds that strengthen neighborhoods and promote the health and well-being of its residents.\r\n \r\nAdditionally, the CCIP aims to have a longer-term impact beyond the region, both in California and nationally, by creating a documented set of practices that other regions can use to come together across cities and sectors in an effort to foster more engaged communities.  This will establish Los Angeles as a leader in the space of civic innovation, instilling pride in residents and the local governments that serve them, and encouraging further collaboration between the two."

  description3: "<p>Our competition for this specific project would come from organizations, like Code for America Brigade, that focus primarily on technology solutions that can be easily deployed in multiple cities. Additionally, over the past few years there has been a focus on hack-a-thons and rapidly building tools for communities in 24 to 48 hours. In practice the hack-a-thon model often falls short on delivering real solutions that reflect the communityâ€™s needs.  Thatâ€™s not to say all hack-a-thons fail, but drawing on our experience participating in numerous hackathons, we see an opportunity to go beyond the hackathon.  In this way we can encourage more social connectedness between diverse groups in the interest of addressing community needs, rather than providing a platform for a group of technologists to code for a day to design the fanciest app.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EducadeLA, a community branch of GameDesk, is planning a Meetup in LA on the NDCH to bring together residents to focus on education hacks. This is not necessarily competition, because we believe that the more groups answering the White House's call to action, the better.  But EducadeLAâ€™s event will attract a segment of the population that will not be attending our event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Organizationally we do not see ourselves as having direct competition because weâ€™re exploring a field that has vast amounts of uncharted territory. Our combination of research, policy recommendations, convening stakeholders, and prototyping solutions makes us unique in the think tank and policy fields, and gives us an advantage in the on-the-ground work we do through partnerships with local governments.</p>"
  vision: "<p>At the CCIP we believe that increased civic participation results in more resilient communities that provide a better quality of life for residents. As Los Angelenos grow stronger networks within their communities and city, they will be better equipped to respond to disasters, demand responsive governments, and develop leaders for the future. The CCIP aims to make change throughout California, and the Los Angeles region is a significant stakeholder in our progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By 2050 the prototypes developed by the community, through this project, and tested in the cities will be replaced, but we can hope that the new connections and relationships, and even the new skills and experience, developed through the National Day of Civic Hacking event and prototyping workshops will last beyond five years and shape the way people interact with one another and government well into the future. </p>"

  ideas and prototypes could range from things as simple as better signage for
  navigating City Hall and government offices, to developing a system that
  alerts the public when particular issues of personal concern appear before
  City Council. </p>









  <p>This event is a creative, productive, and exciting way for Los Angelenos to
  volunteer while promoting civic and social engagement. Our target audience for
  NDCH is local government officials in cities throughout Los Angeles County,
  community leaders, citizen hacktivists, designers, and ordinary residents
  interested in finding ways to make local governmental transparency meaningful
  and engaging for the people of Los Angeles.</p>









  <p>Over the three months following the NDCH, CA Civic Innovation (CCIP) staff
  will lead small workshops at which community members and local government
  staffers will more fully develop and vet prototypes in preparation for their
  use within government. The CCIP will work with local governments to implement
  the concepts, whether they be process improvements, technologies, or policies
  aimed at improving civic engagement through transparency. </p>









  <p>Phase 1: National Day of Civic Hacking Event  LA Civic Lab launch (June 1,
  2013)</p>



  <p>The event will bring together participants from various sectors to
  collaborate on idea generation and prototyping civic tools to make government
  more transparent and engaging. Civic tools can range from policy improvements
  aimed at making information more engaging, to participatory projects like
  participatory budgeting, and could also include technology to easily enable
  collaborative writing of rules, policies, or guides. We expect that a variety
  of ideas and prototypes will surface that reflect the needs and desires of the
  community, and these tools will not be limited to only technology
  solutions.</p>









  <p>Phase 2: Prototyping Workshops (June  August 2013)</p>



  <p>Three to five small workshops will be held in Los Angeles to fully develop
  ideas and prototypes generated during the NDCH event. The workshops will be
  small scale, handson, two or three hour sessions.  Teams or individuals that
  developed prototypes will receive and provide feedback, mentoring, and any
  additional support they might need. The goal is to ensure that the prototypes
  meet the needs of the community and can be supported by local governments.
  Prototypes resulting from the NDCH could include draft amendments to local
  policies, or a new SMS tool to connect neighbors and send alerts. Because of
  the short time frame, we do not expect fully functional, featurerich tools to
  emerge from this process, but we will aim for prototypes that can be tested by
  local governments and residents.</p>









  <p>Phase 3: Implement in Los Angeles County (September  November 2013)</p>



  <p>CCIP will select two or three cities within Los Angeles County to implement
  the community prototypes. To ensure the projects represent community needs,
  the CCIP hopes to work closely with community members, organizations like
  Strategic Concepts in Organizing & Policy Education (SCOPE) and the Department
  of Neighborhood Empowerment, and the local government prior, during and post
  implementation.</p>









  <p>Phase 4: Best Practices Reporting (December 2013)</p>



  <p>This initiative will stimulate new collaboration by community stakeholders
  in the exploration and adoption of new civic tools, so documenting the best
  practices and other learnings from the process is of value to the region
  internally and externally. The projectâ€™s best practices will also be shared
  through the CCIPâ€™s network of local governments and community organizations
  throughout California, and through existing networks of local government
  professional associations, in hopes that the model can be adapted to other
  communities. The visually engaging report will be released at the conclusion
  of the project. </p>









  <p>Social connectedness is a determinant of a community's quality of life, and
  bringing people together to share ideas, ask questions, and cocreate has the
  potential to establish long lasting relationships beyond the initial
  gathering. By creating a space where local government staff and the community
  can interact and collaborate, the NDCH event will lead to stronger networks
  between residents and government, resulting in longerterm civic and social
  engagement.</p>
What are some of your organizationâ€™s most important achievements to date?: >-
  <p>The CCIP aims to diffuse innovation in California local governments through
  researching and recommending organizational and emerging practices that enable
  the creation and adoption of innovative policies, technology, and programs
  that deepen community engagement and accelerate civic innovation. Our research
  and practical exploration aim to breakdown barriers to innovation within
  municipalities, allowing for deeper relationships between residents and
  government.</p>






  <p>CCIP launched in April 2012, and in our first year we have assembled a team
  of staff, interns, advisors, and partners that are dedicated to supporting
  CCIP in achieving longterm sustainability and changing the way California
  local governments work in order to be more responsive to their residents,
  enhancing social connectedness..</p>






  <p>Major project accomplishments include:</p>






  <p> In 2012, Vallejo, California launched the first citywide participatory
  budgeting process in the United States. The City of Vallejo will invite
  residents to decide how to spend over $3.4 million in sales tax revenue.
  Through a yearlong PB process, thousands of residents will engage in critical
  discussions and decisions about the future of the city. The process aims to
  generate more informed spending, develop new grassroots leaders, build
  stronger communities, educate the public, expand civic participation, and
  forge deeper connections between government officials and citizens.  CCIP
  serves as a research partner on this project because we are interested in the
  numerous impacts participatory budgeting can have in a community.</p>






  <p> In September 2012, CCIP began an exploration of how innovation spreads in
  local government, through a study of how local governmental leaders use formal
  and informal networks to share information. The project uses a diverse set of
  methodologies  from conversations with experts on networks and city
  administration, to surveys and interviews with public servants and city
  government associations, to documentation of knowledge sharing practices in
  several innovative projects undertaken by cities and counties in California.
  Together, these methods will allow us to explain how city staffers currently
  receive and disseminate information related to innovation, the barriers to
  more effective diffusion of ideas and approaches, and the ways in which
  existing formal networks might be modified to promote better collaboration and
  communication. We hope that the study will build on successes in the civic
  innovation space by helping to institutionalize the spread of innovation
  within and between cities. We seek to provide a roadmap to formal networks for
  effective modification and replication of successful projects. Our findings
  report will be released the week of April 1st.</p>
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  <p>The CCIP will leverage partnerships with local community groups for
  outreach and participation in the National Day of Hacking event. As a grantee
  of the James Irvine Foundation, we will reach out to other grantees in the Los
  Angeles area to ensure we are inclusive in outreach and partnerships. In
  addition, we will seek input and participation from municipalities within Los
  Angeles County and anchor organizations like the Department of Neighborhood
  Empowerment.</p>






  <p>In addition, the New America Foundation has an existing partnership with
  Zocalo Public Square, a notforprofit daily Ideas Exchange that blends live
  events and humanities journalism, based in Santa Monica, CA.</p>
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  <p>The ultimate outcome of the Civic Lab will be an increase in civic
  participation in communities throughout Los Angeles and attendant improvements
  in the ability of residents to impact local decisionmaking.  This will be
  realized through a number of intermediate outcomes that comprise an increase
  in capacity and connections among stakeholders throughout Los Angeles. </p>


   


  <p>The specific intermediate outcomes that we expect from the Civic Lab that
  will foster participation and better decisionmaking are:</p>






  <p> Increased avenues for participation through new user friendly tools and
  government processes that dovetail with those tools</p>



  <p> Greater amount of knowledge and skills regarding the use and value of
  tools and processes for civic innovation among both residents and local
  leaders</p>



  <p> Enhanced crosssector relationships among stakeholders working to improve
  civic life in Los Angeles communities</p>



  <p> A new template for collaborative, regional civic innovation through the
  this project model</p>






  <p>Key Metrics:



  National Day of Civic Hacking Event</p>



  <p> Reach: At least 100 participants, including local government employees,
  community members, community leaders, businesses</p>



  <p> Engagement: Small working groups will form around topics/ ideas. These
  groups will persist beyond the initial event and work together in the
  subsequent workshops.</p>



  <p> Policy/Influence: Commitment from two local governments to adopt a
  solution designed during the event.</p>






  <p>Prototyping Workshops</p>



  <p> Reach: Three to five workshops within the county that provide space,
  mentoring, and feedback for teams continuing to prototype solutions</p>



  <p> Engagement: At least 20 community members and other stakeholders engaged
  in the workshops over the course of three months</p>



  <p> Policy/ Influence: Five new community projects resulting from the
  workshops. Not all of these will be implemented within local government; some
  will remain community driven projects.</p>






  <p>Community Engagement Prototypes</p>



  <p> Reach: Two projects will be tested in cities within Los Angeles
  County.</p>



  <p> Engagement: The collaborative nature of the projects will ensure the
  prototypes tested by cities reflect community engagement needs and fit within
  governmentâ€™s scope.</p>



  <p> Policy/ Influence: Prototypes will test various models of government
  transparency leading to engagement. Ultimately the tools should lead to
  widespread adoption of more transparency and engagement programs in
  cities.</p>






  <p>Best Practices and Lessons Learned</p>



  <p> Reach: Provide report on best practices and lessons learned.</p>



  <p> Engagement: Use developing best practices and continually refine them.</p>



  <p> Policy/ Influence: Share best practices with all interested stakeholders
  through website and CCIP network of local governments, and partnerships with
  organizations like Department of Neighborhood Empowerment or SCOPE.</p>
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  Our overarching goal is to use this integrated ideation, prototype and
  deployment process to significantly change citizen interactions with each
  other and government in ways that deepen people's connection to and investment
  in Los Angeles communities.






  Over 500 volunteer hours will be dedicated to the NDCH, through participation
  in the day long event. This project will give those who might not
  traditionally volunteer an opportunity to use their skills as community
  organizers, designers, developers, or subject matter experts, to contribute to
  improving the future of Los Angeles.  By partnering with local community
  organizations, we also hope to attract populations who are distrustful of Los
  Angelesâ€™ government, or who have had no previous exposure to the inner
  workings of local government.  These might include undocumented immigrants,
  formerly incarcerated people, youth, lowincome people, nonnative English
  speakers, and minorities.  Engaging these communities in the process of
  government, providing them with contacts at City Hall, and ensuring that
  government services are directed toward these groups is vitally important for
  a city that continues to struggle with enormous racial and economic divides,
  and in which many residents harbor deep resentment toward local government
  agencies.






  In addition to volunteering, the participants will leave the event with new
  connections and relationships with other community members, and those
  connections will be nurtured through the prototyping workshops, where teams
  that formed during the NDCH will continue to meet, collaborate, and create
  together. The ideas discussed and prototyped during from the NDCH will be
  geared toward social connectedness, producing greater involvement in the
  community by residents.  This, in turn, will lead to community input at City
  Hall that is more representative than what is typically received, resulting in
  solutions that respond more directly to community needs.  But we also expect
  that relationships formed during the process of Civic Lab will be valuable to
  participants as they seek to establish networks that can later assist in
  everything from public safety to childcare to finding a job.  By bringing
  diverse groups of people together, the Civic Lab will create bonds that
  strengthen neighborhoods and promote the health and wellbeing of its
  residents.


   


  Additionally, the CCIP aims to have a longerterm impact beyond the region,
  both in California and nationally, by creating a documented set of practices
  that other regions can use to come together across cities and sectors in an
  effort to foster more engaged communities.  This will establish Los Angeles as
  a leader in the space of civic innovation, instilling pride in residents and
  the local governments that serve them, and encouraging further collaboration
  between the two.
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  <p>At the CCIP we believe that increased civic participation results in more
  resilient communities that provide a better quality of life for residents. As
  Los Angelenos grow stronger networks within their communities and city, they

    answer: "<p>The National Day of Civic Hacking (NDCH) is a national event, sponsored by the White House, taking place in over 50 cities across the country on June 1st and 2nd. It gives citizens an opportunity to do what is most quintessentially American: roll up our sleeves, get involved and work together to improve our society. We plan to kick off the National Day of Hacking with an event focused not on coding, but rather on developing ideas and prototypes to make government transparency efforts lead to better civic engagement. Community ideas and prototypes could range from things as simple as better signage for navigating City Hall and government offices, to developing a system that alerts the public when particular issues of personal concern appear before City Council. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This event is a creative, productive, and exciting way for Los Angelenos to volunteer while promoting civic and social engagement. Our target audience for NDCH is local government officials in cities throughout Los Angeles County, community leaders, citizen hacktivists, designers, and ordinary residents interested in finding ways to make local governmental transparency meaningful and engaging for the people of Los Angeles.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Over the three months following the NDCH, CA Civic Innovation (CCIP) staff will lead small workshops at which community members and local government staffers will more fully develop and vet prototypes in preparation for their use within government. The CCIP will work with local governments to implement the concepts, whether they be process improvements, technologies, or policies aimed at improving civic engagement through transparency. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Phase 1: National Day of Civic Hacking Event - LA Civic Lab launch (June 1, 2013)</p>\r\n<p>The event will bring together participants from various sectors to collaborate on idea generation and prototyping civic tools to make government more transparent and engaging. Civic tools can range from policy improvements aimed at making information more engaging, to participatory projects like participatory budgeting, and could also include technology to easily enable collaborative writing of rules, policies, or guides. We expect that a variety of ideas and prototypes will surface that reflect the needs and desires of the community, and these tools will not be limited to only technology solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Phase 2: Prototyping Workshops (June - August 2013)</p>\r\n<p>Three to five small workshops will be held in Los Angeles to fully develop ideas and prototypes generated during the NDCH event. The workshops will be small scale, hands-on, two or three hour sessions.  Teams or individuals that developed prototypes will receive and provide feedback, mentoring, and any additional support they might need. The goal is to ensure that the prototypes meet the needs of the community and can be supported by local governments. Prototypes resulting from the NDCH could include draft amendments to local policies, or a new SMS tool to connect neighbors and send alerts. Because of the short time frame, we do not expect fully functional, feature-rich tools to emerge from this process, but we will aim for prototypes that can be tested by local governments and residents.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Phase 3: Implement in Los Angeles County (September - November 2013)</p>\r\n<p>CCIP will select two or three cities within Los Angeles County to implement the community prototypes. To ensure the projects represent community needs, the CCIP hopes to work closely with community members, organizations like Strategic Concepts in Organizing & Policy Education (SCOPE) and the Department of Neighborhood Empowerment, and the local government prior, during and post implementation.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Phase 4: Best Practices Reporting (December 2013)</p>\r\n<p>This initiative will stimulate new collaboration by community stakeholders in the exploration and adoption of new civic tools, so documenting the best practices and other learnings from the process is of value to the region internally and externally. The projectâ€™s best practices will also be shared through the CCIPâ€™s network of local governments and community organizations throughout California, and through existing networks of local government professional associations, in hopes that the model can be adapted to other communities. The visually engaging report will be released at the conclusion of the project. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Social connectedness is a determinant of a community's quality of life, and bringing people together to share ideas, ask questions, and co-create has the potential to establish long lasting relationships beyond the initial gathering. By creating a space where local government staff and the community can interact and collaborate, the NDCH event will lead to stronger networks between residents and government, resulting in longer-term civic and social engagement.</p>"

    answer: "Our overarching goal is to use this integrated ideation, prototype and deployment process to significantly change citizen interactions with each other and government in ways that deepen people's connection to and investment in Los Angeles communities.\r\n\r\nOver 500 volunteer hours will be dedicated to the NDCH, through participation in the day long event. This project will give those who might not traditionally volunteer an opportunity to use their skills as community organizers, designers, developers, or subject matter experts, to contribute to improving the future of Los Angeles.  By partnering with local community organizations, we also hope to attract populations who are distrustful of Los Angelesâ€™ government, or who have had no previous exposure to the inner workings of local government.  These might include undocumented immigrants, formerly incarcerated people, youth, low-income people, non-native English speakers, and minorities.  Engaging these communities in the process of government, providing them with contacts at City Hall, and ensuring that government services are directed toward these groups is vitally important for a city that continues to struggle with enormous racial and economic divides, and in which many residents harbor deep resentment toward local government agencies.\r\n\r\nIn addition to volunteering, the participants will leave the event with new connections and relationships with other community members, and those connections will be nurtured through the prototyping workshops, where teams that formed during the NDCH will continue to meet, collaborate, and create together. The ideas discussed and prototyped during from the NDCH will be geared toward social connectedness, producing greater involvement in the community by residents.  This, in turn, will lead to community input at City Hall that is more representative than what is typically received, resulting in solutions that respond more directly to community needs.  But we also expect that relationships formed during the process of Civic Lab will be valuable to participants as they seek to establish networks that can later assist in everything from public safety to childcare to finding a job.  By bringing diverse groups of people together, the Civic Lab will create bonds that strengthen neighborhoods and promote the health and well-being of its residents.\r\n \r\nAdditionally, the CCIP aims to have a longer-term impact beyond the region, both in California and nationally, by creating a documented set of practices that other regions can use to come together across cities and sectors in an effort to foster more engaged communities.  This will establish Los Angeles as a leader in the space of civic innovation, instilling pride in residents and the local governments that serve them, and encouraging further collaboration between the two."

    answer: "<p>The ultimate outcome of the Civic Lab will be an increase in civic participation in communities throughout Los Angeles and attendant improvements in the ability of residents to impact local decision-making.  This will be realized through a number of intermediate outcomes that comprise an increase in capacity and connections among stakeholders throughout Los Angeles. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>The specific intermediate outcomes that we expect from the Civic Lab that will foster participation and better decision-making are:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Increased avenues for participation through new user friendly tools and government processes that dovetail with those tools</p>\r\n<p>- Greater amount of knowledge and skills regarding the use and value of tools and processes for civic innovation among both residents and local leaders</p>\r\n<p>- Enhanced cross-sector relationships among stakeholders working to improve civic life in Los Angeles communities</p>\r\n<p>- A new template for collaborative, regional civic innovation through the this project model</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Key Metrics:\r\nNational Day of Civic Hacking Event</p>\r\n<p>- Reach: At least 100 participants, including local government employees, community members, community leaders, businesses</p>\r\n<p>- Engagement: Small working groups will form around topics/ ideas.

    answer: "<p>The CCIP aims to diffuse innovation in California local governments through researching and recommending organizational and emerging practices that enable the creation and adoption of innovative policies, technology, and programs that deepen community engagement and accelerate civic innovation. Our research and practical exploration aim to break-down barriers to innovation within municipalities, allowing for deeper relationships between residents and government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CCIP launched in April 2012, and in our first year we have assembled a team of staff, interns, advisors, and partners that are dedicated to supporting CCIP in achieving long-term sustainability and changing the way California local governments work in order to be more responsive to their residents, enhancing social connectedness..</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Major project accomplishments include:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- In 2012, Vallejo, California launched the first city-wide participatory budgeting process in the United States. The City of Vallejo will invite residents to decide how to spend over $3.4 million in sales tax revenue. Through a year-long PB process, thousands of residents will engage in critical discussions and decisions about the future of the city. The process aims to generate more informed spending, develop new grassroots leaders, build stronger communities, educate the public, expand civic participation, and forge deeper connections between government officials and citizens.  CCIP serves as a research partner on this project because we are interested in the numerous impacts participatory budgeting can have in a community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- In September 2012, CCIP began an exploration of how innovation spreads in local government, through a study of how local governmental leaders use formal and informal networks to share information. The project uses a diverse set of methodologies -- from conversations with experts on networks and city administration, to surveys and interviews with public servants and city government associations, to documentation of knowledge sharing practices in several innovative projects undertaken by cities and counties in California. Together, these methods will allow us to explain how city staffers currently receive and disseminate information related to innovation, the barriers to more effective diffusion of ideas and approaches, and the ways in which existing formal networks might be modified to promote better collaboration and communication. We hope that the study will build on successes in the civic innovation space by helping to institutionalize the spread of innovation within and between cities. We seek to provide a roadmap to formal networks for effective modification and replication of successful projects. Our findings report will be released the week of April 1st.</p>"

    answer: "<p>Our competition for this specific project would come from organizations, like Code for America Brigade, that focus primarily on technology solutions that can be easily deployed in multiple cities. Additionally, over the past few years there has been a focus on hack-a-thons and rapidly building tools for communities in 24 to 48 hours. In practice the hack-a-thon model often falls short on delivering real solutions that reflect the communityâ€™s needs.  Thatâ€™s not to say all hack-a-thons fail, but drawing on our experience participating in numerous hackathons, we see an opportunity to go beyond the hackathon.  In this way we can encourage more social connectedness between diverse groups in the interest of addressing community needs, rather than providing a platform for a group of technologists to code for a day to design the fanciest app.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EducadeLA, a community branch of GameDesk, is planning a Meetup in LA on the NDCH to bring together residents to focus on education hacks. This is not necessarily competition, because we believe that the more groups answering the White House's call to action, the better.  But EducadeLAâ€™s event will attract a segment of the population that will not be attending our event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Organizationally we do not see ourselves as having direct competition because weâ€™re exploring a field that has vast amounts of uncharted territory. Our combination of research, policy recommendations, convening stakeholders, and prototyping solutions makes us unique in the think tank and policy fields, and gives us an advantage in the on-the-ground work we do through partnerships with local governments.</p>"
