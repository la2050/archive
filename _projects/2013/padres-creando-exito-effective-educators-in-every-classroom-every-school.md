title: 'Padres Creando Exito: Effective educators in every classroom every school  '
project_summary: "The Alliance for a Better Community (ABC) is proposing to elevate the public dialogue regarding equity and access to high quality instruction delivered by highly effective educators to all students in every classroom, every school. By partnering with the parents and families, students, teachers and administrators served by the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), ABC will implement an education and awareness campaign, with a particular focus on media, to discuss and define the critical role parents and families must play in identifying, supporting and retaining effective educators.  \r\n\r\nPublic education in Los Angeles and California is fundamentally failing our children. For decades it has underserved and tracked students of color into separate academic and vocational programs, thereby perpetuating the inequities of race, gender and socio-economic status in our society. ABC believes that in order for schools to provide the quality education children deserve and need, parents and families must serve as meaningful partners at the school and district levels. \r\n\r\nTo increase student learning, excellent teachers are needed in every classroom. Research has found teachers to be the most important school-related factor in student achievement.  According to a report on the LAUSD, the National Center on Teacher Quality found that, “of the 11,000 LAUSD teachers evaluated in the 2009-2010 school year, 79 percent met the standard in all 27 indicators, signaling that they did not need any improvement. Contrast teachers’ apparent extraordinary level of performance with student performance: only 41% of students scored proficient on the state language arts exam and only 39% scored proficient in mathematics.” There are specific educational disparities that inequitably impact Latinos and African Americans in Los Angeles; one of those is the caliber of teachers in their classrooms. In a report by Education Trust-West, it was found that effective teachers are not equally distributed in LAUSD. Teachers in the top 25 percent are less likely to instruct lower-income students of color. These teachers are also more likely to leave the district's highest need schools.  This is critically important since a teacher has more impact on student learning than any other factor controlled by school systems, including class size, school size, the quality of after-school programs and even which school a student attends. Because a high percentage of a school’s impact is attributable to teachers, attracting and retaining highly effective educators becomes critical to making substantial achievement gains that are sustained over time. (Met Project, 2011). \r\n\r\nABC is working collaboratively with its partners to advocate for policies and practices that identify, support and retain effective educators in high-need schools across LAUSD and integrate parents and families in the discussion and decision-making. Public dialogue around the topic has traditionally been led by District and union leaders and education pundits who are currently shaping how this issue is framed by the mainstream media and understood by those on the sideline watching the debate.  ABC is proposing to elevate the voices of those not typically heard, the: PARENTS and FAMILIES who have students in the District; STUDENTS who have been through the public school system and can testify to the impact that effective educators have had on their academic successes, and; TEACHERS in the classroom that understand the importance of the debate because they care about their students and families. ABC will launch a public education and awareness campaign, through the use of media, that elevates the critical role these stakeholders share in including the parents and families in the educator effectiveness dialogue to benefit student educational outcomes.  \r\n\r\nSome of the key activities will include: convening at least 3 focus groups comprised of teachers, parents and students to discuss how parents and families can contribute to the development of policies and public conversations; developing at least 2 videos and 5 online profiles of parents, teachers and students providing testimonials about the importance of family voices in this public dialogue; developing key recommendations for how parents and families can be engaged in this conversation at their local schools and at the District; developing a document that outlines key principles for engaging parents in educator effectiveness that can be distributed amongst parent groups; and coordinating an official kick-off launch with the produced videos, profiles and information tools that will help inform on-going and future discussions about how to best identify, support and retain effective teachers. \r\n"

  description: "Los Angeles stands to benefit from this project because the academic and social (human capital) development of our students is being shaped by more than 32,000 teachers that instruct over 667,250 students ever year in our public schools.  Research shows that 58% of a school’s impact on student achievement is attributable to principal and teacher effectiveness. As a result, attracting and retaining highly effective educators becomes critical to making substantial gains in student achievement that are sustained over time. Research has also shown that parents are a significant influence in the academic success of their children. Although studies often point to poverty as a significant predictor of low academic achievement, when parents and families are given the skills and tools necessary to create a nurturing learning environment, low-income families and children can defy the odds (Davis-Keane, 2007). Additionally, when parents are given decision making roles and considered equal partners in their child’s education, they can become informed and effective advocates for their child’s education.  \r\n\r\nAs the second largest school District in the nation, LAUSD is taking a step forward and leading the debate as it currently examines how it can best support its teacher and administrator workforce. We currently have a window of opportunity to engage in this discussion and most importantly to help shape it, so that we ensure that parents and families are seen as crucial partners and part of the solution to arriving at meaningful ways of identifying, supporting and retaining effective educators for their children. By launching a public education and awareness campaign around the importance of having an effective educator in every classroom, every school and offering tools and recommendations on parents’ roles in this issue, we will build critical links between policy development and on-the-ground teacher, student and parent realities, by broadening public accountability to include consumers. \r\n\r\nUltimately, Los Angeles will benefit from having educators that are: \r\n-\tidentified as highly effective to minimize inequitable access to quality teachers by low-income and underrepresented families; \r\n-\tsupported in their profession by receiving high-quality, relevant professional development and resources to improve their craft, and; \r\n-\tretained in the classroom so that students have consistent and stable learning environments and teachers are rewarded for their positive contributions to student outcomes. \r\n"

    ABC will work with teacher and student led organizations that have also
    identified educator effectiveness as a core priority, in order to highlight
    diverse voices in this public dialogue. ABC will partner with Teach Plus, a
    teacher-led organization focused on developing the capacity of teachers; and
    Students for Education Reform (SFER), a student led group with local
    chapters across Southern California  who have also identified “great
    leaders, great teachers” as important to the success of students.  TeachPlus
    and SFER have been approached to help identify teacher and student voices,
    respectively, that can speak to the importance of having an effective
    educator in every classroom and the important role of parents to ensure this
    happens.

  description1: "College Preparatory Curriculum: ABC co-convened the Communities for Educational Equity, a network of more than 20 organizations that mobilized thousands of parents, students, and stakeholders to advocate for LAUSD to adopt a policy that provides the A-G college preparatory curriculum to all students.  The policy was adopted in 2005.\r\n\r\nPilot Schools and Zones of Choice:  In response to the poor academic outcomes produced at local schools, ABC incited and supported the District in its efforts to bring new, innovative models of learning to Mid-City, Belmont-area students.  Today, these students are provided school choice through a novel program called the Belmont Zone of Choice.  Incoming 9th grade students choose among 19 career-themed options housed within four campuses.\r\n\r\nLinked Learning: ABC is committed to developing high quality college and career education opportunities via the Linked Learning approach to instruction.  Efforts include the successful passage of LAUSDs Linked Learning Resolution and the authoring of The Bottom-Up Approach: How Youth & Parent Organizing Strengthen Linked Learning Pathways to Both College and Career. ABC is also an evaluator for the Linked Learning Statewide Certification Review Team. \r\n \t\r\nAfterschool Programs: ABC authored the report, “Maximizing After School Opportunities for English Learners” which outlined policy recommendations for improving the academic outcomes of ELs through after school programs.  As a result of the report, then Assembly member Torlakson authored AB 2178 which allows after school program operators to obtain student academic data from school districts in order to improve programming and service delivery to students and Governor Schwarzenegger signed AB 2178 into law.  \r\n\r\nDon’t Hold Us Back Coalition: ABC was a leading member of this partnership comprised of a group of civil rights, parent and community organizations that believe every child deserves a quality public school education that prepares them for college and 21st century careers.. Our key demands to the LAUSD and the local teachers union included lifting the cap on teacher-led school structures; providing multiple measure evaluations to teachers; and assigning teachers to schools based on student need and not \"must-place\" hiring practices. As the spokesperson for the coalition, ABC used its platform in interviews with every major LA Spanish and English language newspaper and local media outlets, to describe how together, 100 parents and community members were mobilized, 26 organizations signed on to our efforts, close to 1,000 signed our petition, and as a result LAUSD-UTLA passed the Local Schools Stabilization and Empowerment Initiative of 2011. Since the coalition’s efforts wrapped up in December 2011, ABC shared its efforts with teacher groups, community organizations, parent groups and researchers nationwide to promote the replication of this type of effort. "
  description3: "ABC was formed to achieve its objectives by harnessing the collective strengths of diverse and multiple stakeholders to create a synergy of program and policy development toward positive change.  In addition, ABC works closely with parents and families in local schools to lift up their voices and help inform critical educational systemic change efforts.  The role of convener, coalition builder and parent galvanizer is what differentiates ABC from other organizations that have a similar focus on educator effectiveness. \r\n\r\nABC’s competition in the arena of educator effectiveness is defined by those organizations that have explicit goals, missions, and/or objectives related to improving the impact that teachers have on student outcomes. Specifically, work done to examine how effective educators are identified, supported and retained classifies as being in line with the work that ABC does in this space. Organizations that do work around educator effectiveness include Educators for Excellence, Students First, Teach Plus, Students for Education Reform, Teachers for New Unionism, and EdVoice.  ABC knows these organizations well because we have worked closely with each of them on local and state-wide campaigns to address certain pieces of the educator effectiveness reform.  In some instances we have co-sponsored local reports on the importance of educator effectiveness, and in others we have been part of informal collaborative groups that have strategized and discussed how best to positively impact discussions around this issue. ABC prides itself on having positive working relationships with each one of these groups and regularly meets and talks to them to share our work and determine areas of alignment and support for common outcomes.\r\n\r\nABC’s added-value to the work being done around educator effectiveness is its partnerships with local parents and families and its ability to elevate their voices for policy and systems change. Similarly, our successful track record of convening partners and providing a space for collaboration amongst different stakeholders is another way that ABC differentiates itself and brings value to the collaborative work between all of these organizations.  \r\n\r\nABC realizes the impact of its work lies in its ability to raise awareness in the community and among our key decision makers on the important role parents and families can play in advancing educator effectiveness policies that best support their children. ABC also acknowledges the positive impact that differing voices, experiences and perspectives can bring to campaign for educational improvement. "
  vision: "In the year 2050, education in Los Angeles will once again be amongst the top rated in the country. Groups from other school districts in the nation will be visiting LAUSD to learn about the effective teaching taking place in all of its classrooms.  Parents, teachers and students will continue to be welcomed contributors to the public dialogue about effective teaching, student achievement, and the importance of building a school community that responds to the needs of each one of these stakeholders.\r\n\r\nThe LAUSD will see parents are critical partners in the educator effectiveness conversation, and as such will design culturally and linguistically relevant tools that inform parents and families as well as obtain parental feedback on key school reform efforts.  In line with these changes, parent surveys will be used as one of the multiple indicators in teacher evaluations. Information regarding educator effectiveness will be readily available to parents so that they can be better advocates for their children and the teachers in their schools.  Teachers will not feel attacked or challenged when parents speak about educator effectiveness, because they will all be using similar language to describe their ambitions for the success of students. \r\n\r\nIn addition, each student will have access to high quality instruction that will result in the elimination of the achievement gap, elimination of inequitable effective teacher distribution, reduced drop-out rates, engaged students that are being challenged with rigorous and relevant instruction, and an increase in students being prepared for college and meaningful careers in a highly competitive economy. Educators that are struggling in the classroom will be able to receive helpful feedback from their performance evaluations and strong professional development and supports that improve their teaching.  Likewise, educators that are effectively teaching their students will be rewarded with transparent and unbiased feedback on their performance, as well as compensation based on their contributions to student outcomes and their school community.  \r\n\r\nIn 2050, teachers, parents and students will be regularly featured by the media, District and union leaders and educational pundits that want to add to the public dialogue about educational issues that matter to everyone and can be relatable by anyone.

What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >+
  The Alliance for a Better Community (ABC) is proposing to elevate the public
  dialogue regarding equity and access to high quality instruction delivered by
  highly effective educators to all students in every classroom, every school.
  By partnering with the parents and families, students, teachers and
  administrators served by the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), ABC
  will implement an education and awareness campaign, with a particular focus on
  media, to discuss and define the critical role parents and families must play
  in identifying, supporting and retaining effective educators.  






  Public education in Los Angeles and California is fundamentally failing our
  children. For decades it has underserved and tracked students of color into
  separate academic and vocational programs, thereby perpetuating the inequities
  of race, gender and socioeconomic status in our society. ABC believes that in
  order for schools to provide the quality education children deserve and need,
  parents and families must serve as meaningful partners at the school and
  district levels. 






  To increase student learning, excellent teachers are needed in every
  classroom. Research has found teachers to be the most important schoolrelated
  factor in student achievement.  According to a report on the LAUSD, the
  National Center on Teacher Quality found that, “of the 11,000 LAUSD teachers
  evaluated in the 20092010 school year, 79 percent met the standard in all 27
  indicators, signaling that they did not need any improvement. Contrast
  teachers’ apparent extraordinary level of performance with student
  performance: only 41% of students scored proficient on the state language arts
  exam and only 39% scored proficient in mathematics.” There are specific
  educational disparities that inequitably impact Latinos and African Americans
  in Los Angeles; one of those is the caliber of teachers in their classrooms.
  In a report by Education TrustWest, it was found that effective teachers are
  not equally distributed in LAUSD. Teachers in the top 25 percent are less
  likely to instruct lowerincome students of color. These teachers are also more
  likely to leave the district's highest need schools.  This is critically
  important since a teacher has more impact on student learning than any other
  factor controlled by school systems, including class size, school size, the
  quality of afterschool programs and even which school a student attends.
  Because a high percentage of a school’s impact is attributable to teachers,
  attracting and retaining highly effective educators becomes critical to making
  substantial achievement gains that are sustained over time. (Met Project,
  2011). 






  ABC is working collaboratively with its partners to advocate for policies and
  practices that identify, support and retain effective educators in highneed
  schools across LAUSD and integrate parents and families in the discussion and
  decisionmaking. Public dialogue around the topic has traditionally been led by
  District and union leaders and education pundits who are currently shaping how
  this issue is framed by the mainstream media and understood by those on the
  sideline watching the debate.  ABC is proposing to elevate the voices of those
  not typically heard, the: PARENTS and FAMILIES who have students in the
  District; STUDENTS who have been through the public school system and can
  testify to the impact that effective educators have had on their academic
  successes, and; TEACHERS in the classroom that understand the importance of
  the debate because they care about their students and families. ABC will
  launch a public education and awareness campaign, through the use of media,
  that elevates the critical role these stakeholders share in including the
  parents and families in the educator effectiveness dialogue to benefit student
  educational outcomes.  






  Some of the key activities will include: convening at least 3 focus groups
  comprised of teachers, parents and students to discuss how parents and
  families can contribute to the development of policies and public
  conversations; developing at least 2 videos and 5 online profiles of parents,
  teachers and students providing testimonials about the importance of family
  voices in this public dialogue; developing key recommendations for how parents
  and families can be engaged in this conversation at their local schools and at
  the District; developing a document that outlines key principles for engaging
  parents in educator effectiveness that can be distributed amongst parent
  groups; and coordinating an official kickoff launch with the produced videos,
  profiles and information tools that will help inform ongoing and future
  discussions about how to best identify, support and retain effective
  teachers.

  In the year 2050, education in Los Angeles will once again be amongst the top
  rated in the country. Groups from other school districts in the nation will be
  visiting LAUSD to learn about the effective teaching taking place in all of
  its classrooms.  Parents, teachers and students will continue to be welcomed
  contributors to the public dialogue about effective teaching, student
  achievement, and the importance of building a school community that responds
  to the needs of each one of these stakeholders.






  The LAUSD will see parents are critical partners in the educator effectiveness
  conversation, and as such will design culturally and linguistically relevant
  tools that inform parents and families as well as obtain parental feedback on
  key school reform efforts.  In line with these changes, parent surveys will be
  used as one of the multiple indicators in teacher evaluations. Information
  regarding educator effectiveness will be readily available to parents so that
  they can be better advocates for their children and the teachers in their
  schools.  Teachers will not feel attacked or challenged when parents speak
  about educator effectiveness, because they will all be using similar language
  to describe their ambitions for the success of students. 






  In addition, each student will have access to high quality instruction that
  will result in the elimination of the achievement gap, elimination of
  inequitable effective teacher distribution, reduced dropout rates, engaged
  students that are being challenged with rigorous and relevant instruction, and
  an increase in students being prepared for college and meaningful careers in a
  highly competitive economy. Educators that are struggling in the classroom
  will be able to receive helpful feedback from their performance evaluations
  and strong professional development and supports that improve their teaching. 
  Likewise, educators that are effectively teaching their students will be
  rewarded with transparent and unbiased feedback on their performance, as well
  as compensation based on their contributions to student outcomes and their
  school community.  






  In 2050, teachers, parents and students will be regularly featured by the
  media, District and union leaders and educational pundits that want to add to
  the public dialogue about educational issues that matter to everyone and can
  be relatable by anyone.

project_summary_backup: "College Preparatory Curriculum: ABC co-convened the Communities for Educational Equity, a network of more than 20 organizations that mobilized thousands of parents, students, and stakeholders to advocate for LAUSD to adopt a policy that provides the A-G college preparatory curriculum to all students.  The policy was adopted in 2005.\r\n\r\nPilot Schools and Zones of Choice:  In response to the poor academic outcomes produced at local schools, ABC incited and supported the District in its efforts to bring new, innovative models of learning to Mid-City, Belmont-area students.  Today, these students are provided school choice through a novel program called the Belmont Zone of Choice.  Incoming 9th grade students choose among 19 career-themed options housed within four campuses.\r\n\r\nLinked Learning: ABC is committed to developing high quality college and career education opportunities via the Linked Learning approach to instruction.  Efforts include the successful passage of LAUSDs Linked Learning Resolution and the authoring of The Bottom-Up Approach: How Youth & Parent Organizing Strengthen Linked Learning Pathways to Both College and Career. ABC is also an evaluator for the Linked Learning Statewide Certification Review Team. \r\n \t\r\nAfterschool Programs: ABC authored the report, “Maximizing After School Opportunities for English Learners” which outlined policy recommendations for improving the academic outcomes of ELs through after school programs.  As a result of the report, then Assembly member Torlakson authored AB 2178 which allows after school program operators to obtain student academic data from school districts in order to improve programming and service delivery to students and Governor Schwarzenegger signed AB 2178 into law.  \r\n\r\nDon’t Hold Us Back Coalition: ABC was a leading member of this partnership comprised of a group of civil rights, parent and community organizations that believe every child deserves a quality public school education that prepares them for college and 21st century careers.. Our key demands to the LAUSD and the local teachers union included lifting the cap on teacher-led school structures; providing multiple measure evaluations to teachers; and assigning teachers to schools based on student need and not \"must-place\" hiring practices. As the spokesperson for the coalition, ABC used its platform in interviews with every major LA Spanish and English language newspaper and local media outlets, to describe how together, 100 parents and community members were mobilized, 26 organizations signed on to our efforts, close to 1,000 signed our petition, and as a result LAUSD-UTLA passed the Local Schools Stabilization and Empowerment Initiative of 2011. Since the coalition’s efforts wrapped up in December 2011, ABC shared its efforts with teacher groups, community organizations, parent groups and researchers nationwide to promote the replication of this type of effort.
