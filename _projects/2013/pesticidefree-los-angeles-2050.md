title: PesticideFree Los Angeles 2050
indicator: ' Environmental Quality'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  Since 2006, more than onethird of honey bee colonies have collapsed
  worldwide—a global phenomenon now called Colony Collapse Disorder or CCD.
  There is no one smoking gun causing CCD; in fact, scientists now widely agree
  that it is a combination of factors. The best science tells us that if present
  trends continue there will be no more bees by 2035. That is, if we fail to
  act—if we fail to recognize this disaster in the making and don't take strong
  action to counter the slow march to extinction. <br><br>






  At HoneyLove we have made it our mission to inspire and educate urban
  beekeepers as a means of conserving this critical species. Whereas bees used
  for pollination in the migratory beekeeping industry are suffering from colony
  collapse disorder, bees living in urban environments—especially Los
  Angeles—have been spared this fate. Why? Because the reasons contributing to
  the decline of the honey bee are absent (or significantly reduced) in the city
  environment. Urban bees can find more than enough forage in our gardens,
  landscaping, and weedy areas to feed themselves throughout the seasons
  (commercial bees are fed an artificial diet of sugar water, confectionery
  sugar and high fructose corn syrup). Because there is plentiful forage, urban
  bees are spared the stress which has contributed to the species'
  vulnerability. And since the vast majority of the forage in the city is
  pesticidefree—because most homeowners aren't dumping industrialstrength
  chemicals on their yards—bees have one less critical enemy to contend with.
  While the city represents the bees' best shot at surviving and thriving, at
  HoneyLove still have a lot of work to do to ensure they will have a healthy
  ecosystem in the future. <br><br>






  In spite of being relatively pesticidefree compared to big agriculture, Los
  Angeles still uses an alarming amount of consumerlevel pesticides that pollute
  our soil and waterways and affect our already poor air quality. Consumer
  products are often harmful to pollinators like the honey bee and yet they do
  not have to be labeled as such. HoneyLove's vision for 2050 is of a
  pesticidefree Los Angeles, achieved through grassroots campaigning and led by
  beekeepers in each of LA's 95 communities. We believe that by creating
  educated urban beekeepers we're also creating stakeholders in our communities
  who can represent our concerns about pesticides. It is our belief that by
  training and educating beekeepers as ambassadors of the pesticidefree Los
  Angeles message, we can begin to tackle this enormous problem one household at
  a time, one lawn at a time, one school at a time, until we've built a critical
  mass which will simply not accept the use of chemicals in our backyards,
  parks, and public spaces. Taking pesticides out of the equation will have
  unquestionable benefits for our environment; soil will be free of chemical
  contaminants, runoff after storms will lack the poisonous punch it once had,
  and citizens will breathe freely knowing they won't be inhaling carcinogenic
  toxins. The only indicator a pesticidefree LA in 2050 doesn't touch on is
  proximity to parks and access to free space, but it does ensure that those
  places will be cleaner, healthier environments for people to enjoy. Our parks
  can become shining examples of pesticidefree, natural environments and serve
  as the inspiration for citizens to think differently about the products they
  use at home and in their gardens.
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  Since being founded in April 2011, HoneyLove has been leading the grassroots
  effort to legalize urban beekeeping in Los Angeles, beginning with an
  extensive feasibility study and outreach campaign in Mar Vista. From there we
  gained the additional support of 10 Neighborhood Councils throughout Los
  Angeles: Del Rey, Greater Griffith Park, South Robertson, Silver Lake,
  Hollywood United, Atwater Village, West LA, Boyle Heights, Lake Balboa, and
  Chatsworth. Our thorough campaign work resulted in Councilman Bill Rosendahl
  putting our motion before the Los Angeles City Council where it is currently
  being studied by the Planning and Land Use Committee. And while we can't say
  that we have achieved full legalization yet, in creating the community model
  and approaching it from a grassroots level we've created momentum which cannot
  be stopped. <br><br>






  Our most important achievements are not measured in legislative changes but in
  the number of people we reach, teach, and impact. In that respect we have been
  enormously successful. In a short time we've connected with people all over
  the world through monthly workshops, mentoring sessions, honey bee rescues,
  education outreach, neighborhood council involvement and social media
  connections. Our proudest single achievement is creating a global community of
  conscientious, active urban beekeepers who now share HoneyLove's mission with
  an evergrowing audience. In 2050, we hope to look back on our work and be
  proud to say that we helped lead the change toward a pesticidefree Los
  Angeles.    
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  HoneyLove's success can be attributed to our eagerness to partner with other
  local orgs and community groups. In addition to working with other beekeeping
  clubs, we'll collaborate with groups like Surf Rider's Ocean Friendly Gardens,
  Tree People, and LA Green Grounds. In order to bring LA up to speed with other
  great cities around the world, we will build on the work of Capital Bee,
  Pesticide Action Network, Beyond Pesticides, Pollinator Partnership, Xerces
  Society, and more. We intend to work at the community level so we'll actively
  seek partnership with each of LA's 95 community councils. Our strategy is to
  create advocates (beekeepers) in each community so our true partners are the
  individuals advancing the cause on a hyperlocal level.
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  As we've learned through our legalization efforts, you can't just take on all
  of Los Angeles all at once; it works much better if you build your case
  community by community. Since the first step of our PesticideFree Los Angeles
  campaign is to target the use of pesticides on city and county property, we'll
  start by approaching community councils to gain support for our motion to
  suspend citysponsored pesticide applications in parks, medians, and other
  public properties. The metrics for success are fairly straightforward: we can
  gauge progress by the number of councils reached and where our motion stands
  in the Los Angeles City Council legislative agenda. <br><br>






  Another benchmark we'll strive for is the creation and training of beekeeper
  ambassadors in each of Los Angeles' communities. We will evaluate our success
  on the basis of having a representative in each community who can persuasively
  make the case why Los Angeles must rid itself of pesticides. <br><br>






  The third piece of our campaign is to create an educational curriculum about
  pesticides we can share through our school outreach, workshops, and marketing
  materials. These opportunities will provide the feedback we'll need to
  constantly evaluate the efficacy of our materials. It will require us to
  continuously refine our approach, and tailor it to the various audiences and
  demographics. <br><br>






  The effects of our project—cleaner soil, air, and water—will be very difficult
  to measure, but the progress toward freeing Los Angeles of pesticides will be
  evaluated by asking ourselves the simple question, "do people still use
  pesticides?" If the answer is anything but "no," we haven't yet reached our
  goal. 
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  The conventional wisdom is that Los Angeles is polluted, smoggy and utterly
  beyond repair. Residents who don't know anything else succumb to apathy and do
  little to invest in the quality of their local environment. Beyond helping to
  create a healthier ecosystem (air, water and soil quality), we believe that
  PesticideFree Los Angeles will elicit an enduring investment in the local
  environment from a significant and meaningful number of the city's denizens.
  People are always shocked—then pleasantly surprised—to learn that the city is
  the last, best hope for the survival of the honey bee. A HoneyLove project
  will educate, enlighten and inspire the hearts and minds of current and future
  residents of Los Angeles and as a result will garner the magnitude of
  investment we need to reduce pollutants and restore the health of our
  communities. Our project's most tangible offering to the Los Angeles community
  will be a mobile app that allows users to track the use of pesticides in
  public spaces, and receive a score card for how their local park, green space,
  or high school sports field is performing. 
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  The year is 2050 and Los Angeles has fundamentally, beautifully transformed;
  has successfully reinvented herself like so many Hollywood starlets throughout
  our city's history. Bursting with rooftop gardens downtown, raised beds that
  feed entire families and sustainable suburbs alive with native plants, there
  is not a useless grass lawn in sight. Los Angeles has morphed from the
  consumer/commuter culture of yesteryear into a hyperlocal, walkable,
  sustainable, responsible city with a healthy future. Not only has Los Angeles
  undergone a physical transformation from a concrete jungle to a
  localfoodproducing haven, it has also taken on a new cultural personality.
  Shedding their former consumer identities, Angelenos now think of themselves
  as producers capable of growing their own food and providing for themselves.
  Residents of Los Angeles have become fiercely protective of their local
  environment and are proud of the fact their city was the first to be 100%
  pesticidefree. Honey bees and beekeepers have become symbols of this newfound
  identity, representing the catalyst that was needed to forge the new Los
  Angeles. Our city will have become the gold standard for living alongside
  honey bees and we will be globally renowned for our bountiful honey harvests.
  And rather than being cast as killers and pests, honey bees will be returned
  to their rightful role at the very center of our existence.
