title: Heal This City
project_summary: "<p>My idea, “Heal This City” (HTC) will demonstrate how PURE, FRESH food, grown locally, is the medicine needed to heal our city's economy from the bottom up &, also, to heal its citizens from the inside out. As you'll read below, besides Health, HTC will also impact Education & the Environment.</p>\r\n<p>LA-2050's award will start 4 high-production, circulating-water farms, a virtual economy-in-a-neighborhood, in Council District 1, 8, or 9 (TBD). These will be designed compliant with municipal zoning code that would, otherwise, outlaw traditional, petrochemical & poison-dependent, soil-based farming.</p>\r\n<p>In the selected neighborhood, HTC's farms will be located 10 to 15 minutes walking distance from every home in the service area. Typically, the heat of asphalt/concrete during summer keeps people indoors. HTC farms will cool the service area with greenery & give an incentive for neighborhood residents to stroll. Tranquil waterfall farms will be structured in climate controlled greenhouses, surrounded by green, park-like settings, producing plant nutrient with on-site fish aquariums. Farms will generate 6 to 10 times more produce per square foot, in (small & large) vacant lots, compared with traditional, industrial farms that work vast acres of land in distant, rural settings.\r\nHTC farms will use 5% of water needed by soil-based farming, helping to conserve water in a critical period of drought. They release no pollution into the environment.</p>\r\n<p>Local jobs will emerge, paying substantially more than minimum wage. These will be supported by ongoing sales of produce. Culinary programming will be coordinated, with friends & family dinners to be served. Priced at cost, they'll introduce neighbors to healthful & delicious nutrition designed (& proven) to increase healthful living, & even save lives (search “May I Be Frank,” the movie, on Google search).</p>\r\n<p>Grown in the place where people reside, HTC's fresh foods will be rich in living enzymes from the moment they are picked. They will be sold to consumers the same day. Grown without pesticides or herbicides, this food is more pure & better tasting than organic foods. It is not filled with preservatives & chemicals, as is the food that arrives by truck from hundreds of miles or (by airbus) from thousands of miles away. HTC will improve diets, enable better health for local families.\r\nIn HTC’s target districts, long-standing poverty exploded in the aftermath of the great recession of 2008-09. Here, communities are tortured by the likelihood of potentially lifelong malnutrition. This problem is an outgrowth of urban blight that emerged during the troubled civil rights, 1950-60 era. Local children from that time are the disease-prone adults of today, crowding emergency rooms & clinics with chronic heart & other organ ailments, diabetes, obesity, & mental illness.</p>\r\n<p>In fact, these souls were crippled before the time when we discovered that a child undernourished in her first three years will not be able to effectively learn throughout a lifetime of standard education. So, in addition to chronic health problems, devoid of healthy learning tools, a whole generation of people have been effectively prevented from prospering. HTC will open doors to a new future, buttressed in its resolve by the dozens of studies that prove the value & healthful effects exposure to nature has on people living in hardscape urban settings. With exposure to nature in the context of food cultivation, the available rewards increase in terms of confidence, self-esteem & leadership; discipline & a sense of self-sufficiency also result. \r\nAs HTC’s economic model is proven viable, banks will step up to invest in its urban-farming economy.

  description: "<p>EDUCATION:\r\nWith the momentum we've experienced this past year as part of developing the program and curriculum for Westchester Enriched Sciences Magnets High School, there's no question that teachers and principles recognize the value of Lab-type greenhouse farming as opposed to traditional raised-bed farming. It's hard to overstate the value of this to high-school education. Teaching seed propagation, benefits of a varied crop mix to high-school students markedly improves test scores. (See studies uploaded, below)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ENVIRONMENT:\r\nWith increasing climate change, extended droughts are continuing, further limiting food production in the Central Valley and farming communities on the outskirts of Los Angeles. Bottom line, food prices are projected to spike sooner, not later. It is crucial to begin transitioning from wasteful and ecologically damaging farming practices that yield 4-6 harvests per year to intensive, high-production circulating-water farm methods that use 5% of water used in conventional agribusiness. Energy prices are also trending upward and this, too, affects cost and availability of foods. Without question, this project is tied to Los Angeles' economic viability as an agriculture industry state. With farm production shrinking in the Central Valley each year, Los Angeles could step into position as a high-volume producer of fresh foods and vegetables, improving the likelihood that agriculture will continue to be a strong element of the local and state economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The food desert issues and homeless problems in in Los Angeles are also at a critical juncture. There is no doubt that a vibrant urban agriculture economy will make a huge difference to Los Angeles' ability to maintain law and order, should production in distant rural settings undergo continued shrinkage as a result of changing climate, drought, rising energy prices and the need to scale back carbon emissions that trucking foods from farms to urban centers causes.</p> "

  description3: "<p>At present, there is very little competition... we are collaborating more than competing with others in this space. My fellow Aquaponicists and Aeroponicists are focused on the goal of developing urban farming that reduces the food miles to near zero for transport and enables provisioning of the healthiest and freshest foods to focus groups and neighborhoods where we will measure satisfaction and results. We are also nearing completion of the process that will define us at USDA as more pure than foods grown organically in soil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With respect to making inroads with city officials, getting support for urban farming in Los Angeles, our local movement (myself and my partners) leads the field. It makes us strong in comparison with others that our strategy is actively creating the entitlements needed to start a new farming economy where it has never before existed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My architectural background and career as a licensed builder for 30 years has given me an advantage in negotiating those entitlements (when the code limits us). Having had the opportunity on many prior occasions to interact with City Councilmembers has put me in a leadership position compared to most urban farmers who come from academia (biologists, botanists, etc.) Traditional farmers who have come into the field often hate city hall. Not me. It's difficult to overstate the importance of having rapport with government officials, planners and zoning administrators to get cooperation and to understand the advantage they seek by cooperating and enabling us.</p>"
  vision: >-
    The harsh neighborhoods of L.A.'s inner city contain thousands of families
    held hostage to crime and gang warfare, even as their health is degrading as
    a result of fast-food addictions, rampant unemployment that keeps them poor,
    absence of fresh foods. The capitalist tool of choice, here, is the sale of
    illicit drugs. Combined with a prison industry that profits from
    incarceration, the absence of male supervision and father-figures in general
    is now the norm. Truly, the only possible way out of this mess is by means
    of an economy that TRICKLES UP, one grown with simple seeds that also leads
    to health. Food is the only entry level economy that works, central to
    everything worth living for, including family unity, culture and tradition,
    the celebration of life. No rational solution will emerge from entitlement
    programs that throw money or coupons at the problem without involving life
    transforming processes that cure people in ways they need curing. Where the
    bottom falls out of our society, the support for people falling through that
    hole must involve nutrition, jobs, and genuine food justice. Success in the
    year 2050 is an inner city environment remediated of toxic substances in
    homes (partnership we will enable through involvement of fellow builders
    volunteering to help us move that piece forward); hardscape neighborhoods
    softened by tree plantings giving shade, making neighborhoods strollable,
    lessening heat in summer, that lead walkers to park settings where farms dot
    the former hardscape. Success is more (if not all) children well-nourished,
    even if poor, children who appreciate where food comes from (not the
    supermarket), regularly partaking in the unifying grace that breaking bread
    with family and friends bestows on us when we sit together at a common
    table, who give thanks and enjoy the happiness of common gratitude. Success
    is the end of our oppressive "war on drugs" that punishes people for wanting
    to medicate themselves out of their misery, that locks them up, splintering
    families, delivering profits to faceless corporations that build and own
    human warehouses. Success is recognition for the civilizing effect that
    agriculture once bestowed on early human society, matched in the present and
    giving people tools of survival that they, themselves, activate at will.
    Success is money earned locally that circulates in the neighborhood to
    improve the quality of life, that grows as a community asset like the food
    growing where they live. Success is a city proud of the people in the hood,
    in the barrio, who are productive. Success is children learning, unburdened
    by hunger and lack of sleep. Success is fathers reuniting with their
    families, looking forward with hope. Success is the eradication of
    adult-type diabetes in children, the eradication of child heart disease
    brought on by obesity. Success is love between neighbors, who take pride
    from mutual self-sufficiency and a means of survival that they share.

  Does your project impact Los Angeles County?: 'yes'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  <p>My idea, “Heal This City” (HTC) will demonstrate how PURE, FRESH food,
  grown locally, is the medicine needed to heal our city's economy from the
  bottom up &, also, to heal its citizens from the inside out. As you'll read
  below, besides Health, HTC will also impact Education & the Environment.</p>



  <p>LA2050's award will start 4 highproduction, circulatingwater farms, a
  virtual economyinaneighborhood, in Council District 1, 8, or 9 (TBD). These
  will be designed compliant with municipal zoning code that would, otherwise,
  outlaw traditional, petrochemical & poisondependent, soilbased farming.</p>



  <p>In the selected neighborhood, HTC's farms will be located 10 to 15 minutes
  walking distance from every home in the service area. Typically, the heat of
  asphalt/concrete during summer keeps people indoors. HTC farms will cool the
  service area with greenery & give an incentive for neighborhood residents to
  stroll. Tranquil waterfall farms will be structured in climate controlled
  greenhouses, surrounded by green, parklike settings, producing plant nutrient
  with onsite fish aquariums. Farms will generate 6 to 10 times more produce per
  square foot, in (small & large) vacant lots, compared with traditional,
  industrial farms that work vast acres of land in distant, rural settings.



  HTC farms will use 5% of water needed by soilbased farming, helping to
  conserve water in a critical period of drought. They release no pollution into
  the environment.</p>



  <p>Local jobs will emerge, paying substantially more than minimum wage. These
  will be supported by ongoing sales of produce. Culinary programming will be
  coordinated, with friends & family dinners to be served. Priced at cost,
  they'll introduce neighbors to healthful & delicious nutrition designed (&
  proven) to increase healthful living, & even save lives (search “May I Be
  Frank,” the movie, on Google search).</p>



  <p>Grown in the place where people reside, HTC's fresh foods will be rich in
  living enzymes from the moment they are picked. They will be sold to consumers
  the same day. Grown without pesticides or herbicides, this food is more pure &
  better tasting than organic foods. It is not filled with preservatives &
  chemicals, as is the food that arrives by truck from hundreds of miles or (by
  airbus) from thousands of miles away. HTC will improve diets, enable better
  health for local families.



  In HTC’s target districts, longstanding poverty exploded in the aftermath of
  the great recession of 200809. Here, communities are tortured by the
  likelihood of potentially lifelong malnutrition. This problem is an outgrowth
  of urban blight that emerged during the troubled civil rights, 195060 era.
  Local children from that time are the diseaseprone adults of today, crowding
  emergency rooms & clinics with chronic heart & other organ ailments, diabetes,
  obesity, & mental illness.</p>



  <p>In fact, these souls were crippled before the time when we discovered that
  a child undernourished in her first three years will not be able to
  effectively learn throughout a lifetime of standard education. So, in addition
  to chronic health problems, devoid of healthy learning tools, a whole
  generation of people have been effectively prevented from prospering. HTC will
  open doors to a new future, buttressed in its resolve by the dozens of studies
  that prove the value & healthful effects exposure to nature has on people
  living in hardscape urban settings. With exposure to nature in the context of
  food cultivation, the available rewards increase in terms of confidence,
  selfesteem & leadership; discipline & a sense of selfsufficiency also result. 



  As HTC’s economic model is proven viable, banks will step up to invest in its
  urbanfarming economy. Already, Chase Bank, Playa Vista, has expressed
  interest, knowing growth will occur where there was practically nothing in
  which to invest.</p>



  <p>Beyond nutrition, as important as that is, the fundamental change that HTC
  will realize is transforming a generation of young people by exposing them to
  nature & the ancient discipline of food cultivation. 



  In grammar, middle, & highschools, HTC's mission is to propagate farms
  throughout Los Angeles. By using school lands to establish gardenenhanced
  curriculum, students are empowered to learn better & to innovate in
  development of new, urban farming tools. implements are being designed &
  fabricated, shedding light on yet another economic engine of the new urban
  agriculture. 



  Combining these assets with existing curriculum, students will learn the
  economics of “farming the American city”, establishing themselves as a growing
  army of urban farmers that can expand farms statewide, nationally and
  internationally.</p>



  <p>Following graduation from highschool, students will help to propagate farms
  for retirement homes and impoverished neighborhoods. There are also hospital
  targets, such as Kaiser Permanente, that is seeking to enable the same goals
  HTC is focused on in underserved communities.</p>

Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  <p>Our projects, at both WESM High School in Westchester & Milliken Middle
  School in Burbank, are curricular models with builtin measures that will be
  evaluated by faculty & administration. Success is measured by improved overall
  educational performance. Academic achievement is what they want to assure.</p>



  <p>Our measure of results is how much enrichment & positive behavior
  modification we accomplish by involving students in food growing discipline.
  How much health is it possible for students to gain? We rely on interviews &
  scoring by students to measure our overall success in conjunction with
  teacher/administrator reviews.</p>



  <p>In the projects we propose for farming in LA, we are selecting a
  neighborhood food desert, wherein all resident families will be interviewed
  before our first year's residency to determine the dietary deficiencies
  against current staples, given the absence of fresh foods in the community.
  During the first year's residency, we will revisit the least wellnourished 1/3
  of families to sample progress & better understand how to make their
  experience at our farmers markets more beneficial. Giving families with
  children precedent, we will visit schools where our focus children attend to
  present & give those children pride, at the same time, raising interest in
  fresh foods among their peers & establishing the basis for outreach in those
  schools so we can eventually bring a school Aquaponics garden that grows food
  using fish nutrient as an entrylevel project. We anticipate maximum 3 schools
  (elementary, middle school, & high school) somewhere near the focus
  neighborhood. Further into the project, as the culinary program takes shape,
  we will gage the response to fresh foods recipes from at least two restaurant
  chef visits, & we'll invite families to contribute ethnographic recipes drawn
  from their family history.</p>



  <p>Our bottom line, however, is the measure of farm success. We plan to sell
  our produce as it is grown... giving overgrowth to the homeless project with
  which we presently collaborate at Ocean Park Community Center or via friends
  of families in our own focus neighborhood. To the extent that we can increase
  consumption of fresh foods, locally, particularly by children, measuring that
  consumption by survey, we will be able to calibrate by extension what kind of
  effect we will have in the expansion phase following the first year.</p>



  <p>An interesting model is developing at WESM that I will duplicate & modify
  for our neighborhood farm network. In the Health & Sports Medicine Magnet, the
  embedded culinary program has students calibrating themselves, measuring
  weight, height, body fat, blood levels, etc. Their diet, then modified, will
  include measured quantities of fresh foods grown in the Aqua/Aeroponic
  greenhouse  on campus. Each week, the physical exam will be given to each
  student anew, measuring various blood levels, weight, & body fat. I will get
  neighborhood participants to follow that regime as well</p>

  volunteering to help us move that piece forward); hardscape neighborhoods
  softened by tree plantings giving shade, making neighborhoods strollable,
  lessening heat in summer, that lead walkers to park settings where farms dot
  the former hardscape. Success is more (if not all) children wellnourished,
  even if poor, children who appreciate where food comes from (not the
  supermarket), regularly partaking in the unifying grace that breaking bread
  with family and friends bestows on us when we sit together at a common table,
  who give thanks and enjoy the happiness of common gratitude. Success is the
  end of our oppressive "war on drugs" that punishes people for wanting to
  medicate themselves out of their misery, that locks them up, splintering
  families, delivering profits to faceless corporations that build and own human
  warehouses. Success is recognition for the civilizing effect that agriculture
  once bestowed on early human society, matched in the present and giving people
  tools of survival that they, themselves, activate at will. Success is money
  earned locally that circulates in the neighborhood to improve the quality of
  life, that grows as a community asset like the food growing where they live.
  Success is a city proud of the people in the hood, in the barrio, who are
  productive. Success is children learning, unburdened by hunger and lack of
  sleep. Success is fathers reuniting with their families, looking forward with
  hope. Success is the eradication of adulttype diabetes in children, the
  eradication of child heart disease brought on by obesity. Success is love
  between neighbors, who take pride from mutual selfsufficiency and a means of
  survival that they share.
