  success: >-
    Seeing 25 functioning aquaponic systems installed on 25 campuses is a great
    milestone for any school district.  Counting the numbers of teachers who
    have integrated aquaponics into their existing course work will be a bonus. 
    Listening to the student “aquaponics ambassadors” give educational tours to
    their peers and community members will be a leap in education.  Looking
    beyond 2013, the project will have maximized success when the school
    district begins to open up more land on campuses not just for
    educational-scaled systems, but also for aquaponic farms to be installed,
    sized accordingly, to feed the campus and the neighboring community…
    offering a clear path towards a hyper-local food system. 
  Indicator: ' Education'
  brief: >-
    Food IS the common thread that can help solve the world’s major problems
    simultaneously. Urban farming points us in the right direction and
    aquaponics is the vehicle to get us there. Aquaponics is the most
    sustainable (economically and environmentally) way to grow food on the
    planet – most water efficient, highest yields, zero waste,
    better-than-organic, with incredible taste. It is a closed-loop system that
    combines aquaculture (fish farming) and hydroponics (growing food in water).
    We developed a highly efficient model that grows more food per square foot
    than just about anything, using vertical grow- towers. The rendering posted
    above can produce up to 1000 plants per year in just 20 square feet in
    optimal conditions. Aquaponics grows leafy greens, herbs and fruiting crops
    along with edible or ornamental fish. After several years of operating
    different types of aquaponic systems we have found this approach to be the
    easiest and most efficient way to learn, teach and jump right into the
    excitement of growing your own food.  OUR PLAN: We are prepared to install
    25 of our unique aquaponic systems in 25 schools in 2013. Each school will
    receive training based on our existing course and manual (Art & Science of
    Aquaponics) coupled with maintenance and support. We will also encourage
    installation of the vertical grow-tower system to become a class project.
    Additionally, we have also budgeted to pay a stipend to 4 teachers to help
    us convert our course into a curriculum that meets CA State Standards.
    Integrated Environmental Education (including urban farming) has been proven
    by our partner Environmental Charter High School to lead to the highest
    graduation rates (and acceptance to 4-year colleges) in the US. Aquaponics
    is the future of farming on planet Earth. By combining the two, aquaponics +
    education, what better way to cultivate a resilient community?

  description: "OPEN SPACE IS FARM SPACE:\r\nEnough unused land exists in LA to feed LA. If we considered just the 5000 acres of asphalt that LAUSD owns and converted 4% (200 acres) of that to aquaponic farms, we could put a salad on EVERY Angelino’s plate EVERY day of the year. The revenue the School District could earn would radically change the face of public education. Imagine teachers paid a fair wage, students learning useful vocational training, schools nourishing the minds and bodies of our youth, and communities benefiting from neighborhood farms and schools – the way LA used to be. Evo Farm offers a profound stepping-stone to get us there. \r\n\r\nREDUCTION OF CHRONIC DISEASES: Almost all of the diseases we face are not only preventable but also reversible. They can be turned on and off based on what we eat and what we don’t. In the US, we spend as much on these diseases as we spend on defense ($700 Billion annually). A path towards reducing these costs opens the door to happier, healthier world. Children who are involved in growing vegetables will eat vegetables and are more likely to raise their children to do the same. Evo Farm will teach them to turn our food deserts into food oases. \r\n\r\nWATER EFFICIENCIES:  Some people still question the validity of climate change, but the reduction of available freshwater on the planet is undisputed. Last year was probably the worst year for agriculture on record due to drought (and extreme temperature). Aquaponics offers extreme water efficiencies (95% more efficient than conventional ag) and opens the door to a reliable food source.  Many of these farms can operate largely on existing rainfall (only possible with aquaponics) that LA receives annually coupled with the steady stream of the LA River. Evo Farm is creating fully functioning, scalable micro- farms demonstrating the greater potential. \r\n\r\nURBAN FARMING IS JOBS: Training the future farmers of America is essential. Captivating them with exciting green-tech (triple bottom line), income potential ensures we have an able and willing labor force to do this essential work. It is not just about plants and animals, it is about marketing, IT, business development, finance, accounting, supply chain management, customer relationship management, local manufacturing, engineering, innovation, and entrepreneurship. Urban farming drives a local and resilient economy. A return to our agrarian roots is the single greatest step we can accomplish to allow for the health of individuals, health of communities and health of the planet. \r\n"

    We do not feel that we have competition at this point. Not only are we the
    only organization in LA formally teaching and preaching the gospel of
    aquaponics and have the most systems built or slated to be built in the
    region, we are also a very open-sourced platform. We teach aquaponics for
    several reasons but mainly because we invite competition into the market
    place…however that is defined. We have given tours for free to 1000’s of
    people allowing them to ask questions and take pictures. At least 50% of the
    attendees in our Art & Science of Aquaponics class attend for reduced or no
    cost… especially teachers, students and NGOs. We have an apprenticeship
    program that offers a 100% refund to those who take the class and commit
    some hours to applied experience at our farm pilot. We are not patenting our
    designs or protecting our intellectual property. Anything but! We
    disseminate our work as broadly as possible. Today, aquaponics is a
    fledgling industry. But it is poised to make a remarkable impact
    economically, environmentally and socially on the City and beyond. Last year
    was the year that more fish consumed on Earth came from the land than from
    the sea. Last year was the year that food prices tripled and even quadrupled
    in CA due to erratic weather. Last year was the year that climate controlled
    agriculture production (greenhouses) was deemed to be essential for a stable
    food supply. THIS is the year where the tides will shift and urban
    aquaponics will prove itself to be one of the last great opportunities we
    have to save ourselves from ourselves.  
  vision: >-
    Ironically, success means to us that we have trained enough people and built
    enough farms that we have essentially worked ourselves out of job. By then,
    LA will be operating enough farms in the city to provide the fruits and
    vegetables we eat. The ability to grow food will be a requirement to
    graduate high school. Cafeterias will harvest and prepare fresh food daily.
    Diseases like obesity and heart disease will be nearly eradicated.  Fast
    food chains will have been replaced by salad and juice bars. Restaurants and
    institutional kitchens will source the majority of their food from town.
    Selling fruits on corner stands will no longer be stigmatized and illegal,
    but integrated into the policy of the city.  Food justice and environmental
    justice issues will be taught in our history classes.  And everyday will be
    an opportunity to celebrate easy access to the healthiest best tasting foods
    possible.  All of this is not only possible, but also inevitable.
