title: 25 Aquaponic Farms in 25 Schools
indicator: ' Education'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  Food IS the common thread that can help solve the world’s major problems
  simultaneously. Urban farming points us in the right direction and aquaponics
  is the vehicle to get us there. Aquaponics is the most sustainable
  (economically and environmentally) way to grow food on the planet — most water
  efficient, highest yields, zero waste, betterthanorganic, with incredible
  taste. It is a closedloop system that combines aquaculture (fish farming) and
  hydroponics (growing food in water). We developed a highly efficient model
  that grows more food per square foot than just about anything, using vertical
  grow towers. The rendering posted above can produce up to 1000 plants per year
  in just 20 square feet in optimal conditions. Aquaponics grows leafy greens,
  herbs and fruiting crops along with edible or ornamental fish. After several
  years of operating different types of aquaponic systems we have found this
  approach to be the easiest and most efficient way to learn, teach and jump
  right into the excitement of growing your own food.  






  OUR PLAN: We are prepared to install 25 of our unique aquaponic systems in 25
  schools in 2013. Each school will receive training based on our existing
  course and manual (Art & Science of Aquaponics) coupled with maintenance and
  support. We will also encourage installation of the vertical growtower system
  to become a class project. Additionally, we have also budgeted to pay a
  stipend to 4 teachers to help us convert our course into a curriculum that
  meets CA State Standards. Integrated Environmental Education (including urban
  farming) has been proven by our partner Environmental Charter High School to
  lead to the highest graduation rates (and acceptance to 4year colleges) in the
  US. Aquaponics is the future of farming on planet Earth. By combining the two,
  aquaponics + education, what better way to cultivate a resilient community?

Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  Seeing 25 functioning aquaponic systems installed on 25 campuses is a great
  milestone for any school district.  Counting the numbers of teachers who have
  integrated aquaponics into their existing course work will be a bonus. 
  Listening to the student “aquaponics ambassadors” give educational tours to
  their peers and community members will be a leap in education.  Looking beyond
  2013, the project will have maximized success when the school district begins
  to open up more land on campuses not just for educationalscaled systems, but
  also for aquaponic farms to be installed, sized accordingly, to feed the
  campus and the neighboring community… offering a clear path towards a
  hyperlocal food system. 
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
  OPEN SPACE IS FARM SPACE:



  Enough unused land exists in LA to feed LA. If we considered just the 5000
  acres of asphalt that LAUSD owns and converted 4% (200 acres) of that to
  aquaponic farms, we could put a salad on EVERY Angelino’s plate EVERY day of
  the year. The revenue the School District could earn would radically change
  the face of public education. Imagine teachers paid a fair wage, students
  learning useful vocational training, schools nourishing the minds and bodies
  of our youth, and communities benefiting from neighborhood farms and schools —
  the way LA used to be. Evo Farm offers a profound steppingstone to get us
  there. 






  REDUCTION OF CHRONIC DISEASES: Almost all of the diseases we face are not only
  preventable but also reversible. They can be turned on and off based on what
  we eat and what we don’t. In the US, we spend as much on these diseases as we
  spend on defense ($700 Billion annually). A path towards reducing these costs
  opens the door to happier, healthier world. Children who are involved in
  growing vegetables will eat vegetables and are more likely to raise their
  children to do the same. Evo Farm will teach them to turn our food deserts
  into food oases. 






  WATER EFFICIENCIES:  Some people still question the validity of climate
  change, but the reduction of available freshwater on the planet is undisputed.
  Last year was probably the worst year for agriculture on record due to drought
  (and extreme temperature). Aquaponics offers extreme water efficiencies (95%
  more efficient than conventional ag) and opens the door to a reliable food
  source.  Many of these farms can operate largely on existing rainfall (only
  possible with aquaponics) that LA receives annually coupled with the steady
  stream of the LA River. Evo Farm is creating fully functioning, scalable micro
  farms demonstrating the greater potential. 






  URBAN FARMING IS JOBS: Training the future farmers of America is essential.
  Captivating them with exciting greentech (triple bottom line), income
  potential ensures we have an able and willing labor force to do this essential
  work. It is not just about plants and animals, it is about marketing, IT,
  business development, finance, accounting, supply chain management, customer
  relationship management, local manufacturing, engineering, innovation, and
  entrepreneurship. Urban farming drives a local and resilient economy. A return
  to our agrarian roots is the single greatest step we can accomplish to allow
  for the health of individuals, health of communities and health of the
  planet. 


What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  Ironically, success means to us that we have trained enough people and built
  enough farms that we have essentially worked ourselves out of job. By then, LA
  will be operating enough farms in the city to provide the fruits and
  vegetables we eat. The ability to grow food will be a requirement to graduate
  high school. Cafeterias will harvest and prepare fresh food daily. Diseases
  like obesity and heart disease will be nearly eradicated.  Fast food chains
  will have been replaced by salad and juice bars. Restaurants and institutional
  kitchens will source the majority of their food from town. Selling fruits on
  corner stands will no longer be stigmatized and illegal, but integrated into
  the policy of the city.  Food justice and environmental justice issues will be
  taught in our history classes.  And everyday will be an opportunity to
  celebrate easy access to the healthiest best tasting foods possible.  All of
  this is not only possible, but also inevitable.
