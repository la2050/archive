title: 'The A LOT Initiative: Using Art to Activate Vacant City Lots'
project_summary: "Our A LOT Initiative will foster a stronger community identity, a sense of place, and revitalize economic development by way of supporting creative activity. Free events will promote the concept of creative placemaking, encouraging our community to animate public and private spaces, rejuvenate streetscapes, improve local business viability and public safety, while bringing together diverse people to celebrate, to inspire, and to be inspired. The A Lot Initiative will begin in Fall 2013.\r\n\r\n\r\nA LOT's primary goal is to broaden audience and artist engagement, as well as, expand geographic scope, with underserved communities especially benefiting. Rather than placing cultural activities in enclosed venues for a limited number of people for a couple of hours, the objective is to enliven vacant lots, streets, and entire areas with creative energy -- sound, light, visual art, and performance -- for days or even weeks at a time. In addition to engaging residents in the arts, A LOT is intended to increase pedestrian traffic and enliven streets with vacant storefronts, thus creating prospects for both \"pop-up\" and more permanent businesses to revitalize these neighborhoods. The projects' mobility is intended to offer this transformative opportunity to multiple neighborhoods creating lasting impact throughout the city."

    The primary intended outcome of the project is that the Long Beach and Los
    Angeles County will be strengthened through the arts. A secondary outcome is
    public engagement with diverse and excellent art. Quantitative performance
    measurements of both outcomes will include the numbers of performances,
    artists, audiences, locations, and neighborhoods that participate. In
    addition to the quantitative performance measurements, the Arts Council for
    Long Beach will work with its primary partner, Long Beach Development
    Services, to evaluate the qualitative impact of the project on the
    communities involved. The partners will assess the level of increased social
    and economic vitality in areas where performances take place, such as
    reduction of blight; businesses opened in vacant storefronts; new gathering
    spaces; positive reporting in the media; and increase in membership in
    neighborhood and block associations. The partners will also work with the
    community to gather to anecdotal evidence of change, such as increase in
    neighborhood pride; and greater interaction of cultures and ethnic groups.
    This information will be gathered through surveys and interviews with key
    staff of the partners and leaders of the community.

    Arts Council for Long Beach and its partners have embarked on a unique,
    initiative that blends arts participation with community redevelopment. The
    A LOT Initiative  will improve the vitality of traditionally underserved
    neighborhood and enliven the areas through arts participation. A LOT
    encourages the presence and participation in cultural opportunities by
    bringing art into communities. It furthers support of cultural participation
    by creating art opportunities in areas where previously there was limited to
    no access to the arts. A LOT allows new audiences to experience art in their
    neighborhood. While the current structure and focus of the initiative  is on
    underserved neighborhoods and residents in the Long Beach area, the
    project's concepts can be applied throughout the region.  
  collaborators: >-
    A LOT aims to serve low-income residents by linking arts and culture
    participation with the mission of redevelopment, helping to revitalize
    economically-challenged neighborhoods with world-class performances that
    will increase social and economic activity. Because of these shared goals,
    the project is being planned and implemented as a partnership between ACLB
    and Long Beach Development Services, a local government agency. Other
    partners in this effort include local neighborhood associations and groups,
    as well as business improvement districts throughout the city.

    The Arts Council for Long Beach does not see itself as having any
    competition. We are committed and dedicated to creating strategic,
    functional partnerships throughout our community.  
  vision: >-
    In 2050, A LOT’s success will be seen throughout Los Angeles as vacant lots
    become cultural hubs bringing communities together. These spaces will
    transform the cultural landscape of communities building arts participation
    and engaging audiences. All LA residents will have access to high-quality
    performances and arts experiences in their own neighborhoods, but also
    people from throughout the region can visit other neighborhoods and
    communities to experience art there, thus breaking down some of the
    geographic barriers that currently segregate LA economically and culturally.
    Arts will also be a primary consideration in civic planning, development,
    and transportation.
