title: 'The A LOT Initiative: Using Art to Activate Vacant City Lots'
indicator: Arts & Cultural Vitality
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  Our A LOT Initiative will foster a stronger community identity, a sense of
  place, and revitalize economic development by way of supporting creative
  activity. Free events will promote the concept of creative placemaking,
  encouraging our community to animate public and private spaces, rejuvenate
  streetscapes, improve local business viability and public safety, while
  bringing together diverse people to celebrate, to inspire, and to be inspired.
  The A Lot Initiative will begin in Fall 2013.









  A LOT's primary goal is to broaden audience and artist engagement, as well as,
  expand geographic scope, with underserved communities especially benefiting.
  Rather than placing cultural activities in enclosed venues for a limited
  number of people for a couple of hours, the objective is to enliven vacant
  lots, streets, and entire areas with creative energy  sound, light, visual
  art, and performance  for days or even weeks at a time. In addition to
  engaging residents in the arts, A LOT is intended to increase pedestrian
  traffic and enliven streets with vacant storefronts, thus creating prospects
  for both "popup" and more permanent businesses to revitalize these
  neighborhoods. The projects' mobility is intended to offer this transformative
  opportunity to multiple neighborhoods creating lasting impact throughout the
  city.
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >+
  Recipient of the National Endowment for the Arts Our Town Grant for $150,000.
  The Arts Council was one of 80 organizations selected from a pool of 317
  applicants.  And, 1 of 6 organizations to receive the highest amount.  The
  Arts Council serves over 2500 students each year in the Arts Learning program.
  Every October, Long Beach Arts Month promotes over 500 events for National
  Arts and Humanities Month in Long Beach. This calendar reaches over 100,000
  people all over Los Angeles. On average each year, the Arts Council
  distributes over 40 grants to artists and community based nonprofit arts
  organizations. 


Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  A LOT aims to serve lowincome residents by linking arts and culture
  participation with the mission of redevelopment, helping to revitalize
  economicallychallenged neighborhoods with worldclass performances that will
  increase social and economic activity. Because of these shared goals, the
  project is being planned and implemented as a partnership between ACLB and
  Long Beach Development Services, a local government agency. Other partners in
  this effort include local neighborhood associations and groups, as well as
  business improvement districts throughout the city.
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  The primary intended outcome of the project is that the Long Beach and Los
  Angeles County will be strengthened through the arts. A secondary outcome is
  public engagement with diverse and excellent art. Quantitative performance
  measurements of both outcomes will include the numbers of performances,
  artists, audiences, locations, and neighborhoods that participate. In addition
  to the quantitative performance measurements, the Arts Council for Long Beach
  will work with its primary partner, Long Beach Development Services, to
  evaluate the qualitative impact of the project on the communities involved.
  The partners will assess the level of increased social and economic vitality
  in areas where performances take place, such as reduction of blight;
  businesses opened in vacant storefronts; new gathering spaces; positive
  reporting in the media; and increase in membership in neighborhood and block
  associations. The partners will also work with the community to gather to
  anecdotal evidence of change, such as increase in neighborhood pride; and
  greater interaction of cultures and ethnic groups. This information will be
  gathered through surveys and interviews with key staff of the partners and
  leaders of the community. 
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  Arts Council for Long Beach and its partners have embarked on a unique,
  initiative that blends arts participation with community redevelopment. The A
  LOT Initiative  will improve the vitality of traditionally underserved
  neighborhood and enliven the areas through arts participation. A LOT
  encourages the presence and participation in cultural opportunities by
  bringing art into communities. It furthers support of cultural participation
  by creating art opportunities in areas where previously there was limited to
  no access to the arts. A LOT allows new audiences to experience art in their
  neighborhood. While the current structure and focus of the initiative  is on
  underserved neighborhoods and residents in the Long Beach area, the project's
  concepts can be applied throughout the region.  
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  In 2050, A LOT’s success will be seen throughout Los Angeles as vacant lots
  become cultural hubs bringing communities together. These spaces will
  transform the cultural landscape of communities building arts participation
  and engaging audiences. All LA residents will have access to highquality
  performances and arts experiences in their own neighborhoods, but also people
  from throughout the region can visit other neighborhoods and communities to
  experience art there, thus breaking down some of the geographic barriers that
  currently segregate LA economically and culturally. Arts will also be a
  primary consideration in civic planning, development, and transportation.
