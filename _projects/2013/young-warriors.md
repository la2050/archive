title: Young Warriors
project_summary: "A significant majority of boys in absent father homes are hurting so deeply that they become unproductive and destructive members of society. Young Warriors believes that all boys need affirmation, guidance, training, and support from positive male role-models.  The physical, emotional, and social needs of boys and their mothers in absent-father homes is the central focus of the programs provided by Young Warriors.\r\nYoung Warriors is life education, things one should learn from a father.  YW participants learn life skills such as changing a tire, how to treat women respectfully, trusting others, dealing with finances, pursuing a college education,  work-readiness skills, anger management, conflict resolution, team-building skills, nutrition and health management, and much, much more--- all while having FUN!  YW is somewhere to turn for advice and answers that many children from fatherless homes do not have."

  success: "1. YW uses standard psychological tests to measure self-esteem, self-efficacy, and negative risk-taking behavior.\r\n2.

Before, during, termination, and post-termination program assessments and evaluations will be conducted.  \r\n4. Teacher, school officials, and other professional recommendations and input are considered.  \r\n5. Recommendations, assessments, and evaluations will be reviewed by the program director, family therapist,  and YW Advisory Board as necessary.  \r\n6.

  description: "Based on statistics from the California Family Council, children from fatherless homes are more likely to: commit suicide, be poor, drop out of school, have maladaptive behavior, be abused, abuse drugs and alcohol, run away, join gangs, wind up in state institutions or on state welfare, or be killed.  Young Warrior changes these boys future for the betterment of themselves and society.\r\n1. The first objective of YW is to increase self-esteem and self-efficacy in boys whose identity is lost and who are at risk of becoming another troubling statistic.  YW mentors inspire boys discover their own strengths, take on new challenges, and face their failures as well as their victories.  In these critical life lessons, YW mentors develop trust with participants so that the participants are able to hear good advice, and therefore, become good decision makers.\r\n\r\n2. The second objective of YW is to encourage and develop positive interpersonal communication amongst participants, mentors, peers, parents, guardians, teachers, and authorities.  YW mentors  promote diversity and respect for others by modeling self-discipline, integrity, honesty, compassion, forgiveness, ethical and moral behavior.  YW starts cultivating these skills in the home by collaborating with a local Marriage and Family Therapist (MFT) in creating a parent education program.  This curriculum assists parents become more effective in the lives of their boys.\r\n\r\n3. Finally, YW third objective is to prevent negative, risk-taking behavior, including gang prevention.  YW reduces the need to find security in gangs, substance abuse, or the like by instilling worth and confidence in participant's abilities.  YW participants learn anger management, conflict resolution, and how to engage themselves in  healthy, positive affiliations with others."

  description1: "YW started with a relationship between Jason Hill and one 10-year-old boy named Wonder.  Along with other mentors, Jason was able to give Wonder the mentoring relationship that Jason had received from caring mentors who changed Jason's life.  Wonder is now on a  healthy path and thriving.  In fact, Wonder received an award for Male Athlete of the Year at his school. \r\n\tWonder is responsible for the birth of Young Warriors.  During Wonder's success, Jason decided to give other boys broader horizons.  YW started with a small group of boys, their single moms, and a circle of friends.  The program was extremely successful, and quickly grew to over 20 boys, with moms calling from as far as two hours away, asking to come Young Warrior events.  YW participants are committed; they enjoy being in the program and attendance rates are over 96%.   Adults in these children's lives have noticed almost an immediate change in the boy's attitudes and behaviors.  In addition, grades are showing improvement.\r\n\tYW has expanded its program throughout the community.  YW  community members (such as Galpin Ford, Nestle, Wells Fargo, the city of  Van Nuys, and many private investors) are excited to participate in the program.  YW now has two programs:  (1) the original YW group, and (2) two elementary schools consisting of 24 fatherless 5th grade boys.  Other principals heard of YW and are expressing a strong interest in hosting the YW program at their schools.  In addition, Jason has peaked the interest of various gang-prevention units.  The waiting list for YW is growing with 100’s of kids waiting for the program to become available to them!"
  vision: >-
    Success would look like having an after school program in every LAUSD school
    or independent school systems.  Success will be Young Warriors of the next
    generation being mentored by alumni.  Success will be Young Warriors being
    the capable and upstanding leaders and fathers of tomorrow.  Success would
    be social connectedness of family.  Most importantly to these boys, true
    success would be the presence of a father of character back in the lives of
    the family.  Dads, we need you!
