title: Young Warriors
indicator: ' Education'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  A significant majority of boys in absent father homes are hurting so deeply
  that they become unproductive and destructive members of society. Young
  Warriors believes that all boys need affirmation, guidance, training, and
  support from positive male rolemodels.  The physical, emotional, and social
  needs of boys and their mothers in absentfather homes is the central focus of
  the programs provided by Young Warriors.



  Young Warriors is life education, things one should learn from a father.  YW
  participants learn life skills such as changing a tire, how to treat women
  respectfully, trusting others, dealing with finances, pursuing a college
  education,  workreadiness skills, anger management, conflict resolution,
  teambuilding skills, nutrition and health management, and much, much more all
  while having FUN!  YW is somewhere to turn for advice and answers that many
  children from fatherless homes do not have.
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: "YW started with a relationship between Jason Hill and one 10yearold boy named Wonder.  Along with other mentors, Jason was able to give Wonder the mentoring relationship that Jason had received from caring mentors who changed Jason's life.  Wonder is now on a  healthy path and thriving.  In fact, Wonder received an award for Male Athlete of the Year at his school. \n\n\n\tWonder is responsible for the birth of Young Warriors.  During Wonder's success, Jason decided to give other boys broader horizons.  YW started with a small group of boys, their single moms, and a circle of friends.  The program was extremely successful, and quickly grew to over 20 boys, with moms calling from as far as two hours away, asking to come Young Warrior events.  YW participants are committed; they enjoy being in the program and attendance rates are over 96%.   Adults in these children's lives have noticed almost an immediate change in the boy's attitudes and behaviors.  In addition, grades are showing improvement.\n\n\n\tYW has expanded its program throughout the community.  YW  community members (such as Galpin Ford, Nestle, Wells Fargo, the city of  Van Nuys, and many private investors) are excited to participate in the program.  YW now has two programs:  (1) the original YW group, and (2) two elementary schools consisting of 24 fatherless 5th grade boys.  Other principals heard of YW and are expressing a strong interest in hosting the YW program at their schools.  In addition, Jason has peaked the interest of various gangprevention units.  The waiting list for YW is growing with 100’s of kids waiting for the program to become available to them!"
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  Galpin Ford, LAUSD, Frederick S. Upton Foundation, Mentor Management Systems,
  Nestle, Mil Milagros, various Marriage & Family Therapists, Adrienne Newsome,
  nonprofit counsel and many community volunteers and businesses.
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  1. YW uses standard psychological tests to measure selfesteem, selfefficacy,
  and negative risktaking behavior.



  2. Qualitative and quantitative data will be collected from the participants,
  parents, mentors, YW staff, mentors, community volunteers, advisory, and board
  members via attendance records, grades, assessments, participation at all
  events and meetings, observations, and comments.  



  3. Before, during, termination, and posttermination program assessments and
  evaluations will be conducted.  



  4. Teacher, school officials, and other professional recommendations and input
  are considered.  



  5. Recommendations, assessments, and evaluations will be reviewed by the
  program director, family therapist,  and YW Advisory Board as necessary.  



  6. Livescan screening and “best practices” training methods insure that
  participants have well qualified mentors.
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  Based on statistics from the California Family Council, children from
  fatherless homes are more likely to: commit suicide, be poor, drop out of
  school, have maladaptive behavior, be abused, abuse drugs and alcohol, run
  away, join gangs, wind up in state institutions or on state welfare, or be
  killed.  Young Warrior changes these boys future for the betterment of
  themselves and society.



  1. The first objective of YW is to increase selfesteem and selfefficacy in
  boys whose identity is lost and who are at risk of becoming another troubling
  statistic.  YW mentors inspire boys discover their own strengths, take on new
  challenges, and face their failures as well as their victories.  In these
  critical life lessons, YW mentors develop trust with participants so that the
  participants are able to hear good advice, and therefore, become good decision
  makers.






  2. The second objective of YW is to encourage and develop positive
  interpersonal communication amongst participants, mentors, peers, parents,
  guardians, teachers, and authorities.  YW mentors  promote diversity and
  respect for others by modeling selfdiscipline, integrity, honesty, compassion,
  forgiveness, ethical and moral behavior.  YW starts cultivating these skills
  in the home by collaborating with a local Marriage and Family Therapist (MFT)
  in creating a parent education program.  This curriculum assists parents
  become more effective in the lives of their boys.






  3. Finally, YW third objective is to prevent negative, risktaking behavior,
  including gang prevention.  YW reduces the need to find security in gangs,
  substance abuse, or the like by instilling worth and confidence in
  participant's abilities.  YW participants learn anger management, conflict
  resolution, and how to engage themselves in  healthy, positive affiliations
  with others.
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  Success would look like having an after school program in every LAUSD school
  or independent school systems.  Success will be Young Warriors of the next
  generation being mentored by alumni.  Success will be Young Warriors being the
  capable and upstanding leaders and fathers of tomorrow.  Success would be
  social connectedness of family.  Most importantly to these boys, true success
  would be the presence of a father of character back in the lives of the
  family.  Dads, we need you!
