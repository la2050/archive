title: Young Warriors
project_summary: "YW started with a relationship between Jason Hill and one 10-year-old boy named Wonder.  Along with other mentors, Jason was able to give Wonder the mentoring relationship that Jason had received from caring mentors who changed Jason's life.  Wonder is now on a  healthy path and thriving.  In fact, Wonder received an award for Male Athlete of the Year at his school. \r\n\tWonder is responsible for the birth of Young Warriors.  During Wonder's success, Jason decided to give other boys broader horizons.  YW started with a small group of boys, their single moms, and a circle of friends.  The program was extremely successful, and quickly grew to over 20 boys, with moms calling from as far as two hours away, asking to come Young Warrior events.  YW participants are committed; they enjoy being in the program and attendance rates are over 96%.   Adults in these children's lives have noticed almost an immediate change in the boy's attitudes and behaviors.  In addition, grades are showing improvement.\r\n\tYW has expanded its program throughout the community.  YW  community members (such as Galpin Ford, Nestle, Wells Fargo, the city of  Van Nuys, and many private investors) are excited to participate in the program.  YW now has two programs:  (1) the original YW group, and (2) two elementary schools consisting of 24 fatherless 5th grade boys.  Other principals heard of YW and are expressing a strong interest in hosting the YW program at their schools.  In addition, Jason has peaked the interest of various gang-prevention units.  The waiting list for YW is growing with 100’s of kids waiting for the program to become available to them!"

  success: "1. YW uses standard psychological tests to measure self-esteem, self-efficacy, and negative risk-taking behavior.\r\n2. Qualitative and quantitative data will be collected from the participants, parents, mentors, YW staff, mentors, community volunteers, advisory, and board members via attendance records, grades, assessments, participation at all events and meetings, observations, and comments.  \r\n3. Before, during, termination, and post-termination program assessments and evaluations will be conducted.  \r\n4. Teacher, school officials, and other professional recommendations and input are considered.  \r\n5. Recommendations, assessments, and evaluations will be reviewed by the program director, family therapist,  and YW Advisory Board as necessary.  \r\n6. Live-scan screening and “best practices” training methods insure that participants have well qualified mentors."
  Indicator: ' Education'
  brief: "A significant majority of boys in absent father homes are hurting so deeply that they become unproductive and destructive members of society. Young Warriors believes that all boys need affirmation, guidance, training, and support from positive male role-models.  The physical, emotional, and social needs of boys and their mothers in absent-father homes is the central focus of the programs provided by Young Warriors.\r\nYoung Warriors is life education, things one should learn from a father.  YW participants learn life skills such as changing a tire, how to treat women respectfully, trusting others, dealing with finances, pursuing a college education,  work-readiness skills, anger management, conflict resolution, team-building skills, nutrition and health management, and much, much more--- all while having FUN!  YW is somewhere to turn for advice and answers that many children from fatherless homes do not have."

Young Warrior changes these boys future for the betterment of themselves and society.\r\n1. The first objective of YW is to increase self-esteem and self-efficacy in boys whose identity is lost and who are at risk of becoming another troubling statistic.  YW mentors inspire boys discover their own strengths, take on new challenges, and face their failures as well as their victories.  In these critical life lessons, YW mentors develop trust with participants so that the participants are able to hear good advice, and therefore, become good decision makers.\r\n\r\n2. The second objective of YW is to encourage and develop positive interpersonal communication amongst participants, mentors, peers, parents, guardians, teachers, and authorities.  YW mentors  promote diversity and respect for others by modeling self-discipline, integrity, honesty, compassion, forgiveness, ethical and moral behavior.  YW starts cultivating these skills in the home by collaborating with a local Marriage and Family Therapist (MFT) in creating a parent education program.  This curriculum assists parents become more effective in the lives of their boys.\r\n\r\n3. Finally, YW third objective is to prevent negative, risk-taking behavior, including gang prevention.  YW reduces the need to find security in gangs, substance abuse, or the like by instilling worth and confidence in participant's abilities.  YW participants learn anger management, conflict resolution, and how to engage themselves in  healthy, positive affiliations with others."

  description3: "There are many great organizations that exist in effort to help at-risk youth such as Big Brothers and Big Sisters, Boys & Girls Clubs, and various scouting organizations.  All of these programs make extraordinary contributions to our society.  However, there are some differences between these organizations and Young Warriors program.\r\n\tMost of the other programs are open to all at-risk youth with limited socio-economic resources. Young Warriors specifically zeros in on the absence of positive male, role model or father-figure.  Young warriors focuses on this crucial missing link.   Some organizations use one on one relationship mentoring, which can be effective, but may also be an extremely high-risk.  When this one on one relationship ends and the emotional support ends, the termination confirms that \"people will eventually leave you.\"  In addition, one on one relationships can lend itself to an abusive situation.  \t\r\n\tFor these reasons, YW opted for a group-oriented educational design.  Approximately 24 mentees are assigned to the same group or “tribe”.  Mentees are matched to a tribe based on their ages and development level.  Each tribe is divided into four smaller groups with 5 boys, 1 youth mentor and 1 adult mentor.  YW Mentors are males recruited from the community.  These mentors are thoroughly screened and trained using “best practices” and proven successful methods.  Small group membership is consistent so that trusting relationships can be established.  \r\n\tYW does not just stop with the boys' relationships.  YW focuses on other relationships associated with the boys-- that is peer relationships, authority relationships, and especially the parent relationships.  YW recognizes how difficult it is for a single parent to raise the child.  Without helping the parent/guardian, one cannot fully help the child.  YW requires parent/guardian involvement.  To this end, parenting workshops and resources are provided.  In summation, YW focuses on building an entire community of caring and networking relationships, a positive alternative to gang affiliations.  "
  vision: >-
    Success would look like having an after school program in every LAUSD school
    or independent school systems.  Success will be Young Warriors of the next
    generation being mentored by alumni.  Success will be Young Warriors being
    the capable and upstanding leaders and fathers of tomorrow.  Success would
    be social connectedness of family.  Most importantly to these boys, true
    success would be the presence of a father of character back in the lives of
    the family.  Dads, we need you!
