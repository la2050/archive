title: OPENHealth Central  Putting the care back in healthcare
project_summary: "Placing patients at the center of care: OPENHealth Central \r\n\r\n\r\nObamacare is increasing the number of people with access to health insurance in Los Angeles, but that won’t automatically translate into better care. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLA's healthcare systems serve more people than anywhere else. However, given the geographic, economic, and social disparities in the county, meeting the needs of the newly insured is a huge challenge. Making matters more difficult, no software service exists that is designed specially to assist primary-care teams in managing their most complex cases. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFortunately, these challenges offer an opportunity to create an innovative system and forge new partnerships that can improve care for everyone in Los Angeles and serve as an example for the entire country. Taking advantage of this opportunity will  be easier with the open-source software service that we call OPENHealth Central, whose purpose is to put the 'care' back into the healthcare system. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOPENHealth Central helps doctors and patients plan for visits more effectively, track experiences between visits, boost the quality of care and self-care, and provide the psychological support that comes from a rich human feedback loop. The system does this by triggering action on the part of doctors, while collecting data that drives evidence-based improvement in patient care, population health, and healthcare costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOPENHealth Central provides patients with effective ways to organize and use their healthcare information in order to be more active participants in their own care. \r\n\r\n\r\nBeyond helping people make and prepare for medical appointments, keep track of prescriptions, and decode lab results, OPENHealth Central also encourages people to set and reach health goals through tailored care plans that offer both medical and lifestyle suggestions. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEngaged patients make healthier choices, which means a healthier population—and reduced healthcare costs—overall.\r\n\r\n\r\nLA's healthcare challenges require a systematic response\r\n\r\n\r\nThe newly insured have significant health needs and social circumstances that make it difficult for them to take full advantage of healthcare services. Meanwhile, this population is often treated at clinics that are already tending to those living in under-served communities where caseloads are high, funding is minimal, and compensation is restricted to face-to-face services only. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA shortage of primary-care doctors in these communities already makes it more difficult to help people achieve optimal health. Fortunately, physician-led inter-disciplinary \"care team\" models are emerging to address this shortage while improving care. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd yet there is no integrated software service that will help with this transition to a more efficient and effective care model.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlacing patient needs at the center of healthcare\r\n\r\n\r\nLos Angeles can bridge the gap between insurance reform and healthcare reform in a systematic and innovative fashion by supporting OPENHealth Central, a web- and mobile-based system that helps clinical care teams better manage the health needs of patients with complex and costly chronic illnesses. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen operational, OPENHealth Central will help clinical care teams:\r\n\r\n\r\n•\tscreen, assess, and coordinate the care of patients whose complex health problems and social situations pose barriers to timely and economical care \r\n\r\n\r\n•\tcommunicate with and monitor the health of patients remotely, in order to improve data quality while saving on time and expense associated with face-to-face clinical encounters\r\n\r\n\r\n•\tsupport individualized preventive/chronic/acute wellness planning to keep people out of the hospital whenever possible\r\n\r\n\r\n•\tdevelop a primary care model of continuous personal relationships that are data-driven and accountable; doing so will help ensure that clinical quality data can be more easily shared within medical practices and across hospitals and clinics, to improve the overall quality of care of Angelenos\r\n\r\n\r\n•\tincrease patient access to healthcare and community assistance programs, facilitating 'warm hand-offs' to people in agencies who can help the patient with their health-related needs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOPENHealth Central will help Angelenos and their care-providers lead more healthy and satisfying lives regardless of their social advantages.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  success: "OPENHealth Central, at its core, is a data system that tracks the quality of the care experience, the care process itself, costs, and outcomes. It will provide much needed information to practice leaders and policymakers so that funds can flow where they will be of greatest value. \r\n\r\nThe Recovery Act (“Meaningful Use”) and the Affordable Care Act are leading patients, payers, purchasers, and the clinical leaders to demand information that sheds light on the true value of healthcare services. This historical alignment of payment for value has the potential to fuel the improvement of healthcare delivery in the U.S., but only if new metrics and methods are created to define value for all involved.\r\n\r\nOPENHealth Central is designed to help provide better means to manage care, particularly at clinics in under-served communities and for patients with complex chronic diseases and their attendant co-morbidities. Costs associated with caring for these populations are staggering, and OPENHealth Central will provide the means for clinics in these communities to screen, care for, monitor, and collect evidence about these populations. This evidence-based model has the potential for creating the conditions for systemic change, particularly when such a software service is adopted by clinical care teams around Los Angeles using similar means for collecting and analyzing data about individual patients and whole populations.\r\n\r\nUse of this and other systems across Los Angeles lays the groundwork for methodical multi-site clinical quality-improvement initiatives that can help healthcare providers demonstrate that their care is working and why. Such data will better satisfy the information needs of communities, private insurers, Medicare/Medicaid, and community-health researchers.  \r\n\r\nFinally, OPENHealth Central will promote transparent and appropriate data-governance mechanisms that will ensure fairness, openness, data sharing and hence a more level playing field for less-powerful players in multi-stakeholder projects such as this.\r\n"

  description1: "OPENHealth Central is being designed by Lybba, a 501(c)3 nonprofit based in Los Angeles that design networks, tools, and events that help people better care for themselves and one another. We engage patients, physicians, and researchers in collaborations that create breakthrough solutions.\r\n\r\nOver the past three years Lybba is a founding designer of the Collaborative Chronic Care Network (C3N), a new model for devising and testing innovations in clinical care and research. We are designing tools that help patients track their health between appointments, visualize their health over time via clear and engaging graphics, communicate with physicians using online and mobile applications, and choose to share their medical data with other patients and researchers. By increasing patient engagement, the C3N can transform the experience and outcomes of illness, and accelerate the discovery and application of new knowledge. (Supported by the National Institutes of Health.) \r\n\r\nLybba is currently designing and building an automated decision-support aid for doctors and patients to use together to achieve better outcomes. By using this product, patients with serious chronic illnesses will arrive at decisions about the treatment options most suitable to their particular situation. (Supported by a major LA research medical center.)\r\n\r\nLybba designed a Genetic Care Interchange that networks the collective experience of patients, their genetic information, and medical knowledge to supply insight for creating new genetically defined targets for drug development. (Supported by southern California life-sciences company.)\r\n\r\nLybba designed knowledge base of medical diagnostic, including  knowledge-sharing models for how potential contributors--such as MDs, patients, organizations, and others--will participate in the creation and cultivation of an online knowledge base of medical diagnostic information and techniques. (Supported by the California Endowment.)\r\n\r\nLybba is a co-designer of the Regional Resource Network of quality improvement leaders throughout the country.

  vision: "By 2050 the Los Angeles healthcare system can orient itself around the needs of the vast number of people who are currently ill-served by the current system. This will happen because we will have used our know-how, passion, and community assets to create resilient peer networks that are focused on outcomes for all residents, not just those with the most luxurious insurance policies. \r\n\r\nCurrently, only half the U.S. population with chronic illness receives the care they need, and only half of those patients successfully follow the wellness plans provided by their physicians. Depression, diabetes, heart disease, renal failure, and other prevalent chronic ailments can quickly escalate without screening, monitoring, and timely intervention. With so much data being produced by and on behalf of patients, systems will emerge to offer a more continuous model of care and that reinforces best practices and collaboration between patients and their care-providers. \r\n\r\nJust as important, these systems will convert data into care insights and meaningful action, helping to ensure that patients have access to and control over their own health information. Los Angeles in 2050 will be driven by its citizens not just because laws such as HIPPA says that they have a right to their data, but because systems rise up to help citizens use that data to improve their own care and the care of whole populations.\r\n\r\nThe healthcare system of Los Angeles in 2050 can keep people informed, connected, and ideally out of the hospital via a continuous care model that saves time, money, and lives. It can provide care-providers better ways to connect with their patients and each another, enabling more continuous and symmetrical flows of information. \r\n\r\nThe design of OPENHealth Central, which will be made available to the public, will provide an example that can be adopted, adapted, and/or emulated, thus contributing to the common good by offering an alternative to the profit-oriented companies offering billing systems in the guise of EMRs and PMSs. "
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: "OPENHealth Central: a software service that helps clinics manage the care of patients with complex cases, thus increasing access, improving care, and driving down costs in a systematic and scalable fashion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is increasing the number of people with access to health insurance in Los Angeles, but that won’t automatically translate into better care. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the geographic, economic, and social disparities here, meeting the needs of our residents is a huge challenge. After all, L.A. County's healthcare systems serve more people than any other place in America. When the newly insured enter the system, experts agree they will bring with them significant health needs and social circumstances that will make it especially difficult to take full advantage of healthcare services. This population is often treated at clinics where caseloads are high, funding is minimal, and compensation is restricted to facetoface services only. On top of that, a shortage of primarycare doctors in these communities already makes it more difficult to help patients achieve optimal health. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFortunately, these challenges offer an opportunity to cultivate innovative solutions that enhance the healthy connections between clinics and the populations they serve, and which will forge partnerships with the power to systematically improve care for everyone in Los Angeles. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile there are many promising political, economic, and social initiatives underway to create a more equitable and effective healthcare system in the county, we cannot allow the connection between healthcare providers and their patients to be the weak link. Specifically, primary care practices are already struggling to serve people with complex chronic conditions in proactive, comprehensive, and effect ways, and if they don't have the tools to rise to the occasion, access to care will matter little. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong the most promising advances in clinical care is the emergence of physicianled interdisciplinary \"care teams\" that flesh out the \"medical home\" approach to managing patient populations. Care teams of communitybased healthcare workers complement the expertise of MDs in ways that address the physician shortage while improving care and driving down costs.  These teams permit a more comprehensive approach to patient needs while boosting the number of patients a practice can manage. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut how can Los Angeles increase the effectiveness of care teams at scale, thus expanding access to highvalue care as the patient population expands?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe believe that Lybba's OPENHealth Central is a fundamental pathway toward a healthier L.A. in 2050. OPENHealth Central is a web and mobilebased system that helps clinical care teams better manage the health needs of patients with complex and costly chronic conditions, while prompting patients to collect the kinds of information between visits that can dramatically improve their care and the system as a whole. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOPENHealth Central is an opensource software service whose purpose is to put the 'care' back into the healthcare system. It helps doctors and patients plan for visits more effectively, track experiences between visits, boost the quality of care and selfcare, and provide the psychological support that comes from a rich human feedback loop. The system triggers action on the part of doctors, while also collecting data that drives evidencebased improvement in patient care, population health, and healthcare costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOPENHealth Central provides patients with effective ways to organize and use their healthcare information in order to be more active participants in their own care. \n\n\nBeyond helping people make and prepare for medical appointments, keep track of prescriptions, and decode lab results, OPENHealth Central also encourages people to set and achieve health goals through tailored care plans that offer both medical and lifestyle suggestions.  \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOPENHealth Central will help clinical care teams:\n\n\n\n\n\n*\tscreen, assess, and coordinate the care of patients whose complex health problems and social situations pose barriers to timely and economical care \n\n\n\n\n\n*\tcommunicate with and monitor the health of patients remotely, in order to improve data quality while saving the time and expense associated with facetoface clinical encounters\n\n\n\n\n\n*\tsupport individualized preventive, chronic, and acute wellness planning to keep people out of the hospital whenever possible\n\n\n\n\n\n*\tdevelop a primary care model of continuous personal relationships that are datadriven and accountable\n\n\n\n\n\n*\tincrease patient access to healthcare and community assistance programs, facilitating 'warm handoffs' to people in agencies who can help the patient with their healthrelated needs\n\n\n\n\n\n*\thelp ensure clinical quality data is shareable within medical practices and across hospitals and clinics\n\n\n\n\n\nOPENHealth Central will help Angelenos and their careproviders lead more healthy and satisfying lives"

They will have the knowledge and means to keep themselves healthy, and they will know when there is no other choice but it seek medical attention. And they will get the attention they need at a fair price.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy 2050 clinical practices will be sharing information about how their patient populations are doing so that optimal care is evenly distributed throughout Los Angeles regardless of social status or geographic location.
