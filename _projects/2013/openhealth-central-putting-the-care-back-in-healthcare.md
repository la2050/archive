title: OPENHealth Central  Putting the care back in healthcare
project_summary: "OPENHealth Central is being designed by Lybba, a 501(c)3 nonprofit based in Los Angeles that design networks, tools, and events that help people better care for themselves and one another. We engage patients, physicians, and researchers in collaborations that create breakthrough solutions.\r\n\r\nOver the past three years Lybba is a founding designer of the Collaborative Chronic Care Network (C3N), a new model for devising and testing innovations in clinical care and research. We are designing tools that help patients track their health between appointments, visualize their health over time via clear and engaging graphics, communicate with physicians using online and mobile applications, and choose to share their medical data with other patients and researchers. By increasing patient engagement, the C3N can transform the experience and outcomes of illness, and accelerate the discovery and application of new knowledge. (Supported by the National Institutes of Health.) \r\n\r\nLybba is currently designing and building an automated decision-support aid for doctors and patients to use together to achieve better outcomes. By using this product, patients with serious chronic illnesses will arrive at decisions about the treatment options most suitable to their particular situation. (Supported by a major LA research medical center.)\r\n\r\nLybba designed a Genetic Care Interchange that networks the collective experience of patients, their genetic information, and medical knowledge to supply insight for creating new genetically defined targets for drug development. (Supported by southern California life-sciences company.)\r\n\r\nLybba designed knowledge base of medical diagnostic, including  knowledge-sharing models for how potential contributors--such as MDs, patients, organizations, and others--will participate in the creation and cultivation of an online knowledge base of medical diagnostic information and techniques.

  success: "OPENHealth Central, at its core, is a data system that tracks the quality of the care experience, the care process itself, costs, and outcomes. It will provide much needed information to practice leaders and policymakers so that funds can flow where they will be of greatest value. \r\n\r\nThe Recovery Act (“Meaningful Use”) and the Affordable Care Act are leading patients, payers, purchasers, and the clinical leaders to demand information that sheds light on the true value of healthcare services. This historical alignment of payment for value has the potential to fuel the improvement of healthcare delivery in the U.S., but only if new metrics and methods are created to define value for all involved.\r\n\r\nOPENHealth Central is designed to help provide better means to manage care, particularly at clinics in under-served communities and for patients with complex chronic diseases and their attendant co-morbidities. Costs associated with caring for these populations are staggering, and OPENHealth Central will provide the means for clinics in these communities to screen, care for, monitor, and collect evidence about these populations. This evidence-based model has the potential for creating the conditions for systemic change, particularly when such a software service is adopted by clinical care teams around Los Angeles using similar means for collecting and analyzing data about individual patients and whole populations.\r\n\r\nUse of this and other systems across Los Angeles lays the groundwork for methodical multi-site clinical quality-improvement initiatives that can help healthcare providers demonstrate that their care is working and why. Such data will better satisfy the information needs of communities, private insurers, Medicare/Medicaid, and community-health researchers.  \r\n\r\nFinally, OPENHealth Central will promote transparent and appropriate data-governance mechanisms that will ensure fairness, openness, data sharing and hence a more level playing field for less-powerful players in multi-stakeholder projects such as this.\r\n"

  brief: "Placing patients at the center of care: OPENHealth Central \r\n\r\n\r\nObamacare is increasing the number of people with access to health insurance in Los Angeles, but that won’t automatically translate into better care. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLA's healthcare systems serve more people than anywhere else. However, given the geographic, economic, and social disparities in the county, meeting the needs of the newly insured is a huge challenge. Making matters more difficult, no software service exists that is designed specially to assist primary-care teams in managing their most complex cases. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFortunately, these challenges offer an opportunity to create an innovative system and forge new partnerships that can improve care for everyone in Los Angeles and serve as an example for the entire country. Taking advantage of this opportunity will  be easier with the open-source software service that we call OPENHealth Central, whose purpose is to put the 'care' back into the healthcare system. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOPENHealth Central helps doctors and patients plan for visits more effectively, track experiences between visits, boost the quality of care and self-care, and provide the psychological support that comes from a rich human feedback loop. The system does this by triggering action on the part of doctors, while collecting data that drives evidence-based improvement in patient care, population health, and healthcare costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOPENHealth Central provides patients with effective ways to organize and use their healthcare information in order to be more active participants in their own care. \r\n\r\n\r\nBeyond helping people make and prepare for medical appointments, keep track of prescriptions, and decode lab results, OPENHealth Central also encourages people to set and reach health goals through tailored care plans that offer both medical and lifestyle suggestions. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEngaged patients make healthier choices, which means a healthier population—and reduced healthcare costs—overall.\r\n\r\n\r\nLA's healthcare challenges require a systematic response\r\n\r\n\r\nThe newly insured have significant health needs and social circumstances that make it difficult for them to take full advantage of healthcare services. Meanwhile, this population is often treated at clinics that are already tending to those living in under-served communities where caseloads are high, funding is minimal, and compensation is restricted to face-to-face services only. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA shortage of primary-care doctors in these communities already makes it more difficult to help people achieve optimal health. Fortunately, physician-led inter-disciplinary \"care team\" models are emerging to address this shortage while improving care. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd yet there is no integrated software service that will help with this transition to a more efficient and effective care model.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlacing patient needs at the center of healthcare\r\n\r\n\r\nLos Angeles can bridge the gap between insurance reform and healthcare reform in a systematic and innovative fashion by supporting OPENHealth Central, a web- and mobile-based system that helps clinical care teams better manage the health needs of patients with complex and costly chronic illnesses. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen operational, OPENHealth Central will help clinical care teams:\r\n\r\n\r\n•\tscreen, assess, and coordinate the care of patients whose complex health problems and social situations pose barriers to timely and economical care \r\n\r\n\r\n•\tcommunicate with and monitor the health of patients remotely, in order to improve data quality while saving on time and expense associated with face-to-face clinical encounters\r\n\r\n\r\n•\tsupport individualized preventive/chronic/acute wellness planning to keep people out of the hospital whenever possible\r\n\r\n\r\n•\tdevelop a primary care model of continuous personal relationships that are data-driven and accountable; doing so will help ensure that clinical quality data can be more easily shared within medical practices and across hospitals and clinics, to improve the overall quality of care of Angelenos\r\n\r\n\r\n•\tincrease patient access to healthcare and community assistance programs, facilitating 'warm hand-offs' to people in agencies who can help the patient with their health-related needs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOPENHealth Central will help Angelenos and their care-providers lead more healthy and satisfying lives regardless of their social advantages.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
  budget explanation: "There's no getting around the fact that the system-wide challenges of Los Angeles require system-wide responses, particularly if our common aim is to adopt substantial and self-reinforcing strategies designed to yield verifiable positive effects between now and the year 2050. \r\n\r\n\r\nSuch system-wide responses can be complex, time-consuming, and costly. Lybba's deep experience and its nonprofit business model, however, mean that financial investment in OPENHealth Central will be efficiently deployed and highly leverageable by allied healthcare initiatives in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\n\r\nFunding from LA 2050 can provide critical funding for OPENHealth Central. OPENHealth Central will require approximately 18 months and $790,000 to design, build, and roll out. The budget below accounts only for staffing costs; all other costs (rent, phones, computers, etc.) will be paid for through Lybba's overhead budget.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe expect cost of operations of the system (once built) to be approximately $250,000 in staff costs, as well as another $75,000 in technical infrastructure costs for the first year. These costs will be born by service subscribers through a pricing model that will make the service affordable to under-funded clinics.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Design (current phase)\r\n  Direct staff costs: $100,000\r\n\r\n\r\n+Construction & testing\r\n   Direct Staff costs: $380,000 \r\n\r\n+Prototype Testing Phase\r\n   Direct Staff costs: $140,000\r\n\r\n\r\n+Roll Out \r\n   Direct Staff costs: $170,000/year\r\n\r\n\r\n+Operations\r\n  Direct staff costs: $250,000/year\r\n  Technical infrastructure costs: $75,000\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the support of LA 2050, Lybba will be able to design a service and business plan that will attract support from other funders. Lybba has an excellent track record in securing funding for our healthcare-transformation initiatives, from organizations such as The California Endowment, the California Biotechnology Foundation, the National Institutes for Health, that Agency for Healthcare Research & Quality, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, and the Kauffman Foundation. \r\n"
  description: "The personal, community, and healthcare costs associated with treating chronic illness are crippling Los Angeles; the costs associated with not treating such cases are even greater. The influx of newly insured people in Los Angeles is taxing an already burdened system, because a significant number of these families have serious untreated illnesses and challenging social barriers to negotiate. Many new strategies must be adopted now if we are to make headway by 2050.\r\n\r\nOPENHealth Central is designed to help clinics better plan and coordinate the in-home and clinical care of patients with chronic illnesses before their conditions grow serious, complex, and expensive. Baked into the shape and purpose of OPENHealth Central is a data-collection regime that aids clinics in improving quality of care and reducing costs. In addition to directly benefitting the patients and clinics using OPENHealth Central, these data will help identify which 'needles' to move across Los Angeles, helping to determine what is achieving positive results, and sharing those insights broadly. \r\n\r\nThese data, in turn, will provide policymakers and clinical practice leaders the information they need to channel resources where they are most needed. \r\n\r\nLA's current safety-net approach to healthcare (like the rest of the state's) is limited to face-to-face strategies, emphasizing the volume of medical encounters over the value of medical attention. This must change if we are to improve outcomes while decreasing per-capita healthcare costs. OPENHealth Central is designed to increase the volume and value of care encounters while driving down costs, in part by providing digital tools that make it easier to make care decisions more accurately and swiftly. \r\n\r\nCommunity-oriented care organizations (such Lybba's collaborator, Family & Parent Centered Care Partners) strive to achieve the IHI Triple Aim of improved patient experience and care processes, improved outcomes, and better cost controls. But these organizations lack the computational infrastructure to make methodical and swift progress. Without data and the IT infrastructure to direct care resources optimally, even the most dedicated physicians and their care teams have difficulty discriminating between effective and ineffective care strategies. The business model for OPENHealth Central is centered around providing that infrastructure at low cost to clinical practices that would otherwise be unable to build their own.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that people actually will take better care for themselves and one another, especially when they have continuous, personal relationships with healthcare providers who know their case well and can help them achieve lifestyle and wellness objectives. Primary care practices in under-served communities are best positioned to be partners with these individuals, provided they have the tools they need to manage the care of their population.  "
  collaborators: "OPENHealth Central will be built in an open-source fashion, relying on multiple software and data providers to achieve rapid, widespread transformation of healthcare for the public good. \r\n\r\nBrian Prestwich, MD, Assistant Professor of Clinical Family Medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of USC, serves as Medical Director for OPENHealth Central. We also have the support of Libby Hoy, founder Patient & Family Centered Care Partners, which contribute knowledge, insight, as well as a test-bed for the OPENHealth Central. PFCC Partners is committed to building a community of health care providers, administrators, patients, and families to improve the quality, safety, experience and delivery of health care. "

  description3: "The evolution of the digital health practice is still in its infancy. It needs a thoughtful, design-oriented strategy that addresses needs of care teams and patients alike. Because no commercial care-management solution exists to serve the needs of primary care teams, Lybba is designing one in an open-source manner, for the purposes of addressing the needs of Los Angeles and other communities. \r\n\r\nMany people believed that electronic medical record systems (EMRs) would help in managing care and improve the quality of healthcare services. But the value EMRs at a clinical-care level is unclear at best, with patients and doctors alike complaining that their use is distracting and the data generated rarely supplies either party with information that enhances diagnosis and care. That is because EMRs are essentially billing systems, and are not designed to make it easy for clinics to better care for their patients or to help patients understand their health conditions better. \r\n\r\nPractice-management system (PMS) software keeps the medical office running in terms of billing, scheduling, and other essential business processes. But like EMRs, the PMS products are not designed to help care teams understand the needs of their patient populations for purposes of delivering and measuring the care they need.\r\n\r\nThe EMR and PMS vendors see no commercial advantage in developing systems to determine, facilitate, and record better care. So at best these companies are introducing small 'fixes' to their current products. This is a little like trying to build Apple's Garage Band on top of Microsoft Excel: maybe the result product will make sound, but it won't be pretty.\r\n\r\nYet, despite legitimate complaints about their utility and usability, EMRs and PMSs are here to stay. \r\n\r\nThese are some of the reasons a non-profit healthcare technology-design company like Lybba is working in this field. Designing a care-oriented IT solution that expands the utility of EMRs and PMSs is now critical if we are to ensure the success of Obamacare and to achieve the Triple Aims of improved patient experience, healthier populations, and a decrease in per capita healthcare costs.\r\n\t\r\nThrough design, OPENHealth Central puts the 'care' back in the healthcare system. It offers a compelling interactive information layer that plucks relevant information from the patient health record and situates it in a context that enables healthcare workers, patients, and their families to improve care and communication, while also offering a feedback loop that improves clinical care and research.\r\n"
  vision: "By 2050 the Los Angeles healthcare system can orient itself around the needs of the vast number of people who are currently ill-served by the current system. This will happen because we will have used our know-how, passion, and community assets to create resilient peer networks that are focused on outcomes for all residents, not just those with the most luxurious insurance policies. \r\n\r\nCurrently, only half the U.S. population with chronic illness receives the care they need, and only half of those patients successfully follow the wellness plans provided by their physicians. Depression, diabetes, heart disease, renal failure, and other prevalent chronic ailments can quickly escalate without screening, monitoring, and timely intervention. With so much data being produced by and on behalf of patients, systems will emerge to offer a more continuous model of care and that reinforces best practices and collaboration between patients and their care-providers. \r\n\r\nJust as important, these systems will convert data into care insights and meaningful action, helping to ensure that patients have access to and control over their own health information. Los Angeles in 2050 will be driven by its citizens not just because laws such as HIPPA says that they have a right to their data, but because systems rise up to help citizens use that data to improve their own care and the care of whole populations.\r\n\r\nThe healthcare system of Los Angeles in 2050 can keep people informed, connected, and ideally out of the hospital via a continuous care model that saves time, money, and lives. It can provide care-providers better ways to connect with their patients and each another, enabling more continuous and symmetrical flows of information. \r\n\r\nThe design of OPENHealth Central, which will be made available to the public, will provide an example that can be adopted, adapted, and/or emulated, thus contributing to the common good by offering an alternative to the profit-oriented companies offering billing systems in the guise of EMRs and PMSs.

What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: "OPENHealth Central: a software service that helps clinics manage the care of patients with complex cases, thus increasing access, improving care, and driving down costs in a systematic and scalable fashion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is increasing the number of people with access to health insurance in Los Angeles, but that won’t automatically translate into better care. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the geographic, economic, and social disparities here, meeting the needs of our residents is a huge challenge. After all, L.A. County's healthcare systems serve more people than any other place in America. When the newly insured enter the system, experts agree they will bring with them significant health needs and social circumstances that will make it especially difficult to take full advantage of healthcare services. This population is often treated at clinics where caseloads are high, funding is minimal, and compensation is restricted to facetoface services only. On top of that, a shortage of primarycare doctors in these communities already makes it more difficult to help patients achieve optimal health. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFortunately, these challenges offer an opportunity to cultivate innovative solutions that enhance the healthy connections between clinics and the populations they serve, and which will forge partnerships with the power to systematically improve care for everyone in Los Angeles. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile there are many promising political, economic, and social initiatives underway to create a more equitable and effective healthcare system in the county, we cannot allow the connection between healthcare providers and their patients to be the weak link. Specifically, primary care practices are already struggling to serve people with complex chronic conditions in proactive, comprehensive, and effect ways, and if they don't have the tools to rise to the occasion, access to care will matter little. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong the most promising advances in clinical care is the emergence of physicianled interdisciplinary \"care teams\" that flesh out the \"medical home\" approach to managing patient populations. Care teams of communitybased healthcare workers complement the expertise of MDs in ways that address the physician shortage while improving care and driving down costs.  These teams permit a more comprehensive approach to patient needs while boosting the number of patients a practice can manage. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut how can Los Angeles increase the effectiveness of care teams at scale, thus expanding access to highvalue care as the patient population expands?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe believe that Lybba's OPENHealth Central is a fundamental pathway toward a healthier L.A. in 2050. OPENHealth Central is a web and mobilebased system that helps clinical care teams better manage the health needs of patients with complex and costly chronic conditions, while prompting patients to collect the kinds of information between visits that can dramatically improve their care and the system as a whole. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOPENHealth Central is an opensource software service whose purpose is to put the 'care' back into the healthcare system. It helps doctors and patients plan for visits more effectively, track experiences between visits, boost the quality of care and selfcare, and provide the psychological support that comes from a rich human feedback loop. The system triggers action on the part of doctors, while also collecting data that drives evidencebased improvement in patient care, population health, and healthcare costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOPENHealth Central provides patients with effective ways to organize and use their healthcare information in order to be more active participants in their own care. \n\n\nBeyond helping people make and prepare for medical appointments, keep track of prescriptions, and decode lab results, OPENHealth Central also encourages people to set and achieve health goals through tailored care plans that offer both medical and lifestyle suggestions.  \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOPENHealth Central will help clinical care teams:\n\n\n\n\n\n*\tscreen, assess, and coordinate the care of patients whose complex health problems and social situations pose barriers to timely and economical care \n\n\n\n\n\n*\tcommunicate with and monitor the health of patients remotely, in order to improve data quality while saving the time and expense associated with facetoface clinical encounters\n\n\n\n\n\n*\tsupport individualized preventive, chronic, and acute wellness planning to keep people out of the hospital whenever possible\n\n\n\n\n\n*\tdevelop a primary care model of continuous personal relationships that are datadriven and accountable\n\n\n\n\n\n*\tincrease patient access to healthcare and community assistance programs, facilitating 'warm handoffs' to people in agencies who can help the patient with their healthrelated needs\n\n\n\n\n\n*\thelp ensure clinical quality data is shareable within medical practices and across hospitals and clinics\n\n\n\n\n\nOPENHealth Central will help Angelenos and their careproviders lead more healthy and satisfying lives"

  make care decisions more accurately and swiftly. 









  Communityoriented care organizations (such Lybba's collaborator, Family &
  Parent Centered Care Partners,) strive to achieve the IHI Triple Aim of
  improved patient experience and care processes, improved outcomes, and better
  cost controls. But these organizations lack the computational infrastructure
  to make methodical and swift progress. Without data and the IT infrastructure
  to direct care resources optimally, even the most dedicated physicians and
  their care teams have difficulty discriminating between effective and
  ineffective care strategies. The business model for OPENHealth Central is
  centered around providing that infrastructure at low cost to clinical
  practices that would otherwise be unable to build their own.









  The good news is that people actually will take better care for themselves and
  one another, especially when they have continuous, personal relationships with
  healthcare providers who know their case well and can help them achieve
  lifestyle and wellness objectives. Primary care practices in underserved
  communities are best positioned to be partners with these individuals,
  provided they have the tools they need to manage the care of their population.


What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: "The healthcare system of Los Angeles in 2050 can keep people informed, connected, and ideally out of the hospital via a continuous care model that saves time, money, and lives. It can provide careproviders better ways to connect with their patients and each another, enabling more continuous and symmetrical flows of information. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, only half the U.S. population with chronic illness receives the care they need, and only half of those patients successfully follow the wellness plans provided by their physicians. Depression, diabetes, heart disease, renal failure, and other prevalent chronic ailments can quickly escalate without screening, monitoring, and timely intervention.  With so much data being produced by and on behalf of patients, systems will emerge to offer a more continuous model of care and that reinforces best practices and collaboration between patients and their careproviders. \n\n\n\n\n\nBy 2050 the Los Angeles healthcare system can serve the essential needs of the vast number of people who are currently illserved by the current system. Those with the greatest need will get the attention they require because data systems will show that the benefits of holding back services are insignificant compared with the benefits of allocating resources evenly across the county. \n\n\n\n\n\nBy 2050 residents will have the information they need to care for themselves and one another. They will have the knowledge and means to keep themselves healthy, and they will know when there is no other choice but it seek medical attention. And they will get the attention they need at a fair price.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy 2050 clinical practices will be sharing information about how their patient populations are doing so that optimal care is evenly distributed throughout Los Angeles regardless of social status or geographic location. Primary care practices will be less dependent on MDs and less oriented toward managing bills sent to dozens of 'payers', and more centered around care teams led by physicians oriented around the needs of their patients.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese qualities will come to life because we will have used our knowhow, passion, and community assets to create resilient networks of people, information, and resources focused around the needs of all residents, not just those with the most luxurious insurance policies. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust as important, these systems will convert data into care insights and meaningful action, helping to ensure that patients have access to and control over their own health information. Los Angeles in 2050 will be driven by its residents not just because laws such as HIPPA say that they have a right to their data, but because systems have emerged to help us use our data to improve our own care and the care of the entire  population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the adoption of systems like OPENHealth Central, more meaningful relationships between doctors and patients will be possible.
