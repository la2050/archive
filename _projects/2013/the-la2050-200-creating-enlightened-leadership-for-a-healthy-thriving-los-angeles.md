title: >-
  The LA2050 200  Creating Enlightened Leadership for a Healthy Thriving Los
  Angeles
indicator: ' Education'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >+
  <p>The success of the LA2050 initiative depends on the intelligence,
  creativity, clarity and effectiveness of its most influential proponents.</p>






  <p>If those who are responsible for leading this important initiative have a
  tool to be more effective in their chosen area, their influence will be more
  profound. The leaders of this effort should themselves embody the highest
  ideals of health, comprehensive vision, compassion and creativity. </p>






  <p>The LA2050 "200" program, under the direction of the David Lynch
  Foundation, will train 200 top leaders in the various target areas (Education,
  Health, Housing, etc.) in the Transcendental Meditation program.
  Transcendental Meditation (TM) is the most thoroughly researched
  selfdevelopment tool for relieving stress, improving health and wellbeing, and
  actualizing inner potential to enhance organizational leadership.</p>

  <p>The David Lynch Foundation has provided training programs for some of the
  most successful organizations in the country, including Oprah Winfrey's
  Harpo/OWN network, Dr. Oz and Ellen Degeneres' production companies, employees
  at Bridgewater Associates, the world's most successful hedge fund company.
  </p>






  <p>With this grant from GOOD, the David Lynch Foundation will provide a custom
  training program for 200 of the most inspired and inspiring leaders of the
  LA2050 initiative. </p>








What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >+
  The David Lynch Foundation has instructed over 250,000 atrisk populations
  worldwide in the Transcendental Meditation program. 






  Programs focus on atrisk students, veterans with PTSD, homeless and retraining
  programs, women and girls initiatives

Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  Collaborators include Aileen Getty, who along with her GettLove Foundation, is
  one of the biggest influences addressing the issue of homelessness in Los
  Angeles, and Dr. Roberta Benjamin, Superintendent of Aspire Public Schools for
  Los Angeles. A top California foundation has signaled its interest in working
  with the David Lynch Foundation to bring education and research data on the TM
  program to thought leaders and policy makers in health, education and
  politics.
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  The David Lynch Foundation has its own internal assessment capability,
  including educational researchers Dr. Sanford Nidich and Dr. Sarina Grosswald.
  We would design an evaluation model to measure results in the participating
  group using inventories such as Emotional Quotient Inventory (EQI)  widely
  used in the field of management; the Intrapersonal Scale comprises selfregard,
  emotional selfawareness, assertiveness, independence, selfactualization
  Interpersonal scale comprises empathy, social responsibility, and
  interpersonal relationship (only scale not quite statistically significant);
  Stress Management Scale comprises stress toleration and impulse control;
  Adaptability scale comprises reality testing, flexibility, and problem,
  solving ability; Positive Mood comprises optimism and happiness; Profile of
  Mood States (POMS) measures psychological distress.
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  Giving 200 leaders of the LA2050 initiative a potent tool for dealing with
  stress and actualizing their highest potential will translate to more creative
  solutions, more effective programs, and more profound results. 
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >+
  We can foster a more enlightened, integrated, and effective leadership who
  will in turn create the most successful models in their own areas of
  expertise. Our focus will be on raising the core effectiveness of the leaders
  responsible for the LA2050 initiative. To use a metaphor, a healthy garden
  depends on many elements  good seed, good soil, water and sunshine in proper
  time in proper amounts. Our focus is on the “gardeners”. So much depends on
  the leaders who are charged with executing the plans for a healthier and
  happier Los Angeles in 2050. We will help them achieve their highest level of
  competency and effectiveness.
