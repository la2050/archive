    The David Lynch Foundation has its own internal assessment capability,
    including educational researchers Dr. Sanford Nidich and Dr. Sarina
    Grosswald. We would design an evaluation model to measure results in the
    participating group using inventories such as Emotional Quotient Inventory
    (EQI) - widely used in the field of management; the Intrapersonal Scale
    comprises self-regard, emotional self-awareness, assertiveness,
    independence, self-actualization Interpersonal scale comprises empathy,
    social responsibility, and interpersonal relationship (only scale not quite
    statistically significant); Stress Management Scale comprises stress
    toleration and impulse control; Adaptability scale comprises reality
    testing, flexibility, and problem, solving ability; Positive Mood comprises
    optimism and happiness; Profile of Mood States (POMS) measures psychological
    distress.

  budget explanation: >-
    The cost of training 200 individuals in a custom-designed program of
    instruction and follow-up is $1,000 per person. The David Lynch Foundation
    would match the $100,000 grant from GOOD to bring the TM training to 200 of
    the most influential leaders in Los Angeles, on a voluntary basis.

    Giving 200 leaders of the LA2050 initiative a potent tool for dealing with
    stress and actualizing their highest potential will translate to more
    creative solutions, more effective programs, and more profound results. 
  collaborators: >-
    Collaborators include Aileen Getty, who along with her GettLove Foundation,
    is one of the biggest influences addressing the issue of homelessness in Los
    Angeles, and Dr. Roberta Benjamin, Superintendent of Aspire Public Schools
    for Los Angeles. A top California foundation has signaled its interest in
    working with the David Lynch Foundation to bring education and research data
    on the TM program to thought leaders and policy makers in health, education
    and politics.

  description3: "There are other meditation programs being offered and taught - mindfullness meditation, zen meditation, Chopra, relaxation response. \r\n\r\nMeditations are different and have different effects and benefits. TM is the most thoroughly researched and published form of meditation. Its benefits, derived from the simple, natural, effortless system allowing for \"automatic self-transcending\" are holistic and comprehensive. \r\n\r\nWe support all programs offering meditation to bring peace and relief to suffering people."
  vision: "We can foster a more enlightened, integrated, and effective leadership who will in turn create the most successful models in their own areas of expertise. Our focus will be on raising the core effectiveness of the leaders responsible for the LA2050 initiative. To use a metaphor, a healthy garden depends on many elements - good seed, good soil, water and sunshine in proper time in proper amounts. Our focus is on the “gardeners”. So much depends on the leaders who are charged with executing the plans for a healthier and happier Los Angeles in 2050. We will help them achieve their highest level of competency and effectiveness.\r\n"
