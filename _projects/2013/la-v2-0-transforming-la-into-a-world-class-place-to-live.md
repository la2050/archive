  description: "Let's face it. Life right now in the Los Angeles region is a dysfunctional mess. Millions of us suffer every day through the infamous reality of how difficult it is to slog from far-flung housing to jobs, without the adequate commuter options that other cities around the world have, but we have never managed to achieve.  With high demand versus available supply, some choose to move to more affordable suburbs and exurbs – but then contribute to the traffic problem (given the lack of adequate transit options), contributing to the gridlock that blocks new housing from being built closer to job centers and bringing down costs in the first place.\r\n\r\nRevolutionizing access to housing by transforming Angelenos commuting options will transform the daily experience for commuting Angelenos, open up a revolutionary number of new, denser housing options constructed near rail stations and near job centers, and reduce costs for transportation bared by working families, freeing up income to be able to afford housing in the first place. \r\n\r\nWith a functioning transportation system anchored by fast, frequent, subway, light rail, and commuter rail options -- plus bike-friendly and walkable neighborhoods, community fears about developments' traffic impacts won't stop transit-friendly housing from being developed. And LA will be able to build the housing density around job centers needed to meet our housing challenges, making housing more affordable as supply increases to meet demand. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, existing areas with more affordable options -- from the San Fernando Valley to traditionally lower-income areas across the region, will gain better access to jobs. \r\n\r\nAnd Angelenos with the newfound practical option of ditching their car and commuting by fast, efficient transit options, will see huge savings (estimated at $900/month: http://bit.ly/XFWdVk) that they can use to help them afford their housing costs.\r\n\r\nOTHER BENEFITS\r\nGetting LA a fully-built-out rail system will bring huge gains in quality of life for Angelenos, dramatically changing the game for many, if not all, of the LA2050 indicators, e.g.:\r\n* environmental quality: car dependency and sprawl leads to smog and public health problems\r\n* income & employment: LAEDC says Measure R’s transportation construction will create 409,080 jobs with labor income of $24.9 billion over a thirty year period (PDF: http://bit.ly/14mznJk); we propose something significantly more ambitious than this, which will create magnitudes more jobs\r\n* public safety: improving mobility would improve emergency response and free officers to attend to public safety issues instead of inching along in bumper-to-bumper traffic\r\n* social consecutiveness / arts and cultural vitality: Angelenos are less likely to volunteer, participate in nonprofits, or attend arts and cultural events because traffic (and lack of rail alternatives) makes getting there so onerous. \r\n"

  description3: "On the transportation issues and the nexus between housing & transportation, given the scale of the problem, there is an acute need for as many parties involved as possible. Frankly, given the scale of the problem, there is a need for much more to be done. We don't see ourselves in competition with others so much as seeing us as all advancing different parts of a huge problem. (As an analogy, one might think of environmental groups, and how there is a role played by the Sierra Club, NRDC, Heal the Bay, and others tackling different aspects of the \"same\" cause.)\r\n\r\nMobility 21: Mobility 21 is a seven-county effort in Southern California, focusing on efforts ranging from Advocacy in DC to issues like goods movement and a broad range of transportation issues. They're doing very important work, but we do not see our efforts as duplicative with their seven county focus.\r\n<br>\r\nMove LA: Move LA has been focusing a great deal of effort on accelerating the existing Measure R projects in Los Angeles County, an extremely important goal.

FAST has largely been focused on shorter term efforts, which are very important, but make for a difference focus than what's proposed for this LA2050 project.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThere are other transit and bike groups in LA that we are also a fan of, but which we do not feel make our proposal for LA2050 duplicative or unneeded.\r\n<br><br>\r\nOther Business groups, housing groups, and other land use groups: largely the focus is on fighting for individual construction projects, rather than stepping back and addressing the underlying causes for community opposition to housing -- the lack of ample transportation options in LA."
  vision: "Los Angeles will no longer be the laughing stock of the nation -- our infamous deficiencies will be wiped clean, replaced by Los Angeles version 2.0: a revamped region with ubiquitous, intensely used rail transit, leading to dramatic increases in housing availability near job centers and to easy access to affordable housing. In short, Los Angeles will be able to join the ranks of world class cities, by tackling head-on our most dysfunctional problem.\r\n<br><br>\r\nNow, crippling traffic gridlock (with no competitive transit alternatives in most areas) means that Angelenos' intensely fight new housing construction, including density near jobs centers and affordable housing projects. These problems will fade away. New housing developments  -- including dense developments near rail stations with affordable housing components -- will be built near jobs centers, given the new capacity that a rail system will bring. As the housing supply increases to meet demand, prices will fall.  Meanwhile, Angelenos who choose to live further out in more affordable areas won't have to face hellish car commutes, finally getting hugely improved commuter rail options. (But make no mistake, the main purpose of a rail system won't be to encourage more sprawl, but rather to allow more Angelenos to be able to have and afford housing closer to job centers.)\r\n<br><br>\r\nAngelenos' transportation costs will be dramatically decreased as public transit becomes widely adopted, freeing up family budgets to be better able to afford housing in the first place.\r\n<br><br>\r\nNot to mention, with a fully built out subway/light rail system and ample commuter rail options Los Angeles will be a dramatically more livable place, with faster mobility and improved environmental quality. Bikeable and walkable communities will support public health goals.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn the meantime, we will have make a big impact on income and employment issues, too, by creating hundreds of thousands of well-paying construction jobs over the decades leading up to 2050.  (LAEDC notes that the less ambitious Measure R construction will create 409,080 jobs with labor income of $24.9 billion over its thirty year period http://bit.ly/14mznJk).\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn short, Los Angeles will be a livable region. Angelenos will actually be able to get around quickly and easily, access ample new housing options, and have a dramatically improved quality of life."

  Our goal is nothing less than to lay the foundation so we will transform Los
  Angeles into a world class city and region by 2050, by tackling the biggest
  obstacle to meeting the housing problems LA2050 lays out. 



  <br><br>


   


  The reality is that we cannot solve the region’s housing challenges without
  first addressing that sibling of land use issues: transportation. An adequate
  rail transportation system — like most other large cities have  is the means
  to an end here for making it politically possible to build the ample, denser
  housing needed to increase affordability and meet current and future needs.
  The biggest challenge to building the housing supply that will meet demand and
  lower costs, and to making areas with affordable housing accessible, is our
  traffic and lack of adequate mobility options, which causes citizens to block
  new housing construction.



  <br><br>



  Our LA2050 project will propose, legitimize, and build a movement for a
  fullybuilt out, fast rail transit system in Los Angeles County: fast,
  ubiquitous subway lines that connect housing, jobs centers, and major
  destinations; and frequent, expanded commuter rail to connect more affordable
  housing areas. New York City has it. London has it. Tokyo has it. Paris has
  it. Chicago has it. Los Angeles doesn’t, and we’ll never be a world class
  livable city until we do. And we certainly will never be able to meet our
  housing challenges until we do.



  <br><br>



  We won’t just propose a vision; we will legitimize it and build a movement of
  supporters. 



  <br><br>



  To do so,. this year we will host an international distinguished speaker
  series bringing top global thinkers & doers to LA to inject global thinking
  into the civic conversation in LA, and to speak to the impact that other
  cities’ fully builtout rail systems have had on livability. Modeled on an
  expanded version of the Dutch Embassy's 2011 ThinkBikeLA weekend, which
  resulted in green bike lanes in LA, we will invite speakers of the caliber of
  Boris Johnson (Mayor of London), Tyler BrÃ»lÃ© (founder of Monocle &
  Wallpaper, Financial Times columnist, known for Monocle’s Global Quality of
  Life report), and Bruce Katz (director of Brookings’ Metropolitan Policy
  Program). Beyond our own events, we will invite the LA Mayor and other civic
  elites to host additional receptions, highlevel meetings, or workshops to
  maximize the visitors' influence.



  <br>



  We also propose to make infographics & a video to build momentum for our
  vision and to highlight other cities that have coordinated and met their
  housing and transportation challenges, to inspire Angelenos that we can do so,
  too. (We have already have an Emmy/Peabody award winning documentary producer
  who wants to do a longer, multiyear documentary project for us (funding
  permitting); this YouTube video could either be a short 23 min.
  documentarystyle video, or an independently produced viral video similar to
  “Did You Know?” (http://youtu.be/PHmwZ96_Gos).



  <br><br>



  We will make presentations on our LA2050 vision  and how to fund it to make it
  happen  to major business, civic, labor, environmental, and land use groups
  and leaders, signing up endorsers and building a coalition of supporters. We
  will work through the media to attract signatories from the broader legions of
  frustrated commuters, and we will do other efforts advancing our mission. 



  <br><br>



  INDICATOR



  There are three primary reasons that a fully built out rail transportation
  system impacts the Housing Indicator: 






  <br><br>



  1) despite housing shortage — and the according increase in housing costs, the
  lack of a fully built out rail system causes traffic gridlock, blocking new
  housing construction from being approved due to community concerns about
  traffic impacts of new development. (Our group’s president used to staff the
  Land Use Committee at a major business group and saw this firsthand.)



  <br><br>






  2) areas that do have (more) affordable housing in the suburbs and exurbs lack
  subways or adequate commuter rail linkages, unlike counterparts in other
  cities.



  <br><br>






  3) Angelenos have less money to spend on housing due to high transportation
  costs. Unlike in other cities, transit often isn’t a practical option. The
  average Angeleno could save $900 per commuter per month by taking transit and
  giving up a car (http://bit.ly/XFWdVk), money that could go towards housing
  expenses. 



  <br><br>






  But perhaps the issue is best illustrated by this anecdote from a LA Times
  article by Christopher Hawthorne: "Ron Galarze, who works in the epicure
  department at Neiman Marcus in Beverly Hills ...takes the bus to the store
  from his home in Whittier, a trip that takes between 90 minutes and 2 1/2
  hours each way." Housing & transportation issues are intimately linked.



  <br><br>



  By building a comprehensive rail transit system, we will be able to remake LA,
  with dense housing developments along transit lines and near job centers. We
  canand must—remake LA into a livable, world class city.
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  Before we tout our own horn, we should note you don't have to take our word
  for it about our achievements. Some of Los Angeles' most prominent leaders and
  foundations have given major donations  and in each case, major followon
  donations  to us, including business leaders Elon Musk (of Tesla & SpaceX

  “It was invigorating for me to attend last week’s rollout meeting…. It was
  reassuring to hear David Murphy, one of the organizers of the group, say in
  opening comments: ‘It’s time to come together…. Enough is enough.’”     


        Editorial by Charlie Crumpley, Editor, LA Business Journal





  “I think your sympathizers are in the millions.” 


         Warren Olney, host of KCRW's “Which Way, L.A.?”, introducing us on the air. 








  (Our efforts under the names Angelenos Against Gridlock, and our predecessor
  efforts under the name Building LA's Future are covered herein.)
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  Our past event partners include the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, Metro,
  FAST, and BizFed, and we’ve collaborated with civic elites and organizations
  in DC & LA too numerous to fit into the space here (email us for details).
  After LA2050 green lights our new project, we will reach out to potential
  collaborators such as: The new LA Mayor & groups like the Mayor's Council on
  Innovation & Industry ( PDF: http://bit.ly/15R8kCc), and local
  housing/transportation advocates like ULI, LAANE, Move LA, the LA Chamber,
  etc; national/international experts; GOOD/CORPS: if GOOD might consider
  probono advice on infographics/messaging, we'd love to widely distribute our
  own leaflets on this issue. (LOVED GOOD's work for Starbucks.)
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  Given that our project seeks to lay the stage for the transformation of Los
  Angeles in the long term, we have developed the following metrics to assist
  with evaluation in the shorter term:



  <br><br>



  REACH: 



  * Through the Media: the quality and quantity of media coverage of our vision
  for LA and of the projects in this proposal <br>



  * Key influencers: what civic elites and key influencers and policymakers have
  we reached with our efforts? <br> 



  * Presentations/meetings: what groups have we made presentations to or met
  with? <br>



  * Event attendance: how many people have attended our events? what types of
  audience members have we reached  have we reached a broad spectrum of people
  (business leaders, housing/transportation advocates, advocates for working
  families and the poor, policymakers, etc.)<br>



  * Distribution of materials: how have our outreach materials been distributed?
  how many people have they reached?



  <br><br>



  Ultimate goal is for denser housing (as opposed to endless sprawl) in LA made
  possible by a fully builtout transit system.






  <br><br>



  VISION<br>



  * Are we thinking big enough? Are we pushing LA to break the status quo?<br>









  <br><br>



  SUPPORTERS/SIGNATORIES:<br>



  * What groups/organizations/prominent leaders sign on to our vision for LA?
  (Conversely, are we attracting naysayers  a sign and gaining attention?)<br>



  * How many citizens have signed on to our vision for LA?
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
  Let's face it. Life right now in the Los Angeles region is a dysfunctional
  mess. Millions of us suffer every day through the infamous reality of how
  difficult it is to slog from farflung housing to jobs, without the adequate
  commuter options that other cities around the world have, but we have never
  managed to achieve.  With high demand versus available supply, some choose to
  move to more affordable suburbs and exurbs — but then contribute to the
  traffic problem (given the lack of adequate transit options), contributing to
  the gridlock that blocks new housing from being built closer to job centers
  and bringing down costs in the first place.






  Revolutionizing access to housing by transforming Angelenos commuting options
  will transform the daily experience for commuting Angelenos, open up a
  revolutionary number of new, denser housing options constructed near rail
  stations and near job centers, and reduce costs for transportation bared by
  working families, freeing up income to be able to afford housing in the first
  place. 






  With a functioning transportation system anchored by fast, frequent, subway,
  light rail, and commuter rail options  plus bikefriendly and walkable
  neighborhoods, community fears about developments' traffic impacts won't stop
  transitfriendly housing from being developed. And LA will be able to build the
  housing density around job centers needed to meet our housing challenges,
  making housing more affordable as supply increases to meet demand. 






  Meanwhile, existing areas with more affordable options  from the San Fernando
  Valley to traditionally lowerincome areas across the region, will gain better
  access to jobs. 






  And Angelenos with the newfound practical option of ditching their car and
  commuting by fast, efficient transit options, will see huge savings (estimated
  at $900/month: http://bit.ly/XFWdVk) that they can use to help them afford
  their housing costs.






  OTHER BENEFITS



  Getting LA a fullybuiltout rail system will bring huge gains in quality of
  life for Angelenos, dramatically changing the game for many, if not all, of
  the LA2050 indicators, e.g.:



  * environmental quality: car dependency and sprawl leads to smog and public
  health problems



  * income & employment: LAEDC says Measure R’s transportation construction will
  create 409,080 jobs with labor income of $24.9 billion over a thirty year
  period (PDF: http://bit.ly/14mznJk); we propose something significantly more
  ambitious than this, which will create magnitudes more jobs



  * public safety: improving mobility would improve emergency response and free
  officers to attend to public safety issues instead of inching along in
  bumpertobumper traffic



  * social consecutiveness / arts and cultural vitality: Angelenos are less
  likely to volunteer, participate in nonprofits, or attend arts and cultural
  events because traffic (and lack of rail alternatives) makes getting there so
  onerous. 


What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  Los Angeles will no longer be the laughing stock of the nation  our infamous
  deficiencies will be wiped clean, replaced by Los Angeles version 2.0: a
  revamped region with ubiquitous, intensely used rail transit, leading to
  dramatic increases in housing availability near job centers and to easy access
  to affordable housing. In short, Los Angeles will be able to join the ranks of
  world class cities, by tackling headon our most dysfunctional problem.



  <br><br>



  Now, crippling traffic gridlock (with no competitive transit alternatives in
  most areas) means that Angelenos' intensely fight new housing construction,
  including density near jobs centers and affordable housing projects. These
  problems will fade away. New housing developments   including dense
  developments near rail stations with affordable housing components  will be
  built near jobs centers, given the new capacity that a rail system will bring.
  As the housing supply increases to meet demand, prices will fall.  Meanwhile,
  Angelenos who choose to live further out in more affordable areas won't have
  to face hellish car commutes, finally getting hugely improved commuter rail
  options. (But make no mistake, the main purpose of a rail system won't be to
  encourage more sprawl, but rather to allow more Angelenos to be able to have
  and afford housing closer to job centers.)



  <br><br>



  Angelenos' transportation costs will be dramatically decreased as public
  transit becomes widely adopted, freeing up family budgets to be better able to
  afford housing in the first place.



  <br><br>



  Not to mention, with a fully built out subway/light rail system and ample
  commuter rail options Los Angeles will be a dramatically more livable place,
  with faster mobility and improved environmental quality. Bikeable and walkable
  communities will support public health goals.



  <br><br>



  In the meantime, we will have make a big impact on income and employment
  issues, too, by creating hundreds of thousands of wellpaying construction jobs
  over the decades leading up to 2050.  (LAEDC notes that the less ambitious
  Measure R construction will create 409,080 jobs with labor income of $24.9
  billion over its thirty year period http://bit.ly/14mznJk).



  <br><br>



  In short, Los Angeles will be a livable region. Angelenos will actually be
  able to get around quickly and easily, access ample new housing options, and
  have a dramatically improved quality of life.
