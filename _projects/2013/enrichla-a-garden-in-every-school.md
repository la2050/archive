title: EnrichLA A Garden in EVERY School!
indicator: ' Environmental Quality'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >+
  Our idea is simple:  A Garden in EVERY School.






  Over the last 2 years EnrichLA has installed gardens of all types in schools
  throughout Los Angeles County, from the West Side of Los Angeles to the San
  Gabriel Valley.  We will continue our work, building more gardens in schools
  throughout Los Angeles, focusing on lowincome and underserved neighborhoods.






  School gardens benefit students and communities in a variety of ways.  The
  most immediate impact for these children is that after our school garden
  build, students have instant access to green outdoor spaces.  Areas that were
  formerly unused parking lots or asphalt slabs are now transformed into lush
  and inviting gardens.  






  In addition to improved aesthetics, these outdoor spaces can, over time,
  impact the health and wellness of children and their surrounding community. 
  Air quality will be improved, leading to a lower cancer risk from air
  toxicity, and an increased exposure to the natural world will lead to a higher
  level of environmental stewardship.  With this new exposure and education,
  students will learn how to implement changes in their daily life that reduce
  waste, energy consumption, and pollution.  The gardens also act as catalysts
  to show students just how versatile, delicious, and fun healthy food can be,
  developing positive attitudes toward healthy food and increasing consumption
  of those foods.  The startling obesity statistics in Metro Los Angeles alone
  demonstrate a strong need for this kind of program.


What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >+
  In less than two years as a designated nonprofit organization, EnrichLA has
  built over 35 school gardens.  These gardens range from 1 acre farms, to
  wildlands schoolyard habitats, to reading gardens, or small edible raised
  beds.  Our school gardens are inexpensive.  They are built on a shoestring
  budget using the power of community volunteers to fuel these massive
  transformations.






  In addition to building school gardens, we have also provided “Home and Garden
  Economics” programs at many of these schools.  With this program, our garden
  stewards plant seedlings with students and provide regular maintenance to the
  garden.  Once these fresh fruits and vegetables are ready to be harvested,
  students prepare healthy snacks in their outdoor kitchen.  Throughout this
  process students are learning about science, lifecycles, composting, the
  importance of recycling, and they are developing a handson relationship to the
  source of their food.  






  We have seen middle school students enthusiastically exclaim that beets are
  their new favorite vegetable.  In surveys, students demonstrated that after
  the garden program they not only ate more fruits and vegetables, but also had
  more fruits and vegetables available to them in the home, suggesting that the
  impact goes further than just the classroom.  At one school, the edible school
  garden program was the catalyst for a new “environmental magnet” program and
  has been credited as one key component in the improvement of overall test
  scores on the campus.  


Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >+
  EnrichLA has partnered with organizations such as Whole Foods Markets, Gay for
  Good, Fox Gives, Kaiser Permanente, The Office of Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa,
  Tree People and others to build school gardens and provide school garden
  programming throughout Los Angeles.  






  We will continue to nurture these partnerships and seek out additional
  collaborators who share our goal of enriching the lives of children and
  contributing to a healthier, happier Los Angeles.


Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  There are both short and long term evaluations that will take place in order
  to determine the success and necessary revisions to our project.






  In the short term, we will survey students and staff before and after their
  involvement in the garden.  We will track changes in access to fresh, healthy
  foods, the amount of fruits and vegetables consumed per day, attitudes toward
  environmental responsibility, as well as time spent in the garden or in
  outdoor classroom settings.






  We will also collect and analyze data from sources such as the LA County
  Department of Public Health to determine the long term positive effects of
  school garden education, by evaluating changes in obesity and diabetes rates,
  and improvement in air quality and access to parks.






  Success would mean more children having access to green outdoor spaces, and
  more teachers utilizing these spaces for classes.  Success would be an
  improvement in health due to increased consumption of fruits and vegetables
  and a healthier attitude toward overall wellness.  
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
  Our project will benefit Los Angeles by bringing edible gardens into schools. 
  These gardens cheer up communities, improve campus morale, and act as outdoor
  classrooms.  For many students, these school gardens are their only access to
  green, outdoor spaces in their neighborhood.  By improving the environmental
  quality of their surroundings, children are more likely to succeed.  We have
  seen firsthand how access to edible gardens can improve test scores and
  community involvement.






  Additionally, these gardens address the serious problem of obesity and obesity
  related diseases among our residents.






  According to the CDC, 1 in 3 children born in 2000 will contract diabetes in
  their lifetime. If that child is either Hispanic or Black, the odds of this
  happening is increased to 1 in 2. In response to the staggering childhood
  obesity statistics, the Center for Disease Control states that:






  "Schools play a particularly critical role by establishing a safe and
  supportive environment with policies and practices that support healthy
  behaviors.  Schools also provide opportunities for students to learn about and
  practice healthy eating and physical activity behaviors"






  Our school gardens directly address this issue, not by forcing children to eat
  healthy food, but by encouraging them through access and education.


What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >+
  For EnrichLA, success would be defined as a healthier, happier Los Angeles. 
  Children in the most urban, asphalt covered areas of Los Angeles would have
  access to green, outdoor spaces.  They would grow up learning about healthy,
  natural foods, and they would have access to these foods not only in the home,
  but in the classroom as well.  They would be inspired to learn about the
  natural world not forced.  This education would lead to improved health, test
  scores, and a sense of community and environmental responsibility. 






  Currently, 1.6 million children in Los Angeles County do not have access to
  parks.  Our school gardens change that, and in 2050 our goal would be for all
  children, particularly those in lowincome, at risk and underserved
  neighborhoods of Los Angeles, to have access to green outdoor spaces.  These
  spaces enrich the minds and bodies of children, their families, and the
  community as a whole.
