title: Transforming Lives One Show at a Time
indicator: Arts & Cultural Vitality
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >+
  CRE Outreach is a nonprofit performing arts organization that helps atrisk
  youth, the visually impaired, and military veterans in greater Los Angeles
  overcome their challenges through the creation of original works. Our programs
  actively engage the most underserved individuals, empowering them to live
  better lives and successfully navigate through today’s society. 






  Programming



  Our Changing Perceptions program provides visually impaired youth, teens and
  adults with essential lifeskills through the performing arts.  Through this
  program nonverbal students become vocal, participants confidently navigate a
  stage and move through space, and casts learn to work as a team towards a
  common goal. Theatre by the Blind, the country’s only theater troupe composed
  entirely of blind adult actors, provides participants with a constructive and
  creative forum to confront their challenges while informing the public and
  changing misconceptions about the capabilities of the blind.  Creative Youth
  Theatre provides atrisk youth with performing arts programs at underfunded
  schools and community centers. Students’ explore their own hopes and struggles
  to create original stories focused on themes such as bullying, racism, peer
  pressure, and selfesteem. Heroes’ Stories is a performing arts program with
  New Directions at the V.A. that gives military veterans a safe environment to
  voice their own heroic stories and experiences through theatre. Through these
  innovative performing arts programs, CRE Outreach is “Transforming Lives, One
  Show at a Time.”


What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  In the past two years, CRE Outreach has become a fixture within the Inglewood
  Unified School District serving over 100 atrisk youth with afterschool
  programs, doubled our audiences for local productions, expanded our donor
  database by over 15%, and been able offer stipends to our Theatre by the Blind
  actors for the first time. Our seventh Theatre by the Blind production,
  Private Eyes, completed a successful sixweek run in April 2012. An audience
  favorite, the show was prominently featured in the Los Angeles Times and other
  local publications (see attached press).  In addition, we have forged a strong
  relationship with the Braille Institute and the Junior Blind of America to
  develop and execute artsbased programming in the Los Angeles area serving
  approximately 200 visually impaired participants. CRE Outreach has also become
  the parent company for Outreach Through the Arts, at the Santa Monica Music
  Center, which provides over 80 underserved youth with scholarships for
  instrument lessons and music instruction. Most recently, we have developed a
  partnership with the Veterans Affair’s New Directions program to implement
  “Heroes’ Stories” — a performing arts residency that gives a voice to our
  nations brave service members helping to honor and empower them through
  theatre.
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-

  Outreach Through the Arts, at the Santa Monica Music Center, which provides
  underserved youth with scholarships for instrument lessons and music
  instruction. Additionally, this fall we have started theatre programs at the
  VA, titled Heroes’ Stories to help returning war veterans cope with PTSD and
  other related issues through theatre.
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >+
  Participants will selfselect an item from processfolios to include in an
  oncamera interview highlighting the important aspects of their journey and a
  personal evaluation of the program as a whole. CRE Outreach staff will combine
  these interviews (with the permission of all parties involved) with video of
  rehearsals as well as the final performance to create a minidocumentary about
  the program that will include items from the students’ processfolios,
  photographs, and footage from the program. A copy of the DVD as well as a
  written final report will be made available to participants, their families,
  and the schools. 






  The effectiveness of our program is documented in the final report and
  measured through participation data including creativity journals, dialogue
  note cards between participants and instructors and process folios, teacher
  evaluation forms, and informal observations. CRE Outreach staff will collect
  these materials from class instructors and use it to track student’s
  individual achievements as well as document the impact that exposure to the
  arts has in a child’s development and or/an individuals life. These assessment
  tools and results will then be used in future public and private grant
  proposals.


How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  By working in the greater Los Angeles community, on stage and in schools,
  using the medium of theatre, CRE Outreach confronts many challenges that
  atrisk youth and the disabled community face. Our work provides a constructive
  and creative forum for participants to bring issues to the forefront and let
  their voice be heard.  Our programs actively engage the most underserved
  individuals to live better lives and empower them to successfully navigate
  through today’s society.
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  Success would include Los Angeles embracing the theater community not only in
  terms of its inherent entertainment value, but also recognizing that the
  performing arts have transformative capabilities; the power to change atrisk
  youth into service oriented caretakers for the elderly and responsible
  stewards of their physical surroundings. In 2050 Los Angeles will be the
  epicenter of empowerment for disabled individuals to receive resources,
  opportunities for selfexpression, and meaningful employment. And in
  partnership with the VA, the Los Angeles performing arts community will help
  veterans successfully transition from combat into society.
