title: Transforming Lives One Show at a Time
project_summary: >-
  In the past two years, CRE Outreach has become a fixture within the Inglewood
  Unified School District serving over 100 at-risk youth with after-school
  programs, doubled our audiences for local productions, expanded our donor
  database by over 15%, and been able offer stipends to our Theatre by the Blind
  actors for the first time. Our seventh Theatre by the Blind production,
  Private Eyes, completed a successful six-week run in April 2012. An audience
  favorite, the show was prominently featured in the Los Angeles Times and other
  local publications (see attached press).  In addition, we have forged a strong
  relationship with the Braille Institute and the Junior Blind of America to
  develop and execute arts-based programming in the Los Angeles area serving
  approximately 200 visually impaired participants. CRE Outreach has also become
  the parent company for Outreach Through the Arts, at the Santa Monica Music
  Center, which provides over 80 under-served youth with scholarships for
  instrument lessons and music instruction. Most recently, we have developed a
  partnership with the Veterans Affair’s New Directions program to implement
  “Heroes’ Stories” – a performing arts residency that gives a voice to our
  nations brave service members helping to honor and empower them through
  theatre.

    CRE Outreach specializes in original play creation with at-risk youth,
    veterans and blind youth, teens, and adults. As one of the few performing
    arts organizations providing access to theatre arts for visually impaired
    students within the greater Los Angeles area, CRE Outreach is unique its
    mission. Our productions bring audiences together to learn about these
    populations and empower participants to overcome their challenges. Our goal
    is to educate the public and change perceptions about the capabilities of
    disabled individuals while empowering participants to build confidence and
    self-esteem.
  vision: >-
    Success would include Los Angeles embracing the theater community not only
    in terms of its inherent entertainment value, but also recognizing that the
    performing arts have transformative capabilities; the power to change
    at-risk youth into service oriented caretakers for the elderly and
    responsible stewards of their physical surroundings. In 2050 Los Angeles
    will be the epicenter of empowerment for disabled individuals to receive
    resources, opportunities for self-expression, and meaningful employment. And
    in partnership with the VA, the Los Angeles performing arts community will
    help veterans successfully transition from combat into society.
