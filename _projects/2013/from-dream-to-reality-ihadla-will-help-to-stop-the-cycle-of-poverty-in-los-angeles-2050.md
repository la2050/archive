  From Dream to Reality: IHADLA Will Help to Stop The Cycle of Poverty in Los
  Angeles 2050
indicator: ' Education'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  <p>IHADLA sponsors entire grade levels of children from underperforming
  schools in lowincome, crimeridden areas of our city and provides them with the
  most longterm, comprehensive program of its kind in Los Angeles. Regardless of
  disability, all children are welcomed. The prime component of our program is
  academic achievement. For ten years, from third to twelfth grade, in both
  afterschool and summer programs, our “Dreamers” receive math and language arts
  instruction that not only better prepares them for California Standardized
  Testing, but also assures that they have the academic foundation required to
  perform at an accredited fouryear university. Parents/guardians are also
  provided with workshops on strategies that best prepare their child for
  academic success.</p>


   


  <p>To accompany academic instruction, IHADLA provides college and career
  preparedness programming, including college site visits, SAT Prep workshops,
  and monthly lectures by professionals from a wide variety of careers. IHADLA
  also provides a variety of cultural enrichment opportunities which include
  engaging, informative field trips, arts and music courses and community
  service. Our objective is to expose Dreamers to enriching experiences outside
  of their neighborhoods that will reinforce their desire to achieve.</p>


   


  <p>IHADLA is known as a “whole life” program because academic help, while
  crucial to success, does not guarantee the solid foundation needed to
  withstand negative external influences. Therefore, IHADLA partners with mental
  health providers to provide both group and individual counseling to any
  Dreamer that requires it. Dreamers also have mentors and tutors who act as
  positive adult role models and provide critical oneonone time that most do not
  receive at home. Sex education is also an important part of our programming,
  as teen pregnancy remains a pervasive problem in the communities we serve.
  During their high school years, Dreamers participate in the “Baby, Think It
  Over” program, in which they are given lifelike infant dolls that require
  round the clock attention, coupled with sex education materials provided by
  Planned Parenthood. As our students are with IHADLA for over ten years with
  the same staff, they consider IHADLA “like family”, and are open with them
  about the trials in their life and relationships. These factors combined have
  kept teen births in the program incredibly low throughout our 25 year
  history.</p>


   


  <p>Upon high school graduation, each Dreamer receives a college scholarship to
  the accredited university or trade school of their choice. IHADLA represents
  the most comprehensive, longterm program available for lowincome children in
  Los Angeles County.</p>


   


  <p>IHADLA currently serves 297 students in four active program sites, which
  were chosen across Los Angeles to ensure that we are creating the most
  widespread impact possible. The numbers of children and adults positively
  affected by IHADLA is far greater than just the number of Dreamers, for our
  programs not only impact the students themselves, but their parents, siblings,
  peers and community members.</p>


   


  <p>The following statistics encapsulate the need of our newest class of
  Dreamers at 99th Street Elementary School in Watts. The data exemplifies the
  types of needs of our other current program sites in Inglewood and Boyle
  Heights have as well:</p>



  <p>*43% English Learner population.</p>



  <p>*97% percent are from severely economically disadvantaged homes, including
  many that live in governmentsubsidized housing (projects). The 99th Street
  Elementary school in Watts is a Title 1 school.</p>



  <p>*41% of the parents of Dreamers have not attained their GED; almost none
  have attended a single day of college.</p>



  <p>*A significant portion of these students are under the jurisdiction of the
  dependency court system in Los Angeles, meaning they are in a foster care, a
  group home, or live with a nonparental guardian.</p>



  <p>*Within the past six months, 263 violent crimes have been committed in the
  Watts community, an area of only two square miles. Gang activity is on high,
  and many of the parents in our programs are members themselves.</p>


   


  <p>IHADLA is unique, not only in its comprehensive nature and duration, but
  also due to its contract with each school district, giving IHADLA the ability
  to act as a powerful liaison between school district officials and parents,
  teachers, and school administrators alike.</p>
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  <p>As an organization, we have changed the lives of over 1,000 students in LA
  thus far by guiding them diligently through their academic careers and
  exposing them to enriching experiences which motivate them to attend college.
  Our results speak for themselves: Of our most recent class, 94% have graduated
  from high school, and 96% of those are in college. This more than doubles the
  average graduation rates that typically characterize these depressed areas.
  Programwide, 97% percent of Dreamers report that IHADLA is like a “second
  family” to them and Ninetyeight percent of Dreamers feel that their mentor
  will be there for them “no matter what” and can trust them with their
  problems.</p>






  <p>Additionally, in 2011, IHADLA received the FBI Director’s Community
  Leadership Award for outstanding service to the community. Only one
  organization nationally is honored each year. We were thereafter able to forge
  a partnership with the FBI, and were able to match many of our Dreamers with
  FBI mentors. </p>






  <p>Each of our current classes has achievements from this year which exemplify
  the success of our program overall:






  In 2002, IHADLA adopted an entire grade level of almost 150 first grade
  students from Murchison Elementary School. Almost all of these students lived
  in the Ramona Gardens Projects in East LA, and many still do. These Dreamers
  are now on the eve of their high school graduation. Eightythree percent of our
  graduating Dreamers from this class will be attending college, and that number
  will grow next year when our second year seniors graduate as well. Colleges
  that Dreamers will be attending include: UC Irvine, UC Santa Barbara, UC San
  Diego, USC, UCLA, Stanford University, Ithaca University, a host of Cal States
  throughout California, and many, many more.  






  Adopted back to back in 2006 and 2007, IHADLA has two grades of Dreamers in
  Inglewood. This year, we are proud to report that these middleschool Dreamers
  are performing better than their peers on the California English Language
  Development Test. Seventyone percent of Dreamers were rated as “early
  advanced” or “advanced”, compared with only 39% of their peers. These Dreamers
  continue to flourish academically, with 66% improving their grade point
  averages this year overall. Despite turbulence within the Inglewood school
  district, the majority of our Dreamers have above a 3.0 GPA, and many of those
  below are Dreamers in our special education program.






  Our newest group of third grade Dreamers have not only melted our hearts, but
  inspired our organization as a whole. These children come from extraordinary
  circumstances, including domestic violence, familial gang membership, and
  unbelievable scenarios of poverty. Despite it all, these children are well on
  their way to becoming the future leaders of our society. Over the course of
  IHADLA’s first six months of programming, these Dreamers went from 32% only
  passing their quarterly assessments to 62% at advanced/proficient level.</p>
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  IHADLA has partnered with mental health service providers Amanecer and Didi
  Hirsch to provide psychological counseling to our young Dreamers. An
  astounding 97% of students in our Watts class come from economically
  disadvantaged homes, and 30% are in the Dependency Court System, meaning
  Foster Care, Group Homes, or in the care of a nonparent guardian. Dreamers are
  now provided with group and oneonone therapy sessions, including artistic
  programs which offer Dreamers the opportunity to express themselves through
  different mediums. We partner with a host of organizations and companies that
  provide everything from physical fitness courses to organizations like The
  Story Project, which guides Dreamers through their own filmmaking project.
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  <p>The academic progress of Dreamers is measured consistently through teacher
  relationships, report cards, and CST scores. IHADLA staff regularly monitors
  homework completion and submission, and all Program Coordinators are
  responsible for completing Program Monthly Reports which detail events of the
  previous month and track the achievements and areas of needed improvement with
  specific students. These reports consistently monitor the effectiveness of the
  program.</p>  






  <p>Additionally, IHADLA undergoes external evaluations every two to three
  years, and tracks statistics on grades, attendance, involvement in crime and
  drugs, pregnancies and familial discord through individual meetings, school
  records, and mentor reports.  </p>






  <p>IHADLA believes in full transparency, and welcomes all queries by its
  supporters.</p>






  <p>How IHADLA Measures and Defines Success:</p>






  <p>Dreamers Achieve Academic Success



  1. Dreamers are “ontrack” with enough credits to graduate from high school



  2. Dreamers are enrolled in appropriate courses for college entrance
  requirements



  3. Each Dreamer’s average daily attendance rises or is at the level at which,
  in the combined judgment of their school and IHADLA, he/she are achieving
  their full potential. Dreamers will also indicate on annual survey that they
  feel connected to their school and intend to graduate



  4. Dreamer’s GPA rises or is at the level at which, in the combined judgment
  of their school and IHADLA, he/she are achieving their full potential



  5. Dreamers will perform better than their comparison population on reading,
  writing and math CST



  6. Dreamers will graduate high school/receive GED at a rate greater than the
  LAUSD nonDreamer population



  7. Dreamers will pursue postsecondary education at a rate greater than the
  LAUSD nonDreamer population</p>






  <p>Dreamers Develop Emotional Intelligence



  1. Dreamers will report increased selfconfidence, perseverance, conflict
  resolution skills, and social competence



  2. Dreamers will report that they have a caring and trusting relationship with
  IHADLA staff</p>






  <p>Dreamers Develop Master Life Skills



  1. Dreamers report that they are making positive life choices and are engaging
  in healthy risktaking



  2. Dreamers report that they have learned skills for meaningful employment



  3. Mentors report on whether Dreamers have learned skills for meaningful
  employment or not. </p>



  <p>Dreamers Develop CollegeReadiness Skills



  1. Dreamers enter college at a higher rate than nonDreamer LAUSD graduates



  2. Dreamers report they are more knowledgeable about college admission
  requirements</p>
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
  This past year, LAUSD shortened the academic school year, laid off hundreds of
  qualified teachers, cut almost all afterschool, art and music programs, and
  reduced funding dramatically. Ironically, students have then been asked to
  perform higher on California Standardized Tests. Our Dreamers already contend
  with substandard living, nutrition, and educational facilities. IHADLA aims to
  fill these gaps and beyond with the understanding that a better life for these
  children means a better life for all of us. 






  IHADLA specifically chooses different program sites throughout Los Angeles so
  that we make the most impact possible across the county. By providing the
  children with the greatest needs with IHADLA’s “wholelife” programming, we are
  dramatically increasing their opportunity to succeed. Higher graduation rates,
  and healthier lifestyles, mean that they are less likely to rely upon the
  public welfare system and also less likely to cause crime, which leads to a
  decreased burden on the prison system in California. High school dropouts are
  four times more likely to be unemployed as those who have a college degree,
  and are more likely to require federal assistance. They are also more likely
  to be delinquents, as eightytwo percent of prisoners in America are dropouts. 






  Most of all, by supporting IHADLA, Angelenos are making an investment in the
  future of our city. The future innovators of science, technology, social
  science, etc. are standing before us at 99th Street Elementary School in
  Watts. They have extraordinary potential. However, most of their parents never
  finished high school, and even fewer still know what it’s like to earn above
  the poverty line. Who, if not IHADLA, will lead these children towards towards
  their dreams? To turn our backs on them would be to turn our backs on our own
  community, and our economy, and all of our futures. 


What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >+
  <p>Our ultimate dream, of course, would be for our organization’s mission to
  become obsolete. However, the problems that we are combating in these
  communities are generational, and only provide for as many students to enter
  the program as funding makes possible. In the year 2050, with support The “I
  Have a Dream” Foundation — Los Angeles could be adopting multiple classes each
  year at schools in need. With the appropriate funding, IHADLA could
  potentially serve up to thousands more children. Every group of Dreamers
  sponsored by IHADLA means we are changing the income and educational level of
  hundreds, not just our Dreamers, but their parents, family members, peers, and
  ultimately, their communities. We will therefore see a decrease in public aid
  and uncrowded prisons, as well as safer streets for us all. We will see a drop
  in teen birth rates and a dramatic increase in high school graduation rates.
  </p>






  <p>We will also see our Dreamers become the heads of our companies, the
  leaders of change, and the innovators of society. We, as a foundation, are
  ambitious and hopeful about the future. We see the struggle and triumph of our
  Dreamers on an everyday basis, and know that we can make dreams possible for
  so many more. After 25 years of service to Los Angeles County, we have gained
  a reputation for taking children deemed “without hope” and turning them into
  college graduates. </p>






  <p>IHADLA wants to keep fulfilling our promise to the Los Angeles by finding
  new ways to alleviate the everchanging challenges facing our youth in the
  highcrime, violent neighborhoods we focus on. This generous grant has the
  potential to get us there.</p>
