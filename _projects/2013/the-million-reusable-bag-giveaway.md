title: The Million Reusable Bag Giveaway
indicator: ' Environmental Quality'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >+
  California Greenworks, in partnership with Green Vets LA and Homeboy
  Industries, proposes the “Million Reusable Bag Giveaway” pilot program, to
  create and distribute 25,000 reusable shopping bags (with an overall goal of 4
  million) in lowerincome Los Angeles neighborhoods as the City’s plastic bag
  ban goes into effect.  Using informational inserts in the bags, we will spread
  the word about costsaving and environmentallyurgent energy efficiency and
  water conservation programs.  






  This program will positively impact at least four LA 2050 indicators by:






  1) immediately increasing stable Income & Employment of two of LA’s most
  atrisk populations: homeless, disabled and returning combat veterans, and
  formerlygang involved and recentlyincarcerated men and women; 






  2) Educating lowincome and traditionally difficulttoreach populations about
  new energy efficiency and water conservation measures introduced by the Los
  Angeles Department of Water & Power (LADWP), thereby helping reduce their
  monthly utility and weekly shopping bills…






  3) …while improving Environmental Quality by reducing greenhouse gas emissions
  in terms of electricity and water use, and reducing the use of singleuse
  shopping bags which often become blight and part of the litter stream in our
  neighborhoods and waterways;






  4) and building a bridge of Social Connectedness between two previously
  disparate communities who share similar challenges around assimilation and
  acceptance into the mainstream Los Angeles society.






  The Million Reusable Bag Giveaway pilot project will employ Green Vets LA
  veterans in making 25,000 reusable shopping bags, and Homeboy Industries in
  silkscreening them, and will engage City Councilmembers, Los Angeles
  neighborhood councils, faithbased and community groups and environmental
  organizations such as the Clean Seas Coalition, the Green LA Coalition and the
  LA Climate Action Coalition in distributing the bags.  






  Once the pilot project is up and running, California Greenworks will continue
  the “Million Bags” fundraising process by involving local businesses (such as
  grocery stores, local utilities such as LADWP, sports teams such as the
  Dodgers, film studios, et al) to sponsor the project in exchange for their
  logos being imprinted upon durable shopping bags that will be used weekly by
  Los Angeles consumers for the five to ten year expected life of these durable
  shopping bags.  






  The ultimate goals of the Million Bag project are to provide a free reusable
  shopping bag, with energy efficiency and water conservation tips within it, to
  every one of the nearly four million residents in the City of Los Angeles, to
  substantially reduce electricity and water use across the City, reduce
  greenhouse gas emissions as the threat of climate change looms, and, in the
  process, to create a sustainable sewing and silk screening industry staffed by
  atrisk populations who will benefit from a growing trend of plastic bag ban
  ordinances spreading across California, the United States and the world.


What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >+
  California Greenworks has established itself as one of the premier
  environmental groups within South Los Angeles. California Greenworks directs
  its efforts to the atrisk communities in South Los Angeles.  Our projects
  revolve around environmental education programs, revitalization of urban open
  spaces to reduce blight, promotion of water quality and advocacy for green
  jobs.  






  The following are a few of California Greenworks programs and initiatives:





   EarthFestLA — Annual Concert for the Environment & Expo — Beginning in 2006, California Greenworks produced its first environmental fair in the City of Watts, then called “South LA Earth Day Festival.”  Since then, EarthFestLA has become an annual, familyoriented event focusing on environmental education and community health awareness.  Website for EarthFest LA 2012: www.EarthFestLA.org.





   Communitybased Energy Efficiency Water Outreach Program (through the Los Angeles Department of Water & Power)  California Greenworks received a 2013 $45,000 grant to do an extensive grassroots outreach effort to spread information about energy efficiency and water conservation to LADWP customers in South Los Angeles.





   Compton Creek Watershed Pollution Prevention Partnership Program — This firstofitskind watershed pollution prevention partnership is a twoyear project sponsored by the Regional Water Quality Control Board, geared to raise community awareness of watershed pollution prevention.  Polluted water and trash flowing into storm drains is the greatest danger to the wellbeing of birds and animals that live in the coastal wetlands drained by Compton Creek Watershed.  The partnership provides a low impact solution by installing storm drain catch basins and screens preventing trash from entering the waterways.





   Water Links! Urban Youth Watershed Education Program — An environmental education program that links the urban watershed to the ocean, targeted to the 5th grade student.  This 4week pilot program raises awareness for environmental stewardship, pollution prevention, and water conservation within the urban communities. 


Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  Green Vets LA and Homeboy Industries have both committed to working with
  California Greenworks in this effort.  






  Green Vets LA is a nonprofit organization that is working with Veterans from
  the West Los Angeles VA Hospital to provide job training and work therapy to
  injured and noninjured and even homeless Veterans in a supportive
  environment.  This program offers a wide variety of job trainings, including
  sewing reusable bags, and has helped Veterans successfully reenter the work
  force upon returning from military service.     www.greenvetsla.com






  Homeboy Industries serves highrisk, formerly ganginvolved men and women with a
  continuum of free services and programs, and operates seven social enterprises
  that serve as jobtraining site
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >+
  The successful implementation of the whole of this pilot project will be
  measured in several ways:






  1) The successful creation and distribution of 25,000 reusable shopping bags
  to lowerincome communities for their use before the City’s plastic bag ban
  goes into effect, likely in early 2014.  Having free shopping bags will allow
  lowerincome families to shop without worrying about being impacted by having
  to pay themselves for reusable bags (in the absence of free, singleuse plastic
  bags, or having to pay the 10 cent charge for paper bags, as mandated by the
  City’s singleuse bag ordinance).






  2) A successful pilot project will allow the incremental growth of this effort
  from 25,000 bags to 4 million bags.






  3) California Greenworks will request a baseline electricity and wateruse
  reading from the LA Department of Water and Power in the City Council
  districts in which the bags will be distributed before and then after the bags
  (and therefore the energy efficiency and water conservation information) are
  distributed in order to track the effectiveness of the educational materials. 
  Additionally, LADWP will be able track the number of customers who apply to
  their energy efficiency programs as a result of this pilot project to gauge
  its effectiveness toward the City’s overall energy efficiency goals.






  4) The most important matrix by which California Greenworks will gauge the
  success of this program is the additional Vets and formerlygang involved men
  and women who are hired to work at good, wellpaying jobs in these supportive
  work environments.


How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
  BUILD EMPLOYMENT AMONG ATRISK COMMUNITIES






  Both Green Vets LA and Homeboy Industries provide good jobs in a supportive
  atmosphere to atrisk communities which need strong support.  The Million Bag
  Giveaway pilot project will provide predictable workflow for both companies to
  make 25,000 reusable bags for 3 months as California Greenworks raises funds
  toward the eventual goal of giving away 4 million reusable bags, one for each
  resident of the City of Los Angeles.  A fullyfunded order for 4 million bags
  will then provide financial backing to create a stronger infrastructure for
  both companies to increase hiring from these two worthy atrisk communities, so
  that they might build out their reusable bag manufacturing infrastructure and
  prepare them to fill more orders in the future as plastic bag ban trend
  spreads from city to city across the United States. 






  PROVIDE FREE REUSABLE GROCERY BAGS TO LOWERINCOME COMMUNITIES AS PLASTIC BAGS
  ARE PHASED OUT






  The Million Bag Giveaway pilot project builds upon the environmental success
  of the City’s ban on singleuse plastic bags by providing, free of charge,
  reusable bags for lowerincome residents, so that everyone can celebrate the
  success of cleaning blight out of our neighborhoods and waste out of our
  rivers and oceans without being concerned about the 10 cent fee that will be
  charged at the grocery store for the use of singleuse paper bags.  






  HELP COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE BY SPREADING ENERGY EFFICIENCY






  LADWP has announced its historic goal to move the City of Los Angeles
  completely off of coal power by 2025 and dramatically reduce the City’s
  greenhouse gas emissions well below 1990 levels.  To accomplish that
  effectively, the City must meet robust energy efficiency goals among all
  communities.  The project provides an educational pamphlet distributed within
  each bag, giving residents information and tips on LADWPfunded energy
  efficiency and water conservation programs, so that the environmental benefits
  to the City can be even larger while simultaneously shrinking utility bills
  for customers.  






  BUILDING BRIDGES BETWEEN COMMUNITIES






  The Million Bag Giveaway Project will build a bridge of Social Connectedness
  and shared goals between two previously disparate communities who share
  similar challenges around assimilation and acceptance into mainstream society.


What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >+
  In the best case scenario, by the year 2050, there will be no need for Green
  Vets LA and Homeboy Industries, as there will be no war, no gang violence and
  we will have become welleducated in being much improved stewards of our
  planet.






  However, falling short of that, the successful outgrowth of the Million Bag
  Giveaway Project, by 2050, will result in Green Vets LA and Homeboy Industries
  both spreading into all fifty states, supporting combat veterans and formerly
  ganginvolved men and women in a myriad of employment opportunities, which in
  turn help benefit the environment.  






  Energy efficiency and water conservation has increased to a level in 2050
  where we live in a zero waste community.  We use only clean technologies to
  power our homes and vehicles and thrive using only the water we collect that
  falls from the sky.  Climate change has been mitigated to the point that its
  effects are only scarcely noticeable.






  Singleuse items, such as plastic bags, will have become a thing of the past,
  as, by 2050, all members of society have learned the environmental
  consequences of their daily habits and purchasing choices.  






  The current members of these two organizations — Green Vets LA and Homeboy
  Industries — who may only now, in 2013, be assimilating into the productive
  workforce, will grow into leadership roles, help lead both organizations and
  our great country into the year 2100.

    answer: "In the best case scenario, by the year 2050, there will be no need for Green Vets LA and Homeboy Industries, as there will be no war, no gang violence and we will have become well-educated in being much improved stewards of our planet.\r\n\r\nHowever, falling short of that, the successful outgrowth of the Million Bag Giveaway Project, by 2050, will result in Green Vets LA and Homeboy Industries both spreading into all fifty states, supporting combat veterans and formerly gang-involved men and women in a myriad of employment opportunities, which in turn help benefit the environment.  \r\n\r\nEnergy efficiency and water conservation has increased to a level in 2050 where we live in a zero waste community.  We use only clean technologies to power our homes and vehicles and thrive using only the water we collect that falls from the sky.  Climate change has been mitigated to the point that its effects are only scarcely noticeable.\r\n\r\nSingle-use items, such as plastic bags, will have become a thing of the past, as, by 2050, all members of society have learned the environmental consequences of their daily habits and purchasing choices.  \r\n\r\nThe current members of these two organizations – Green Vets LA and Homeboy Industries – who may only now, in 2013, be assimilating into the productive workforce, will grow into leadership roles, help lead both organizations and our great country into the year 2100.\r\n"
