On an annual basis, we provide affordable housing, community services, community organizing, and wealth building services to over 2,000 residents. ELACC’s track record includes leveraging over $135 million of investment to the Eastside and housing over 1,000 residents in safe, habitable, and affordable housing throughout East Los Angeles. We mobilize a Community Organizing base of over 1,300 members annually, and have helped over 3,000 families to purchase their first homes, avoid foreclosure, establish savings, and build and sustain wealth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ELACC, community residents, and partner organizations have now come together to form the “Los Angeles Street Vending Campaign” to push the Los Angeles City Council to implement a policy that will provide a licensing process for vendors to sell foods without the fear criminalization.  The coalition has already conducted numerous town halls throughout Los Angeles neighborhoods where there is a high concentration of street vendors, in order to begin educating and engaging them on what the City’s first comprehensive vending policy could look like.</p>"

  Organization Name: >-
    East LA Community Corporation (ELACC) in partnership with Leadership for
    Urban Renewal Now (LURN)
  Indicator: ' Income & Employment'
  brief: "<p>Though recognized for its street food scene, Los Angeles is the only city of the 10 largest cities in the US that does not have formal regulations around street vending. Street vending, as a widespread practice, is simply illegal. Vendors can be fined up to $1,000, be jailed for 6 months, and have their carts—their entire business—confiscated. This is bad for business, bad for customers, and bad for families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>East LA Community Corporation (ELACC) and Leadership for Urban Renewal Now (LURN) will expand income and employment for low-income Angelenos and small business owners through the Los Angeles Street and Sidewalk Entrepreneurs  Initiative or LA-SSEI.  LA-SSEI will promote partnerships between  businesses and street vendors, start a venture capital fund that will provide working capital that will help support the growth of LA’s approximately 10,000 street vendors.  By 2050, LA will decriminalize street and sidewalk vending integrate them into LA’s social and cultural life, providing Angelenos with affordable, convenient and healthy retail options. A developed pathway to success will allow a vendor to begin as an off-street market entrepreneur and end up as a fixed stall, certified farmers market retailer, or commercial tenant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Politically, the support of established businesses is crucial to bring a policy change to the city. In this next year, the Street and Sidewalk Entrepreneurs Initiative will:</p>\r\n \r\n<p>1. Build support for street vendors among brick-and-mortar businesses along major commercial corridors in Los Angeles;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Bring street vendors and local businesses to the same table in order to better support one another through listening and stakeholder sessions such as ELACC’s Policy con Pan Dulce and LURN’s PLUS2 conferences;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Create a venture capital fund for low-income entrepreneurs to allow street vendors to grow and further legitimize their businesses.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>With these pieces in place, we expect to see:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. A City-wide policy that supports street vendors, created in partnership with existing brick-and-mortar businesses who would benefit from street vendors  marketing their businesses to pedestrians and passersby;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Closer coordination between businesses and vendors that increase profits for all involved;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. A “Venture Capital for the ‘Hood” program that provides street vendors technical assistance and equity that allows them to scale their businesses and grow their bottom line.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>ELACC and LURN believe this is a tremendous opportunity for the City to transform low-income business corridors and lift thousands of people out of poverty and unemployment through profits from vending as a source of household income. An IBISWorld Market Research Report identifies street vending as a national growth industry, with $1 billion in revenue and 8.4% annual growth between 2008 and 2012. Street vending creates employment and income opportunities for immigrant families with little start-up capital and low prospects in the formal sector. For many, street vending is the only way to legitimately take care of their families, break the cycle of poverty, and meet the demand for food in these communities.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The process for becoming licensed as a street vendor in Los Angeles is close to impossible to complete since there are many agencies to deal with and too many requirements that close opportunities to vendors. The best way to improve income and employment for these families is to give them the tools they need to legitimize their activities in the underground economy and formalize their businesses. And the only way to achieve this legislative change is through a ‘win-win’ partnership between street vendors and established brick-and-mortar businesses.</p>"
  budget explanation: "Outreach and Engagement for Small Business Owners:\r\nTo engage businesses around street vending issues, ELACC and LURN will hire an outreach team of organizers as temporary staff to create concentrated bursts of outreach to non-food businesses in commercial corridors across LA in May and June of 2013. This time-sensitive push will create momentum for the street vendor campaign and establish first contact with long-term allies\r\nOutreach Push 1 (May 14th to May 31st) - $12,000\r\nLead Organizer ($3,000 monthly) - $3,000\r\n4 Organizers ($3,500 to $4,000 each monthly) - $8,000\r\nOutreach Push 2 (June 1st to June 30th) - $19,000\r\nLead Organizer ($3,000 monthly) - $3,000\r\n4 Organizers ($3,500 to $4,000 each monthly) - $16,000\r\nIn order to ensure the team’s effectiveness, the outreach team will work with expert political consultants to train the team and develop their outreach strategy.

Also training on general finance issues and development of ideas for partnerships with brick-and-mortar business.\r\nInvestment into the Loan Fund (June – December) - $25,000 \r\nUse $25,000 as seed money to start the fund and leverage it to attract further investment.\r\nDesign of Loan Fund Collateral & Printing- $2,000\r\nIncludes logo, graphics, and outreach materials.\r\nOutreach to Potential Clients (borrowers) - $10,000\r\nStreet vendor outreach to raise awareness of the fund, develop potential clients, and recruit 25-50 vendors to attend mixers with small business owners.\r\n\r\nLegal & Consulting Fees for the Development of the Fund - $5,000\r\nNecessary procedural work to acquire all documentation and certification with governmental entities to be approved as a lender."
  description: "Street vendors are already an iconic part of Los Angeles’ national reputation for culinary excellence and innovation, as well a daily part of city residents’ lives. In low-income communities, almost everyone has a neighbor, a friend, or a family member who at least supplements their family income with street vending.\r\n \r\nAlthough street vending as an occupation has existed for hundreds of years, it is often part of the underground economy, which means that it is a highly insecure line of work. Currently vendors are under constant threat from both the city and petty crime, which vendors cannot stop out of fear of police persecution. In addition, because vending is illegal, the city makes no tax or licensing revenue from it and pays fees for policing and storing confiscated equipment.\r\n \r\nThrough partnerships with small business, vendors gain a powerful ally in exchange for helping to revive and adorn empty LA sidewalks in front of those businesses. The creation of a forum that brings formal and informal businesses together will strengthen both sectors through idea-sharing and collaboration. Vendors will increase the capacity of their businesses and be more effectively able to fill market niches by understanding the existing business landscape.\r\n \r\nIn 2050, legalized vending will have moderate costs in the short-term from creating and enforcing new licensing, but will lead to tremendous long-term economic growth benefits. Entrepreneurs on the street operating will no longer fear legal repercussions and for the first time will be able to sustain and grow their businesses, invest more in equipment, and build meaningful relationships with small businesses. And, for those who wish, a legal system for street vendors will create an entrepreneurial pathway for them to grow into their own brick-and-mortar businesses in the City—businesses with a high likelihood of re-investing locally. Additionally, the whole City will benefit from new income from licensing and tariffs.\r\n\r\nDeveloping of a venture capital fund to support street vendors will allow the City to invest in its low-income entrepreneurs. The fund will provide capital for vendors to buy new products, certified equipment, hire staff, or even pay for permits. Financial support will not be provided as a loan, but as an investment, in exchange for a minority stake in the business and a commitment from the vendor to work with a “board member” or “advisor” to support the growth of the business over time. At an agreed upon point, the vendor will have the opportunity to “buy out” the minority stake sold; money that will be re-invested into the fund to support other entrepreneurs. \r\n \r\nUltimately, support for vending has the potential to organically bring investment streams into the poorest areas and communities of LA. It will allow enterprising individuals to lift themselves up by their own bootstraps, creating their own jobs to provide for their families."
