title: 'LA Open Acres: Transforming Empty Space Through Collaboration and Empowerment'
indicator: ' Environmental Quality'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  <p>Many communities in Los Angeles are severely lacking in access to parks and
  open space. This directly impacts the quality of our environment through
  deteriorated air and water quality, more noise, reduced tree cover, etc.
  Studies have also shown that a lack of parks and open space has substantial
  indirect effects on public health by reducing opportunities for children and
  adults to participate in outdoor activities. </p>






  <p>Yet, while LA is poor in parks, we are rich in vacant and underutilized
  lands, many of which are located in the very neighborhoods that are most in
  need of new parklands. The LA Open Acres Project aims to capitalize on this
  opportunity by facilitating the transformation of the city’s thousands of
  acres of vacant and underutilized lands into vibrant green, public places that
  contribute to the health and wellbeing of local residents.</p>






  <p>Currently, these vacant, underutilized, and often abandoned empty spaces
  are eyesores, places for illegal dumping, and focal points for crime. Local
  residents who have the motivation to transform these spaces face an
  intimidating morass of overlapping bureaucracies and unclear ownership
  structures. Identifying appropriate opportunities for new green space
  development is extraordinarily difficult and requires a high degree of
  expertise. Furthermore, there is no comprehensive process in place for
  expanding access to open space through community participation in the
  assessment and stewardship of vacant land.</p>






  <p>The LA Open Acres Project will break this cycle of neglect by decoding the
  system, creating a shared platform that neighbors can use to support each
  other in administrative advocacy for access to these spaces and to share
  expertise. </p>






  <p>At the heart of the LA Open Acres Project is an online platform that
  provides community members with clear pathways to transforming vacant and
  underutilized parcels into green, open spaces. This platform will catalog and
  distribute information about vacant lots, alleys, red fields, surface parking
  lots, easements, flood control channels, and other underutilized spaces and
  allow neighbors and park and open space advocates to access this information
  in an attractive, graphical format and connect with each other to begin the
  process of working with the City and other landholders to develop projects.
  </p>






  <p>The Project will begin by creating a database of these empty spaces in the
  City. Information will be collected using GIS data from city departments, as
  well as fieldwork led by community resident researchers, satellite imagery,
  and existing webbased mapping software. This information will inform the
  development of an interactive online map that allows users to identify vacant
  and underutilized parcels and obtain all relevant publiclyavailable data about
  them. Users of the website will also be able to tag and upload photos of
  vacant lots in their neighborhoods, allowing the data to be verified,
  expanded, and continually updated. Profiles of empty spaces and land parcels
  will include their location, size, lot number, and ownership, as well as
  images and any information about current efforts to organize a project around
  the parcel. Furthermore, users of the website will be able to find and connect
  with others interested in working on particular sites, and access public and
  private resources dedicated towards transforming them.</p>






  <p>The online database and interactive map will be a powerful tool that allows
  neighbors, community organizations, nonprofits, neighborhood councils, and
  other stakeholders to work together to develop plans for converting empty
  spaces to places full of opportunity such as urban gardens, small parks, and
  other muchneeded community open space uses. The online tools will be prepared
  in partnership with 596 Acres, a nonprofit that is on the forefront of
  building online organizing platforms for land access advocates and
  facilitators.</p>






  <p>As a key complement to the webbased tools, the LA Open Acres Project will
  work to translate these online resources into action on the ground, building
  upon the ongoing efforts of Community Health Councils and the Coalition for an
  Active South Los Angeles (CASLA) that CHC convenes and facilitates. This
  component of the Project will be adapted from 596 Acres’ tactics in New York 
  putting signs directly on the fences of vacant municipal properties with
  pathways, contact information and a way for inspired passersby to connect with
  one another. CHC in partnership with a diverse network of advocates will
  connect local stakeholders with the online tools and with nonprofits and
  public agencies that can help them develop projects. The organized groups
  facilitated by the website and CHC will work in solidarity and partnership
  learning from each other’s challenges and successes. </p>
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  CHC: Since 1992 CHC has led coalitions in South LA and beyond to advocate for
  healthy communities. CHC utilizes data, experience and the expertise of
  community stakeholders to shape policy, systems and environmental change. 
  This approach provides an exceptional opportunity for people of different
  backgrounds to build a shared understanding of the degree of health justice
  issues, allowing them to examine the root causes of health inequity. Among
  many accomplishments CHC has:



  Trained hundreds of community members to conduct neighborhood level
  assessments to document food and physical activity inequities in South LA
  leading to local policy change.



  Led the adoption of the Baldwin Hills Oilfield Community Standards District,
  South LA Fast Food Interim Control Ordinance and Fast Food Moratorium.



  Convened the ReImagining Empty Space Tour and Summit: http://goo.gl/UOogw



  Negotiated a community benefits agreement in response to the removal of 253
  trees due to the transport of the Space Shuttle Endeavor. The agreement
  creates a South LA Open Space & Tree Master Plan. 






  CLab, Columbia University Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and
  Preservation: CLab’s research focuses on techniques for communication about
  urban environments. Work has included a vision plan for an estuary in South
  Korea, awarded the firstprize by the South Korean Urban Design Institute and a
  masterplan for Chengdu, China. CLab’s projects use mapping as a means of
  uncovering hidden potentials in cities. A current project maps new,
  unacknowledged ‘neighborhoods’ of New York, based on commonalities and
  underlying networks of support. CLab’s project ‘Locating the Middle Class in
  New York City’ considers several possible criteria for defining the ‘middle
  class’ in the city, and uses GIS data to map their footprints. In researching
  aging urban populations, CLab has produced maps of NORCs (naturally occurring
  retirement communities) in NY, and is currently partnering with Tongji
  University in Shanghai to develop strategies and research for housing the
  aging middle class in China. 






  596 Acres: In 2011, 596 Acres launched an online interactive map of all the
  publicly owned vacant land in Brooklyn, NY. Since then they have expanded the
  map by compiling and releasing data for Manhattan, Queens, and the Bronx.
  Workshops and online networking tools have been created to help communities
  share knowledge with each other and build relationships with decisionmakers.
  In the short time since the project launched, 8 new sites have been granted
  official status as communityrun open spaces, and 6 additional sites have been
  preapproved by city agencies who have jurisdiction over them. Currently 105
  groups citywide are in the process of campaigning for access to public land.
  With the recent release of vacant land data for the Bronx, the 596 Acres has
  mapped 1394 vacant lots in 4 of the 5 boroughs and is currently working on
  data for Staten Island. Spanish versions are also available.
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  Partners in the project will include Community Health Councils, Columbia
  University’s CLab, and the 596 Acres Project. CHC will work with local
  organizations and city departments to ensure that the project will be of
  benefit to the communities it is intended to serve, and is informed by the
  knowledge, skills, and expertise of local community residents. CLab will
  contribute spatial analysis techniques, including GISbased mapping, as well as
  graphic design for the website and educational materials. 596 Acres will
  develop the core functionality of the website, drawing on its previous work
  mapping vacant land and creating online organizing tools in New York
  (596acres.org).
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  <p>The LA Open Acres Project will provide a muchneeded source of accurate
  information that will help stimulate debate about vacant land in LA, and allow
  citizens to cooperate to transform specific parcels. The project will compile
  information on vacant land, assemble it into a comprehensive database, and
  make it accessible to the public through an online interface, thereby allowing
  communities to learn about land resources in their neighborhoods. Although the
  ultimate goal will be to radically improve the number of acres of parkland per
  resident in the City and reduce the number of residents who live more than a
  quarter of a mile away from the nearest park, given the short term of the
  grant, the success will be measured based on data that would indicate the
  extent to which the Project is laying the foundation that will lead toward
  those goals, including:</p>






  <p>       How many land parcels were reclaimed for public open space using the
  website’s tools and how much total acreage is made available for public
  use?</p>






  <p>       How many vacant lots are identified that were previously
  uncounted?</p>






  <p>       How many people used the website to find vacant land and share
  information with their neighbors?</p>






  <p>       How many organizations used the data in furthering their
  mission?</p>






  <p>       How many urban greening projects were launched through the
  website?</p>






  <p>These metrics are easy to obtain through communication with community
  participants and site usage data, and will help establish a baseline for
  evaluating the project’s success. But there are other, longerrange effects
  that may be harder to immediately quantify, including:



  <p>       How many people use the open spaces that are created, and what is
  the benefit to their physical and mental health?</p>






  <p>       How are local economies benefited by opening vacant land to public
  uses like green markets and farming?</p>






  <p>       How is the information useful to city departments in shaping plans
  for open space in LA?</p>






  <p>       How does the project promote a public dialogue about open space and
  land use?</p>






  <p>       How does access to open space empower communities over multiple
  generations?</p>






  <p>These effects will be the best indication of the project’s success, and
  should be possible to anticipate using shorterterm metrics like the number of
  land parcels that the website’s users are monitoring and organizing to
  transform.</p>
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
  Los Angeles is one of the most parkpoor cities in America: the Trust for
  Public Land found that only 30% of the LA’s four million residents live within
  one quarter mile of a park compared with 80% and 90% in Boston and New York,
  respectively. The shortage of parks and open space is most acute in Los
  Angeles poorest neighborhoods, exacerbating a chronic disease and obesity
  epidemic that is closely tied to poor diet and lack of exercise. Given the
  critical need for parks, open space, and urban agriculture and the city’s
  limited ability to develop these resources on its own, LA Open Acres partners
  are spearheading an effort to create a new model that capitalizes on the
  opportunities that exist in vacant and underutilized land throughout the City,
  particularly in the areas most in need. 






  No public agency or nongovernmental entity in LA has comprehensively
  identified where and how much of these vacant lands exist and the potential
  for new green space. Limited access to this information disables efforts to
  repurpose these sites into better serving uses. However, there is no lack of
  imagination on the part of community members. Using networks fostered by CHC
  for over 20 years, LA Open Acres together with communities will use this
  newlyavailable and accessible information to push forward exciting and
  innovative open space projects that are in tune with particular local
  neighborhood conditions, needs and visions. LA Open Acres can provide an
  opportunity for Angelenos to serve as a national model spurring innovation and
  dramatic change by organizing and advocating for better use of empty and
  underutilized space. The data, maps, and online networking tools provided by
  the LA Open Acres Project will allow community members to find information
  about available empty spaces, and connect with their neighbors to start
  organizing, in cooperation with landholders, for access to unused parcels. By
  providing information and resources, the project will allow others to work
  together to launch initiatives to transform the local environment.
  Furthermore, this data will inform the development of multiple planning
  processes occurring in the city now, including the development of a South LA
  OpenSpace Master Plan. This project will allow more people to access
  information, connect with decisionmakers, and participate in the planning
  process in their neighborhoods to create healthier neighborhood
  environments.  


What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  <p>LA Open Acres Project will put in motion a process through which, by 2050,
  every resident in Los Angeles will enjoy the environmental and health benefits
  of having parks and open space within an easy walking distance from their
  home. By 2050, neighbors working together throughout Los Angeles will create
  hundreds of community gardens, miniparks, urban farms, green markets, plazas,
  playgrounds, and other public spaces. LA Open Acres will serve as the catalyst
  and the wayfinding tool for these realizations of local desires  the key to
  unlocking the potential of acres of underutilized land. </p>






  <p>Local and regional air and water quality will be improved, neighbors will
  have more and more opportunities to interact with one another, the heat island
  effect will be reduced, unsightly and hazardous abandoned properties will be
  eliminated, and ecological sanctuaries for people and wildlife will become a
  feature in every part of the City. </p>






  <p>People will be healthier, thanks to access to parks for exercise and
  relaxation and gardens for growing fresh, organic food. People meeting in
  these small healthy places will incubate more projects and organize locally 
  the formerly desolate acres will be catalysts for improvements in public
  safety, social connectedness, and employment across the region. </p>






  <p>This vision of the future begins by giving communities the information and
  tools they need to reclaim and repurpose these underutilized spaces.</p>

    explanation: ''
    answer: "<p>Many communities in Los Angeles are severely lacking in access to parks and open space. This directly impacts the quality of our environment through deteriorated air and water quality, more noise, reduced tree cover, etc. Studies have also shown that a lack of parks and open space has substantial indirect effects on public health by reducing opportunities for children and adults to participate in outdoor activities. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet, while LA is poor in parks, we are rich in vacant and underutilized lands, many of which are located in the very neighborhoods that are most in need of new parklands. The LA Open Acres Project aims to capitalize on this opportunity by facilitating the transformation of the city’s thousands of acres of vacant and underutilized lands into vibrant green, public places that contribute to the health and well-being of local residents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, these vacant, underutilized, and often abandoned empty spaces are eyesores, places for illegal dumping, and focal points for crime. Local residents who have the motivation to transform these spaces face an intimidating morass of overlapping bureaucracies and unclear ownership structures. Identifying appropriate opportunities for new green space development is extraordinarily difficult and requires a high degree of expertise. Furthermore, there is no comprehensive process in place for expanding access to open space through community participation in the assessment and stewardship of vacant land.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The LA Open Acres Project will break this cycle of neglect by decoding the system, creating a shared platform that neighbors can use to support each other in administrative advocacy for access to these spaces and to share expertise. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the heart of the LA Open Acres Project is an online platform that provides community members with clear pathways to transforming vacant and underutilized parcels into green, open spaces. This platform will catalog and distribute information about vacant lots, alleys, red fields, surface parking lots, easements, flood control channels, and other underutilized spaces and allow neighbors and park and open space advocates to access this information in an attractive, graphical format and connect with each other to begin the process of working with the City and other landholders to develop projects. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Project will begin by creating a database of these empty spaces in the City. Information will be collected using GIS data from city departments, as well as fieldwork led by community resident researchers, satellite imagery, and existing web-based mapping software. This information will inform the development of an interactive online map that allows users to identify vacant and underutilized parcels and obtain all relevant publicly-available data about them. Users of the website will also be able to tag and upload photos of vacant lots in their neighborhoods, allowing the data to be verified, expanded, and continually updated. Profiles of empty spaces and land parcels will include their location, size, lot number, and ownership, as well as images and any information about current efforts to organize a project around the parcel. Furthermore, users of the website will be able to find and connect with others interested in working on particular sites, and access public and private resources dedicated towards transforming them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The online database and interactive map will be a powerful tool that allows neighbors, community organizations, non-profits, neighborhood councils, and other stakeholders to work together to develop plans for converting empty spaces to places full of opportunity such as urban gardens, small parks, and other much-needed community open space uses. The online tools will be prepared in partnership with 596 Acres, a non-profit that is on the forefront of building online organizing platforms for land access advocates and facilitators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a key complement to the web-based tools, the LA Open Acres Project will work to translate these online resources into action on the ground, building upon the ongoing efforts of Community Health Councils and the Coalition for an Active South Los Angeles (CASLA) that CHC convenes and facilitates. This component of the Project will be adapted from 596 Acres’ tactics in New York - putting signs directly on the fences of vacant municipal properties with pathways, contact information and a way for inspired passers-by to connect with one another. CHC in partnership with a diverse network of advocates will connect local stakeholders with the online tools and with nonprofits and public agencies that can help them develop projects. The organized groups facilitated by the website and CHC will work in solidarity and partnership learning from each other’s challenges and successes. </p>"

    answer: "Los Angeles is one of the most park-poor cities in America: the Trust for Public Land found that only 30% of the LA’s four million residents live within one quarter mile of a park compared with 80% and 90% in Boston and New York, respectively. The shortage of parks and open space is most acute in Los Angeles poorest neighborhoods, exacerbating a chronic disease and obesity epidemic that is closely tied to poor diet and lack of exercise. Given the critical need for parks, open space, and urban agriculture and the city’s limited ability to develop these resources on its own, LA Open Acres partners are spearheading an effort to create a new model that capitalizes on the opportunities that exist in vacant and underutilized land throughout the City, particularly in the areas most in need. \r\n\r\nNo public agency or non-governmental entity in LA has comprehensively identified where and how much of these vacant lands exist and the potential for new green space. Limited access to this information disables efforts to re-purpose these sites into better serving uses. However, there is no lack of imagination on the part of community members. Using networks fostered by CHC for over 20 years, LA Open Acres together with communities will use this newly-available and -accessible information to push forward exciting and innovative open space projects that are in tune with particular local neighborhood conditions, needs and visions. LA Open Acres can provide an opportunity for Angelenos to serve as a national model spurring innovation and dramatic change by organizing and advocating for better use of empty and underutilized space. The data, maps, and online networking tools provided by the LA Open Acres Project will allow community members to find information about available empty spaces, and connect with their neighbors to start organizing, in cooperation with landholders, for access to unused parcels. By providing information and resources, the project will allow others to work together to launch initiatives to transform the local environment. Furthermore, this data will inform the development of multiple planning processes occurring in the city now, including the development of a South LA Open-Space Master Plan. This project will allow more people to access information, connect with decision-makers, and participate in the planning process in their neighborhoods to create healthier neighborhood environments.  \r\n"

      Partners in the project will include Community Health Councils, Columbia
      University’s C-Lab, and the 596 Acres Project. CHC will work with local
      organizations and city departments to ensure that the project will be of
      benefit to the communities it is intended to serve, and is informed by the
      knowledge, skills, and expertise of local community residents. C-Lab will
      contribute spatial analysis techniques, including GIS-based mapping, as
      well as graphic design for the website and educational materials. 596
      Acres will develop the core functionality of the website, drawing on its
      previous work mapping vacant land and creating online organizing tools in
      New York (596acres.org).

    answer: "<p>The LA Open Acres Project will provide a much-needed source of accurate information that will help stimulate debate about vacant land in LA, and allow citizens to cooperate to transform specific parcels. The project will compile information on vacant land, assemble it into a comprehensive database, and make it accessible to the public through an online interface, thereby allowing communities to learn about land resources in their neighborhoods. Although the ultimate goal will be to radically improve the number of acres of parkland per resident in the City and reduce the number of residents who live more than a quarter of a mile away from the nearest park, given the short term of the grant, the success will be measured based on data that would indicate the extent to which the Project is laying the foundation that will lead toward those goals, including:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-       How many land parcels were reclaimed for public open space using the website’s tools and how much total acreage is made available for public use?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-       How many vacant lots are identified that were previously uncounted?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-       How many people used the website to find vacant land and share information with their neighbors?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-       How many organizations used the data in furthering their mission?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-       How many urban greening projects were launched through the website?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These metrics are easy to obtain through communication with community participants and site usage data, and will help establish a baseline for evaluating the project’s success. But there are other, longer-range effects that may be harder to immediately quantify, including:\r\n<p>-       How many people use the open spaces that are created, and what is the benefit to their physical and mental health?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-       How are local economies benefited by opening vacant land to public uses like green markets and farming?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-       How is the information useful to city departments in shaping plans for open space in LA?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-       How does the project promote a public dialogue about open space and land use?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-       How does access to open space empower communities over multiple generations?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These effects will be the best indication of the project’s success, and should be possible to anticipate using shorter-term metrics like the number of land parcels that the website’s users are monitoring and organizing to transform.</p>"

    answer: "CHC: Since 1992 CHC has led coalitions in South LA and beyond to advocate for healthy communities. CHC utilizes data, experience and the expertise of community stakeholders to shape policy, systems and environmental change.  This approach provides an exceptional opportunity for people of different backgrounds to build a shared understanding of the degree of health justice issues, allowing them to examine the root causes of health inequity. Among many accomplishments CHC has:\r\n-Trained hundreds of community members to conduct neighborhood level assessments to document food and physical activity inequities in South LA leading to local policy change.\r\n-Led the adoption of the Baldwin Hills Oilfield Community Standards District, South LA Fast Food Interim Control Ordinance and Fast Food Moratorium.\r\n-Convened the Re-Imagining Empty Space Tour and Summit: http://goo.gl/UOogw-\r\n-Negotiated a community benefits agreement in response to the removal of 253 trees due to the transport of the Space Shuttle Endeavor. The agreement creates a South LA Open Space & Tree Master Plan. \r\n\r\nC-Lab, Columbia University Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation: C-Lab’s research focuses on techniques for communication about urban environments. Work has included a vision plan for an estuary in South Korea, awarded the first-prize by the South Korean Urban Design Institute and a masterplan for Chengdu, China. C-Lab’s projects use mapping as a means of uncovering hidden potentials in cities. A current project maps new, unacknowledged ‘neighborhoods’ of New York, based on commonalities and underlying networks of support. C-Lab’s project ‘Locating the Middle Class in New York City’ considers several possible criteria for defining the ‘middle class’ in the city, and uses GIS data to map their footprints. In researching aging urban populations, C-Lab has produced maps of NORCs (naturally occurring retirement communities) in NY, and is currently partnering with Tongji University in Shanghai to develop strategies and research for housing the aging middle class in China. \r\n\r\n596 Acres: In 2011, 596 Acres launched an online interactive map of all the publicly owned vacant land in Brooklyn, NY. Since then they have expanded the map by compiling and releasing data for Manhattan, Queens, and the Bronx. Workshops and online networking tools have been created to help communities share knowledge with each other and build relationships with decision-makers. In the short time since the project launched, 8 new sites have been granted official status as community-run open spaces, and 6 additional sites have been pre-approved by city agencies who have jurisdiction over them. Currently 105 groups city-wide are in the process of campaigning for access to public land. With the recent release of vacant land data for the Bronx, the 596 Acres has mapped 1394 vacant lots in 4 of the 5 boroughs and is currently working on data for Staten Island.

    answer: "Through the Coalition for an Active South Los Angeles (CASLA), CHC works with many of the groups that are currently advocating for expanding access to open space in South Los Angeles. Members include community- and faith-based organizations; open space and mobility developers, stakeholders, and advocates; academic and educational institutions; local, state and often federal regulatory and administrative entities working together with community members to find solutions to the underlying systemic and institutional barriers to health. Having already convened a broad range of organizations through CASLA, CHC Is well-positioned to work with these groups and others to instigate a public discussion on the future of vacant land in the city, and the information and online organizing tools created by the LA Open Acres Project will be an asset to these organizations. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the online platform will be a publicly available resource, allowing anyone interested in learning more about vacant land in LA to find information, join the discussion, and cooperate with others to make plans for vacant parcels, and work with landholders to reclaim land for public uses. By making the information available and working with community organizations to make use of it, the LA Open Acres Project will allow more people and groups to participate in the planning of open space in their communities, and will serve as a launch pad for their future initiatives.\r\n"

    answer: "<p>LA Open Acres Project will put in motion a process through which, by 2050, every resident in Los Angeles will enjoy the environmental and health benefits of having parks and open space within an easy walking distance from their home. By 2050, neighbors working together throughout Los Angeles will create hundreds of community gardens, mini-parks, urban farms, green markets, plazas, playgrounds, and other public spaces. LA Open Acres will serve as the catalyst and the way-finding tool for these realizations of local desires - the key to unlocking the potential of acres of underutilized land. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Local and regional air and water quality will be improved, neighbors will have more and more opportunities to interact with one another, the heat island effect will be reduced, unsightly and hazardous abandoned properties will be eliminated, and ecological sanctuaries for people and wildlife will become a feature in every part of the City. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>People will be healthier, thanks to access to parks for exercise and relaxation and gardens for growing fresh, organic food. People meeting in these small healthy places will incubate more projects and organize locally - the formerly desolate acres will be catalysts for improvements in public safety, social connectedness, and employment across the region. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This vision of the future begins by giving communities the information and tools they need to reclaim and re-purpose these underutilized spaces.</p>"
