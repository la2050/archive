title: 'daKAT House:  A Public Housing Project for musicians.'
indicator: ' Housing'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >+
  I am offering a scenario that impacts two of the eight suggested indicators;
  housing and arts/cultural vitality.






  In 2013, many artists cannot afford to live in the “artist district”, because
  the rent is so high.






  Please follow me as I speak as if my idea is already a reality: 






  In downtown Los Angeles, there is a 128unit building that is filled with
  musicians, and people who promote the music they generate.  22 floors of
  cats.  The building has a house jazz orchestra, a house symphonic orchestra,
  and daKAH Hip Hop Orchestra.  There are also dozens of offshoot groups.  Every
  month, they give a concert that costs five bucks to see.  Everyone who lives
  there teaches privately for ten bucks a lesson.






  There is a concert hall, and a cafÃ© on the ground floor.  The sound of tenant
  recitals fill the air.  Every performance is recorded, filmed, and streamed
  around the world.






  In exchange for $400.00/month rent, each musician provides a tenday/month
  commitment to rehearsal, performance, recitals, private lessons, and recording
  sessions.  In the course of a year, the people who live there generated four
  hundred CDs worth of recorded music.






  House of daKAH cats.



  daKAT House.






  Like I said, this proposal follows the "Twobird/Onestone" theory of social
  policy.  As we get deeper into the 21st century, it's getting more important
  to find ways to cover a coupla bases with one paycheck.  We impact two
  indicators by providing affordable housing to a focused group of people who
  will enrich the musical landscape of the city.









  PUBLIC HOUSING PROJECT FOR MUSICIANS






  The first step in my idea is to partner with an existing nonprofit housing
  organization, (or an individual who can create one), that can apply to HUD on
  our behalf.  As a fulltime musician, I am talking in vague terms about laws
  and regulations that I know nothing about. I am confident that someone with
  knowledge of this terrain will be able to navigate through the various housing
  programs that are available through the federal government that would support
  this approach to housing.






  At first glance, an ArtistBased public housing project could exploit a
  combination of Section 8 tenant status, a Section 107 Community Development
  Block Grant, Section 3 Economic Opportunities, Section 221 Multifamily Rental
  Status and Section 213 Cooperative Housing programs.






  The process of finding musicians to live in the building is a combination of
  an orchestra audition, applying for an O1 Artist Visa and an application for
  Section 8 housing.  We aren’t looking for rich people who want to pay cheap
  rent.  We are looking for musicians, at any phase in their career, who need a
  break on the rent.






  In addition to financial need, each tenant must demonstrate exceptional
  ability on their instrument.  Each tenant is also required to stay in L.A.
  during the term of their lease at daKAT House.  Short trips are negotiable,
  but the purpose is to build a house orchestra, of reliable cats.   


What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >+
  I am applying as a composer with an idea about housing.  I have no
  achievements in the housing sector.  At this point, it’s an achievement to
  make my rent payment on time.  






  My achievements have all happened on a stage, in a classroom or in a recording
  studio.






  As a composer/conductor, my friends and I started daKAH Hip Hop Orchestra in a
  nightclub in 1999.  We started it with no money.






  By 2001, we had made it to Grand Performances.  In 2002, we made a CD, no
  record label.  In 2004, we were onstage at Disney Concert Hall, San Francisco
  and in Vegas.  In 2005, we were at Hollywood Bowl, South By Southwest, New
  Orleans during Jazzfest.






  The movie “HIP HOP MAESTRO” was released in 2011.  The film traces this
  journey from the street to symphony hall.  






  This is what makes me think we can pull it off.  All we had to work with was
  sheet music, and cats in chairs, learning how to play it.  After more than a
  decade, we’ve built a deep community of musicians in L.A.






  daKAT House operates with the same philosophy as daKAH Hip Hop Orchestra,
  upping the stakes by providing a cheap roof over their heads.






  As a musician, I’ve learned how to make something out of nothing.  The times
  I’ve been entrusted with resources have seen success more often than failure. 
  My strength is knowing my weakness, and finding the right people to execute
  the task.


Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >+
  For wise counsel, I will be asking for guidance from a personal friend.  He
  has a lot more money than I do, and knows how to navigate the nonprofit sector
  with ease.






  The most important person in this project is the nonprofit housing guru.  I
  have not identified this person yet. 






  The most important collaborators will be the group of musicians living in the
  building.  


Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >+
  A producer friend once said, “The tape don’t lie.”






  1Since our project has a performance and recording element, it will be as easy
  as looking at the iTunes playlist to see if we have been productive.






  2After a year, I expect to see a rise in attendance at our concerts.  After
  spending some time teaching lessons, playing gigs on a consistent basis in a
  consistent venue, and being in the neighborhood, I would expect the people
  living nearby to start wandering in.






  3Over time, I would expect to see a rise in the number of musicians living in
  L.A.  With L.A. getting press coverage as a city that supports its artists,
  word will most likely travel to other artists in other cities.






  4On the macro level, I would expect to see a federal HUD program that treats
  artists housing the same way it treats tribal housing, and provides incentives
  to other cities to adopt these sorts of cultural reservations of real estate
  for artists.






  5—I would hope to see an increase in interests towards instrumental music from
  young people.  I started playing in public school, because there was someone
  down the hall who could put a saxophone in my hands.  It was as simple as
  access.


How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
  Fundamentally, it would provide affordable housing to a large group of
  people.  Even better, this large group of people happen to be outstanding
  musicians, who will dedicate the term of their leases to creating a musical
  ensemble with the other tenants.  And, even better than that, this group of
  musicians is engaged in the surrounding community, providing affordable
  instrumental music lessons to those who wish to learn.






  Every month sees a performance of the house ensembles.  These performances are
  recorded, and broadcast over the internet.  A major factor in the promotion
  and exploitation of the recordings will be the fact that the musicians are
  living communally in subsidized housing provided through the city and federal
  government.






  A program like this presents the city as a patron to its own artists.  This
  type of reputation can serve as a magnet for other artists to relocate to our
  city, contributing to the economy of L.A. 






  Since the performances are affordable, the house ensembles present a way in
  which the workingclass community can discover symphonic music in a live
  environment. Since tickets to the L.A. Phil can get pricey, the opportunity to
  see live symphonic music is limited to those who have disposable income. 
  daKAT House provides this opportunity to those on a fixed budget.






  This project provides a cadre of music teachers at a cutrate price to those
  who would like to learn.  The location of the Echo Park property is in close
  enough proximity to the VAPA Magnet High School in downtown L.A.  There are
  also several elementary and middle schools in the area that serve a
  workingclass community.  Discounted local music lessons could provide an
  option that may not have been available for some of these families.


What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >+
  Every council district in the city of L.A. has at least one multiunit
  apartment complex reserved for musician residence.  Each of these buildings
  have their own house ensembles.  Each of the buildings has a unique flavor. 
  Building owners recruit musicians like star ballplayers.  The variety of the
  recordings speaks to the variety of people in L.A.  There is a baseline
  quality of musicianship around the city.






  The State of California has provided an incentive to building owners to adopt
  their properties to cultural reservation use.  All buildings zoned for
  cultural reservation are taxexempt. 






  Federal HUD programs now include a section called “Cultural Reservation
  Housing”, where property owners are given tax breaks and reimbursements in
  exchange for providing cheap rent to artists.






  The recordings generated by daKAT House went around the world, and musicians
  started moving to L.A. at an unusual rate.  Pretty soon, it was like Vienna
  1790 on steroids.  The presence of so many musicians in one place created an
  environment of musical excellence.  You had to really be good to call yourself
  a musician in L.A. 2050.






  After thirty years of daKAT House, there were over ten thousand CDs, and led
  several musical revolutions contained wherein.  The musicians at daKAT House
  became a legendary tribe, and were revered by musicians all over the globe.

    answer: "Every council district in the city of L.A. has at least one multi-unit apartment complex reserved for musician residence.  Each of these buildings have their own house ensembles.  Each of the buildings has a unique flavor.  Building owners recruit musicians like star ballplayers.  The variety of the recordings speaks to the variety of people in L.A.  There is a baseline quality of musicianship around the city.\r\n\r\nThe State of California has provided an incentive to building owners to adopt their properties to cultural reservation use.  All buildings zoned for cultural reservation are tax-exempt. \r\n\r\nFederal HUD programs now include a section called “Cultural Reservation Housing”, where property owners are given tax breaks and reimbursements in exchange for providing cheap rent to artists.\r\n\r\nThe recordings generated by daKAT House went around the world, and musicians started moving to L.A. at an unusual rate.  Pretty soon, it was like Vienna 1790 on steroids.  The presence of so many musicians in one place created an environment of musical excellence.  You had to really be good to call yourself a musician in L.A. 2050.\r\n\r\nAfter thirty years of daKAT House, there were over ten thousand CDs, and led several musical revolutions contained wherein.  The musicians at daKAT House became a legendary tribe, and were revered by musicians all over the globe.\r\n"

project_summary: "I am applying as a composer with an idea about housing.  I have no achievements in the housing sector.  At this point, it’s an achievement to make my rent payment on time.  \r\n\r\nMy achievements have all happened on a stage, in a classroom or in a recording studio.\r\n\r\nAs a composer/conductor, my friends and I started daKAH Hip Hop Orchestra in a nightclub in 1999.  We started it with no money.\r\n\r\nBy 2001, we had made it to Grand Performances.  In 2002, we made a CD, no record label.  In 2004, we were onstage at Disney Concert Hall, San Francisco and in Vegas.  In 2005, we were at Hollywood Bowl, South By Southwest, New Orleans during Jazzfest.\r\n\r\nThe movie “HIP HOP MAESTRO” was released in 2011.  The film traces this journey from the street to symphony hall.  \r\n\r\nThis is what makes me think we can pull it off.  All we had to work with was sheet music, and cats in chairs, learning how to play it.  After more than a decade, we’ve built a deep community of musicians in L.A.\r\n\r\ndaKAT House operates with the same philosophy as daKAH Hip Hop Orchestra, upping the stakes by providing a cheap roof over their heads.\r\n\r\nAs a musician, I’ve learned how to make something out of nothing.  The times I’ve been entrusted with resources have seen success more often than failure.  My strength is knowing my weakness, and finding the right people to execute the task.\r\n"
