title: 'La Loma Center: Green Education Environmental Resources and Job Training '
indicator: ' Income & Employment'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  Our idea is to design, build, and operate a community center for the
  advancement of sustainable landscaping and permaculture jobs through green
  education, environmental resources, urban agriculture demonstrations and local
  food security programs.  We would use $100,000 wisely to complete our center,
  ramp up programming, and open our doors to the broader public.  We currently
  are located in a 30,000+ sq. ft. property in an Enterprise Zone, an
  underserved neighborhood (food desert), formerly a historic truck mechanic. 
  For nearly six months we have been using our cash flow from La Loma to convert
  this location into a base of “postindustrial ecorenaissance.”  We have also
  formed a nonprofit, named Zanja Madre, to handle the education, training, and
  pro bono work we do for the community, schools, and institutions.  For the La
  Loma Center, we have floated names like “Sustainia” and “Ecodepot,” but most
  importantly we have the place and people to do this now.  The facilities would
  be perfect for job training, professional certification courses, events and
  even conferences.  With creative reuse of the giant garages, mechanic bays,
  and grounds, we will be able to exhibit techniques and technologies, as well
  as provide the resources for the public to mimic the cutting edge
  demonstrations.  We also have an adjunct vacant lot in LA where we demonstrate
  natural techniques on the land.






  Our idea clearly impacts nearly all of the indicators listed, however we will
  focus on income and employment after going through the rest of them. 
  Education will be improved by providing classes at various levels in
  collaboration with local schools and universities, as well as professional
  certification and job training programs.  We have active relationships with
  local high schools and community colleges, and the Art Center College of
  Design, Environmental Charter Schools, and LAUSD. 






  Environmental quality will be impacted directly by the tools and resources we
  provide.  Our jobs increase watershed awareness, irrigation conservation,
  rainwater harvesting, and planting appropriate trees.  We design, build, and
  maintain organic gardens, as well as ecological restoration projects.  We will
  demonstrate how individuals can improve their immediate surroundings through
  the landscape.  






  Health has been shown to improve through environmental quality,  practicing
  horticulture, and eating good local food.  Our facilities and programs will
  improve people’s health by getting them to improve their lifestyles and
  connections to nature and community.  Also, we are in contact with the
  director of the public health department to create the first local organic
  food commissary, hosting qualifying food trucks, food carts, and mobile
  farmers' markets.  By providing access to local organic food we will eliminate
  food deserts and improve the health of the community.






  Social connectedness is one of our primary goals at the community center,
  networking between organizations and individuals to synergize the local
  sustainability movement.  We already have become a hub for the permaculture
  world, making it feel like a small world with all of the relationships, and
  being invited to give talks at various conferences including Bioneers,
  Permaculture Convergence, Urban Ecology, and the Arboretum's Garden Show.






  Arts and cultural vitality will radiate from our center with the look and feel
  style of the place, arts exhibitions focused on land art, green building, and
  creative expression.  We are a land based organization that believes our work
  is art and culture tied to the land.  We are not your average mow and blow or
  construction contractor, we are a designbuild firm with a social mission and a
  vision for the future.  






  Moreover, La Loma provides jobs and income.  This year alone we have created
  thirty jobs with no budget allocated to job creation, simply by employing and
  training a diversity of local workers in real green projects.  We intend to
  dedicate our center to the creation of local wealth and sustainable
  livelihoods, by providing the tools and opportunities to do good for the local
  community and local environment.  We are fully confident that La Loma Center
  will become the leading place to acquire knowledge, credentials, and
  opportunities for increased incomes and job creation.  This is evident in our
  record of offering gainful employment, engaging workers' coops, and acting as
  an important stepping stone for dozens of careers.  
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  Besides our latest project at our center....  La Loma is a critical partner in
  the creation of Arlington Gardens, a three acre, awardwinning community
  garden.  We were also awarded the Green Hero Award by Environmental Charter
  Schools for the greening of their campus, which also received national
  attention as a runnerup in the White House Race to the Top contest.  We
  received the Pasadena Beautiful Golden Arrow Award for our classic terraced
  vineyard project and other frontyard gardens.  We were published on the cover
  of Landscape Contractor Magazine for our use of recycled concrete in
  beautiful, monumental projects, as well as stories in LA Times, Sunset,
  Pasadena Star, and others.  We had an acclaimed installation, the Public Fruit
  Tree Theater, at LACMA that unfortunately was replaced by "Levitated Mass." 
  We have been publicly commended by several council members for our work at
  schools and other community projects, such as Plaza Morazan (Ed Reyes), Main
  St. Elementary (Jan Perry), Pasadena Senior Center (Steve Madison).  We
  bioremediated our site, eliminating the gasoline, oil and chemicals. We are
  leaders of converting toxic chlorine pools into Natural Pools, that create
  habitat and store drinking water.  We were called upon as an emergency
  responder to the recent windstorms, and we pride ourselves as being a force of
  nature for our community.  Currently we are finishing a large Demonstration
  Garden for the Chino Basin Water District.  Marco Barrantes was formerly a
  Parks and Recreation Commissioner, as well as a member of Food Policy Council,
  he wrote a book called "Feed Your City: Urban Agriculture Food Systems."  We
  are a registered Small Business, Minority Business Enterprise, and
  prequalified for projects with LAUSD, MWD, among other major institutions.  We
  have created jobs and income during a recession, what more can you ask?
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  Education and job training partners include, but not limited to:



  The Pasadena Learning Garden.



  Flintridge Foundation. 



  City of Pasadena, Department of Public Health.



  Larry Santoyo, Earthflow. 



  Ray Cirino.






  Marco Barrantes is the President of La Loma Development Company, with Masters
  of City Planning and Landscape Architecture.  He is also a certified Arborist,
  Permaculture Designer, and Green Roof Professional.  Marco founded La Loma as
  a General A and C27 in order to do the big projects he envisions without being
  hindered by bureaucratic restrictions.  As a designer and builder, with a
  standing team of skilled workers and professional staff, we are capable of
  doing amazing projects, as is demonstrated by our website. 
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  We will evaluate our projects by the number of jobs we create, the number of
  classes we hold, the number of job trainees we certify, the number of green
  projects we design, build and maintain, the amount of income we create for our
  workers and partners, the amount of income that goes back into the community
  through our nonprofit arm, the number of members that join our community
  center and food commissary.  The results will be easy to measure and
  straightforward.  We will create good jobs, local wealth, neighborhood
  projects that can not be missed.  Typically our gardens result in greater
  environmental awareness as is measured by testimonials and wordofmouth.  It is
  easy to measure our success by the gallons of water we capture or save, the
  number of trees we plant, the pounds of food we produce, the pounds of seeds
  we store and distribute, the tons of local waste we recycle into compost,
  mulch and building materials.  By counting the number of visitors that come
  through our locations, the number of awards and publications we have received
  and will continue to win.
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  Our project will benefit Los Angeles in numerous ways as was discussed above. 
  Specifically, we will have a major impact on the creation natural parks,
  beautiful gardens, and public spaces to organize community.  LA has a shortage
  of green spaces, we solve that problem.  We will empower the community with
  information and work, hosting regular classes, community workshops, and job
  training on a variety of relevant sustainability issues.  Specific subjects
  include Arboriculture, Aquaculture, Beekeeping, Soil, Water, Seeds, School
  Composting, Compost Tea, Vermiculture, Xeriscape, Drip Irrigation, DryStacked
  Broken Concrete Terracing, Masonry, Carpentry, Metalwork, Edible Gardening,
  Food Preservation (solar dehydration, canning), Fruit Tree Pruning, Green
  Roofs, Greywater, Living Walls, Natural Building (cobb, adobe), Natural Pools,
  Permaculture, Rainwater Harvesting, Urban Agriculture, Rocket Stoves/Ovens,
  Solar Power, Conservation Remodeling, and so much more.  






  Our facilities will provide a perfect location for school field trips,
  afterschool programs, regular farmers’ market, as well as special events.  We
  will become the place to go for cutting edge information and resources to
  improve our environmental health and urban sustainability.  Designers and
  contractors will depend on us for the dissemination of ideas and supplies,
  hopefully inspiring the replication of the model.  DIY people will be
  empowered by our offerings, and commercial and institutional clients will turn
  to us for leadership in creating jobs and getting their environmental projects
  completed with beauty and integrity.  






  Los Angeles currently does not have a place like this in the entire county,
  there are many pieces to the puzzle, and we are putting them together to help
  accelerate our economic and environmental recovery.
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >+
  Success in the year 2050 will look like our city has bloomed into a green
  urban paradise, transforming from industrial decay into creative
  rejuvenation.  Our water shortages will be eliminated with a healthy
  watershed, an LA River that is vital and used for recreation and habitat. 
  Aquifers will be recharged with smart use of rainwater and graywater, while
  intelligent landscaping will reduce our needs for irrigation.  Urban
  agriculture will increase local produce, supplementing our diets while
  creating butterfly and bee habitat.  People will have meaningful work that
  improves our public health and environmental quality.  Community connectivity
  will be strengthened with regional hubs replicating our model.

    We consider most “competition” to be allies.  We actively engage non-profit
    institutions and schools that pursue similar goals.  We work with other
    landscape designers and subcontract to other contractors.  Perhaps
    competition is better defined as the structural challenges in society that
    make it difficult to do good while maintaining a livelihood and a business. 
    We have experienced the need to take on jobs just to keep our organization
    going, trying our best to drive otherwise average projects to excellent
    examples of our principles.  Sometimes we get undermined by unlicensed
    designers or illegal contractors, offering copy-cat services at impossible
    prices.  Maintaining the labor burden and overhead of our business is a
    great challenge, however, we have proven we can do this while continuing to
    grow.  We invite more competition, our goal is to have a robust local
    economy.

      result in greater environmental awareness as is measured by testimonials
      and word-of-mouth.  It is easy to measure our success by the gallons of
      water we capture or save, the number of trees we plant, the pounds of food
      we produce, the pounds of seeds we store and distribute, the tons of local
      waste we recycle into compost, mulch and building materials.  By counting
      the number of visitors that come through our locations, the number of
      awards and publications we have received and will continue to win.

      Besides our latest project at our center....  La Loma is a critical
      partner in the creation of Arlington Gardens, a three acre, award-winning
      community garden.  We were also awarded the Green Hero Award by
      Environmental Charter Schools for the greening of their campus, which also
      received national attention as a runner-up in the White House Race to the
      Top contest.  We received the Pasadena Beautiful Golden Arrow Award for
      our classic terraced vineyard project and other front-yard gardens.  We
      were published on the cover of Landscape Contractor Magazine for our use
      of recycled concrete in beautiful, monumental projects, as well as stories
      in LA Times, Sunset, Pasadena Star, and others.  We had an acclaimed
      installation, the Public Fruit Tree Theater, at LACMA that unfortunately
      was replaced by "Levitated Mass."  We have been publicly commended by
      several council members for our work at schools and other community
      projects, such as Plaza Morazan (Ed Reyes), Main St. Elementary (Jan
      Perry), Pasadena Senior Center (Steve Madison).  We bioremediated our
      site, eliminating the gasoline, oil and chemicals. We are leaders of
      converting toxic chlorine pools into Natural Pools, that create habitat
      and store drinking water.  We were called upon as an emergency responder
      to the recent windstorms, and we pride ourselves as being a force of
      nature for our community.  Currently we are finishing a large
      Demonstration Garden for the Chino Basin Water District.  Marco Barrantes
      was formerly a Parks and Recreation Commissioner, as well as a member of
      Food Policy Council, he wrote a book called "Feed Your City: Urban
      Agriculture Food Systems."  We are a registered Small Business, Minority
      Business Enterprise, and pre-qualified for projects with LAUSD, MWD, among
      other major institutions.  We have created jobs and income during a
      recession, what more can you ask?

      We consider most “competition” to be allies.  We actively engage
      non-profit institutions and schools that pursue similar goals.  We work
      with other landscape designers and subcontract to other contractors. 
      Perhaps competition is better defined as the structural challenges in
      society that make it difficult to do good while maintaining a livelihood
      and a business.  We have experienced the need to take on jobs just to keep
      our organization going, trying our best to drive otherwise average
      projects to excellent examples of our principles.  Sometimes we get
      undermined by unlicensed designers or illegal contractors, offering
      copy-cat services at impossible prices.  Maintaining the labor burden and
      overhead of our business is a great challenge, however, we have proven we
      can do this while continuing to grow.  We invite more competition, our
      goal is to have a robust local economy.

    answer: "Success in the year 2050 will look like our city has bloomed into a green urban paradise, transforming from industrial decay into creative rejuvenation.  Our water shortages will be eliminated with a healthy watershed, an LA River that is vital and used for recreation and habitat.  Aquifers will be recharged with smart use of rainwater and graywater, while intelligent landscaping will reduce our needs for irrigation.  Urban agriculture will increase local produce, supplementing our diets while creating butterfly and bee habitat.  People will have meaningful work that improves our public health and environmental quality.  Community connectivity will be strengthened with regional hubs replicating our model.  \r\n\r\n"
