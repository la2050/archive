  success: "We will evaluate the Mindful Education for LAUSD project by the quality of the working relationships: Are people sharing ideas, cooperating for the good of the project and LA2050? Are we able to work constructively and enjoyably with public education officials and city leaders? Has a university become our partner? Are teachers curious and coming to our working sessions and the Original Play Playshop? Is the result original, engaging and replicable?  Is it designed to be a working model open to the initiative and autonomy of teachers in the classroom? Ultimately success will be measured by the outcomes of the proposal writing process: (1) Does it mirror our highest intentions of designing a Mindful pedagogical approach to curriculum, instruction, assessment, teacher education AND also meet the expectations of the Common Core?  (2) Does the teacher education program teach teachers to teach in creative and playful and active ways - does it inspire them to inspire the students? (3) Does the project attract partnerships and collaborators who will speak for it at the LAUSD hearing (if we submit as a charter) (4) Does LAUSD accept the proposal and will El Rio move forward in 2014-2015 school years as an LAUSD publicly chartered school or an LAUSD pilot school? \r\n\r\n"
  Organization Name: 'El Rio Schools: MIND-FIT EDUCATION FOR THE 21ST CENTURY'
  Indicator: ' Education'
  brief: >-
    Mindfulness in education is a means to significantly improve student
    attention, enjoyment, and achievement. Our idea is to develop a prototype
    Mindful Education K-8 public school within LAUSD -  either as a charter
    school or as a pilot school.  Our aim is to develop a  prototype curriculum,
    teaching methods, methods of assessment, cognitive research data points and
    teacher education program with the aim of entering a proposal for
    consideration to the LAUSD between October and December 2013.  The resulting
    mindful education framework will  serve as a working model for continuous
    learning about the impact of mindfulness in education on student and
    community "good". 
  budget explanation: "Project Coordination - $25,000\r\nConsultants: Common Core, Special Education, ELL - $35,000 \r\nWorkshops - July Playshop with O.

    Los Angeles benefits when our public education system serves the needs of
    the 21st century: People who can initiate and create the new world of work,
    playful emotionally resilient socially aware people, and people who can
    think deeply and with imagination. These 21st century needs will be met when
    our educational system changes to one that is based on a biologically,
    psychologically, and ontologically correct concept of the human mind in
    childhood and adolescence. We call this "mind-fit" education.  Mind-fit
    education is mindful education because it enters the reality of the child.
    When the curriculum, teaching methods, and methods of assessment work in
    synchronicity with the student's developmental age and individual strengths
    and capacities learning is irresistible. Educational success, and life
    success, begins at the K-8. The Mindful Education for LAUSD project will be
    a test-bed demonstrating its value for every student and especially for
    traditionally hard-to-reach students. Part of the project will be to track
    the data-points of success - attendance, engagement, behaviour, and
    initiative as well as on traditional metrics.

    We have an ontological aversion to a negative view of competition in the
    area of improving public education in Los Angeles. In general, our approach
    to adversarial relationships are the practices of non-violent
    communication.  Beyond that, we hold that the different educational
    philosophies popping up around LA inspire mutual self-improvement and
    healthy copying.  
  vision: >-
    (1) People in LA will evaluate education in light mindfulness and the
    age-fitness of the program for children and adolescents as well as the test
    scores and social equity.  A "good" school will be a challenging, mindful,
    age-fit place where children love to go and enjoy learning and are
    successful learners. (2) Teachers in LA will have a new hope for their
    profession as creative, engaging, and powerful. (3) LAUSD schools ADA
    funding model provides at least $15,000 per year per student as opposed to
    the current $5,000.  As less funding has to go to fixing problems
    downstream, more funds will go to educating teachers in mindfulness and
    age-fit instructional capabilities. This will free up funds to go to
    autonomy in the classroom and less to minding from the top.

Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >+
  We will evaluate the Mindful Education for LAUSD project by the quality of the
  working relationships: Are people sharing ideas, cooperating for the good of
  the project and LA2050? Are we able to work constructively and enjoyably with
  public education officials and city leaders? Has a university become our
  partner? Are teachers curious and coming to our working sessions and the
  Original Play Playshop? Is the result original, engaging and replicable?  Is
  it designed to be a working model open to the initiative and autonomy of
  teachers in the classroom? Ultimately success will be measured by the outcomes
  of the proposal writing process: (1) Does it mirror our highest intentions of
  designing a Mindful pedagogical approach to curriculum, instruction,
  assessment, teacher education AND also meet the expectations of the Common
  Core?  (2) Does the teacher education program teach teachers to teach in
  creative and playful and active ways - does it inspire them to inspire the
  students? (3) Does the project attract partnerships and collaborators who will
  speak for it at the LAUSD hearing (if we submit as a charter) (4) Does LAUSD
  accept the proposal and will El Rio move forward in the 2014-2015 school years
  as an LAUSD publicly chartered school or an LAUSD pilot school?
