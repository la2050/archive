title: Creative Activist Program
project_summary: "An Incubator, Academy, & Agency, our Creative Activist Program (CAP) is a place for LA’s creative activists to turn ideas into action & for the Los Angeles community at large to become a force for change. In LA alone, we incubate, educate, & represent over 45 different media & arts projects, ranging in media types (film, multimedia, music, visual arts, & more) & focusing on our 6 core causes (human rights, youth & education, global consciousness, environment, gender equality, & health & wellness). <p>Individually, our creative activists exemplify a heightened level of social connectedness. Having identified their cause, they use a media type to address an issue & inspire action. Their work in turn demands social interaction & civic engagement, & their projects draw community involvement & local volunteerism.

All content from these series is filmed & made available on the ON Revolution social networking site.\r\n\r\nAs an Agency we connect our creative activists with the people, funding, & networks they need. We also provide fundamental services such as fiscal sponsorship while matching them with industry professionals for mentorship.\r\n\r\nOur engagement with the LA community at large will take form as an expansion of CAP, geared for the public.

LA2050 currently gives LA an orange rating for social connectedness, implying that LA’s lack of social connectedness currently hinders human development.  With CAP, we strive to significantly enhance human development across LA, and we intend to measure that by quantifying the work of our LA creative activists and evaluating the social interaction, civic engagement, and volunteerism produced through our Creative Activist Program.</p>"

  description: "Transcending the binds that educational attainment often places on individuals’ exposure to and opportunities for engagement, CAP will strengthen social connectedness throughout LA by cultivating creative activist projects that offer social interaction, civic engagement, and volunteer opportunities.  CAP inherently affects LA2050’s metrics for social connectedness.\r\n\r\nRegarding social interaction, CAP not only provides Angelenos with the ON Revolution resource-rich social networking site to communicate and collaborate around projects and issues alike, but it also offers the LA community a wide variety of events.  Aside from the LA Creative Activist Conference, Angelenos will now be able to attend an ON Rev Speaker Series event every 4-6 weeks.  Additionally, at our Dan Eldon Center for Creative Activism in Malibu, we host gallery openings, monthly Sundowners for creative activists to meet and mingle from April through September, and Sack Lunches for Angelenos interested in creative activism to come learn more.  Recently, we’ve begun hosting occasional screenings and even held small festivals at our Center as well.  Separately, our 45+ creative activists and their projects host an array of satellite events around LA, from fundraisers to awareness events, available to the broader LA community.\r\n\r\nRegarding civic engagement, each of CAP projects offers individuals numerous points of entry to mobilize personally and as a community around issues that matter most to them.  As a media and art centered source for engagement, we meet citizens at the core of what inspires them, and these projects call on the community to take action. For our creative activists, action can take many different forms – from a Global Day of Play for a Cardboard Challenge to a screening and discussion around global poverty and microfinance.  Action can also mean donating to a cause to sustain its work or signing a petition to influence institutional change.\r\n\r\nRegarding volunteerism, CAP and the projects under its umbrella survive thanks to volunteers, and we have a bottomless well of opportunities for volunteers to get involved.  The media and arts component of CAP functions as that entry point for the average, uninspired, uninvolved citizen to become inspired and get involved.\r\n\r\nAnd with inspired, involved, invested citizens, LA has the potential to flourish as a community and tap into its own spark to ignite change both locally and globally."

  description3: "As an Incubator, Academy, and Agency, CAP sits at the unique intersection of 3 different worlds.  Similarly, CAP’s competition spans those 3 different arenas.  Some competitors offer social innovation think tanks.  Some offer training programs and fellowships.  Some offer fiscal sponsorship.  And some offer industry representation.  However, we have yet to meet an organization that merges the three roles of Incubator, Academy, and Agency as CAP does. We have the rare chance to face what otherwise would be deemed competition instead as opportunities for collaboration and community expansion.\r\n\r\nFor instance, some of LA’s comparable incubators include Y Combinator, the Praxis Accelerator Program, and the Hub LA.  A boot camp of sorts, Y Combinator provides seed funding and creative development to startups in 2 short-term batches a year.  The Praxis Accelerator Program, structured into 4-5 day events, nurtures its select fellows 3 times a year for a fee of $7000.  The Hub LA, however, is anchored by a physical place in the heart of the Arts District in Downtown LA, where it combines the best of a café, innovation lab, business accelerator, serviced office, and community center to create a place for meaningful encounters, productive work sessions, exchange and inspiration all with the ambition to spur social innovation. With such aligned core values and ambitions, we’ve fostered a relationship between CAP and the Hub LA to share resources, community, and programming.  Covering 2 geographically varied parts of LA we look forward to diversifying opportunities for engagement for our participants.\r\n\r\nLA has no shortage of academies offering courses on media and the arts – from elite universities to trade schools to weekend workshops.  To name a few, we’ve collaborated with experts from USC, RED Digital Cinema’s REDucation, research institutes like The Geena Davis Institute on Gender & Media, and UCLA’s Burkle Institute for International Relations to bolster our curriculum with the expertise of our surroundings.\r\n\r\nLastly, dense with talent agencies and management companies, LA’s network of agencies is like none other, and their potential power is unparalleled.  However, while these agencies connect their clients with industry professionals and endless financial opportunities, we possess a significant depth and breadth of experience in the world of social action.  As an Agency, we connect our “clients” per say not only to industry professionals, not only to funding opportunities, but also to the social innovators and humanitarian gurus they need to fulfill their projects’ missions. We’ve established relationships with some of LA’s most influential talent agencies (CAA, UTA, ICM, etc.) to combine our contacts, expand our reach, and tap into Hollywood’s potential to spur social action.\r\n\r\nAs a collaborative organization, we are eager to expand our network and continue to build new relationships. We define our competition as opportunities to better our work."
  vision: "<p>For CAP, success in 2050 would be an LA where we’re interacting with one another, engaging in critical issues, volunteering for what moves us, and participating as voters to craft the narrative around our community. LA2050’s report on social connectedness looked bleak at best.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2050, we see an LA with over 50% of its residents active on the ON Revolution social networking site, or engaging with one another on whatever platform the ON Revolution has evolved to become.  More importantly, we see an LA where that same number of people, if not more, is interacting with one another face to face at a host of community events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We see an LA with no fewer than 100 active LA creative projects operating under our Creative Activist Program, with an additional 50 projects having graduated to alumni and operating as their own 501©3s.  In turn, we see an LA with a dramatic rise in civic engagement, increasing the local donations raised and the number of petitions signed by at least 300%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We see an LA where the rates of volunteerism have risen from 21.5% to 65.8% and the number of adults volunteering has climbed from 2 million to 6 million.  We see an LA that sits somewhere in the top 3 metro areas for volunteerism rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And we see an LA where we’re voting and trusting and enjoying our community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Above all, in 2050 we see an LA where social connectedness is not an indicator of human development but instead an essential part of life.  It is in our blood and sweat and DNA as Angelenos, and it is only the beginning of our potential to thrive.</p>"

  THE IMAGINATION FOUNDATION



  Grown out of “Caine’s Arcade” & with support from the Goldhirsh Foundation,
  the Imagination Foundation (IF) turned a viral video with 6 million views into
  a movement that now finds, fosters, & funds creativity & entrepreneurship in
  kids. In 2012 IF launched its Global Cardboard Challenge & hosted over 270
  events in 41 countries. 






  TENDER GREENS SUSTAINABLE LIFE PROJECT



  A dynamic farming program developed by Tender Greens Restaurants’ founders,
  the Sustainable Life Project (SLP) provides transitioning foster youth with a
  safe, consistent learning & living environment.  To date, SLP has nurtured a
  class of interns to complete the program & become Tender Greens employees.






  FOSTER THE FUTURE



  This project is the band Foster the People’s philanthropic initiative that
  works with charities & communities to influence the act of giving back &
  creating community. 






  In LA they work with 826LA, Breakaway Education, LA Guerrilla Gardening, &
  Social Justice Learning Institute.






  The implementation of CAP throughout LA will consist of 2 different levels of
  engagement: 1) with individual high impact creative activists & 2) with the LA
  community as a whole. To our selected creative activists & their projects, we
  provide direct services as an Incubator, Academy, & Agency.






  As an Incubator, we offer strategic & narrative development to map out their
  goals & objectives. We host an annual CAP Summit at our community Center in
  Malibu where we exchange ideas & share lessons learned. We also provide our
  creative activists with the ON Revolution, a resourcerich online social
  network where they can collaborate around their projects & meet one another’s
  needs.






  As an Academy, we nurture our creative activists’ talents & introduce them to
  critical knowledge through workshops & seminars in our CAP Academy Series &
  through panel conversations in our ON Rev Speaker Series. All content from
  these series is filmed & made available on the ON Revolution social networking
  site.






  As an Agency we connect our creative activists with the people, funding, &
  networks they need. We also provide fundamental services such as fiscal
  sponsorship while matching them with industry professionals for mentorship.






  Our engagement with the LA community at large will take form as an expansion
  of CAP, geared for the public. We will hold an LA Creative Activist Conference
  for a broad audience.  Fashioned in the style of an arts & mediacentric TED
  Conference, this will be a fusion of our CAP Summit & our ON Rev Speaker
  Series. The Creative Activist Conference will highlight the work of our
  creative activists, offer panels about our most successful projects, & host
  forums on innovate solutions for LA’s pressing issues. This gathering will
  provide opportunities for the community to get involved through civic
  engagement & volunteerism. As part of CAP’s immersion into LA, we will offer
  Angelenos exclusive access to the ON Revolution site, our ON Rev Speaker
  Series, & our creative activists’ satellite community events.






  Armed with the endless possibilities of digital media, today’s Angelenos are
  all producers, journalists, storytellers — piecing together a collective
  narrative & engaging in a global dialogue. What story will we tell?  Thanks to
  LA2050, this year we have the chance to make LA’s story count — to make it a
  story about the community that tackled issues like poverty, global warming,
  human trafficking, & educational inequity with films & words & photos.  






  By nurturing LA’s creative activists & extending their work deep into the LA
  community, CAP will enliven, encourage, & sustain social connectedness
  throughout LA. CAP’s 45+ active local projects provide Angelenos with the
  opportunity to participate in the solutions that will determine the future of
  LA. Ultimately, our Creative Activist Program has the ability to make the
  story of LA2050 that of a community rich in social interaction, civic
  engagement, & volunteerism.
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  <p>To date Creative Visions Foundation has incubated over 150 creative
  activist projects and productions, reaching over 90 million people. 
  Furthermore, these projects have reached 195 countries across the globe, and a
  recent evaluation of our finances, found that for every $1 donated to Creative
  Visions Foundation, $2.44 is raised for our fiscally sponsored creative
  activist projects.  Additionally, since the launch of our Dan Eldon Center for
  Creative Activism in Malibu, we’ve hosted more than 100 events, serving over
  10,000 people through educational seminars and community program. 
  Specifically, as an Academy, CAP’s Academy Series and ON Rev Speaker Series
  host approximately 20 events annually, which produce original content and
  generate roughly 300 minutes of finished productions a year.</p>






  <p>Some notable projects to have come out of CAP include the following:</p>






  <p>Video Volunteers:  One of CVF’s first creative activist, nurtured by
  founders Kathy Eldon and Amy Eldon Turteltaub here in LA, Jessica Mayberry had
  a vision to teach illiterate Indian women  how to use film to tell their
  stories and fight their battles.  We helped her see it with business strategy,
  creative consulting, journalism education, and board development.  Today Video
  Volunteers has created the largest, most diverse network of salaried community
  producers in the world.  To date, Video Volunteers has created 15 community
  video units, trained 150 producers, employed 100 fulltime producers, held 1100
  screenings, reached 200,000 people through screenings, produced 60 video
  magazines and 50 additional films, hosted regular video screenings in 350
  villages and slums, spurred 2,000 people to take direct action.</p>






  <p>Happy:  The latest documentary from Academy Award nominee and Angeleno Roko
  Belic, Happy sets out to answer the question and stimulate conversations
  around, “What makes you happy?”  With a Facebook force of more than 30,000
  Facebook fans, Happy quickly climbed to the #1 documentary on iTunes and
  declared February 11th, 2012 World Happy Day, holding over 600 screenings of
  the documentary in 60 countries on all 7 continents.</p>






  <p>Living on One:  A documentary about 4 LAbased college students who spent
  their summer living on $1 a day in rural Guatemala to better understand
  extreme poverty, Living on One has screened in 25 cities to 52,000 people &
  launched a Student Microfinance Movement with participation from 55
  universities. A resource for students to take microfinance classes, find
  internships, and attend conferences, the Student Microfinance Movement builds
  the skill set necessary to become successful social entrepreneurs.</p>

  <p>We will evaluate CAP by detailing, measuring, and quantifying not only the
  impact that each of our LA CAP projects produces but also CAP’s impact on the
  LA community at large.  We require that each of our LA creative activists
  submits impact reports that provide us with concrete metrics on their work,
  and we hold our own work to the same expectations. We will have impact reports
  on each of our nearly 50 LA creative activists as well as a comprehensive
  report on CAP’s impact on LA as a whole.</p>






  <p>In these reports, we assess impact, social media, strategy, media
  attention, and fundraising. </p>






  <p>Regarding impact, we will detail what direct services have been provided,
  who has been served, and how many people have benefitted.  We will also
  evaluate what longterm effects the project produces, whom or what has
  benefitted from those effects, and the metrics surrounding those
  beneficiaries.  Additionally, we will assess how the project has influenced
  change and what outcomes have been produced that have helped shape key
  policies, rights, and/or freedoms.  Lastly, we will report on how our project
  has addressed the issues surrounding the root cause of the problem and
  implemented sustainable change.</p>






  <p>Regarding social media, we will outline the project’s social media
  strategy, and we will detail, measure, and quantify social media traffic,
  reach, reaction, and action.  For instance, we will track who we are reaching,
  how we are reaching them, who is reacting, what they are saying, who’s taking
  action, what actions are most important, etc.</p>






  <p>Regarding strategy, we will detail our project’s goals and objectives over
  the past year and illustrate how we reached these goals and objectives, noting
  the benchmarks along the way.</p>






  <p>Regarding media attention, we will describe coverage received in 2013 and
  how the project received the attention.</p>






  <p>Regarding fundraising, we will provide yearend financial statements,
  including the budget and expense report for the past seven months.</p>






  <p>We will measure success by evaluating the metrics surrounding LA’s
  volunteerism, voting, and civic and social engagement before and after the
  implementation of CAP in Los Angeles. LA2050 currently gives LA an orange
  rating for social connectedness, implying that LA’s lack of social
  connectedness currently hinders human development.  With CAP, we strive to
  significantly enhance human development across LA, and we intend to measure
  that by quantifying the work of our LA creative activists and evaluating the
  social interaction, civic engagement, and volunteerism produced through our
  Creative Activist Program.</p>
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  Transcending the binds that educational attainment often places on
  individuals’ exposure to and opportunities for engagement, CAP will strengthen
  social connectedness throughout LA by cultivating creative activist projects
  that offer social interaction, civic engagement, and volunteer opportunities. 
  CAP inherently affects LA2050’s metrics for social connectedness.






  Regarding social interaction, CAP not only provides Angelenos with the ON
  Revolution resourcerich social networking site to communicate and collaborate
  around projects and issues alike, but it also offers the LA community a wide
  variety of events.  Aside from the LA Creative Activist Conference, Angelenos
  will now be able to attend an ON Rev Speaker Series event every 46 weeks. 
  Additionally, at our Dan Eldon Center for Creative Activism in Malibu, we host
  gallery openings, monthly Sundowners for creative activists to meet and mingle
  from April through September, and Sack Lunches for Angelenos interested in
  creative activism to come learn more.  Recently, we’ve begun hosting
  occasional screenings and even held small festivals at our Center as well. 
  Separately, our 45+ creative activists and their projects host an array of
  satellite events around LA, from fundraisers to awareness events, available to
  the broader LA community.






  Regarding civic engagement, each of CAP projects offers individuals numerous
  points of entry to mobilize personally and as a community around issues that
  matter most to them.  As a media and art centered source for engagement, we
  meet citizens at the core of what inspires them, and these projects call on
  the community to take action. For our creative activists, action can take many
  different forms — from a Global Day of Play for a Cardboard Challenge to a
  screening and discussion around global poverty and microfinance.  Action can
  also mean donating to a cause to sustain its work or signing a petition to
  influence institutional change.






  Regarding volunteerism, CAP and the projects under its umbrella survive thanks
  to volunteers, and we have a bottomless well of opportunities for volunteers
  to get involved.  The media and arts component of CAP functions as that entry
  point for the average, uninspired, uninvolved citizen to become inspired and
  get involved.






  And with inspired, involved, invested citizens, LA has the potential to
  flourish as a community and tap into its own spark to ignite change both
  locally and globally.
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  <p>For CAP, success in 2050 would be an LA where we’re interacting with one
  another, engaging in critical issues, volunteering for what moves us, and
  participating as voters to craft the narrative around our community. LA2050’s
  report on social connectedness looked bleak at best.</p>






  <p>In 2050, we see an LA with over 50% of its residents active on the ON
  Revolution social networking site, or engaging with one another on whatever
  platform the ON Revolution has evolved to become.  More importantly, we see an
  LA where that same number of people, if not more, is interacting with one
  another face to face at a host of community events.</p>






  <p>We see an LA with no fewer than 100 active LA creative projects operating
  under our Creative Activist Program, with an additional 50 projects having
  graduated to alumni and operating as their own 501Â©3s.  In turn, we see an LA
  with a dramatic rise in civic engagement, increasing the local donations
  raised and the number of petitions signed by at least 300%.</p>






  <p>We see an LA where the rates of volunteerism have risen from 21.5% to 65.8%
  and the number of adults volunteering has climbed from 2 million to 6
  million.  We see an LA that sits somewhere in the top 3 metro areas for
  volunteerism rates.</p>






  <p>And we see an LA where we’re voting and trusting and enjoying our
  community.</p>






  <p>Above all, in 2050 we see an LA where social connectedness is not an
  indicator of human development but instead an essential part of life.  It is
  in our blood and sweat and DNA as Angelenos, and it is only the beginning of
  our potential to thrive.</p>
