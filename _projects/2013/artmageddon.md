We are also meeting with key participants and contributors to analyze what was successful last year on the ground level.  Although these will continue to be important factors of determining the future success of ARTmageddon, we will be measuring success in three phases.

  brief: "Make ARTmageddon an annual celebration of the arts in Los Angeles! \r\n\r\nUnder the motto \"Less Car. More Art.\", hundreds of L.A.-based artists and arts organizations united last fall for ARTmageddon, a two-day citywide celebration of the prolific and inspiring art happening all over Los Angeles. At the center of ARTmageddon was a new website which allowed the idea live and be shared digitally (www.ARTmageddonLA.com). It featured 250+ listings for performances, concerts, screenings, literary events, and exhibitions Angelenos could walk, bike and metro.\r\nARTmageddon began as an simple idea inspired by Metro's Carmageddon II, with almost all the previous support being donated time from dedicated volunteers, but it quickly became the largest citywide art party Los Angeles had ever seen. \r\n\r\nARTmageddon connects local artists to each other, encouraging collaborating between artists and arts organizations with each other, and with other local businesses such as restaurants, bookstores, and retailers. This central hub also supplies artists and arts organizations with the tools and know how to start going door to door in their own neighborhoods, creating a structure to offer the opportunity for artists to get to know their neighbors face to face.\r\n\r\nExpansions to enhance ARTmageddon in 2013 include printed materials including a detailed printed map and decals for participating locations. A series of hosted talks and art movies before and during event. Social media contests with instagram. A mobile app creation than can continue to be updated so that the program can live beyond the live event. We would like to create an affiliate program as well for the neighboring cities including Long Beach, Pomona and Claremont and the Orange and Venture counties. "

    Currently there is no direct competitor.  Since the website was utilized as
    a listing site we worked with an existing listing site, Experience LA, to
    assist with the listing platform.  Our web developer was able to enhance the
    listing experience, making it easier to have a participant plan their
    activities with the implementation of google maps. 
  vision: >-
    Success would mean making ARTmageddon an annual Los Angeles celebration of
    local art, bringing together each of Los Angeles' beautiful neighborhoods.
    It would spread to every arts organization in Los Angeles, and because a
    holiday-like atmosphere one weekend a year that spreads through the rest of
    the year through the connections, collaborations, and awareness raised
    during ARTmageddon. It would spread to a national "local movement," where
    headquarters in every major cultural hub join together for one weekend a
    year from cities from coast to coast join together in the biggest art party
    in the world!

  Make ARTmageddon an annual celebration of the arts in Los Angeles! 






  Under the motto "Less Car. More Art.", hundreds of L.A.based artists and arts
  organizations united last fall for ARTmageddon, a twoday citywide celebration
  of the prolific and inspiring art happening all over Los Angeles. At the
  center of ARTmageddon was a new website which allowed the idea live and be
  shared digitally (www.ARTmageddonLA.com). It featured 250+ listings for
  performances, concerts, screenings, literary events, and exhibitions Angelenos
  could walk, bike and metro.



  ARTmageddon began as an simple idea inspired by Metro's Carmageddon II, with
  almost all the previous support being donated time from dedicated volunteers,
  but it quickly became the largest citywide art party Los Angeles had ever
  seen. 






  ARTmageddon connects local artists to each other, encouraging collaborating
  between artists and arts organizations with each other, and with other local
  businesses such as restaurants, bookstores, and retailers. This central hub
  also supplies artists and arts organizations with the tools and know how to
  start going door to door in their own neighborhoods, creating a structure to
  offer the opportunity for artists to get to know their neighbors face to face.






  Expansions to enhance ARTmageddon in 2013 include printed materials including
  a detailed printed map and decals for participating locations. A series of
  hosted talks and art movies before and during event. Social media contests
  with instagram. A mobile app creation than can continue to be updated so that
  the program can live beyond the live event. We would like to create an
  affiliate program as well for the neighboring cities including Long Beach,
  Pomona and Claremont and the Orange and Venture counties. 
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-

Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >+

  For our next iteration, we will once again partner with these folks, as well
  as with Team Friday, and work to expand our reach to include even more
  artists, arts organizations, community partners, and media sponsors. 


Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  Evaluation is key for growth and we definitely understand that. As 2012 was
  the first year we were able to measure success through artist and
  institutional participation and media coverage. We are also meeting with key
  participants and contributors to analyze what was successful last year on the
  ground level.  Although these will continue to be important factors of
  determining the future success of ARTmageddon, we will be measuring success in
  three phases. Phase one  will include measuring the interactions from all
  forms of participants including artists, institutions, consumers and media on 
  digital platforms. Phase two will be measuring the call to action by assessing
  the participation and media coverage during the event.Phase three will be any
  post event coverage and digital interaction. 






  Covering the success of ARTmageddon in three phases will allow us to react and
  change anything necessary to ensure success going forward. 
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
  One of the major and critical benefits of ARTmageddon centers on cultivating
  neighborhoods and their connection to artists. Los Angeles is a city defined
  by its freeways. And yet, there are dozens of beautiful, culturally and
  historically rich neighborhoods, that while tourists travel from hundreds and
  thousands of miles away to experience, we often aren't even aware of what is
  waiting only steps from our front door. Here at ARTmageddon, we believe Los
  Angeles and Art should be defined by its neighborhoods.






  A project of this magnitude benefits not only the arts in a direct and literal
  way but on levels that span across economic and neighborhood development. 






  And that's why we shout our rallying cry! "Less Car! More ART!"


What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  Success would mean making ARTmageddon an annual Los Angeles celebration of
  local art, bringing together each of Los Angeles' beautiful neighborhoods. It
  would spread to every arts organization in Los Angeles, and because a
  holidaylike atmosphere one weekend a year that spreads through the rest of the
  year through the connections, collaborations, and awareness raised during
  ARTmageddon. It would spread to a national "local movement," where
  headquarters in every major cultural hub join together for one weekend a year
  from cities from coast to coast join together in the biggest art party in the
  world!
