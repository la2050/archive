title: Organizing Social Enterprise Urban Farm in South Los Angeles
indicator: ' Income & Employment'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  ImPact Farms, has a plan to develop underutilized property and building
  rooftops in South Los Angeles into Hydroponic/ Aquaponic Urban Farms. These
  high tech soilless Urban farms are capable of producing 10 to 20 times more
  produce per sq. ft. as compared to traditional soil farms. The increased yield
  is the result of an extended growing season, controlled environment and
  growing in three dimension and are essential to supporting investment in Urban
  Farms.






  As a triplebottomline Social Enterprise, ImPact Farms replaces outsourced
  manufacturing with agricultural technology while directly and indirectly
  supporting a potential of 30 local permanent, familysupportivewage jobs per
  acre. 









  At ImPact Farms, we define familysupportivewage as the income required to
  support three people as established by the city of Los Angeles and then add
  health and other benefits. As a matter of policy, base wages will be adjusted
  for inflation using the US Census Cost of Living Index. In addition employees
  are eligible to participate in a profit sharing pool committed at 20% of
  Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA).









  ImPact Farms founders are committed to converting profit sharing into 40%
  employee ownership within 15 years, using the latest models, definitions, and
  ideas for ownership transfer and classifications from the Sustainable
  Economies Law Group (SELC) in their policy group's public comment for the
  proposed Worker Cooperative Statute to be put into the CA Corporations Codes.
  Although it is in the drafting process, we have included this to show Impact
  Farms' commitment to creating fair and meaningful worker ownership.






  Los Angeles, benefits from keeping more of our “food dollar” circulating in
  the Local economy. Meeting Los Angeles nutritional requirements locally by
  2050 could retain as much as $10 billion annually representing over 90,000
  permanent local jobs.






  Even community groups will benefit from profit sharing at 10% of EBITDA for
  nutritional, education and to fulfill other group defined quality of life
  objectives.






  ImPact Farms is able to sell its organic, locally grown, fresh and therefore
  highly nutritive vegetables, fruit and fish at an affordable rate in South LA
  community and offer the above mentioned benefits



  by selling its produce at a premium price in wealthier neighborhoods and
  bringing revenue and income back into the inner city. Our one day harvest to
  table direct delivery to households will be specially helpful to singleparent
  families and those who have no or limited access to transportation, saving
  them time from shopping they can use the time to prepare fresh food and enjoy
  quality time with family members. For example, to further ease access to fresh
  food, ImPact Farms in cooperation with LAUSD will provide CSA produce and
  eventually meals at school sites for parents to pick up when they pick up
  their children.






  Our goal is to create jobs that allow the community to build wealth and equity
  that will help create a middle class in the poorest neighborhoods of Los
  Angeles as opposed to creating many minimumwage jobs that barely raise people
  above the poverty line. A middle class strata has the economic power to impact
  the real estate economy through home purchase and improvement, leading to
  higher property and income taxes that benefit the city and higher buying power
  that will bring more economic movement to the ancillary and surrounding
  businesses. ImPact Farms solution directly addresses Los Angeles existing
  income disparity.
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  While yet to begin operations, we have engaged and raised the passion of many
  of our stakeholders such as local government offices, community organizations,
  property owners and individuals through presentations that demonstrate ImPact
  Farm’s alignment with quality of life objectives ranging from jobs, health and
  environment to growing Local Economies. ImPact Farms is currently organized as
  a Delaware corporation and plans to become a California Benefit/Flexible
  Purpose corporation with the award.






  In addition, we have identified and are in discussion with 3 sites in South
  Los Angeles where we are considering for development.
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  We have presented our business plan to  the following agencies and
  organization and are fortunate to have their support and count on them as
  partners and collaborators.






  * The 9th district city council office



  * The 9th district neighborhood association/ CAANDU



  * South Los Angeles Industrial Tract (BID)



  * Economic Development Agency



  * Genesis LA, Community Development Institute, Funding source



  * Evergreen Cooperative, Cleveland Ohio



  * Emerging Markets, Inc.



  * PV Jobs, A job training and placement agency



  * Slow Money, National org. encouraging investment in local food



  * Community Services Unlimited,  a community organization working to increase
  access to healthy food in South Central Los Angeles.



  * Sustainable Business Council



  * Green LAVA
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >+
  Urban farming is a capitalintensive undertaking requiring organizational
  capital, property and improvements to achieve economies of scale. As such
  ImPact Farm’s success depends on our ability to raise additional capital to
  move into production and for growth. Offering triple bottom line returns, we
  understand capital is available from Socially Responsible Investors (SRI) and
  public through a Direct Public Offering (DPO) under California exemptions.






  As such our first measure of success is completion of a Social Enterprise
  legal structure, positioning ImPact farms for a successful DPO of $1 million
  or more. A  grant of $100k empowers us to establish our company as a “Benefit
  or Flexible Purpose” corporation in California and create a successful
  marketing and branding campaign that will enable us to establish a successful
  DPO campaign. A DPO structure allows for those with small capital to invest in
  a local company where they see the direct impact to the community and where
  they have a role in the growth of their capital. Imagine empowering these
  small investors in Los Angeles to participate and engage in a company that is
  dedicated to shaping their region. Imagine middle class and low income
  families becoming small investors and having ownership in a local company that
  directly affects their livelihood and health.






  Impact Farms commits to taking the B Corporation impact assessment within a
  year of start of operations. B Corporation is a set of third party standards
  that attempts to measure social and environmental impact in four major areas:
  Governance, Workers, Community and the Environment, with reporting and
  measurement of KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) in each category.  Whether it
  is B Corp or another third party standard, Impact Farms commits as a matter of
  policy to annual reporting on social and environmental impact using some set
  of third party standards.









  A second measure of pre revenue success is the number of community members and
  organizations enrolled in becoming a part of our cooperative business
  development and distribution programs. Stakeholders and community will be able
  to engage ImPact farms through our website, twitter, Facebook and proprietary
  internet systems developed to manage the community organizational process. We
  are looking to engage 2,000 people by the end of 2013.





How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  Income and Employment:






  Over 525K households and 1.9M people reside within six (6) miles of Impact
  Farms in South LA, a community consisting primarily of African Americans and
  Latino populations whose unemployment rate is 18.3% and 13.3% respectively.






  Median household income of $54,314 for a family of four,  suggests almost
  950,000 people within a six mile radius did not earn enough to cover basic
  expenses. That 80,000 households within a mile of ImPact Farms, have median
  household incomes of less than $35K, suggest that over 170K people are living
  on less than 67% of established minimum requirements.






  ImPact Farms policies will prioritize hiring and training local community
  members including troubled youth and those needing a second chance. We will
  also target local source vendors.






  Every acre developed will directly and indirectly generate up to 30 full time
  permanent jobs.  Half of these positions are internal and include seeding,
  managing the growing environment, harvesting, packaging, maintaining fluid
  systems and caring for fish. Indirectly ImPact Farms wis looking to develop
  local vendors for operational requirements and will offer funding and training
  to start ancillary cooperatives related to Impact Farm’s business such as
  distribution, packaging, and food preparation, potentially adding an
  additional 15 positions. Together the ImPact Farms network can generate 30X
  the jobs of a comparatively sized space and cost of a photovoltaic electricity
  system.






  In addition, greening and upgrading existing fields and buildings for farming
  operations will require ImPact Farms to invest $1.5 $2.5 million per acre in
  addition to the cost of the property. While some components will be imported
  our intention is to engage local companies, social enterprises and
  cooperatives to perform work. As such, estimating labor at 30%, creates local
  wages for the improvements between $250750K.






  Together, bringing the farm closer to the table, every 5 acres developed
  represents $45 million in annual local wages and benefits and an additional
  $2.5 million in improvement wages.






  Health: 



  Clearly, more and more studies show that eating a variety of whole, fresh food
  void of toxins is our best defense against chronic diseases through improving
  our immune and defense mechanisms. It is in this background of food desert
  caused mainly by lack of access to a wholesome diet that ImPact Farms makes
  another important contribution. Improved health via access to affordable fresh
  vegetables and fruit through community supported agriculture (CSAs), local,
  corner stores and ImPact Farms store front.






  Environmental Quality:



  Compared to traditional soil agriculture, for every acre of production ImPact
  Farm saves:



  * 8+ million gallons of water



  * 40+ tons of CO2 from farms and food transportation



  * 90+ tons of CO2 consumed locally by plants



  These estimates are based on farm studies,  reported water saving @70% and
  calculations of plant C02 absorption for 1M pounds of produce.
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  Becoming food secure by 2050, Los Angeles has created jobs allowing members
  of  the poorest neighborhoods to build wealth and equity to move into middle
  class. The middle class has the economic power to impact the real estate
  economy through home purchase and improvement, leading to higher property and
  income taxes that benefit the city and higher buying power that will bring
  more economic movement to the ancillary and surrounding businesses.






  ImPact farms does this by developing the technical, social responsibility and
  distribution leadership as a foundation for Los Angeles to become food secure
  by 2050.  If every Billion dollars of imported goods cost local economies
  9,000 jobs (Economic Policy Institute), becoming food secure would eliminate
  $10 billion of food and food product imports and create the opening for 90,000
  local Familysupportivewage jobs in Los Angeles.






  Imagine a South Central that has become a bustling economic center with
  beautiful, renovated architecture, access to plenty of organic, locally grown
  fresh food, a local food system (distribution, preparation and packaging) run
  by cooperative companies owned by the local residents. The rates of Obesity,
  diabetes, depression and violence are comparable to those of the more affluent
  neighborhoods in Los Angeles as a result of access to fresh food and improved
  economic vibrancy. Furthermore, health care cost has reduced in LA. The local
  schools Academic Performance Index are comparable to those of the affluent
  neighborhoods and healthy, thriving children are learning and increasingly
  attending higher education institutions.

  description3: "Choosing to be an Urban Farm developer and operator rather than Urban Garden, positions ImPact Farms to become a viable ultra local source of high volume, high quality food. As such, our primary competition is existing distribution systems of imported food and food products and eventually other high yielding Urban farms. \r\n\r\nExisting channels have higher costs to market as a result of transportation, energy and waste and cannot provide LA’s low income population affordable healthy food. Furthermore, they can not compete in taste and maximum nutrient delivery because it occurs in the last few weeks before harvest when the produce is vine ripe. Taste is an important factor in helping to change the fast food culture that delivers taste through high salt, fat and sugar content. If we are to help transition our youth and adult population to healthy vegetables and fruit, then we need to make sure that these items are not tasteless.This can not happen when the food is important from China, Mexico and South America because ripe food does not tolerate transportation and has a low shelf life. But it can certainly happen when the farm is situated a few miles away from the market as it is in the case of ImPact Farms.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to working with other similarly aligned organization to help Los Angeles become food self-sufficient.

Together the ImPact Farms network can generate 30X the jobs of a comparatively sized space and cost of a photovoltaic electricity system.\r\n\r\nIn addition, greening and upgrading existing fields and buildings for farming operations will require ImPact Farms to invest $1.5 -$2.5 million per acre in addition to the cost of the property. While some components will be imported our intention is to engage local companies, social enterprises and cooperatives to perform work. As such, estimating labor at 30%, creates local wages for the improvements between $250-750K.\r\n\r\nTogether, bringing the farm closer to the table, every 5 acres developed represents $4-5 million in annual local wages and benefits and an additional $2.5 million in improvement wages.\r\n\r\nHealth: \r\nClearly, more and more studies show that eating a variety of whole, fresh food void of toxins is our best defense against chronic diseases through improving our immune and defense mechanisms. It is in this background of food desert caused mainly by lack of access to a wholesome diet that ImPact Farms makes another important contribution. Improved health via access to affordable fresh vegetables and fruit through community supported agriculture (CSAs), local, corner stores and ImPact Farms store front.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental Quality:\r\nCompared to traditional soil agriculture, for every acre of production ImPact Farm saves:\r\n• 8+ million gallons of water\r\n• 40+ tons of CO2 from farms and food transportation\r\n• 90+ tons of CO2 consumed locally by plants\r\nThese estimates are based on farm studies,  reported water saving @70% and calculations of plant C02 absorption for 1M pounds of produce."

    answer: "Urban farming is a capital-intensive undertaking requiring organizational capital, property and improvements to achieve economies of scale. As such ImPact Farm’s success depends on our ability to raise additional capital to move into production and for growth. Offering triple bottom line returns, we understand capital is available from Socially Responsible Investors (SRI) and public through a Direct Public Offering (DPO) under California exemptions.\r\n\r\nAs such our first measure of success is completion of a Social Enterprise legal structure, positioning ImPact farms for a successful DPO of $1 million or more. A  grant of $100k empowers us to establish our company as a “Benefit or Flexible Purpose” corporation in California and create a successful marketing and branding campaign that will enable us to establish a successful DPO campaign. A DPO structure allows for those with small capital to invest in a local company where they see the direct impact to the community and where they have a role in the growth of their capital. Imagine empowering these small investors in Los Angeles to participate and engage in a company that is dedicated to shaping their region. Imagine middle class and low income families becoming small investors and having ownership in a local company that directly affects their livelihood and health.\r\n\r\nImpact Farms commits to taking the B Corporation impact assessment within a year of start of operations. B Corporation is a set of third party standards that attempts to measure social and environmental impact in four major areas: Governance, Workers, Community and the Environment, with reporting and measurement of KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) in each category.  Whether it is B Corp or another third party standard, Impact Farms commits as a matter of policy to annual reporting on social and environmental impact using some set of third party standards.\r\n\r\n\r\nA second measure of pre revenue success is the number of community members and organizations enrolled in becoming a part of our cooperative business development and distribution programs. Stakeholders and community will be able to engage ImPact farms through our website, twitter, Facebook and proprietary internet systems developed to manage the community organizational process. We are looking to engage 2,000 people by the end of 2013.\r\n\r\n"

    answer: "Choosing to be an Urban Farm developer and operator rather than Urban Garden, positions ImPact Farms to become a viable ultra local source of high volume, high quality food. As such, our primary competition is existing distribution systems of imported food and food products and eventually other high yielding Urban farms. \r\n\r\nExisting channels have higher costs to market as a result of transportation, energy and waste and cannot provide LA’s low income population affordable healthy food. Furthermore, they can not compete in taste and maximum nutrient delivery because it occurs in the last few weeks before harvest when the produce is vine ripe. Taste is an important factor in helping to change the fast food culture that delivers taste through high salt, fat and sugar content. If we are to help transition our youth and adult population to healthy vegetables and fruit, then we need to make sure that these items are not tasteless.This can not happen when the food is important from China, Mexico and South America because ripe food does not tolerate transportation and has a low shelf life. But it can certainly happen when the farm is situated a few miles away from the market as it is in the case of ImPact Farms.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to working with other similarly aligned organization to help Los Angeles become food self-sufficient.

    answer: "Becoming food secure by 2050, Los Angeles has created jobs allowing members of  the poorest neighborhoods to build wealth and equity to move into middle class. The middle class has the economic power to impact the real estate economy through home purchase and improvement, leading to higher property and income taxes that benefit the city and higher buying power that will bring more economic movement to the ancillary and surrounding businesses.\r\n\r\nImPact farms does this by developing the technical, social responsibility and distribution leadership as a foundation for Los Angeles to become food secure by 2050.  If every Billion dollars of imported goods cost local economies 9,000 jobs (Economic Policy Institute), becoming food secure would eliminate $10 billion of food and food product imports and create the opening for 90,000 local Family-supportive-wage jobs in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nImagine a South Central that has become a bustling economic center with beautiful, renovated architecture, access to plenty of organic, locally grown fresh food, a local food system (distribution, preparation and packaging) run by cooperative companies owned by the local residents. The rates of Obesity, diabetes, depression and violence are comparable to those of the more affluent neighborhoods in Los Angeles as a result of access to fresh food and improved economic vibrancy. Furthermore, health care cost has reduced in LA. The local schools Academic Performance Index are comparable to those of the affluent neighborhoods and healthy, thriving children are learning and increasingly attending higher education institutions.
