  Indicator: ' Education'
  brief: "Minds on Fire is a new initiative that actively empowers middle school students who are most at risk for dropping out to succeed as learners and community leaders. Minds on Fire will improve middle school attendance, student engagement and achievement by empowering students to apply academic coursework to the real-world issues they care about.    \r\n\r\nStudents take ownership of their education by creating connections between their classroom lessons with student-led community projects. MOF will place trained ‘Mind Partners’- retired teachers and college grads - in each class to work with and support teachers. These Mind Partners will work with teachers and administrators to build frameworks for projects that fit the content and pacing of each teacher’s curriculum. They will work directly with students as they design and execute their project. Mind Partners fill a range of roles, from facilitating student-led discussions about the issues they care most about to identifying developmentally appropriate projects that utilize the skills of the particular academic unit; from engaging parents, community partners, businesses and/or government strategically to seeking project funding.   \r\n\r\nThe work of students and teachers will be amplified through a network of ‘real-life’ and virtual platforms, creating a growing community of engaged and knowledgeable Angelenos.  Students and teachers will be able to exchange ideas and share experiences throughout the school year through an online platform. Teachers and school leaders will be able to connect with one another and other community leaders through quarterly ‘learn and link’ events. And the entire Minds on Fire community will celebrate their achievements at a year-end event that showcases student impact and academic achievement. \r\n\r\nStudent voice is central to this approach. In a national survey, students who themselves had dropped out told us how they would improve schools (1). Among their comments, students asked for:\r\n- 81% - Opportunities for real-world learning (e.g. service-learning, internships) to make classroom more relevant\r\n- 81% - Better teachers who keep classes interesting\r\n- 75% - Smaller classes with more individual instruction  \r\n\r\nThese comments are borne out in the research findings and recommendations of education experts like Dr. Robert Balfanz of the Everyone Graduates Center at Johns Hopkins and Dr. William Daggett of the International Center for Leadership on Education. The Minds on Fire model incorporates these concepts through use of student-led, project-based learning with immediate goals and opportunity for success. The classroom-level support allows facilitates exciting learning in personalized, small-group work among students.  \r\n \r\nLos Angeles is home to a disproportionate number of America’s Drop-out Factories – schools in which less than 60% of students who enter high school in 9th grade graduate on time. Minds on Fire will focus outreach to schools that feed into these Dropout Factories and where middle school students are most likely to be struggling. By targeting these ‘feeder’ middle schools, we can reduce the dropout rates in the schools hurt most by a loss of students. \r\n\r\nWe can identify which students are most likely to dropout of school in high school based on their middle school performance (2). Dr. Balfanz coined the term ‘ABCs to describe these indicators – Attendance, Behavior and Course performance. His research is echoed in the findings of others, including the California Dropout Prevention Center. Minds on Fire will work with students who demonstrate risk for dropping out based on use of the ABCs – students who:\r\n- Attend school less than 80 percent of the time\r\n- Have repeated behavior problems and/or problems that are mild but sustained\r\n- Fail one or more courses, particularly in math or English.\r\n \r\nEducation Secretary Arne Duncan said in 2011 “As a target for school reform, the middle grades present the last, best opportunity for educators to reach all students—and not just those who persist and thrive in high school.” Minds on Fire deploys a classroom-level reform model to increase the likelihood of at risk-students leaving middle school prepared to succeed and graduate from high school. In the first year of operation we plan to serve 300 youth in up to six schools, helping that many of the most at-risk middle school students stay on the path to graduation. By Year 3 of operations we will be serving 1,500 students per year, a figure large enough to have a significant impact on the 9th grade dropout rate. In the 2010-11 school year, 3,000 9th graders dropped out of LAUSD schools.   \r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n1.

  description: "Over time, Minds on Fire will build a corps of young leaders with the skills, confidence and commitment to effectively address challenges in their communities. They will enter high school prepared to graduate on time, with aspirations for college, career and civic life. \r\n\r\nAnd while the mission of Minds on Fire is to decrease the dropout rate for Los Angeles’s most at-risk middle school students, this project will have additional benefits spanning student achievement, youth development, teacher quality and community-wide engagement. \r\n\r\nMinds on Fire will start by working with 300 students across six schools.

    MOF is in the process of developing partnerships with schools and community
    agencies. The most critical partnerships will be with the individual
    teachers and school leaders in MOF schools. We will also work with the
    education management organizations that have oversight for likely MOF
    schools along with leaders of the LAUSD. Other partnerships will be based on
    the needs of the specific communities in which students are implementing
    their projects. We will develop new partnerships and collaborations with
    community agencies, businesses and local government as defined by project
    needs. MOF is also engaging with foundations to build a sustainable future
    for the organization.  
  Organization Name: Minds on Fire
  description1: "Minds on Fire is in the start-up phase.

  description3: "Interviews with education non-profit leaders in Los Angeles and a review of the local education landscape reveal that the MOF approach fills a gap in the city’s array of education opportunities. This review includes the organizations listed as LAUSD’s community service partners, the Constitutional Rights Foundation Service Learning Network and the Cities of Service annual report for Los Angeles. The combination of providing ongoing school-based support to teachers; directly connecting academic content with community projects; building connections among school staff, students and community via events, and an online platform, all with a focus on middle school students, is unique. Thus, we define our ‘competition’ as other agencies that use a project-based learning approach in the classroom and those who engage students in volunteer opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe project-based approach is most commonly (but not exclusively) found in the small themed academies that are central to the Pilot School model, in the high schools that participate in the Linked Learning initiative and in some career and technical schools. Organizations such as The Small Schools Center that spearheads the Pilot School work and the Chamber of Commerce/UNITE LA, which champions the Linked Learning model will be ideal partners in this work. Because LAUSD is so large, the pressure to compete is low and the desire to leverage existing resources leads to strong coalitions across LA’s education sector. \r\n\r\nA number of local organizations provide high quality resources and/or summer learning programs that are based on a similar philosophy of project-based learning and community engagement. This second group of agencies engage students in community service and volunteerism, usually through one-time events, provision of teacher curricula and/or teacher trainings.These groups too will be important partners for Minds on Fire. They have high-quality project guides that can guide student discussions, and Minds on Fire can serve as a bridge between these groups and the schools in which we operate. \r\n"
  vision: "An education system that significantly enhances human development is one that provides all children with not only a path to college, but also with the knowledge, skills and experiences to build fulfilling lives, however the individual defines that term. And it is a system that inspires confidence in all families and teachers who are part of it, in which the zip code in which one lives has no bearing on the quality of education one has access to.   \r\n\r\nIn this future, schools will have earned the public support they need to function at the highest possible level –  so teachers, community members, parents and students together can foster an excitement for learning."

What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >+
  Minds on Fire is in the startup phase. However, the organization’s founder
  created and piloted a similar model in New York City public schools as part of
  Mayor Bloomberg’s inaugural NYC Civic Corps in 2009, an initiative launched in
  partnership with AmeriCorps VISTA to engage people across that city in
  volunteerism. The Minds on Fire model is shaped by the successes and learnings
  taken from that pilot, in combination with a deep understanding of the Los
  Angeles education landscape and challenges specific to our school system.






  In the NYC Civic Corps program, a threemember team of VISTA Volunteers engaged
  197 student and teacherleaders  and 4,721 students across 58 schools in the
  development and implementation of service and service learning opportunities. 


Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  MOF is in the process of developing partnerships with schools and community
  agencies. The most critical partnerships will be with the individual teachers
  and school leaders in MOF schools. We will also work with the education
  management organizations that have oversight for likely MOF schools along with
  leaders of the LAUSD. Other partnerships will be based on the needs of the
  specific communities in which students are implementing their projects. We
  will develop new partnerships and collaborations with community agencies,
  businesses and local government as defined by project needs. MOF is also
  engaging with foundations to build a sustainable future for the
  organization.  
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >+
  Minds on Fire will use a rigorous evaluation tool to identify and measure the
  impact of Minds on Fire on participating students. Key to our approach will be
  comparing data for participating students against nonparticipating students
  from the same school and schools with similar characteristics where Minds on
  Fire is not in place.






  The evaluation will utilize a combination of quantitative and qualitative data
  to provide a full picture of impact on student and community.






  Attendance — Use school attendance data to track (1) all student attendance
  levels and (2) change in number of students who miss 20 or more days of school
  in a year  






  Behavior disruptions — Use school level data to measure (1) number of behavior
  infractions and (2) change in number of students with 2 or more infractions






  Classroom grades — Use District data and teacherdata and to (1) track number
  of classes failed by participating students, (2) compare student grades in
  classes and individual class units using MOF approach with nonparticipating
  students. 






  CST scores — Use District data to evaluate impact on CST scores in relevant
  content areas. 






  Student hope, engagement and college aspiration  Use a modified version the
  Gallup Student Poll tool to track student’s feelings before and after
  participating in MOF. Gallup polling has found a strong correlation between
  the factors of student hopefulness, engagement and wellbeing to college
  success. Hope in particular is shown to be a stronger predictor than GPA or
  test scores (1).  






  Teacher satisfaction — Develop a teacher poll in collaboration with
  participating schools to measure teachers’ feelings about value and impact of
  program.






  School and Teacher Quality — Utilize LAUSD data as available for school and
  teacher contributions to Academic Growth over Time.


   


  Connectedness — Measure (1) participation in quarterly teacher/community ‘link
  and learn’ events, (2) student use of MOF blog to share ideas and (3)
  participation in yearend celebration event. 






  Community Impact — Track number of students who complete community projects,
  specific impact to the community of projects.






  Persistence through high school — Use district data to follow students’
  progression through high school. Increased number of atrisk students
  persisting through high school and graduating on time. 3,000 students dropped
  out of LAUSD schools in the year between the end of 8th grade and the end of
  9th grade in 2012.

What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  An education system that significantly enhances human development is one that
  provides all children with not only a path to college, but also with the
  knowledge, skills and experiences to build fulfilling lives, however the
  individual defines that term. And it is a system that inspires confidence in
  all families and teachers who are part of it, in which the zip code in which
  one lives has no bearing on the quality of education one has access to.   






  In this future, schools will have earned the public support they need to
  function at the highest possible level —  so teachers, community members,
  parents and students together can foster an excitement for learning.
