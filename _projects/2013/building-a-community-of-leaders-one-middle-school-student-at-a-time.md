title: Building A Community of Leaders One Middle School Student at a Time
indicator: ' Education'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  Minds on Fire is a new initiative that actively empowers middle school
  students who are most at risk for dropping out to succeed as learners and
  community leaders. Minds on Fire will improve middle school attendance,
  student engagement and achievement by empowering students to apply academic
  coursework to the realworld issues they care about.    






  Students take ownership of their education by creating connections between
  their classroom lessons with studentled community projects. MOF will place
  trained ‘Mind Partners’ retired teachers and college grads  in each class to
  work with and support teachers. These Mind Partners will work with teachers
  and administrators to build frameworks for projects that fit the content and
  pacing of each teacher’s curriculum. They will work directly with students as
  they design and execute their project. Mind Partners fill a range of roles,
  from facilitating studentled discussions about the issues they care most about
  to identifying developmentally appropriate projects that utilize the skills of
  the particular academic unit; from engaging parents, community partners,
  businesses and/or government strategically to seeking project funding.   






  The work of students and teachers will be amplified through a network of
  ‘reallife’ and virtual platforms, creating a growing community of engaged and
  knowledgeable Angelenos.  Students and teachers will be able to exchange ideas
  and share experiences throughout the school year through an online platform.
  Teachers and school leaders will be able to connect with one another and other
  community leaders through quarterly ‘learn and link’ events. And the entire
  Minds on Fire community will celebrate their achievements at a yearend event
  that showcases student impact and academic achievement. 






  Student voice is central to this approach. In a national survey, students who
  themselves had dropped out told us how they would improve schools (1). Among
  their comments, students asked for:


   81%  Opportunities for realworld learning (e.g. servicelearning, internships) to make classroom more relevant


   81%  Better teachers who keep classes interesting


   75%  Smaller classes with more individual instruction  





  These comments are borne out in the research findings and recommendations of
  education experts like Dr. Robert Balfanz of the Everyone Graduates Center at
  Johns Hopkins and Dr. William Daggett of the International Center for
  Leadership on Education. The Minds on Fire model incorporates these concepts
  through use of studentled, projectbased learning with immediate goals and
  opportunity for success. The classroomlevel support allows facilitates
  exciting learning in personalized, smallgroup work among students.  


   


  Los Angeles is home to a disproportionate number of America’s Dropout
  Factories — schools in which less than 60% of students who enter high school
  in 9th grade graduate on time. Minds on Fire will focus outreach to schools
  that feed into these Dropout Factories and where middle school students are
  most likely to be struggling. By targeting these ‘feeder’ middle schools, we
  can reduce the dropout rates in the schools hurt most by a loss of students. 






  We can identify which students are most likely to dropout of school in high
  school based on their middle school performance (2). Dr. Balfanz coined the
  term ‘ABCs to describe these indicators — Attendance, Behavior and Course
  performance. His research is echoed in the findings of others, including the
  California Dropout Prevention Center. Minds on Fire will work with students
  who demonstrate risk for dropping out based on use of the ABCs — students who:


   Attend school less than 80 percent of the time


   Have repeated behavior problems and/or problems that are mild but sustained


   Fail one or more courses, particularly in math or English.


   


  Education Secretary Arne Duncan said in 2011 “As a target for school reform,
  the middle grades present the last, best opportunity for educators to reach
  all students—and not just those who persist and thrive in high school.” Minds
  on Fire deploys a classroomlevel reform model to increase the likelihood of at
  riskstudents leaving middle school prepared to succeed and graduate from high
  school. In the first year of operation we plan to serve 300 youth in up to six
  schools, helping that many of the most atrisk middle school students stay on
  the path to graduation. By Year 3 of operations we will be serving 1,500
  students per year, a figure large enough to have a significant impact on the
  9th grade dropout rate. In the 201011 school year, 3,000 9th graders dropped
  out of LAUSD schools.

What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >+
  Minds on Fire is in the startup phase. However, the organization’s founder
  created and piloted a similar model in New York City public schools as part of
  Mayor Bloomberg’s inaugural NYC Civic Corps in 2009, an initiative launched in
  partnership with AmeriCorps VISTA to engage people across that city in
  volunteerism. The Minds on Fire model is shaped by the successes and learnings
  taken from that pilot, in combination with a deep understanding of the Los
  Angeles education landscape and challenges specific to our school system.






  In the NYC Civic Corps program, a threemember team of VISTA Volunteers engaged
  197 student and teacherleaders  and 4,721 students across 58 schools in the
  development and implementation of service and service learning opportunities. 


Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  MOF is in the process of developing partnerships with schools and community
  agencies. The most critical partnerships will be with the individual teachers
  and school leaders in MOF schools. We will also work with the education
  management organizations that have oversight for likely MOF schools along with
  leaders of the LAUSD. Other partnerships will be based on the needs of the
  specific communities in which students are implementing their projects. We
  will develop new partnerships and collaborations with community agencies,
  businesses and local government as defined by project needs. MOF is also
  engaging with foundations to build a sustainable future for the
  organization.  
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >+
  Minds on Fire will use a rigorous evaluation tool to identify and measure the
  impact of Minds on Fire on participating students. Key to our approach will be
  comparing data for participating students against nonparticipating students
  from the same school and schools with similar characteristics where Minds on
  Fire is not in place.






  The evaluation will utilize a combination of quantitative and qualitative data
  to provide a full picture of impact on student and community.






  Attendance — Use school attendance data to track (1) all student attendance
  levels and (2) change in number of students who miss 20 or more days of school
  in a year  






  Behavior disruptions — Use school level data to measure (1) number of behavior
  infractions and (2) change in number of students with 2 or more infractions






  Classroom grades — Use District data and teacherdata and to (1) track number
  of classes failed by participating students, (2) compare student grades in
  classes and individual class units using MOF approach with nonparticipating
  students. 






  CST scores — Use District data to evaluate impact on CST scores in relevant
  content areas. 






  Student hope, engagement and college aspiration  Use a modified version the
  Gallup Student Poll tool to track student’s feelings before and after
  participating in MOF. Gallup polling has found a strong correlation between
  the factors of student hopefulness, engagement and wellbeing to college
  success. Hope in particular is shown to be a stronger predictor than GPA or
  test scores (1).  






  Teacher satisfaction — Develop a teacher poll in collaboration with
  participating schools to measure teachers’ feelings about value and impact of
  program.






  School and Teacher Quality — Utilize LAUSD data as available for school and
  teacher contributions to Academic Growth over Time.


   


  Connectedness — Measure (1) participation in quarterly teacher/community ‘link
  and learn’ events, (2) student use of MOF blog to share ideas and (3)
  participation in yearend celebration event. 






  Community Impact — Track number of students who complete community projects,
  specific impact to the community of projects.






  Persistence through high school — Use district data to follow students’
  progression through high school. Increased number of atrisk students
  persisting through high school and graduating on time. 3,000 students dropped
  out of LAUSD schools in the year between the end of 8th grade and the end of
  9th grade in 2012.

How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: "Over time, Minds on Fire will build a corps of young leaders with the skills, confidence and commitment to effectively address challenges in their communities. They will enter high school prepared to graduate on time, with aspirations for college, career and civic life. \n\n\n\n\n\nAnd while the mission of Minds on Fire is to decrease the dropout rate for Los Angeles’s most atrisk middle school students, this project will have additional benefits spanning student achievement, youth development, teacher quality and communitywide engagement. \n\n\n\n\n\nMinds on Fire will start by working with 300 students across six schools. If that rate continues through 2050 (a conservative estimate), over 11,000 students will have participated. \n\n\n\n\n\nBecause Minds on Fire looks at the Early Warning Indicators to identify students most at risk of dropping out, we will help students who would otherwise have dropped out succeed in school. They will develop the skills necessary for a successful postsecondary experience and in the workforce, namely: time management, collaboration, creative thinking, research and the academic skills that form the basis for these projects. \n\n\n\n\n\n28,000 students drop out of school in LA County each year. 12,500 dropped out of LAUSD schools in 2011(1).  If only 1,000 more students made it to graduation, there would still be a significant impact on the economy: They would likely (2):\n\n\n*\tEarn as much as $15 million in additional earnings in an average year;\n\n\n*\tSpend an additional $900,000 each year purchasing vehicles    \n\n\n*\tSpend up to $45 million more on homes than they would likely spend without a diploma; and\n\n\n*\tSupport as many as 130 new jobs in the region\n\n\n*\tIncrease the gross regional product by up to $21 million, and pour as much as an additional $1.8 million annually into state and local coffers, all through their increased spending and investments.\n\n\n \n\n\nImproving graduation rates has a positive impact on community life. That, combined with the specifically communityproblemsolving focus of this initiative would lead to an improvement in Los Angeles residents’ life expectancy, health status, and voting rates while also reducing the crime rate and the associated costs to incarcerate criminals (3).  \n\n\n\n\n\nYoung people across the country have already demonstrated their power to make change. Imagine if LA had thousands more young people exploring their own ideas for change — the potential is impossible to calculate, and a very real possibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\tCA Dept. of Education DataQuest; 20092010 Dropouts by Cohort\n\n\n(2)\thttp://www.all4ed.org/files/LosAngelesCA_leb.pdf\n\n\nhttp://www.all4ed.org/publication_material/EconStatesPostsecondary  \n\n\n(3) Source: http://www.measureofamerica.org/docs/APortraitOfCA.pdf \n\n\n\n\n\n"
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  An education system that significantly enhances human development is one that
  provides all children with not only a path to college, but also with the
  knowledge, skills and experiences to build fulfilling lives, however the
  individual defines that term. And it is a system that inspires confidence in
  all families and teachers who are part of it, in which the zip code in which
  one lives has no bearing on the quality of education one has access to.   






  In this future, schools will have earned the public support they need to
  function at the highest possible level —  so teachers, community members,
  parents and students together can foster an excitement for learning.
