title: Peace to Prosperity
project_summary: "CIS has been in the business of improving public safety for over 19 years. As a world champion in martial arts and kickboxing, CIS Executive Director, Blinky Rodriguez has a long history of working with youth. The work became personal in 1990 when Blinky himself fell victim to gang violence. Sonny, his 16-year-old son was killed in a drive-by shooting. In court, Blinky met the three killers face-to-face, not for retribution, but to forgive them. Through a series of meetings, he subsequently negotiated a truce, called The Valley Unity Peace Treaty, which was signed by over 75 gangs with over 1,000 members. The treaty successfully reduced gang-related deaths from 62 to 2 in the first year. The peace treaty project became CIS San Fernando Valley, a non-profit organization in 1994. Blinky approached long-time friend Bobby Arias, then Southwest Regional Director for Communities In Schools, Inc. and solicited his assistance in developing an “integrated service delivery approach” for gang youth. Since the tragedy of Sonny’s death, Blinky and Bobby have dedicated their lives to improve and promote public safety by ending youth and gang violence and helping young people transform their lives.\r\n\r\nCIS is one of the first organizations in LA to deliver services exclusively to gang-involved and gang-oriented youth and young adults within a cohesive, integrated, wrap-around service delivery strategy aimed at addressing root causes. These wrap-around services integrate violence prevention, gang intervention, parenting, mentoring, intensive case management, recreation/sports, therapeutic/mental health counseling, life skills and job development based on the individual needs of each client. A critical element within our model is engaging clients in sporting events. These sporting events displace hostility and violence and have proven to be some of the most effective CIS communal public safety intervention activities. They lead to improved quality of life and restoration of community peace, togetherness and tranquility.\r\n\r\nThe idea we propose to LA2050 to improve public safety is our “CIS GAMES FOR PEACE”. The goal of CIS GAMES FOR PEACE is to showcase how CIS can prevent violence through well designed and coordinated sporting events. For example, a flag football game back in 1993 between rival gang members was the pivotal event that helped CIS solidify the historic Valley Unity Peace Treaty. This was a groundbreaking, paradigm busting, first of its kind phenomenon in the realm of peacekeeping in LA. That original football game morphed into a world renowned blueprint for peace acknowledged by the United Nations. CIS has since then conducted 252 sporting events that bring together potential enemies, reduce friction, encourages harmonious communication and prevent violence. \r\n \r\nOur CIS GAMES FOR PEACE would include a series of basketball, handball, softball and football events. We will conduct a minimum of 25 events each year partnering with Dept. of Recreation & Parks, LAPD and other law enforcement agencies and elected officials to ensure ongoing community safety.\r\n \r\nIn addition, we would make boxing instruction available to this underserved population through our CIS Heart of Champions Boxing Academy. This instruction would take place at a local boxing gym where participants will receive professional boxing instruction. The Academy will provide a positive alternative to gang life for participants and significantly enhance their health, physical fitness and abilities, sense of pride, self-worth, cooperativeness and respect for others. We believe that participation in this program will have profound impact on our youth. Academy youth will be required to take our anger management/mediation class as a pre-requisite to participate in the academy. The curriculum will consist of beginning boxing and kickboxing principles. Those who wish will be allowed to participate in the Golden Gloves program facilitated by the gym. The program will provided participants with a Heart of Champions membership, T-shirt, mouthpiece and hand wraps.\r\n\r\nWe feel this idea will impact public safety by reducing crime and while also improving health. Crime rates are at historic lows throughout the county. Still, the experience of crime and perceptions of safety vary widely along racial and socioeconomic lines. Areas of concentrated poverty tend to have higher rates of violent crime. By participating in CIS GAMES FOR PEACE, youth and young adults will be engaged in positive activities and away from crime. As noted by LA2050, safety and security is “a core element for the well-being of individuals and society as a whole.”2Crime can lead to loss of life and property; it has detrimental physical and mental health consequences; it can reduce economic productivity; and, most detrimentally, it creates a pervasive feeling of vulnerability. By participating in CIS GAMES FOR PEACE, youth and young adults will have ready access to mobile health screening and other services."

  description1: "Numerous national and international leaders including Nelson Mandela, Jimmy Carter, Dr. Jane Goodall, Al Gore and Barbara Boxer have recognized the work of Blinky and CIS. CIS violence prevention and intervention practices have been replicated in the USA, Germany, Tanzania, England and South Africa. In 1998, Blinky received the Medaille d’Excellence, presented in Switzerland to only 14 people worldwide in conjunction with the 50th anniversary of the United Nation’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Blinky has earned over eighty-three awards for his work. He was selected by LA Mayor James Hahn, A&E Television and their Biography series as a 2002 Biography Community Hero for his service to LA. Blinky and the staff of CIS were featured in the November 2002 Reader's Digest article on \"Everyday Heroes\". In 2003, he received the Angel of Peace Award from the Violence Prevention Coalition of Greater LA, The SFV Interfaith Council Human Relations Award, Simon Bolivar Liberty Award and was appointed by Mayor Hahn to The Commission for Children, Youth & Their Families.

  success: "CIS has successfully demonstrated that it can deliver results. CIS became the subject of a study, funded in 1999 by the California State Legislature conducted by Cal State University at Northridge. Over 1,200 people were interviewed during the CSUN evaluation. Among the interviewees were kids, gang members, teachers, probation officers, parents, police officers and local citizens. The following is a sample of the responses:\r\n\r\n•\t“They (CIS) are there day and night; any time…it’s had a tremendous positive impact.”\r\n•\t“For them (the youth) to be part of the program, it makes them feel wanted, loved and understood. It makes the community feel more trust.”\r\n•\t“Now, you don’t have to worry as much. You can feel comfortable in the park. People have birthday parties in the parks now. You couldn’t do that before-not and feel safe.”\r\n•\t“CIS teaches kids how to work their way up. It gives them self-confidence to get a job, teaches them about expectation on the job, teaches them how to make a living and has helped kids get jobs, especially through Local 300.”\r\n\r\nMore recently a five year evaluation of CIS conducted by one of the nation’s foremost social science evaluations firms, ICF International from Fairfax Virginia, showed:\r\n\r\n•\tThe CIS Model yields substantive improvements in school and student level outcomes on credit completion, academics and attendance and is unique in among other dropout prevention programs in reducing dropout and increasing graduation rates.\r\n•\tStudents that receive CIS case management services successfully navigate the critical 6th to 9th grade transition better than those students that do not receive CIS services.\r\n•\tStudent outcomes were significantly better for those who received CIS case-management services for two and three years, rather than just one year, proving that the long term effects of sustained engagement with CIS were substantial.\r\n•\tThe greatest outcomes for schools and students resulted from CIS’s strong business practices, strong CIS leadership and strong school administration and teacher participation.\r\n•\tthe CIS Model resulted in the strongest reduction in dropout rates of over 1600 existing fully scaled dropout prevention program evaluated by ICF\r\n\r\nCIS was evaluated over three years (2005-2008) by Dr. Jorja Leap, PH.D. and a team from the Department of Social Welfare at the UCLA School of Public Policy funded by the California Wellness Foundation. It showed “CIS has demonstrated substantive impact on the lives of the youth it works to serve.  Further, the program has shown to be a steadying force in their lives as well as a source of support in a community that has few such resources available to its families.” Under LA2050, we will have specialized data collected and analyzed by another UCLA team. This evaluation team will write a comprehensive analysis of the results and the report will assess the effectiveness of our work; analyze Process data, numbers of clients, units of service and evidence of intended outcomes.\r\n"

  description: "Our CIS GAMES FOR PEACE project would benefit Los Angeles in a number of ways. Specifically, our CIS GAMES FOR PEACE participants come from communities with some of the lowest income and high crime areas in Los Angeles’ San Fernando Valley. They face a relentless assault of negative influences that often result in drug abuse, violence, teen pregnancy, poor academic performance, even death. By participating in CIS GAMES FOR PEACE, youth and young adults will develop the skills, abilities, relationships and associations necessary to foster self-esteem, persistence, perseverance and positive attitudes to overcome negative influences.\r\n\r\nNext, the project follows evidence-based models already proven to be effective. Two significant studies, Yin (1986) and Spergel (1989) evaluated strategies typically used to deal with gangs and delinquency. Both studies found that the most effective were:\r\n\r\n•\tCommunity Organization- comprehensive interagency cooperation and community cohesion among grass roots organizations, law enforcement agencies along with job development \r\n\r\n•\tProviding Alternative Opportunities-other activities such as sports, recreation, youth service, job training and placement\r\n\r\nCIS services and our Wrap-around service delivery strategy are in line with the “Spergel Model” and incorporate all elements of the model. \r\n\r\nOur special connection with youth and sports has been long, consistent and one of the most highly successful elements of the public safety methodology. The 252 baseball, softball, football, basketball and soccer games and tournaments that CIS has conducted have been highly effective tools in enhancing communication, reducing violence and improving the quality of life for all members of the community. The LA Times February 20, 1994 praised the football game that marked the 110th day of the Valley Unity Peace Treaty. Since then, scores of newspaper articles have documented the importance of these sporting events in helping youth avoid gangs and violence. In 2004, CIS hosted the first ever softball game between LA County Probation Gang Unit Officers and former/current gang members to enhance communication and improve relationships. In August 2005, CIS in partnership with the LAPD, hosted the 5th Annual LAPD Celebrity Swing-A-Thon.\r\n\r\nThe most significant and fundamental benefit to LA is that youth and individuals formally considered as “throw-away” are re-energized with hope and can contribute positively to our society. These are individuals that others have “given up on” and who have been called the “lepers” of society. They are gang-involved or gang oriented youth and young adults who, despite their past behaviors, have demonstrated a sincere willingness to turn their lives around and become productive members of society. LA or any city and community can benefit when souls, spirits and minds are uplifted and redirected toward positive action.\r\n"

    Partners will be LAPD, United Methodist Church, USC, UCLA, CSUN, Mission
    College and xx Boxing Gym. CIS now uses the church gym to provide services
    to gang members in a safe setting who otherwise would not be able to
    congregate because of LAPD gang injunctions. Activities include basketball
    tournaments for youth, zumba classes and self improvement workshops for
    mothers and swap meets for community bargain hunting at the site. USC, UCLA,
    CSUN and Cal State LA will provide interns as mentors/tutors for gang youth.
    Mission College will provide job training, job placement, GED and other
    educational services.

  Organization Name: 'Communities In Schools of San Fernando Valley, Inc.'
  description3: "Although there are a number of fine organizations that provide services to “at-risk” and “high risk” youth in our community, CIS is the only organization in the San Fernando Valley that delivers services exclusively to gang-involved and gang-oriented youth and young adults. In fact many of those other organizations will not accept these youth into their programs; instead refer them to CIS. Simply put, without CIS, this population would otherwise go unserved due to their gang affiliations and would most probably contribute negatively to public safety.\r\n\r\nCertainly, these other organizations now “compete” with CIS in the Valley for new grants and resources that have recently become available for gang intervention and prevention programs. However these organizations typically have a very defined and linear focus that heretofore did not include hard core gang intervention. For example, IADARP is a substance abuse organization and only recently started purporting to work in gang intervention. These organizations follow a traditional structured approach. CIS conversely follows a very unique and untraditional approach toward violence reduction and public safety.  What differentiates CIS from these other organizations is our “wrap-around service delivery” model which is multi-dimensional and incorporates intervention, prevention, community mobilization, mental health, case management, job development and other methodologies.\r\n\r\nWhen you ask CIS to define its competition in a public safety context, it is helpful to look at the question from the perspective of the Los Angeles Police Department. In the realm of actually working with gang youth to enhance public safety, CIS has no competition. No other organization can compete with CIS regarding our established relationship with the LAPD Valley Bureau. In fact as far back as 2003, then Deputy Chief Ron Bergman, Valley Bureau, said at a news conference discussing gang violence, in respect to dealing with the gang population… “CIS is the only game in town.”\r\n\r\nSimilarly, other LAPD comments regarding CIS and its value in addressing gangs and enhancing public safety include the following:\r\n\r\nCapt. Bruce E. Crosley, Commanding Officer, North Hollywood Area, said , “request specific participation from Blinky Rodriguez (Communities In Schools) and allow his successful interventions to continue unfettered.” \r\n\r\nThe LA Police Commission recognized the value and role of CIS by featuring CIS Executive Director Blinky Rodriguez on their cable TV show “Your Police Commission”, and also featured a youth who had “exited” gang life and was now enrolled in college as a result of CIS efforts.\r\n\r\nIn the final analysis, no other organization in the Valley is on call, around the clock, 365 days a year, on a 24/7 basis to enhance public safety like CIS.\r\n"
  vision: "Gang Violence is a plague that potentially threatens the health of every man, woman and child throughout Los Angeles on a daily basis. Victims can be rich, poor or innocent bystanders of any race or age. You or someone you know could be exposed and afflicted at any time, either at home or away from home. This plague takes rank with other significant Public Safety issues that result in death and destruction within in our communities.\r\n\r\nHave you ever heard a gunshot in your neighborhood, in your home? Has your child? Please stop for a minute and think about it. Close your eyes and put yourself there. We believe that in 2050 the success in Public Safety would look like a community where none of us ever has to endure that experience.\r\n\r\nWe believe we can make this vision become a reality through communal public safety intervention activities that will ultimately lead to improved quality of life and restoration of community peace, togetherness and tranquility.\r\n\r\nBetween 2007 and 2008, US Congressman Tony Cardenas, (then an LA City Councilman) worked with CIS and other community stakeholders to draft public policy regarding juvenile justice, gang violence and other public safety issues. The result was a Community-Based Gang Intervention Model that provides a blueprint for the infrastructure to adequately understand gang intervention and create the appropriate mechanisms and systems to support and expand the field of gang intervention. The Model combines proactive and reactive approaches to improve the quality of life of communities through reducing violence and providing integrated human services.\r\n\r\nCommunity-based gang intervention provides specialized crisis intervention as well as ongoing attention and maintenance by skilled intervention specialists who have personal knowledge, understanding, and experience of gang life and thereby offer the greatest likelihood for gaining, building, and maintaining trust and confidence among active and former gang members. \r\n\r\nThis two-prong approach provides hardcore, specialized, street-based mediation and mitigation to stop or prevent violence between gangs and the concurrent redirection of individual gang members and their families in ways that bring progress to themselves and their communities.\r\nProng 1 is Hardcore, Specialized Street and Detention/Prison-Based Services that provide for the deployment of peacemakers on the streets, saving lives by quelling rumors, preventing and mediating conflicts, and responding to crises. Prong 2 is Gang-Responsive/Specific Individual & Family Services that deliver rehabilitative services to gang-involved and affiliated individuals, families, and communities. \r\n\r\nCIS is a community-based organization that is in the business of saving lives. Our work using the two-prong Model results in enhanced public safety rather than fear and apprehension, an environment of support rather than rejection and a new population of young people re-energized with self-confidence, self-esteem and future."

  CIS has been in the business of improving public safety for over 19 years. As
  a world champion in martial arts and kickboxing, CIS Executive Director,
  Blinky Rodriguez has a long history of working with youth. The work became
  personal in 1990 when Blinky himself fell victim to gang violence. Sonny, his
  16yearold son was killed in a driveby shooting. In court, Blinky met the three
  killers facetoface, not for retribution, but to forgive them. Through a series
  of meetings, he subsequently negotiated a truce, called The Valley Unity Peace
  Treaty, which was signed by over 75 gangs with over 1,000 members. The treaty
  successfully reduced gangrelated deaths from 62 to 2 in the first year. The
  peace treaty project became CIS San Fernando Valley, a nonprofit organization
  in 1994. Blinky approached longtime friend Bobby Arias, then Southwest
  Regional Director for Communities In Schools, Inc. and solicited his
  assistance in developing an “integrated service delivery approach” for gang
  youth. Since the tragedy of Sonny’s death, Blinky and Bobby have dedicated
  their lives to improve and promote public safety by ending youth and gang
  violence and helping young people transform their lives.






  CIS is one of the first organizations in LA to deliver services exclusively to
  ganginvolved and gangoriented youth and young adults within a cohesive,
  integrated, wraparound service delivery strategy aimed at addressing root
  causes. These wraparound services integrate violence prevention, gang
  intervention, parenting, mentoring, intensive case management,
  recreation/sports, therapeutic/mental health counseling, life skills and job
  development based on the individual needs of each client. A critical element
  within our model is engaging clients in sporting events. These sporting events
  displace hostility and violence and have proven to be some of the most
  effective CIS communal public safety intervention activities. They lead to
  improved quality of life and restoration of community peace, togetherness and
  tranquility.






  The idea we propose to LA2050 to improve public safety is our “CIS GAMES FOR
  PEACE”. The goal of CIS GAMES FOR PEACE is to showcase how CIS can prevent
  violence through well designed and coordinated sporting events. For example, a
  flag football game back in 1993 between rival gang members was the pivotal
  event that helped CIS solidify the historic Valley Unity Peace Treaty. This
  was a groundbreaking, paradigm busting, first of its kind phenomenon in the
  realm of peacekeeping in LA. That original football game morphed into a world
  renowned blueprint for peace acknowledged by the United Nations. CIS has since
  then conducted 252 sporting events that bring together potential enemies,
  reduce friction, encourages harmonious communication and prevent violence. 


   


  Our CIS GAMES FOR PEACE would include a series of basketball, handball,
  softball and football events. We will conduct a minimum of 25 events each year
  partnering with Dept. of Recreation & Parks, LAPD and other law enforcement
  agencies and elected officials to ensure ongoing community safety.


   


  In addition, we would make boxing instruction available to this underserved
  population through our CIS Heart of Champions Boxing Academy. This instruction
  would take place at a local boxing gym where participants will receive
  professional boxing instruction. The Academy will provide a positive
  alternative to gang life for participants and significantly enhance their
  health, physical fitness and abilities, sense of pride, selfworth,
  cooperativeness and respect for others. We believe that participation in this
  program will have profound impact on our youth. Academy youth will be required
  to take our anger management/mediation class as a prerequisite to participate
  in the academy. The curriculum will consist of beginning boxing and kickboxing
  principles. Those who wish will be allowed to participate in the Golden Gloves
  program facilitated by the gym. The program will provided participants with a
  Heart of Champions membership, Tshirt, mouthpiece and hand wraps.






  We feel this idea will impact public safety by reducing crime and while also
  improving health. Crime rates are at historic lows throughout the county.
  Still, the experience of crime and perceptions of safety vary widely along
  racial and socioeconomic lines. Areas of concentrated poverty tend to have
  higher rates of violent crime. By participating in CIS GAMES FOR PEACE, youth
  and young adults will be engaged in positive activities and away from crime.
  As noted by LA2050, safety and security is “a core element for the wellbeing
  of individuals and society as a whole.”2Crime can lead to loss of life and
  property; it has detrimental physical and mental health consequences; it can
  reduce economic productivity; and, most detrimentally, it creates a pervasive
  feeling of vulnerability. By participating in CIS GAMES FOR PEACE, youth and
  young adults will have ready access to mobile health screening and other
  services.
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >+
  Numerous national and international leaders including Nelson Mandela, Jimmy
  Carter, Dr. Jane Goodall, Al Gore and Barbara Boxer have recognized the work
  of Blinky and CIS. CIS violence prevention and intervention practices have
  been replicated in the USA, Germany, Tanzania, England and South Africa. In
  1998, Blinky received the Medaille d’Excellence, presented in Switzerland to
  only 14 people worldwide in conjunction with the 50th anniversary of the
  United Nation’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Blinky has earned over
  eightythree awards for his work. He was selected by LA Mayor James Hahn, A&E
  Television and their Biography series as a 2002 Biography Community Hero for
  his service to LA. Blinky and the staff of CIS were featured in the November
  2002 Reader's Digest article on "Everyday Heroes". In 2003, he received the
  Angel of Peace Award from the Violence Prevention Coalition of Greater LA, The
  SFV Interfaith Council Human Relations Award, Simon Bolivar Liberty Award and
  was appointed by Mayor Hahn to The Commission for Children, Youth & Their
  Families. The following is a sample of our achievements:


   


  Helped reduce gangrelated deaths from 62 to 2 in one year



  Connected over 1300 youths with mentors  



  Helped place 554 people in jobs



  Helped place 220 people in college



  Conducted over 252 Sports Events with over 11,000 participants



  Conducted over 106 Peace Rallies/Community Events with over 50,000 attendees






  The Public Safety and peacekeeping efforts of CIS were the subject of a 1999
  study, funded by the California State Legislature under AB 2650. Conducted by
  Cal State University at Northridge, it found the peace treaty to be effective
  in demonstrating peacekeeping strategies and recommended that it be replicated
  statewide. CIS has been named the “model” program for gang intervention by the
  State of California, LA County and the City of LA.






  A most significant achievement occurred in 2012. After a journey that exceeded
  eleven years, CIS celebrated the grand opening of our Job Training &
  Opportunity Center on October 22, 2012. The Center has been a dream since 2001
  when CIS first realized the positive impact that having a job had on helping
  youth continue their education and avoid violence. The Center’s construction
  was funded by a partnership between the County of Los Angeles, the City of Los
  Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency and the U. S. Dept. of Housing and
  Urban Development (HUD). The Center represents an unprecedented joint
  partnership between CIS and LA County Probation. Under a tenyear rentfree
  lease, the brand new CIS Job Training & Opportunity Center sits on County land
  and houses job training, educational and other support services programs.
  County Probation officers share the facility with CIS to serve probationary
  youth, dropouts and their families. CIS will maximize the Probation
  partnership and relationships to ensure job readiness service delivery for
  participants is effective, well coordinated and well managed.

It gives them selfconfidence to get a job, teaches them about expectation on the job, teaches them how to make a living and has helped kids get jobs, especially through Local 300.”\n\n\n\n\n\nMore recently a five year evaluation of CIS conducted by one of the nation’s foremost social science evaluations firms, ICF International from Fairfax Virginia, showed:\n\n\n\n\n\n*\tThe CIS Model yields substantive improvements in school and student level outcomes on credit completion, academics and attendance and is unique in among other dropout prevention programs in reducing dropout and increasing graduation rates.\n\n\n*\tStudents that receive CIS case management services successfully navigate the critical 6th to 9th grade transition better than those students that do not receive CIS services.\n\n\n*\tStudent outcomes were significantly better for those who received CIS casemanagement services for two and three years, rather than just one year, proving that the long term effects of sustained engagement with CIS were substantial.\n\n\n*\tThe greatest outcomes for schools and students resulted from CIS’s strong business practices, strong CIS leadership and strong school administration and teacher participation.\n\n\n*\tthe CIS Model resulted in the strongest reduction in dropout rates of over 1600 existing fully scaled dropout prevention program evaluated by ICF\n\n\n\n\n\nCIS was evaluated over three years (20052008) by Dr. Jorja Leap, PH.D. and a team from the Department of Social Welfare at the UCLA School of Public Policy funded by the California Wellness Foundation. It showed “CIS has demonstrated substantive impact on the lives of the youth it works to serve.  Further, the program has shown to be a steadying force in their lives as well as a source of support in a community that has few such resources available to its families.” Under LA2050, we will have specialized data collected and analyzed by another UCLA team. This evaluation team will write a comprehensive analysis of the results and the report will assess the effectiveness of our work; analyze Process data, numbers of clients, units of service and evidence of intended outcomes.\n\n\n"
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: "Our CIS GAMES FOR PEACE project would benefit Los Angeles in a number of ways. Specifically, our CIS GAMES FOR PEACE participants come from communities with some of the lowest income and high crime areas in Los Angeles’ San Fernando Valley. They face a relentless assault of negative influences that often result in drug abuse, violence, teen pregnancy, poor academic performance, even death. By participating in CIS GAMES FOR PEACE, youth and young adults will develop the skills, abilities, relationships and associations necessary to foster selfesteem, persistence, perseverance and positive attitudes to overcome negative influences.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, the project follows evidencebased models already proven to be effective. Two significant studies, Yin (1986) and Spergel (1989) evaluated strategies typically used to deal with gangs and delinquency. Both studies found that the most effective were:\n\n\n\n\n\n*\tCommunity Organization comprehensive interagency cooperation and community cohesion among grass roots organizations, law enforcement agencies along with job development \n\n\n\n\n\n*\tProviding Alternative Opportunitiesother activities such as sports, recreation, youth service, job training and placement\n\n\n\n\n\nCIS services and our Wraparound service delivery strategy are in line with the “Spergel Model” and incorporate all elements of the model. \n\n\n\n\n\nOur special connection with youth and sports has been long, consistent and one of the most highly successful elements of the public safety methodology. The 252 baseball, softball, football, basketball and soccer games and tournaments that CIS has conducted have been highly effective tools in enhancing communication, reducing violence and improving the quality of life for all members of the community. The LA Times February 20, 1994 praised the football game that marked the 110th day of the Valley Unity Peace Treaty. Since then, scores of newspaper articles have documented the importance of these sporting events in helping youth avoid gangs and violence. In 2004, CIS hosted the first ever softball game between LA County Probation Gang Unit Officers and former/current gang members to enhance communication and improve relationships. In August 2005, CIS in partnership with the LAPD, hosted the 5th Annual LAPD Celebrity SwingAThon.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most significant and fundamental benefit to LA is that youth and individuals formally considered as “throwaway” are reenergized with hope and can contribute positively to our society. These are individuals that others have “given up on” and who have been called the “lepers” of society. They are ganginvolved or gang oriented youth and young adults who, despite their past behaviors, have demonstrated a sincere willingness to turn their lives around and become productive members of society. LA or any city and community can benefit when souls, spirits and minds are uplifted and redirected toward positive action.\n\n\n"
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  Gang Violence is a plague that potentially threatens the health of every man,
  woman and child throughout Los Angeles on a daily basis. Victims can be rich,
  poor or innocent bystanders of any race or age. You or someone you know could
  be exposed and afflicted at any time, either at home or away from home. This
  plague takes rank with other significant Public Safety issues that result in
  death and destruction within in our communities.






  Have you ever heard a gunshot in your neighborhood, in your home? Has your
  child? Please stop for a minute and think about it. Close your eyes and put
  yourself there. We believe that in 2050 the success in Public Safety would
  look like a community where none of us ever has to endure that experience.






  We believe we can make this vision become a reality through communal public
  safety intervention activities that will ultimately lead to improved quality
  of life and restoration of community peace, togetherness and tranquility.






  Between 2007 and 2008, US Congressman Tony Cardenas, (then an LA City
  Councilman) worked with CIS and other community stakeholders to draft public
  policy regarding juvenile justice, gang violence and other public safety
  issues. The result was a CommunityBased Gang Intervention Model that provides
  a blueprint for the infrastructure to adequately understand gang intervention
  and create the appropriate mechanisms and systems to support and expand the
  field of gang intervention. The Model combines proactive and reactive
  approaches to improve the quality of life of communities through reducing
  violence and providing integrated human services.






  Communitybased gang intervention provides specialized crisis intervention as
  well as ongoing attention and maintenance by skilled intervention specialists
  who have personal knowledge, understanding, and experience of gang life and
  thereby offer the greatest likelihood for gaining, building, and maintaining
  trust and confidence among active and former gang members. 






  This twoprong approach provides hardcore, specialized, streetbased mediation
  and mitigation to stop or prevent violence between gangs and the concurrent
  redirection of individual gang members and their families in ways that bring
  progress to themselves and their communities.



  Prong 1 is Hardcore, Specialized Street and Detention/PrisonBased Services
  that provide for the deployment of peacemakers on the streets, saving lives by
  quelling rumors, preventing and mediating conflicts, and responding to crises.
  Prong 2 is GangResponsive/Specific Individual & Family Services that deliver
  rehabilitative services to ganginvolved and affiliated individuals, families,
  and communities. 






  CIS is a communitybased organization that is in the business of saving lives.
  Our work using the twoprong Model results in enhanced public safety rather
  than fear and apprehension, an environment of support rather than rejection
  and a new population of young people reenergized with selfconfidence,
  selfesteem and future.
