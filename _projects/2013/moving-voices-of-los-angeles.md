  <p>The Moving Voices of Los Angeles is an audio storytelling project for the
  digital age. It will preserve the South Bay's immigrant community's stories,
  transmitting experiences and values to future generations in its own voice.
  Moving Voices will train audio storytellers from within the community and

  </li></ul>



  <ol><li><strong>Reviving an art form</strong>



  <p>Hearing someone's voice is not the typical way we learn about stories. We
  consume stories largely through visual images. It's time that we train our
  ourselves to listen. The Moving Voices of L.A is innovative in that it will
  revive this timehonored way in conveying and receiving the stories of our
  communities, adding richness to the arts and culture of Los Angeles.</p></li>



  <li><strong>Training community artists</strong>



  <p>Moving Voices of L.A will train young adults in capturing stories of their
  communities through the voices and words from people around them. Every week,
  field interviewers will capture a story from the 16 cities, diverse ethnic
  migrant communities that make up the South Bay. Through the community's voice,
  stories will come alive, guiding the growth of the community. Training and
  support will be provided by experienced cultural workers with graduate degrees
  in social documentation, cultural anthropology, public health, and interactive

  <li><strong>Create an app to move the timehonored art form into the digital
  age</strong>



  <p>Technology is making it cheaper and easier than ever to create high quality
  photographs, video and audio. The Moving Voices app will make audio
  storytelling snap by guiding an interviewer, organizing audio and making it
  easy to publish a finished story.</p></li>



  <li><strong>Provide access to participation in the arts</strong>



  <p>Moving Voices of L.A gives community members an opportunity to engage in a
  lowcost accessible art medium through content production ,online publishing to
  a large audience and a growing community of audio storytellers.</p></li>



  <li><strong>Weave shared stories and experiences</strong>



  <p>Each week, individual stories from the diverse immigrant communities of the
  South Bay will be captured and presented online. These individual stories will
  be woven into a collective narrative that presents a rich tapestry of how the
  South Bay came to be, where it is, and where it is going. At the end of the
  year, a community exhibit and symposium will take place to celebrate the voice
  of the community.</p></li></ol>
