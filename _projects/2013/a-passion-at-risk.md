    The project is meant to inspire school districts to more fully involve
    teachers in their efforts to improve our schools. In addition, the film will
    inspire teachers to demand a more active role in how reform will be
    implemented in their classrooms. The project will be successful if education
    reform organizations embrace its message and host screenings that will start
    conversations among local teachers. In addition, we will use the website to
    promote and distribute the film online. 
  Indicator: ' Education'
  brief: "``A Passion at Risk,'' will be a 40-minute short film about teachers from throughout Los Angeles County and their opinions about the future of education reform. Since ``A Nation at Risk,'' was released 30 years, schoolteachers in Los Angeles have been working in a constant state of reform. Some who started out in their early 20s and are now approaching retirement have spent their whole careers in a sector in a constant cycle of reinvention. In this film, teachers will tell their stories about which reforms have worked and which reforms have fallen short and why. Los Angeles still has a persistent achievement gap, many failing schools and a dropout crisis. Most reforms that have not succeeded through the years have failed due to ineffective implementation. In looking back, we will find great ideas that worked and not so great ideas that led to ridiculous situations. Teachers consistently say they are left out of the conversations about reform and are just given marching orders from administrators who may be unaware of the challenges they face in their classrooms. ``A Passion at Risk,'' will give Los Angeles teachers a voice and give them the opportunity to share their visions for a more collaborative future. There will be one teacher for each grade from K-12 and they will be chosen from traditional public schools, charter schools, private and parochial schools. We will not find out until the end what ``type'' of school it is where they are teaching. They will range in age from new teachers to teachers will vast experience. There will be teachers who are union activists and others who do not belong to a union at all. The film is titled, ``A Passion at Risk,'' because so many teachers are leaving the profession despite their passion for teaching. \r\nLos Angeles is already seeing teachers come together to talk about how they can have a stronger voice in policies that impact their classroom. This film is meant to serve as an inspiration to that movement and to emphasize the importance of involving teachers in the discussion about how to dramatically improve our schools in the next 37 years.

    The education community in Los Angeles is outrageously fractured. Despite
    many attempts to improve education in Los Angeles, we still have
    persistently failing schools throughout the county. Many times we look for a
    one size fits all solution and instead of empowering teachers, we are
    imposing strict rules and regulations that may or may not benefit their work
    with their students. Currently in LAUSD, we are about to implement a new
    teacher evaluation system that will likely fail to because of opposition
    from teachers and a lack of a clear plan from administrators. This film will
    highlight the need for teachers to have a voice in the changes they will be
    asked to implement in their classrooms.

    Our organization strives to produce the most compelling education reform
    films in California. Our goal is to have impact and to support those who are
    doing the best work to increase student achievement in all schools. Through
    various projects for LAUSD and the California Charter Schools Association,
    we have developed relationships with leaders of major organizations involved
    in education reform throughout the county. 
  vision: >-
    In 2050, education in Los Angeles would be built to serve the needs of its
    students. Instead of sticking with systems just because that is always the
    way things have been done, our communities will have freedom and flexibility
    to create education programs that inspire our students to excellence. We
    will come up with funding structures that are consistent so that our schools
    are not left in a constant cycle of crisis. We will provide teachers with
    higher salaries and provide incentives to keep our best teachers in the
    classroom.
