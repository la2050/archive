title: Beautiful Rain Barrels in Public Places
indicator: ' Environmental Quality'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  We’re trying to improve water quality and conserve water through the spread of
  rain barrels. Our rain barrels (30 of them) are going to be special because
  our local artists are going to make them beautiful. Then, we’re going to
  auction them off at a media event and install them throughout the City in an
  effort to raise awareness of their use. 
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  The Venice Art Crawl has been around for more than two years now and has
  focused a lot of the artistic energy which Venice has historically been known
  for. For one night, we’re able to turn so many shops and restaurants all
  across one of the biggest tourist attractions in Los Angles into an arts
  mecca. That has raised business in local shops by as much as 50% nightly,
  resulted in thousands of dollars in sales for local artists and reinvigorated
  the arts community. 






  Alternatively, SGA has worked a lot with rain barrels, designing and
  implementing the first and only rain barrel program of its kind through Mar
  Vista. There, they promoted and installed 600 rain barrels in the
  neighborhood, resulting in 33,000 gallons of water conserved every rainfall.
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  Our biggest partner is SGA who are rain barrel experts and work with PR and
  environmental matters in LA
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >+
  Our biggest metric of success would be developing this into an ongoing
  program, like if we turned this funding into seed money basically. If we did
  that, then that would mean that we would be able to keep on creating and
  distributing eye catching rain barrels which would continue the conversation.






  In terms of the rain barrels themselves, we would like to design, promote,
  auction off and install 30 rain barrels. If we received 12 inches of rain (20%
  below the LA average of 15 inches annually) then that would fill up 36000
  gallons annually. While the weather is out of our control, we think that 36000
  gallons conserved is a good goal.


How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  It benefits LA in lots of ways! First, it’s a creative way to promote the
  concept and use of rain barrels, which would be very beneficial if used by
  every in the dry, urban area of LA. Second, 30 rain barrels get out there
  which adds up to more than 1500 gallons of water conservation (and protection)
  every time it rains. Third, because of the way we designed the auctions, if we
  can raise sufficient funds then this project becomes sustainable and can go on
  until the end of time (or at least a good couple years:)
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  Success in 2050 is easy to picture: it’s at least one functioning rain barrel
  for every home in the City…and a few extra for big buildings.






  One of the things that is so cool about rain barrels is that they are a
  simple, practical solution to two major issues (particularly major in a dry,
  urban sprawl like LA) Combining that with the artistic and community angle
  we're approaching it with, we think that success in 2050 is easily envisioned.
