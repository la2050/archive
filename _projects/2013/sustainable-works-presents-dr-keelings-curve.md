title: 'Sustainable Works Presents Dr. Keeling’s Curve '
indicator: ' Environmental Quality'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >+
  Our idea is to mount the production of Dr. Keeling’s Curve, starring Mike
  Farrell, in 10 different venues in the greater Los Angeles area, with a focus
  on reaching underserved communities. Dr. Keeling’s Curve is a play that both
  entertains and enlightens. It is the story of how one man came to discover the
  impact of carbon dioxide on our planet’s health and wellbeing. What he learned
  of course, is that the rising levels of CO2 are the primary cause of global
  warming. As a side note, when Al Gore was an undergraduate at Harvard, it was
  Dr. Keeling’s Curve that inspired his interest in the environment, which of
  course culminated in the academy award winning film An Inconvenient Truth.



  Dr. Allen Hershkowitz, the senior scientist as NRDC, said the following in an
  interview with the New York Times in October 2012: “We are dealing with a
  gigantic problem and there is no one large undertaking that any individual or
  business or country can do to solve our ecological problems. It will take
  billions of people making highly intelligent choices.”



  So how do you get billions of people to make highly intelligent choices? By
  educating them; first hundreds, then thousands, than hundreds of thousands,
  then millions, and eventually those millions add up to billions. 



  The power of live theater, done well, can be transformative. When I attended a
  performance of Dr. Keeling’s Curve at The Blank Theater, I knew Sustainable
  Works needed to bring this play to as wide an audience in Los Angeles as
  possible. By doing so, we would be educating thousands of people on the issue
  of global warming in a way that would motivate them to do something about the
  problem.  








What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  Since 1998, Sustainable Works has educated over 4,000 residents and instructed
  over 5,500 community college students on issues of sustainability.  We have
  also advised over 400 businesses so they now operate more sustainably. 
  Specifically, they conserve water and energy, produce less waste, use less
  toxic chemicals and purchase greener products.
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: The Blank Theater
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >+
  We will gauge success in 3 ways: 



  1. By the strength of performance attendance  



  2. By audience response to a brief post performance questionnaire



  3. By contributions collected for Sustainable Works. Admission to the
  performances is free.  However, following the example set by Panera Bread in
  some of their restaurants, attendees at our plays will be encouraged to pay
  whatever they feel comfortable paying.


How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  By telling the story of climate change in the form of a provocative play,
  starring a well known and respected actor, we will reach thousands of people
  who might otherwise not have been exposed to this crucial information.   
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  In our vision for the year 2050 Los Angeles would be the greenest city in the
  country and one of the greenest cities on the planet
