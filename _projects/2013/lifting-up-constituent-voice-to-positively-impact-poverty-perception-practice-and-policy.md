  LIFTing up Constituent Voice to positively impact poverty perception practice
  and policy 
indicator: ' Social Connectedness'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >+
  LIFT believes that all people, regardless of socioeconomic status, need the
  following threedimensional supports to overcome poverty’s cycle of crisis and
  move ahead in life: economic resources (money in our pocket); internal
  capabilities (selfconfidence, problem solving skills ); strong community
  networks (people in our corner). When clients come to LIFTLA for support (to
  secure housing, food security, employment, educational opportunities) they are
  immediately connected with a trained volunteer advocate who partners with them
  to navigate through the complex social service delivery systems and map to
  economic security.  LIFTLA’s premise is that 1) we all have shaky ground
  moments, regardless of income, and deserve the same types of support in times
  of crisis— dignified and caring support; 2) constituent voice is needed to
  devise systems and allocate funds that will effectively move people out of the
  cycle of poverty; and 3) an empathetic response unleashes potential for both
  individual and institutional change. To turn up the volume on constituent
  voice to debunk the myths of poverty  and erect more sound policy, our big
  idea is to bring the constituent voice to the forefront of informing and
  reforming the way we address poverty in LA.






  Myth:  Poor people do not have a voice. Author and activist, Arundhati Roy
  states that "there is no such thing as the voiceless. There are the
  deliberately silenced, or the preferably unheard." There is much that
  nonprofits can learn from the for profit sector about the benefits of acting
  on customer feedback. Companies, who are more responsive see profit margins
  3040% higher than those who do not take satisfaction into account. These gains
  are transferable to the human service delivery. The Gates Foundation, for
  instance, has found that the best way to test teacher effectiveness is, well,
  to ask the students. Furthermore, there is direct correlation with academic
  performance. Applied to our social service delivery system, it makes sense
  that if clients are able to rate their experience, it would inform and drive
  more efficient and effective programs that will better the outcomes for
  clients and communities. LIFTLA will develop an interface (like a Yelp App) to
  scale constituent voice that the county can use to evaluate the effectiveness
  of their programs and expenditures, and that funders can use to guide their
  philanthropy. Social service delivery programs will be incentivized to
  properly serve their customer!






  Myth: Only poor people face life challenges. The reality is that life is
  complicated for everyone no matter what race, gender, income level, zip code.
  So much time is spent trying to keep the pieces togetherwith child care,
  lawyers, accountants, personal assistants, family and friends in order to keep
  up the appearance having it together. LIFTLA’s Shaky Ground Moment campaign
  invites celebrities and high profile public figures (those who are at the
  forefront of keeping up appearances) to speak up about their shaky ground
  moments in order to uncover a shared understanding about what we all need in
  order to get by in crisis—moral and material support  from our networks. By
  elevating their voice in a way that we are not accustomed to, we strip down
  the sense that needing to reach out for support is a condition of poverty,
  while heightening the realization that a holistic and humanitarian response is
  as vital as material resources in times of need.  






  Myth: Poor people are weak and lazy and systems are there to help.  In
  reality, poverty is complicated and getting help should not be, but lowincome
  individuals often find themselves lacking the knowledge of overcomplicated
  matrix of community resources to find solid footing. In order to challenge
  assumptions and change perception, LIFT has developed a simulation called
  LIFTopolis, a city where social service providers are understaffed,
  underfunded, and overburdened by unmanageable caseloads, much like what occurs
  in real life. The participants in this exercise—policymakers, philanthropists,
  social services professionals, etc—assume the identity, circumstances, budget,
  and goals of a real LIFT client navigating a room of service providers and
  trying to achieve their objectives (e.g. housing for the family, stable
  income, nutritional assistance for their children, etc). Through the
  experience participants gain a greater understanding of what lowincome
  families need from a system, and they collectively build new solutions that
  can be taken to market and tested.






  Government did not design the social service system from a humancentered
  perspective, and thus is unable to address complicated and interconnected
  problems, or foster trusting relationships between service providers and the
  families that most need help.  The Shaky Ground Campaign, LIFT Yelp App, and
  the LIFTopolis simulation will bring the client voice and experience at the
  core of guiding practice and policy change.


What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  <p>LIFT is a national organization that was founded over fourteen years ago. 
  Since its founding, LIFT has helped over 70,000 low income community members
  work side by side with volunteer advocates to help them achieve their goals.
  Today, LIFT operates 11 resource centers in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New
  York, Philadelphia, and Washington D.C.. Over the last decade, LIFT has
  established a track record of success in supporting families on their path to
  economic security.  In Fiscal Year 2012, 730 advocates helped 11,000
  individuals and families move forward on path to economic selfsufficiency. At
  a time when the economic climate makes the job market hard to enter,
  affordable housing hard to find, and resources hard to secure, LIFT is telling
  a different story for its clients. Last year, LIFT generated $13.7 million in
  wage increases, tax refunds, public benefits, and housing assistance for its
  clients, providing $1,245 in value for the average client.</p>


   


  <p>As David Bornstein wrote in the New York Times (January 2012), “If the
  American Dream is to be resuscitated for many of nation’s poor, there is a
  great deal that we can learn from LIFT.”  LIFT’s  socially innovative model
  has received national and local attention



  In the NYTimes, Huffington Post, and other publications.



  At gatherings of thought leaders like the Milken Global Conference, LA 2050's
  Meet Up on Income and Employment, and Chicago Ideas.



  LIFT ED, Michelle RhoneCollins, was also able to get a mention of LIFTLA on
  HBO’s Enlightened



  LIFTLA has been on KIRN, Persian Radio, is soon to be on KPFK, and has
  garnered interest from KCRW field reporters—all with the idea of getting the
  stories of what our clients face daily in order to break the stereotypes and
  create understanding.</p>


   


  <p>After 5 years of feasibility study, a thorough environmental scan performed
  by Nike Irvin, and seed funding from the Goldhirsh Foundation, we have
  recently open up our landmark LA office in January 2013 with a beautiful
  ceremony held in March 2013.</p>


   


  <p>LIFTLA’s executive director was able to secure space in the reputable and
  likeminded Magnolia Place Family Center.</p>


   


  <p>In the year since Michelle has been on board, she has built a strong board
  including Claire Hoffman, Eric Lodal, Cash Warren, Coddy Johnson, Carrie
  Southworth, Sonia Isaacs, Tonia Davis, Laura Smolowe, and Michael Muller.
  Together they have raised over $250,000 before doors opened.</p>


   


  <p>In the 8 weeks that we have been open, we have served 90 clients, and word
  of mouth has already kicked in with community members hearing about us from
  their neighbors, in churches, and at community gatherings.</p>


   


  <p>We have already reached our capacity for advocates with volunteers coming
  from USC, UC Irvine, Azusa Pacific University, University of Phoenix, and
  Loyola Law School.  Several other colleges and universities are seeking to
  partner with us when we have space to include additional volunteers.</p>

Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >+
  LIFT is engaging Keystone Accountability, a London based evaluation firm which
  helps nonprofits and foundations develop better ways of measuring and
  reporting social change, to develop and test its constituent voice system.
  Constituent voice is a groundbreaking program management tool that provides
  nonprofits with a way to measure performance against their intended results
  while fostering relationships of trust between staff/volunteers and their
  program participants. Nonprofit organizations working for social change lack a
  unifying performance management principle to ensure they are making progress
  towards their mission. Constituent Voice makes the perspectives of the people
  who are meant to enjoy the benefits of the social service— the primary
  constituents — visible to decision makers at the organization. The voices of
  participants should be central to performance measurement and decisionmaking.
  Constituent voice provides a constant stream of feedback data that
  organizations use to be accountable to the experiences of their constituents
  and improve performance. By combining feedback data with other evidence of
  results (e.g. job and housing placements, increased savings), constituent
  voice helps nonprofits discover which feedback is most predictive of
  participant and overall program success. The process includes: 






  1) Collect Feedback: Ask constituents a rotating series of 2 to 5 questions
  after every meeting through a



  confidential survey.



  2) Analyze Data: Interpret feedback alongside other data sets (e.g. economic
  outcomes, 3rd party evaluations, observations).



  3) Refine Program: Review program effectiveness and assess staff/volunteer
  performance against feedback data. Develop plans for improvement and highlight
  areas of success.



  4) Report Back to Constituents: Validate feedback and dialogue with
  respondents about the plan for improvement.



  5) Share with the Public: Report feedback results and program adjustments to
  clients, donors, partners, and the general public.






  LIFTLA will utilize the data gathered through constituent voice to inform
  program design and improve overall performance. The feedback that clients
  provide through ongoing surveys will directly affect decisionmaking at all
  levels of the organization — from our top executives to program staff to
  volunteers. By comparing this work with economic outcome data, LIFTLA will
  make adjustments that respond directly to the needs of our clients. We are
  committed to continually refining our program to ensure it provides the
  highest possible value to our clients.  






  LIFTLA's proven humanitarian approach should receive attention from
  influencers in policy to rate their own programs, discover gaps, and consider
  adopting similar carebased strategies to their own service delivery systems.We
  will leverage our results to impact broader perception, policy, and practice
  in the social service sector  establishing LIFT as a leader in the
  conversation around effective approaches to fighting poverty.


How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
  In some LA neighborhoods, 2 in 3 people are living in or close to poverty! The
  problem is more than income, it is about the systems that fail to help
  families get a toehold, and ultimately, discourage them from achieving their
  goals. Services are often fragmented, bureaucratic, and are built on the
  stereotypes that uphold the belief that those with less resource are to blame
  for their circumstance. In contrast, what we find every day in LIFT offices is
  great resilience, resourcefulness, and endurance that exists in the face of
  tremendous challenges and stigmas of poverty. LIFTLA knows that systems built
  on false premise of who poor people are and what poor people need perpetuate
  the cycle of poverty (50% of those who move out of poverty will fall back into
  poverty in a year’s time). It is due to this builtin shortsightedness that
  billions are spent annually in the fight against poverty without moving the
  needle significantly over the decade. This is an economic issue for all
  Angelenos, but also one of social connectedness. A critical piece of the
  puzzle is still missing: relationships and understanding, aka social capital.
  We have all faced moments of crisis in our lives when we relied on the
  guidance and emotional support of friends and family to help us overcome
  seemingly insurmountable challenges. Likewise, community members struggling
  with poverty need more than financial assistance; they need help accessing
  services; they need social connections and emotional supports; they need an
  empowered voice. 






  LIFTLA’s model features volunteerism, empathy, and resource connections that
  are clientcentered attending to both immediate needs and long term
  aspirations. On average, LIFT helps clients secure 2.5 major outcomes —
  employment, housing, healthcare  per family. LIFT’s model has been vetted by
  the Robin Hood Foundation to have a ROI of 3:1. LIFT’s approach demonstrates
  how a humanoriented safety net system might work for LA.






  The Shaky Ground Campaign combined with LIFTopolis helps to shift the
  perception of poverty to create the stage for client centered evaluation.
  Channels for developing empathy are created through our constituent voice
  strategies. The LIFT app will allow for clients to speak up about how well (or
  not) they have been helped by a given provider. Constituent Voice is at the
  forefront of innovation in the public sector; the world largest charity rater,
  Charity Navigator, recently added constituent voice to its new set of rating
  criteria. This rating informing philanthropy provides huge incentive for
  optimal service delivery which would in turn create a more economically just
  LA. This voice, when heeded, has the power to change policy to more
  effectively allocate tax and philanthropic dollars to create economic
  opportunities for individuals and transform communities. Empathy + Consumer
  driven evaluative measurement = Empowered change!


What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >+
  LIFTLA’s deployment of these strategies will provide a cuttingedge model for
  other nonprofits and government agencies to improve performance and adapt
  their programs to better meet constituent needs. In doing so, we will
  fundamentally change how we design and deploy social service programs
  throughout the county.   Through the Shaky Ground Campaign and LIFTopolis, by
  2050, there will be a changed perception of people who are poor an important
  step that needs to be made in order to bring about effective policy. Because
  of being able to make connections to personal shaky ground moments, people
  will begin to break down the walls of "other" and start to think of what we
  all need when reaching out for help.  And then recognize, through LIFTopolis,
  that it is neither fair nor just that proper dignified treatment is not in
  place for people when most vulnerable. Constituent voice will provide the data
  for organizations to improve programs and the subsequent results needed to
  lead the conversation about effective solutions to the persistent problem of
  poverty. Client feedback will demonstrate how a welcoming office environment,
  trusting relationships, and exceptional customer service support client
  progress on the path to economic stability.  Constituent voice will prove that
  the “soft skills” that clients develop during their engagement with LIFT
  (selfconfidence, problem solving) are not soft at all; they are what drives
  longterm change in clients’ lives.  






  By incorporating constituent voice as the anchor of our evaluation strategy,
  by 2050, we will prove LIFT’s core hypothesis: If clients receive support
  across all three dimensions of wellbeing  economic, internal, and community 
  they will accelerate their economic gains and sustain them over time. 
  Funding, and tax dollars would be well spent in actually helping someone to
  move to a place of well being and stability, not just barely getting by.
  Together, we will raise the bar for the entire social service system — helping
  lowincome families across the county achieve their dreams. Social service
  delivery programs will finally live up to its name, delivering individuals out
  of the cycle of poverty through social connectedness.
