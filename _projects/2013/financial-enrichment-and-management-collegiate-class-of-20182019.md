    Evaluation of the project will be in the form of weekly student activity
    logs, pre and post surveys, quizzes, and monitoring of the students. Our
    success will be measured by monitoring student participation in the weekly
    student activities and workshops, success of the students in using their
    money effectively during workshops and activities, as well as their scores
    from the pre-quiz to the post quiz for the program.

    Statistics from the California High School Performance Reports presented by
    the State Department of Education indicate that only 63.5% of the Los
    Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) students graduate from high school.
    Those scoring above 50 percentile is even less. One area school, Fairfax
    High, has only a four-year competition rate of 42.3%. Without intervention,
    many of those students will drop out of school; many more will graduate
    without the necessary skills needed to succeed in life. Our classes will
    enable students to enter the workforce with more positive and realistic
    aspirations. Students statistically expected to underachieve will be
    empowered to do the opposite.

    As a non-profit organization we cater to the female youth through our
    programming. Through our philanthropy "TIJERAS," cutting through to enhance
    education opportunities, we fundraise hundreds of dollars every year to
    donate to another non-profit organization which carries out this purpose on
    a grander scale. We also serve our community through our Annual Latina Youth
    Leadership Conferences that are targeted to middle and high school students.
    We offer these students workshops about A-G Requirements, resume building,
    networking, mental health, and student panels among many others. Overall our
    organization encourages students to pursue a higher education and we offer
    them the tools and support to do so.

    In the year 2050 this group of students would have reached out to two more
    generations of students developing their financial enrichment, thus
    advancing the effect of this program implemented in 2013. Los Angeles will
    see that more high school students are prepared with the ability to
    understand and use different aspects of banking, money, and credit and its
    relation to personal income.
