title: Financial Enrichment and Management (collegiate class of 20182019)
indicator: ' Income & Employment'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >+
  Lambda Theta Nu Sorority, Incorporated’s overall objective is to implement a
  financial management class for high school students ages 1518.  This class
  will prepare and empower them with financial literacy and the ability to
  respect and understand the distinction between spending money and using money,
  becoming effective citizens in a global economic society.






  The overall impact will teach inner city youth traditionally underexposed to
  the tools of financial literacy, 1) how to use a bank effectively, 2) the
  importance of credit, 3) saving your money vs. spending your money, 4) why all
  money is not “good money," and 5) money and college.


What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  As a nonprofit organization we cater to the female youth through our
  programming. Through our philanthropy "TIJERAS," cutting through to enhance
  education opportunities, we fundraise hundreds of dollars every year to donate
  to another nonprofit organization which carries out this purpose on a grander
  scale. We also serve our community through our Annual Latina Youth Leadership
  Conferences that are targeted to middle and high school students. We offer
  these students workshops about AG Requirements, resume building, networking,
  mental health, and student panels among many others. Overall our organization
  encourages students to pursue a higher education and we offer them the tools
  and support to do so.
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: ''
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  Evaluation of the project will be in the form of weekly student activity logs,
  pre and post surveys, quizzes, and monitoring of the students. Our success
  will be measured by monitoring student participation in the weekly student
  activities and workshops, success of the students in using their money
  effectively during workshops and activities, as well as their scores from the
  prequiz to the post quiz for the program.
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  Statistics from the California High School Performance Reports presented by
  the State Department of Education indicate that only 63.5% of the Los Angeles
  Unified School District (LAUSD) students graduate from high school. Those
  scoring above 50 percentile is even less. One area school, Fairfax High, has
  only a fouryear competition rate of 42.3%. Without intervention, many of those
  students will drop out of school; many more will graduate without the
  necessary skills needed to succeed in life. Our classes will enable students
  to enter the workforce with more positive and realistic aspirations. Students
  statistically expected to underachieve will be empowered to do the opposite.
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  In the year 2050 this group of students would have reached out to two more
  generations of students developing their financial enrichment, thus advancing
  the effect of this program implemented in 2013. Los Angeles will see that more
  high school students are prepared with the ability to understand and use
  different aspects of banking, money, and credit and its relation to personal
  income.
