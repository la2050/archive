  MyARC: A digital social network that solves educational challenges one project
  at a time.
indicator: ' Education'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >+
  MyArc is a flexible, contentagnostic digital media platform developed
  explicitly for educational purposes. It presents a secure, closed ecosystem in
  which students can connect with other students, both at their own school and
  outside; engage with industry experts, community leaders and academics; create
  and share projects and ideas; receive project or assignment feedback from
  students, teachers, and other members of the community; earn, collect and
  award badges in recognition of a broad spectrum of activities and achievements
  otherwise unrecognized by standard educational reward systems. 






  MyARC builds bridges between individuals, classrooms, and schools. It connects
  inschool and afterschool curriculum and facilitates the involvement of the
  larger community in the education process. It does all this by adapting the
  capabilities of the Web 2.0 social networking platforms to reframe the way we
  approach education and consider its constraints.






  Current educational programs, problems, and solutions, are based around and
  limited by the physical structures and geographic locations of schools.
  Experiments in higher education and the digital humanities have shown ways to
  use the Internet for educational purposes, but the students who would most
  benefit from such innovation (i.e. those in LA’s public school system) do not
  yet benefit from these practices. Yes, our students have access to
  technological tools and, often, even training on how to use them. But they are
  not able to use the Internet as the social network towards curricular
  learning. Web 2.0 has shown that the Internet is not just a place to get
  information; it is also, and perhaps more powerfully, a means of making
  connections between human beings, a tool for building communities and
  producing knowledge collaboratively. 






  Social networking sites such as Facebook are rightly banned from school
  computers in order to protect our children. But what if these networks could
  be safely put to use in the education of our children? What if we could build
  a safe, protected online social network that fostered such activity as
  learning and extended classroom curriculum by connecting teachers, students,
  and communities across geographic locations? What if we could use the Internet
  to do what it was intended to do: to connect geographic sites and share
  information in ways that strengthen community? We can. It is called MyARC.






  MyARC adapts the strengths of the Web to serve the needs of our public high
  schools and afterschools in a safe and manageable way. Students create their
  own profiles and participate in “activities,” “clubs,” and “challenges.” They
  elect to join “clubs” based on their interests and to participate in
  “activities” and “challenges.” They communicate with other students around a
  shared interest or project. They can also read, research, and review
  educational tools and resources related to their topic so that MyArc serves as



  a virtual meeting place, a workshop, a research hub, an exhibition space, and
  an archive of collaborative process. 






  Let’s take an extended and easily implementable example: students
  participating in afterschool robotics clubs across Los Angeles. Students login
  to the “Robotics Club” space of MyARC and ask questions, share ides, comment
  on each other’s projects, and even work collaboratively but remotely. Teachers
  can oversee this correspondence and craft curriculum around it, building in
  challenges and badges. Experts from the community can login to follow the
  progress of this student robotics group. Local engineers or science professors
  can provide advice and encouragement, suggesting links to related topics or
  articles for further study. Local technology companies can offer prizes or
  post internship opportunities to the robotics club. As a result, an
  afterschool program in innercity Los Angeles will have access to human
  capital, resources, and networking opportunities usually reserved for the
  privileged and few. 






  We need funding to build MyARC. We have already designed the interface and
  most of its functionality. We need support to build and betatest the
  prototype. Though our pilot is targeted towards high school students, we are
  designing the tool to be scalable and flexible so as to support diverse
  learning communities. The webspace will be secure and protected; content will
  be monitored for accuracy by experts residing both within the ARC team and on
  an extended Advisory Board (see partners). We are in a unique position of
  being able to easily implement the platform once it is built because MyARC
  will be supported and implemented by ARC: an afterschool and experiential
  education provider (see section below).






  MyARC provides a central hub for learners, educational institutions, and other
  organizations to share, exhibit, and learn. MyARC is a digital social network,
  a safe space for projectbased learning that solves educational challenges one
  project and one student at a time. 


What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >+
  ARC provides comprehensive, afterschool programming for over 23,000 student
  participants annually: 6 Elementary Schools, 6 Middle Schools, 21 High Schools
  and more than 80 other schools with LEAD Programming. ARC also collaborates
  with over 275 youth based, community, organizations—from unified school
  districts, charter schools, park and recreation departments to religious youth
  groups, independent schools, YMCA’s, Boys and Girls Clubs, sports clubs, and
  other youth development organizations. 


          


  In twelve years, we have grown from two staff members to over 170 whose
  individual diversity models the diversity of our LAbased student population.
  Our awardwinning afterschool and Leadership, Experience, Adventure &
  Development (LEAD) programs have made a difference in the lives of thousands
  of students in lowincome communities in Southern California, created authentic
  partnerships with schools and closed the opportunity gap for all our kids.  






  Some standout accolades are:






  ARC was selected for inclusion in the US Department of Education’s “Best
  Practices” resource book for older youth after school programs (2010).



  ARC was awarded the “California After School Network Innovators Award for
  Collaboration”



  LAUSD’s Beyond the Bell Branch nominated ARC for the Federal Doing What Works
  in OST website.



  In 2009 the League of CA After School Partners highlighted ARC's partnership
  with Beyond the Bell as a best practices team. 



  ARC was a runner up for the 2010 Loadstone National Collaboration Prize



  A 2009 independent evaluation found that ARC students are 12% more likely to
  pass the CAHSEE exam then their nonARC counterparts.



  ARC developed the successful Take Action Leadership Campaign: a collaboration
  of Los Angeles School District  Beyond the Bell Branch, after school
  providers, and community organizations within Southern California united
  around a common desire to give students leadership skills, celebrate the arts,
  serve our communities, and empower students to mentor their peers.

  ARC developed The Teen Adventure Challenge (now in its fifth year)
  http://www.teenadventurechallenge.com



  ARC partnered with CORE and USC’s Writing Program to develop “SOS College,” a
  website that helps underserved students, grades 812, access information about
  college entrance applications.  http://college.sosclassroom.org/



  In 2009, two of the four ARC After School Executive Managers were honored by
  the CA School Age Consortium for excellence in program design and site
  management.



  ARC's partnership with CORE Educational Services has brought significant
  private sector money to our ASSETS sites from companies such as Home Depot,
  State Farm, Bain Capital, Leichtag Foundation, Sound Body Sound Mind, Parsi
  Accounting, Whole Foods, and many more. 


Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >+
  ARC is a primary after school provider for the Green Dot Public Schools and
  LAUSD. These partnerships and others will serve MyARC, including EduCare
  Foundation, Impact People, Inner City Education Foundation, Youth Policy
  Institute, Woodcraft Rangers, Boys and Girls Club, Alliance Schools, and KYDS.
  The Learning in Afterschool and Summer Initiative and Youtopia are partners in
  the “Badge” development.  Professor Mark Marino (USC), Professor Jessica
  Pressman (UCSD), Professor Jeremy Douglass (UCSB): Recipients of an American
  Council of Learned Societies “Collaborative Fellowship” (20122013) will
  connect MyARC with academia. 


Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  Our metrics for measuring the success of this project will be, as they are in
  any pedagogical effort, both quantitative and qualitative. We will track
  numbers: the number of students, teachers and other stakeholder who sign on to
  participate in the pilot; and how much does that number grows over time; the
  amount of time individual users stay on the site; and more. We will also
  pursue interpretative evaluations to determine what types of activities are
  most engaging; which activities attract the most users and which demand the
  most involvement? We will also use user surveys to track attitudinal shifts
  about learning to see how students perceive the success of MyARC as it
  emerges. Finally, we will work with our partners—teachers, administrators, and
  educational foundations to determine appropriate metrics for tracking
  connections between use of MyARC and student test scores, job applications and
  acceptances, college admission rates, etc.  Success will be measured in
  datasheets and individual narratives, statistics and quotations. 
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
  Make LA a better place by making connections between students across the city
  and remapping the LA’s educational network. Funding MyARC will sow the seeds
  for its continued development via and through LA’s youth. They will take over
  its development and operations, guided by the ARC staff, our partners, and,
  eventually, an emergent network located across LA and based around its public
  school system. 






  MyArc will make LA a better place by forging connections between students,
  schools, curricula, private enterprise and diverse neighborhoods within the
  city. The Web has been touted as having the power to connect, to democratize,
  and to bridge geographical locations into a global village. That potential has
  been largely withheld from LA’s neediest students in our public schools. But
  we need to confront and tackle the obstacles to employing digital social
  networking in education. MyARC does that by proceeding with deep knowledge of
  current trends in the digital humanities, education reform, and the actual
  operations of LAUSD, Green Dot, and other LEAs (see our partners).






  We must refocus education on connections not constraints. MyARC will connect
  students across LAUSD; it will invite the private sector to support and fund
  education via MyARC’s online challenges and rewards; it will support the
  development of an LAbased youth workforce by providing practical, skillbased
  and projectbased learning. Zooming out to larger impacts of this project on
  LA, we can foresee an investment in our digitalbased program for alternative
  education as striking a match that illuminates LA as a creative destination
  for education reformrelated industries.






  By connecting these individual nodes into a larger LAbased network, MyARC
  reforms the social network that is Los Angeles. It connects and benefits
  individual students, teachers, classrooms, schools, afterschool programs, and
  the community at large. Building a platform to harness the powers of the
  digital network for the good of LA’s public school students is good for LA.
  The students of today are, of course, the future of LA in 2050 and beyond.


What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  With a simple technological platform and a management staff to properly
  implement the site and ensure student safety, MyARC can facilitate a
  meaningful transformation in the educational landscape of LA. We can inject
  passion, play, and participation into education just by creatively utilizing
  the tools and social networking skills already in existence. We can build ways
  for students to want to share ideas, discover new subjects, and learn about
  different areas of expertise. We can facilitate ways for the larger Los
  Angeles community to participate in public education, by sharing expertise and
  supporting teachers and by rewarding projectbased competitions. With MyARC, we
  take action to change the present state of education. By building a virtual
  network that will serve LA’s real network of students, schools, and
  communities, we seek to facilitate to improve the educational futures of LA
  youth and, along with them, LA’s future as well.
