  Organization Name: LAXART
  Indicator: Arts & Cultural Vitality
  brief: "As the leading independent nonprofit contemporary art space in Los Angeles, LAXART is linking contemporary art and community—a vital coalition in an international city bursting with creative innovators. Dedicated to artistic and curatorial freedom, LAXART supports ambitious and experimental exhibitions and public art projects with emerging and mid-career artists that respond to the cultural climate of the city. In collaboration, we produce new artwork that takes conceptual and material risks; work that is unlikely to be realized within the traditional museum setting, but is an important part of the story of L.A.’s dynamic art scene. A key component of our artist-centered programming, LA Public Domain (L.A.P.D.) art initiatives literally bring art out of the gallery space and to the streets. The program provides a platform and support for aspiring and critical public interventions that engage diverse audiences and respond directly to urban spaces. Aligned with the LA2050 approach, L.A.P.D. shares the innovations of the next generation in new and exciting frameworks; this year, two sculptural installations in public parks, five billboards across the city, and a commissioned mural on our own building façade. \r\n\r\nThe 2013 L.A.P.D. showcases LAXART’s unique programming model and continues our record of success in the public domain. Los Angeles-based artist Anna Sew Hoy has proposed a site-specific sculptural public art installation at Kings Road Park in West Hollywood. Responding to the park’s constellation-like design with a water fountain, waterfall, jungle gym, and seating, Hoy will create a dimensional work made of glazed stoneware, painted hoops, and an embedded mirror to highlight the act of seeing, offering passersby a viewfinder, a mirror reflection, and an opaque silhouette. Visitors will be able to see something new every time they visit by reflecting different views as they navigate the natural surroundings. LAXART will also produce the first public artwork with L.A. artist Sam Falls. Inspired by the history of minimalist sculpture and an interest in photography, he is creating a post-minimalist aluminum sculpture with paint that fades in the sunlight over time. A site-specific work weighing approximately 250 pounds, the piece will have colored panels that could shift from dark to light over the course of a day.  The work will be installed in conjunction with a major exhibition, billboard project, and publication at LAXART in November, and may remain on-site for as long as two years.   \r\n\r\nBillboard art has been a signature of LAXART since 2006. Whether an element of an artist’s first solo exhibition or as part of a major regional survey, billboards allow artists to break from tradition and share their ideas in large-scale. In 2013, five L.A.P.D. artists will be added to a list that includes Raymond Pettibon, Walead Beshty, Mungo Thomson, Doug Aitken, Mark Bradford, Charlie White, Kate Costello, Roy Dowell, Fay Ray, Meg Cranston, Harrell Fletcher, and more.\r\n\r\nLAXART’s Culver City site has always had a direct relationship with the street and that expressive presence connects community members with the work. The first painting on the façade, by Daniel Joseph Martinez, presented a composed text that read, “beauty… it rubs against one’s tongue it hangs there hurting one insisting on its own existence finally it gets so one cannot stand the pain then one must have beauty extracted.” This project became a part of the identity of the space, as an emblem for the organization that creates dialogue inside and out. Since then, artists such as Karl Haendel, Sanya Kantarovsky, Dianna Molzan, and the renowned L.A. collective Slanguage, have used the façade as their canvas. In 2013, a new L.A.P.D. wall mural on our La Cienega building will be viewed by thousands of drivers and pedestrians traversing on the iconic L.A. thoroughfare.\r\n\r\nThe L.A.P.D. program impacts L.A.’s arts and cultural vitality in the long-term, as it explores the myriad ways that artists speak to audiences and expands the field of how they make work. Each new project gives new perspective on current practices and reveals how city audiences are engaging with the work. LAXART continues to question of the validity of given contexts for the exhibition of contemporary art, architecture, and design. As the forum evolves, we can work toward a new, progressive exhibition modeled after L.A.P.D., with a range of work that lives in the L.A. cityscape with vast accessibility—instead of entering a formal institution to find art, locals walk out their front door and encounter art as they go about their day. This momentum is building toward our most significant exhibition to date, The Occasional, a citywide initiative based on international artist residencies and newly commissioned work in experimental contexts throughout the city that give the public opportunities for interaction with artists from around the world. \r\n"

  description: "Many major cities have flourishing public art programs that help define the urban landscape and build awareness of contemporary art and culture, yet Los Angeles is lacking in this arena. Through L.A.P.D., LAXART is filling this gap by bringing art to the streets, and inspiring residents to engage with the work. Public artworks can change misconceptions about contemporary art and grow new and diverse audiences, as the art experience changes from a static gallery visit to an organic encounter that is meaningful and inspires dialogue. We are developing a larger audience for the arts in L.A. outside the traditional viewing context, and with repeated exposure, a public that feels ownership of and embraces artwork that emerges locally.\r\n\r\nL.A.P.D. benefits Los Angeles artists and audiences. The program gives working artists the opportunity to experiment with new methods and media and to consider their work as part of their home environment. Such projects will help L.A. to sustain its position as a hub for art and culture, and allow us to train and retain the next generation of visual artists, knowing that there are possibilities for their creative practice that await beyond the norm. The LA2050 public projects, including two sculptural installations, five billboards, and a painted building façade are part of an ongoing effort to enhance open spaces. Commissions will add to the character of the city, and we hope that local residents will more readily welcome art in their lives with increased exposure in the public sphere. The city will enjoy a larger audience for contemporary art, as the expansion of L.A.P.D will prepare residents to receive the extensive body of work that LAXART will present in The Occasional in 2015. \r\n"

  description3: "There is a great nonprofit tradition in L.A. that began over 30 years ago, and the density of activity in the arts provides a complex network of professionals who share a commitment to excellence. LAXART is an important independent voice among Los Angeles’s contemporary art organizations; our staff and program reflects the diversity of the local art community, and we have earned the trust of the public that we represent and serve. LAXART is reinventing the conventional establishment to allow for a curatorially run space that serves the needs of artists. Entities who could be considered competition have become our esteemed collaborators; sister organizations who share our goal to advance the careers of L.A. artists. \r\n\r\nLAXART is making significant contributions to the exploration of contemporary art movements in Southern California by undertaking partnerships with major Los Angeles institutions. Our active involvement in the Getty Foundation’s 2011-12 initiative Pacific Standard Time: Art in L.A. 1945- 1980 marked a milestone in our history. In addition to recognizing L.A. artist John Outterbridge with his first exhibition in 15 years, we co-produced the Performance and Public Art Festival (January 2012), along with the Getty Foundation. Our ongoing programmatic collaboration with the Hammer Museum has resulted in exceptional exhibitions including Shannon Ebner: And, per se and, and Kerry Tribe: Milton Sees a Ghost. Our first partnered program, Joel Kyack’s public project entitled Superclogger, received incredible national media attention in 2010. \r\n\r\nThis past year, LAXART co-organized, with the Hammer Museum, Made in L.A. 2012, the first biennial exhibition in the city of Los Angeles. On view from June to September 2012, this major citywide initiative showcased substantial bodies of work from L.A.’s emerging and under-recognized artists at the Hammer and LAXART as well as the Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery. The corresponding Biennial Billboard Project showcased the work of six artists on three advertising structures. A Made in L.A. highlight was the weekend-long Venice Beach Biennial (from July 13 – 15, 2012) on the historic boardwalk, which presented commissioned works alongside the wares of local vendors.\r\n\r\nWe continue to expand our reach across Los Angeles and beyond through close collaborations with curators, artists, galleries, creative organizations, and other art entities. Our curatorial team for The Occasional will be led LAXART Director/Chief Curator Lauri Firstenberg, with: Glenn Phillips, principal project specialist and consulting curator for the Getty Research Institute; Linda Norden, New York-based curator, writer, and historian; Renaud Proch, executive director of Independent Curators International; Ruth Estevez Gomez, director of REDCAT; and Matthew Schum, LAXART curator-at-large. \r\n"
  vision: "A thriving artist community would be evidence of a healthy Los Angeles in 2050. The culture is at its best when bolstered by the influx of young artists eager to train at our world-class schools and technical centers, launch their careers amidst a diverse fraternity of creative contemporaries, and define our living landscape with distinctive public artworks. We want to create sustainable program for a new generation of artists and curators living and working in our city. As the Foundation reported, L.A. is currently home to the largest concentration of working artists in the nation, and we hope to establish an infrastructure that can encourage and support their work and allow for a steady growth in the artist population. The arts sector needs to multiply in tandem, with a contingent of professionals and organizations as resources for the diverse art-makers who will come to our city from around the world, seeking the freedom to share their ideas in a form that represents their vision and skill. \r\n\r\nOur overarching goal for initiatives like L.A.P.D. is to firm a foundation for a community of future Angelenos with an appreciation for contemporary art and a strong commitment to its presence around the city. We foresee a revitalized Los Angeles with public art that enriches cultural life and reflects our position as one of the world’s premier contemporary art destinations. We would have a resident public that is financially and passionately invested in cultural organizations, recognizing the benefit of today’s art to the community. With a patronage that rivals that of New York, Los Angeles can flourish as the cultural hub that its artists deserve. \r\n\r\nIn terms of our own organization, LAXART is working now to strengthen its future position in the artistic ecosystem. We are dedicated to building our internal capacity so that we can cultivate an expert contingent of curators and serve as many artists as possible; those working locally, nationally, and internationally. A successful LAXART in 2050 is an entity that remains independent and works outside the bureaucracy. Keeping pace with artistic growth, we aim to expand and transform our space into a laboratory for working residencies, with studio space, performance space, and gallery space, as well as a library and archive. \r\n\r\nKnowing LAXART’s value to artists as an autonomous entity, we hope that the 2050 L.A. is home to a network of independent organizations that can match the demands of our city’s arts community. Like LAXART, these organizations would be willing to take risks alongside artists and produce cutting-edge work that redefines the art of the time. Our work cannot be replicated by major art institutions; it requires close collaboration in an intimate setting and an open forum free of institutional restraints. Our community would experience a diversity of offerings that matches the vast ethnicity of the regional population, as new voices and cultures would be integrated into the mix.\r\n"

  five billboards across the city, and a commissioned mural on our own building
  faÃ§ade. 






  The 2013 L.A.P.D. showcases LAXART’s unique programming model and continues

  Billboard art has been a signature of LAXART since 2006. Whether an element of
  an artist’s first solo exhibition or as part of a major regional survey,
  billboards allow artists to break from tradition and share their ideas in
  largescale. In 2013, five L.A.P.D. artists will be added to a list that
  includes Raymond Pettibon, Walead Beshty, Mungo Thomson, Doug Aitken, Mark
  Bradford, Charlie White, Kate Costello, Roy Dowell, Fay Ray, Meg Cranston,
  Harrell Fletcher, and more.






  LAXART’s Culver City site has always had a direct relationship with the street
  and that expressive presence connects community members with the work. The

What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >+
  Since its founding in 2005, LAXART has realized over 200 projects with artists
  such as Walead Beshty, Glenn Kaino, William Leavitt, Daniel Joseph Martinez,
  Yunhee Min, Ruben Ochoa, Mark Bradford, Nicole Miller, Thomas Lawson, Kori
  Newkirk, Michael Queenland, Wade Guyton & Kelley Walker, Charles Gaines, Lisa
  Tan, Harrell Fletcher, Torolab, Leslie Hewitt, Vishal Jugdeo, and Kamrooz
  Aram. LAXART continues to support creative pioneers by anchoring programming
  around commissions of work that takes conceptual and material risks and
  inspires community dialogue. LAXART is dedicated to giving emerging artmakers
  their first solo exhibition and works in tandem with them to realize
  interventions in the public domain.






  The organization’s landmark project was the 2012 Performance and Public Art
  Festival, coorganized with the Getty Foundation under the umbrella of the
  major regionwide initiative, Pacific Standard Time: L.A. Art 194580. The 11day
  festival featured new public artworks throughout the city; a dramatic sampling
  of the largescale spectacles, expansive performances, and smallscale
  interventions that punctuated the history of postwar art in Los Angeles. In
  addition, new performances premiered each day, including outdoor visual
  spectacles, experimental theater and sound art, social and political
  interventions, and media art. A nightly afterparty, Black Box, provided a
  space for socializing, and included surprise performances each evening.






  LAXART welcomes the community to interact with contemporary art as part of the
  everyday through L.A.P.D. initiatives. Our programming is central to the
  history of public art in L.A. Highlights include: Ruben Ocha’s 2006 Extracted
  Freeway Wall Intervention, a photographic image of a Los Angeles landscape
  stretched on and interrupting a freeway wall; Jedediah Cesar’s Gleaner’s
  Stone, a resin sculpture temporarily sited at the NE corner of Washington
  Blvd. and Marcasel Avenue in Culver City as part of the 2008 California
  Biennial; Doug Aitken’s Migration, the acclaimed artist’s first monumental
  public project in L.A. seen from Santa Monica Boulevard at Almont Drive in
  2009; Joel Kyack’s Superclogger, a mobile theatre mounted in the back of a
  pickup truck, which traveled all around Los Angeles to the surprise of other
  motorists in summer 2010; and Piero Golia’s Luminous Sphere, a blue globe
  mounted on the top of the Standard Hotel in West Hollywood in 201011.

  L.A.P.D.—LA Public Domain encompasses LAXART’s public art initiatives with

Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >+
  Our approach to evaluation is through a selfstudy process.  LAXART measures
  the success of its exhibitions and education efforts via regularly scheduled
  curatorial meetings and evaluation sessions amongst staff, advisory board
  members, and executive board members. We gather press reviews, attendance
  figures, and comments from the general public, participating artists,
  curators, and scholars. The director and curators assemble a summary
  evaluation plan that includes each year’s accomplishments and activities and
  submits the document to the governance committee for review.






  LAXART will evaluate L.A.P.D. in quantitative and qualitative terms. Beyond
  our ability to realize the planned number of works at the proposed sites with
  the purpose and quality intended, we will track attendance at interactive
  events with artists and invite feedback from participants. As attendance
  figures aren’t plausible for public projects, we will gather critical press
  and analyze online traffic to determine public opinion and impact. Comments
  from LAXART visitors will also help us to determine the relevance and
  viability of the work on our building and billboard, and give us direction for
  their improvement of the overall program moving forward.

  independent and works outside the bureaucracy. Keeping pace with artistic
  growth, we aim to expand and transform our space into a laboratory for working
  residencies, with studio space, performance space, and gallery space, as well
  as a library and archive. 






  Knowing LAXART’s value to artists as an autonomous entity, we hope that the
  2050 L.A. is home to a network of independent organizations that can match the
  demands of our city’s arts community. Like LAXART, these organizations would
  be willing to take risks alongside artists and produce cuttingedge work that
  redefines the art of the time. Our work cannot be replicated by major art
  institutions; it requires close collaboration in an intimate setting and an
  open forum free of institutional restraints. Our community would experience a
  diversity of offerings that matches the vast ethnicity of the regional
  population, as new voices and cultures would be integrated into the mix.
