title: 'Arts on the Grounds: L.A. Escena Performance Series'
indicator: Arts & Cultural Vitality
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >+
  <p>The UCLA William Andrews Clark Memorial Library plans to transform
  community engagement with the arts, and in particular with the Hispanic
  tradition of classical theater through a series called L.A. Escena,  part of
  the Clark Library’s Arts on the Grounds project.  Arts on the Grounds is the
  first stage of a larger strategy for engaging lowerincome and diverse
  communities from the West Adams neighborhood of Los Angeles. Our initial
  strategy for increasing engagement will begin with a performance program set
  in the Clark Library’s five acres of gardens, public spaces, outdoor “rooms,”
  and lawns. Performances will target local audiences through modern
  interpretations of classical texts, bilingual productions and adaptations of
  Spanish plays, and familyfriendly productions. </p>






  <p>This initiative will open in June 2013 with L.A. Escena. Focusing on
  classical theater in Spanish and adaptations for Los Angeles audiences, this
  series will extend the Clark Library’s reach, inspiring artists and audiences
  to explore plays from the Hispanic tradition, and particularly Spain’s Golden
  Age, in bilingual formats and outdoor performances. As a first step in
  introducing broader audiences to this body of work, Playwrights’ Arena,
  spearheaded by Jon Lawrence Rivera, will commission notable local playwrights
  active in the Latino community to adapt classics of the Spanish Golden Age for
  contemporary Los Angeles audiences. The series will launch with a festival of
  staged readings designed to introduce audiences to the treasures of Lope de
  Vega, Cervantes, Sor Juana InÃ©s de la Cruz and more. Playwrights include
  Oliver Mayer, Velina Hasu Houston, and Luis Alfaro. Renowned actors will
  present scenes of their adaptations this summer, to be followed by one or more
  full productions in Summer 2014. </p>






  <p>The UCLA Clark Library is located in the ethnically and economically
  diverse community of West Adams, one of the oldest neighborhoods in Los
  Angeles, with multiple Historic Preservation Overlay Zones.  The community
  includes Latino, white, AfricanAmerican, Asian, Pacific Islander, and Native
  American residents, ranging from wealthy to lowincome, and is a center of
  AfricanAmerican gay life. West Adams thus embodies the racial, economic and
  social diversity of L.A. </p>






  <p>Despite its central location and partial gentrification, however, the
  neighborhood is still far removed from much of the cultural activity in Los
  Angeles. We plan to remedy this through the Arts on the Grounds initiative
  which will welcome residents to outdoor performances, particularly encouraging
  the exploration of the city’s Hispanic heritage.</p>


What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  The Library has offered a range of public programs and theater productions,
  taking advantage of the collection’s focus on the 17th and 18thcentury, one of
  the great ages of classical drama. Most recently, the Clark Library partnered
  with L.A. Theater Works (LATW) to present “Pride and Prejudice” in the
  Library’s drawing room for a live audience and radio broadcast. Other indoor
  performances have included the operatic scena “Il Combattimento di Tancredi e
  Clorinda” (with Opera UCLA), and William Wycherley’s “The Country Wife” in
  collaboration with UCLA’s School of Theater, Film and Television. Theater
  performances build on the tremendous success of the Clark’s Chamber Music
  Series, now entering its 20th year, which draws over 700 people each year. 
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  We partner with neighborhood associations, local theater companies, and
  various departments on the UCLA campus for outreach programs serving
  neighborhood schools.  These include the UCLA Lab School and the School of the
  Arts’ Visual and Performing Arts Education program. Oliver Mayer of USC’s
  School of Dramatic Arts is an additional partner. Our initial theater partner
  for L.A. Escena is Playwrights’ Arena, led by Jon Lawrence Rivera.  In 201314,
  we will partner with East L.A. Classical Theater for performances targeting
  K12 audiences. With the West Adams Heritage Association (WAHA), we have also
  established a joint committee to explore how the library can address the
  cultural needs of the community and potential collaborative projects. 
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: "<p>We will evaluate Arts on the Grounds and measure success in three ways: </p>\n\n\n<p>1)\tAudience attendance and feedback: The Clark Library conducts surveys with audiences at events to learn about their reactions to performances, accessibility of our programs, and their suggestions for future programming. We also collect data on the number of attendees.</p>\n\n\n<p>2)\tPartner response: We interview partners about their experience in the collaboration, troubleshoot during a season, and build their recommendations into development of new collaborative efforts. The Clark Library also measures the success of partnerships by interest from new partners.</p>\n\n\n<p>3)\tOperational assessment: The library periodically conducts assessments of programs by debriefing with Clark Library staff, reviewing audience surveys, and analyzing attendance statistics. These are generally annual evaluations that guide a process to identify shortcomings of past events and programs and develop strategies to improve implementation. </p>\n\n\n<p>Additional assessments will come from interviews with neighborhood groups and school representatives from the West Adams district. The overall success of this initiative will be measured by the number of attendees and media hits of the pilot season.</p> "
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  Arts on the Grounds unique programming will actively engage the diverse
  community in the West Adams district, UCLA students, scholars, and K12 school
  groups with intersections between literature and the performing arts. The
  program aims to increase the opportunities for engagements with art for local
  residents in lowincome neighborhoods, address a growing demand for performing
  arts in the West Adams district, and foster partnerships between humanities
  scholars and performing arts practitioners. The partners and productions in
  the series that we will pilot in Summer 2013 have been selected based on their
  appeal to Spanishspeaking audiences in local communities and are designed to
  engage youth from lowincome families in cultural enrichment. We expect to
  reach a total audience of 8001000 during the Summer 2013 Arts on the Grounds
  series. Each theater event will be promoted by both our theatrical partners
  and the Clark Library, and we will work with the West Adams Heritage
  Association to advertise the events in their newsletter and other appropriate
  neighborhood outlets. 
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  In 2050 we envision thriving artistic communities throughout all area of Los
  Angeles.  We believe that arts and culture has an integral role to play in the
  development of individuals and communities, and also acts as a bridge between
  groups who would otherwise not interact.  We see the Clark Library playing a
  role in this evolution through its Arts on the Grounds program by becoming a
  central hub of cultural vitality in the West Adams district of Los Angeles —
  bringing people together to celebrate their heritage and traditions through
  performances of all kinds.
