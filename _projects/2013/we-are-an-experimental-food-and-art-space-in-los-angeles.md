title: 'We are an experimental food and art space in Los Angeles. '
indicator: Arts & Cultural Vitality
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  Thank You For Coming is an experimental food and art space in Los Angeles that
  opened its doors to the public in December 2012. We are a collectivelyrun and
  permitted restaurant  this means that our crew rotates through volunteer and
  artist residency programs which offer people with varying interests and skills
  opportunities to cook for the public, play with a space, and experiment
  accordingly. By presenting these opportunities and their resulting ideas in a
  permanent and public restaurant space, we are able to provide accessible,
  unexpected, and participatory cultural experiences for Los Angeles residents. 






  By intentionally operating Thank You For Coming as a place that draws
  ambiguous lines between art space, community center and food facility, we want
  to demonstrate that arts and cultural vitality can thrive in everyday spaces
  and via the endeavors of everyday life  in our case, as it pertains to the
  basic acts of eating and feeding and through the universal medium of food.
  This school of thought can help move Los Angeles towards providing access to
  arts for all because its lowbarrier process invites the populace to create and
  participate in its own creative experiences, thereby encouraging the
  proliferation of autonomous cultural production in countless pockets of the
  city, whether occurring in living rooms, neighborhoods, restaurants,
  libraries, parks or parking lots. 






  Thank You For Coming was conceived and built on dreams, lots of people power,
  and a highlyinvolved collaborative process. We are a ragtag crew of teachers,
  builders, scientists, gardeners, activists, and artists, but we are all firm
  believers that we have the ability to harness our own creativity and bring
  attention to it through careful resource appropriation and a doittogether,
  collaborative approach  which means that in the process, we are creating our
  own culture (and sometimes, economy) and building our own community. For as
  long as we remain open, we are committed to figuring out different ways we can
  transfer this empowering outlook to as many participants as possible.  
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  The first milestone we reached was opening our doors December 5, 2012. After 9
  months of fundraising, drawing, redrawing, building, permitting, repermitting,
  installing, inspecting, rebuilding, reinstalling, and reinspecting, we opened
  as a fully permitted restaurant, allowing us to legally sell food to the
  public. Throughout the process, our friends and neighbors continuously offered
  their hands and tools, making it possible to finish, install, and outfit TYFC
  for under $20,000. 






  We’ve begun building a volunteer force and forged dozens of relationships,
  enabling us to source local produce, accept time dollars as currency, or offer
  a class on the History of Art and Food. 






  We are proud to have hosted 3 diverse residency projects by multidisciplinary
  artists who each contextualized food in a different manner through their work
  at TYFC 






  Cristina Victor/ L.A.Novela Special: "As the daughter of CubanAmerican exiles
  born and raised in Miami, exile experience is at the root of my desire to
  contextualize a sense of cultural displacement. Through performance/food
  events, I create environments where parody, contradiction and nostalgia are
  ingredients to addressing the complexities of representing identity. My
  practice often involves appropriating stereotypes present in mass media,
  specifically about Latinos, through my alter ego Miami. By way of humor,
  kitschy aesthetics, and 'authentic' food, I intend to seduce people into a
  situation in which they are immersed in stereotypes that are familiar yet very
  clearly performed."






  Jennifer June Strawn/Superstition & Sustenance: "Reportedly, superstitious
  belief is on the rise in modern society, neckandneck, it seems, with an
  everwidening faith in scientific fact. The purpose of this project is to
  examine the mechanism of superstition, its role in our private and public
  lives, and its relevance. As sensitive creatures vulnerable to the harsh
  realities of the world we live in, superstition, as a complicated system of
  smokeandmirrors—regardless of its actual efficacy—is necessary to our survival
  as a species. Through the scope of whimsy, play, and humor, my mission is to
  present superstition in the form of food and foodforthought."






  Japanther/69Â¢ Only: "In our research, we found that a nickel in 1930 is
  valued, coincidentally, at 69Â¢ today. But while automats used to provide
  public dignity for pennies on the dollar, in 2013, questions about value,
  quality and service are still highly contended. Our intention in creating a
  69Â¢ Only store is to provide a place where people can eat and hang out
  affordably in LA. We’re challenging ourselves to fully consider the costs and
  value of things that are toooften omitted in the conversation: labor, modern
  manufacturing processes, etc. It is without a doubt that we will need to rely
  on creative resource gathering, careful proportioning, DIY processes, and the
  generosity of friends and strangers to realize a 69Â¢ Only store."
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  Every single resident artist, volunteer, advisor and organization that has
  contributed to Thank You For Coming, whether by giving us farmfresh produce,
  being a 501c3 fiscal sponsor, working a kitchen shift, teaching a class,
  making oneofakind ceramic platters, or executing their creative vision. Each
  is important, and all together, they are integral. Mostly, we remain anonymous
  and amorphous  but here, we list as many names as possible to demonstrate how
  many collaborators have helped realize Thank You For Coming in the short time
  we’ve been open. This list is yet incomplete, and we can only imagine that it
  will expand immensely:

Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >+
  We rely on people to activate our space and so many of our evaluations are
  based on conversations or observations of interactive experiences. Though
  impossible to document and evaluate all of these experiences, we’ve defined a
  few parameters that will help us measure success: 1. Number of active
  volunteers (around 30 right now); 2. Continued support and involvement of past
  artistsinresidence (only time will tell); 3. decibel level due to lively
  conversations during family suppers (definitely holding steady around 95dB);
  4. Number of people with full bellies (safe to say over 1,000 so far); 5.
  Every single day we are able to remain open (114 and counting!).


How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
  Thank You For Coming is dedicated to an alwaysopen, inclusive and connected
  “vibe” where people of allages, families, and loners can congregate to feed
  and be fed and nourish and create; allowing for the possibility of an
  unexpected discovery of art and culture. We provide a place where people can
  hang out, have fun, develop personal relationships, and then choose their own
  mechanism for participation. Our approach encourages opportunities for social
  connectedness while participating in autonomous cultural practices such as
  organizing, creating, bartering and volunteering. 






  We offer food as an accessible medium that can break down barriers of
  hierarchy in order to include more people into a conversation about our
  streets, neighborhoods, communities and city. By presenting and supporting Los
  Angeles residents’ creative projects and offering opportunities for true
  participation, we encourage coherent discourse addressing a bevy of Los
  Angelesspecific topics, including: food costs and sources, economy, education,
  transportation, recreation, cultural histories, etc.






  Additionally, Thank You For Coming houses an artistinresidency program which
  provides a monthlong opportunity to use our kitchen, garden, and volunteer
  resources to play and explore. Through an open application process, we invite
  people with varying experiences and backgrounds to propose and develop a
  creative project in the context of sharing food. Residents then utilize our
  restaurant space as a platform for public engagement and creative
  experimentation. This program has and will continue to strongly support local
  applicants as the majority selected to be artistsinresidence at Thank You For
  Coming live in LA.


What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  By 2050, Allan Kaprow’s wisdom about the blurring of art and life will be 100
  years old:



  “They will discover out of ordinary things the meaning of ordinariness. They
  will not try to make them extraordinary but will only state their real
  meaning. But out of nothing they will devise the extraordinary and then maybe
  nothingness as well.” 






  We’re at the midpoint of a journey that’s built upon those who’ve come before
  us. We’ve learned the most important thing is not to underestimate ourselves
  and our friends and our soontobe friends, all of whom are capable of
  accomplishing the extraordinary  






  Everyday, we learn of examples of this occurring, and through this practice,
  we hope that all Angelenos will understand that they can create their own
  culture which views art as something that can be accessible and present in
  everyday life. By 2050, these types of practices should be embraced and
  encouraged in public and private spaces, institutional and noninstitutional
  places and integrated across all sectors.






  In order for this to happen, we hope to see more funding for public art,
  nontraditional practices, and underdog organizations and individuals in Los
  Angeles by 2050.
