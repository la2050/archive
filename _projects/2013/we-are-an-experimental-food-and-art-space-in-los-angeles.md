  success: "We rely on people to activate our space and so many of our evaluations are based on conversations or observations of interactive experiences. Though impossible to document and evaluate all of these experiences, we’ve defined a few parameters that will help us measure success: 1. Number of active volunteers (around 30 right now); 2. Continued support and involvement of past artists-in-residence (only time will tell); 3. decibel level due to lively conversations during family suppers (definitely holding steady around 95dB); 4. Number of people with full bellies (safe to say over 1,000 so far); 5. Every single day we are able to remain open (114 and counting!).\r\n"
  Indicator: Arts & Cultural Vitality
  brief: "Thank You For Coming is an experimental food and art space in Los Angeles that opened its doors to the public in December 2012. We are a collectively-run and permitted restaurant -- this means that our crew rotates through volunteer and artist residency programs which offer people with varying interests and skills opportunities to cook for the public, play with a space, and experiment accordingly. By presenting these opportunities and their resulting ideas in a permanent and public restaurant space, we are able to provide accessible, unexpected, and participatory cultural experiences for Los Angeles residents. \r\n\r\nBy intentionally operating Thank You For Coming as a place that draws ambiguous lines between art space, community center and food facility, we want to demonstrate that arts and cultural vitality can thrive in everyday spaces and via the endeavors of everyday life -- in our case, as it pertains to the basic acts of eating and feeding and through the universal medium of food. This school of thought can help move Los Angeles towards providing access to arts for all because its low-barrier process invites the populace to create and participate in its own creative experiences, thereby encouraging the proliferation of autonomous cultural production in countless pockets of the city, whether occurring in living rooms, neighborhoods, restaurants, libraries, parks or parking lots. \r\n\r\nThank You For Coming was conceived and built on dreams, lots of people power, and a highly-involved collaborative process. We are a rag-tag crew of teachers, builders, scientists, gardeners, activists, and artists, but we are all firm believers that we have the ability to harness our own creativity and bring attention to it through careful resource appropriation and a do-it-together, collaborative approach -- which means that in the process, we are creating our own culture (and sometimes, economy) and building our own community. For as long as we remain open, we are committed to figuring out different ways we can transfer this empowering outlook to as many participants as possible.  "
  budget explanation: "Taking into account that we are currently all-volunteer run, our current budget looks something like --\r\n\r\nAnnual Expenses:    \r\nResidency Program    $25,600\r\nFood Costs    $21,600\r\nRent    $22,200\r\nUtilities    $4,500\r\nCredit Card Fees    $900\r\nSupplies    $1,800\r\nRepairs & Maintenance    $600\r\nInsurance    $1,920\r\nInternet/Phone    $1,080\r\nAccounting    $720\r\nPermits, Taxes and Licenses    $3,300\r\nTotal    $84,220.00\r\n\r\n---\r\nAdditional things we’d like to budget for to make us more viable and add to our long-term sustainability include:\r\nStipends for key organizational roles, such as development manager and program manager $50,000\r\nBuilding and permitting for a mechanical exhaust ventilation system (or hood)\t$20,000\r\nBuilding and permitting for a beer & wine license $7,000\r\nAdditional equipment for the kitchen, such as an oven $2,000\r\nFees for professional services, such as accounting and marketing $10,000\r\nGrants and funds for additional artist projects and special programs $10,000\r\nTransportation, housing and accommodations for artists $5,000\r\nTotal $104,000.00 \r\n\r\nWe are currently incorporated as an LLC, with a non-profit arm through a 501c3 fiscal sponsor (Fractured Atlas) to support our residency and community programs. Upon request, we can provide a breakdown of our income through food sales and individual donations thus far. "
  description: "Thank You For Coming is dedicated to an always-open, inclusive and connected “vibe” where people of all-ages, families, and loners can congregate to feed and be fed and nourish and create; allowing for the possibility of an unexpected discovery of art and culture. We provide a place where people can hang out, have fun, develop personal relationships, and then choose their own mechanism for participation. Our approach encourages opportunities for social connectedness while participating in autonomous cultural practices such as organizing, creating, bartering and volunteering. \r\n\r\nWe offer food as an accessible medium that can break down barriers of hierarchy in order to include more people into a conversation about our streets, neighborhoods, communities and city. By presenting and supporting Los Angeles residents’ creative projects and offering opportunities for true participation, we encourage coherent discourse addressing a bevy of Los Angeles-specific topics, including: food costs and sources, economy, education, transportation, recreation, cultural histories, etc.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Thank You For Coming houses an artist-in-residency program which provides a monthlong opportunity to use our kitchen, garden, and volunteer resources to play and explore. Through an open application process, we invite people with varying experiences and backgrounds to propose and develop a creative project in the context of sharing food. Residents then utilize our restaurant space as a platform for public engagement and creative experimentation. This program has and will continue to strongly support local applicants as the majority selected to be artists-in-residence at Thank You For Coming live in LA.\r\n"

Each is important, and all together, they are integral. Mostly, we remain anonymous and amorphous -- but here, we list as many names as possible to demonstrate how many collaborators have helped realize Thank You For Coming in the short time we’ve been open.

  description3: "Although we are in the company of many amazing individuals and organizations pursuing similar work, we regard them all as collaborators rather than competitors. We look forward to working with everyone in an all-hands, do-it-together manner. \r\n\r\nAs an organization that lies at the intersection of food, art and community we are able to access information from multiple areas to inform our decision-making, allowing us a multitude of opportunities to think and create unconventionally. The benefit of running a rotating artist residency program is that we have the flexibility to invite and involve many of these individuals and organizations to participate in our programs and projects -- \r\n\r\nRestaurant proprietors such as Scott Zwiezen at Elf, James Graham at BA, and Viet Tran at Viet Noodle Bar have all given us important information and continued support on how to build, permit and operate a restaurant. \r\n\r\nArts organizations in Los Angeles that we’ve looked to for inspiration and/or solicited directly for advice include Public Matters, Freewaves, Side Street Projects, dublab, Machine Project, Echo Park Film Center, KCHUNG, The Institute for Art and Olfaction, and the Museum of Public Fiction. \r\n\r\nWe are interested in working with community organizations and partners like the Time Bank and Muir Ranch because we feel we can complement each others’ work and create mutually beneficial relationships. \r\n\r\nOutside of Los Angeles, we’ve looked to organizations such as Conflict Kitchen, PieLab, and S.A.M.E. (So All May Eat) Cafe for how we might be able to model our multidisciplinary, multi-faceted operations and programs. \r\n\r\nIn the context of art history, some of the work and ideas we’ve been deeply inspired by come from ASCO, Allan Kaprow, Alison Knowles, Al Ruppersberg, Beavis and Butthead, and of course, Gordon Matta Clark and Caroline Gooden’s FOOD.\r\n"
  vision: "By 2050, Allan Kaprow’s wisdom about the blurring of art and life will be 100 years old:\r\n“They will discover out of ordinary things the meaning of ordinariness. They will not try to make them extraordinary but will only state their real meaning. But out of nothing they will devise the extraordinary and then maybe nothingness as well.” \r\n\r\nWe’re at the midpoint of a journey that’s built upon those who’ve come before us. We’ve learned the most important thing is not to underestimate ourselves and our friends and our soon-to-be friends, all of whom are capable of accomplishing the extraordinary -- \r\n\r\nEveryday, we learn of examples of this occurring, and through this practice, we hope that all Angelenos will understand that they can create their own culture which views art as something that can be accessible and present in everyday life. By 2050, these types of practices should be embraced and encouraged in public and private spaces, institutional and non-institutional places and integrated across all sectors.\r\n\r\nIn order for this to happen, we hope to see more funding for public art, nontraditional practices, and underdog organizations and individuals in Los Angeles by 2050.

  The first milestone we reached was opening our doors December 5, 2012. After 9
  months of fundraising, drawing, redrawing, building, permitting, repermitting,

  We’ve begun building a volunteer force and forged dozens of relationships,
  enabling us to source local produce, accept time dollars as currency, or offer
  a class on the History of Art and Food. 






  We are proud to have hosted 3 diverse residency projects by multidisciplinary
  artists who each contextualized food in a different manner through their work

Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >+
  We rely on people to activate our space and so many of our evaluations are
  based on conversations or observations of interactive experiences. Though
  impossible to document and evaluate all of these experiences, we’ve defined a
  few parameters that will help us measure success: 1. Number of active
  volunteers (around 30 right now); 2. Continued support and involvement of past
  artistsinresidence (only time will tell); 3. decibel level due to lively
  conversations during family suppers (definitely holding steady around 95dB);
  4. Number of people with full bellies (safe to say over 1,000 so far); 5.
  Every single day we are able to remain open (114 and counting!).


How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+

What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  By 2050, Allan Kaprow’s wisdom about the blurring of art and life will be 100
  years old:



  “They will discover out of ordinary things the meaning of ordinariness. They
  will not try to make them extraordinary but will only state their real
  meaning. But out of nothing they will devise the extraordinary and then maybe
  nothingness as well.” 






  We’re at the midpoint of a journey that’s built upon those who’ve come before
  us. We’ve learned the most important thing is not to underestimate ourselves
  and our friends and our soontobe friends, all of whom are capable of
  accomplishing the extraordinary  






  Everyday, we learn of examples of this occurring, and through this practice,
  we hope that all Angelenos will understand that they can create their own
  culture which views art as something that can be accessible and present in
  everyday life. By 2050, these types of practices should be embraced and
  encouraged in public and private spaces, institutional and noninstitutional
  places and integrated across all sectors.






  In order for this to happen, we hope to see more funding for public art,
  nontraditional practices, and underdog organizations and individuals in Los
  Angeles by 2050.
