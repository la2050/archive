title: 'Create LA: Free Art Classes for Kids'
indicator: Arts & Cultural Vitality
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >+
  Our idea is simple  free quality arts programming for Los Angeles kids. Create
  LA is a nonprofit organization providing arts education programs to Los
  Angeles youth both in community locations and out of a facility in Glassell
  Park that it shares with Keystone Fine Art Studios, a group of over forty
  artists creating sculpture, paintings, public art, and media installations.
  The organization has worked diligently to create partnerships with local
  schools, businesses and organizations to deliver art instruction in various
  capacities, pulling from its immediate resource in supportive Keystone
  artists. Create LA’s goals are to engage youth in quality arts education;
  promote the spread of specialized skillsets from this generation of artisans
  to the next; and provide an engaging community space for creativity to thrive.









  Specifically the organization aims to accomplish these goals through the
  connection of Los Angeles artists with kids in the community. Create LA will
  provide community members with expanding opportunities for participation
  through involvement in various events and the establishment of free after
  school arts programming with weekend workshop offerings. Our idea will impact
  the Arts and Cultural Vitality indicator by creating an environment where
  established and emerging artists work together to envision possibilities,
  explore options, and manifest unique expression.


What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >+
  Within the past year, we have been thrilled to work with a dedicated group of
  volunteers to provide free art workshops to youth in the community in various
  capacities. We have successfully engaged community members by hosting
  fundraising events in our facility, showcasing Los Angeles artists. We have
  been fortunate enough to participate in local initiatives, cosponsoring with
  American Legacy Fine Arts, Glassell Park Improvement Association, Eagle Rock
  Yacht Club, Glassell Park Elementary School, Los Feliz Arts Charter School,
  Los Angeles River School, eCALS, Saint Bernard Catholic School, Work Source
  California, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, and the City of Los Angeles.  We
  have worked hard to establish a network of support consistently contributing
  time, money, and materials to our cause, including California Arts Club,
  Glassell Park   Partners LLC, and The Classroom LA. We are excited about our
  upcoming collaboration with the Gang Reduction and Youth Development program
  of Los Angeles in piloting our after school program. 


Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Keystone Fine Arts Studios, Glassell Park
  Recreation Center, various Los Angeles based visual artists
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  Ultimately, Create LA aims to positively impact the Los Angeles community with
  its uniquely collaborative programming, fostering a lifelong enthusiasm for
  working creatively. Create LA will engage youth in quality arts education,
  promote the spread of specialized skillsets from this generation of artisans
  to the next, and provide an engaging community space for creativity to thrive.
  Evaluation of project success will be measured by increased demand for arts
  programming in the community, individual improvement of higherlevel thinking
  and expansion of artistic exploration among youth, and continued development
  of Create LA’s network of contributing artists and volunteers. Youth will
  continue participation in more complex courses, which can be measured by
  increased enrollment. Artist statements will capture the individual growth of
  higher level thinking in the reflective process. Additionally, as the
  organization provides youth with the space and opportunity to develop discrete
  skills from Los Angeles artists in various visual art forms, success will be
  marked by an increase in interested artist participation. 
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
  Only through the deliberate shift of skills, trades, and ideas can we succeed
  in engaging the next generation of thriving artists and creative thinkers.
  Create LA was formed in direct response to the problem of lacking affordable
  arts education among today’s youth. The organization has begun to engage the
  public via numerous offerings including after school programs, weekend
  workshops, and community art instruction. Over time the Create LA facility
  will grow to be an invaluable resource and engaging community space.






  The Los Angeles community will benefit from our presence as an institution of
  art, education, business, and creativity. As arts enhance culture, Create LA
  will be adding to the cultural vitality of Los Angeles, while directly serving
  youth with quality arts programming. Create LA youth will also get firsthand
  experience with the business of art through exhibition in regular gallery
  shows, where kids can familiarize themselves with the presentation process of
  visual art while participating in exhibits and events. Create LA will have the
  opportunity to encourage artistic exploration in youth, expose young people to
  career paths in visual arts, and provide them with onsite artist role models
  in the invested Keystone Studios.


What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  The prospect of success in the year 2050 is exciting for the Create LA
  program. Through participation and engagement in a comprehensive visual arts
  program, generations of community members will incorporate their creativity
  into all aspects of life. Appreciation for the talents and accomplishments of
  others will be paramount, which sustains a vibrant and peaceful environment. 






  Additionally, a portion of the Angelenos who have been involved with Create LA
  as students will now be artists in their own right, employing skills and
  techniques they have learned from artists before them and applying this
  knowledge in their current work. They will also be sharing and collaborating
  with the young learners of the city, continuing the tradition of passing on
  enthusiasm for learning in and through the arts to the next generation. The
  arts will be central to the development of young people, and the established
  artisans of the area will view sharing the process of creating art as an
  ordinary part of daily life.
