project_summary: >-
  Flying under the radar, I have been a sort of underground for progressive
  thought, where some of the people at the edge have inspired others of us at
  many salon type events I've held. My blog, called "Making Sense of These
  Times," reaches thousands. My mission is to influence thought to where we
  rethink our worldview, and without having names, like projects might, I have
  fostered a community of thought whose interactions have led to things of note.
  I'm stepping out more publicly now producing a TEDx event
  (www.TEDxWestHollywood.com), where the intention is to deliver a body of talks
  that could activate people who want to change the world.

  success: >-
    Success would be evident by the obvious buzz of strangers becoming people
    who care about one another. I just want to say how awed and thrilled I would
    be if this old idea of mine actually saw light of day. I have felt the power
    of it and have not had an opening to deliver it before. I am not doing this
    for the award, where I was all right about my own money helping it to occur
    but could not find the partnering. If this happened I would feel like I made
    my life's contribution to ushering in the new paradigm of connectedness that
    we so need.
  Indicator: ' Social Connectedness'
  brief: "How about creating Sister Blocks, where the richer parts of town partner with the poorer parts? It would be hands-on, where real people would get to shake hands and listen to each other’s stories. If this were a happening thing, it would give affluent people a simple way to be volunteers, where it wouldn’t be a big decision for each individual about which organization to give themselves to, but the group nature of it and the widespread practice would make it a natural for many people to participate. One of the unofficial ways I “give” is to the people who work for me, who clean my house and do my gardening. I am generous to them beyond the fees they charge for their services.  When you know people personally, if you are of a generous nature it is very satisfying  to help them. This would be the same thing, writ large and systematized. So, let a block from Beverly Hills get to know a block from South Central, with the idea of seeing how they can help.\r\n\r\nFacilitation would be needed at the start. And meeting places, like schools or banks or community rooms. But it is so simple and so doable and could be so far reaching, even creating a model program for the rest of the world.\r\n"
  budget explanation: "Money for promotion, including social networking service, could be $500 a week.\r\n\r\nExecution costs: one facilitator per marriage of sister blocks -- perhaps $100 an evening per sister block pair during regular (maybe once a month) get-togethers. Space would be donated. An administrator needed to coordinate the logistics and keep the system flowing and flourishing: perhaps $1,000 a week."

    It would, in simple hands-on fashion, create a connectivity in Los Angeles
    that would be felt everywhere and cost next to nothing.

    I am  the coordinator for a new TEDx branch, www.TEDxWestHollywood.com. TED
    looks for new ways to make impact and this would be something I think they
    could promote all over the country. And I personally have been a hub for
    progressive activists in Los Angeles, with years of salons at my house and
    other productions in larger quarters catering to leaders of thought, so I
    have many alliances. Should this project be accepted, there are many
    collaborators that could be enrolled.

  vision: >-
    An air of cooperation would prevail. Fear would have subsided, with needier
    people knowing they were in a caring world. Hunger and homelessness would
    not be in play. Everyone's basic needs would be met. And the care of those
    in power would have raised the standards of everyone to where people could
    lead productive, successful lives, and social mobility would be the order of
    the day. People would know they were in a system that was watching out for
    them and rooting for them.

  Facilitation would be needed at the start. And meeting places, like schools or
  banks or community rooms. But it is so simple and so doable and could be so
  far reaching, even creating a model program for the rest of the world.
