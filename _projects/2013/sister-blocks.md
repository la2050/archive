title: Sister Blocks
indicator: ' Social Connectedness'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >+
  How about creating Sister Blocks, where the richer parts of town partner with
  the poorer parts? It would be handson, where real people would get to shake
  hands and listen to each other’s stories. If this were a happening thing, it
  would give affluent people a simple way to be volunteers, where it wouldn’t be
  a big decision for each individual about which organization to give themselves
  to, but the group nature of it and the widespread practice would make it a
  natural for many people to participate. One of the unofficial ways I “give” is
  to the people who work for me, who clean my house and do my gardening. I am
  generous to them beyond the fees they charge for their services.  When you
  know people personally, if you are of a generous nature it is very satisfying 
  to help them. This would be the same thing, writ large and systematized. So,
  let a block from Beverly Hills get to know a block from South Central, with
  the idea of seeing how they can help.






  Facilitation would be needed at the start. And meeting places, like schools or
  banks or community rooms. But it is so simple and so doable and could be so
  far reaching, even creating a model program for the rest of the world.


What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  Flying under the radar, I have been a sort of underground for progressive
  thought, where some of the people at the edge have inspired others of us at
  many salon type events I've held. My blog, called "Making Sense of These
  Times," reaches thousands. My mission is to influence thought to where we
  rethink our worldview, and without having names, like projects might, I have
  fostered a community of thought whose interactions have led to things of note.
  I'm stepping out more publicly now producing a TEDx event
  (www.TEDxWestHollywood.com), where the intention is to deliver a body of talks
  that could activate people who want to change the world.
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  I am  the coordinator for a new TEDx branch, www.TEDxWestHollywood.com. TED
  looks for new ways to make impact and this would be something I think they
  could promote all over the country. And I personally have been a hub for
  progressive activists in Los Angeles, with years of salons at my house and
  other productions in larger quarters catering to leaders of thought, so I have
  many alliances. Should this project be accepted, there are many collaborators
  that could be enrolled. 
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  Success would be evident by the obvious buzz of strangers becoming people who
  care about one another. I just want to say how awed and thrilled I would be if
  this old idea of mine actually saw light of day. I have felt the power of it
  and have not had an opening to deliver it before. I am not doing this for the
  award, where I was all right about my own money helping it to occur but could
  not find the partnering. If this happened I would feel like I made my life's
  contribution to ushering in the new paradigm of connectedness that we so need.
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  It would, in simple handson fashion, create a connectivity in Los Angeles that
  would be felt everywhere and cost next to nothing.
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  An air of cooperation would prevail. Fear would have subsided, with needier
  people knowing they were in a caring world. Hunger and homelessness would not
  be in play. Everyone's basic needs would be met. And the care of those in
  power would have raised the standards of everyone to where people could lead
  productive, successful lives, and social mobility would be the order of the
  day. People would know they were in a system that was watching out for them
  and rooting for them.
