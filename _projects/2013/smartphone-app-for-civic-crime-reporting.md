  success: "CitySourced will measure its success based off citizen engagement with the app.  \r\n\r\nEngagement is a measure of how many Angelenos download and interact with the application. We will measure download count across iPhone, Android, Blackberry, and Windows Phone and would expect 10,000 downloads in the first 6 months.  \r\n\r\nWe would also measure the total number of reports generated through the app, and would expect to reach 25,000 in the first 18 months. In order to drive adoption, we’ll run outreach and marketing campaigns to get users involved with the application. In addition, we’ll provide access to our metrics dashboard to any public safety officials in Los Angeles County. \r\n"
  Indicator: ' Public Safety'
  brief: "Crime is pervasive in our communities and its damaging effects are well documented.  Despite the negative impacts, criminal activity and crime tips are often not reported by citizens because of fear associated with ‘snitching’. What if we could make it extremely easy for anyone to anonymously report criminal activity and crime tips from a smartphone?  \r\n\r\nWith our easy to use smartphone, CitySourced proposes to give residents of Los Angeles a technology tool to report and monitor crime happening around them. The CitySourced crime reporting app will allow Los Angeles residents to log and categorize crime witnessed in their neighborhoods from their smartphones or the web. They will also be able to get a quick view into what crimes are happening around them by viewing other reports and public data on a map.\r\n\r\nRegardless if reports are submitted anonymously or a user chooses to include contact telephone and email information, the CitySourced app allows for communication between citizens and public safety officials through the secure app and platform. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the user would have several options for the crime information submitted in the reports, including discreetly adding a photo or video to a report, providing more valuable data for public safety organizations. CitySourced would be able to use this data to alert authorities to a crime in progress or add to the data available to police and the City.\r\n\r\nThe data gathered will help Los Angeles citizens be more aware of their environment and allow them to understand the location of crime hotspots in the city. By allowing two-way communication through the mobile phone between citizens and the police force we provide better service for residents affected by crime.\r\n"

    CitySourced Crime Reporter will make it easier for citizens to report crime
    to the appropriate parties for better response from law enforcement groups.
    We also believe that increasing the visibility of what crime is happening
    and where, will make it easier for policy makers to come up with targeted
    data driven policy and for Angelenos to be informed voters on crime
    prevention policy.
  collaborators: "CitySourced has a well established relationship with many large enterprise software organizations which will great benefit the functionality of the app. Those companies include Esri, Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, Omega Group (crimemapping.com), and many more.\r\n \r\nIn addition, CitySourced has successfully deployed technology apps in Los Angeles Council District 9 and with Los Angeles Unified School district (LAUSD). We’ll harness this experience and additional account manager support to successfully deploy this project throughout all of Los Angeles.  \r\n"

  description3: "CitySourced defines its competition as other groups creating user facing government technology. CitySourced also looks to these groups as partners. We have successfully integrated and maintained partnerships with dozens of other companies in the field including Graffiti Tracker, Omega Group, and OpenPlans.org. \r\n\r\nOur partnerships allow us to deliver the best products in a flexible and open. While we do compete with some software providers we also work as much as possible to integrate and leverage all of our partners and competition to produce the best product possible for our end users.\r\n"
  vision: "We envision our app to be the first step in a technological transformation between citizens and public safety organizations.

  Does your project impact Los Angeles County?: 'yes'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >+
  Crime is pervasive in our communities and its damaging effects are well
  documented.  Despite the negative impacts, criminal activity and crime tips
  are often not reported by citizens because of fear associated with
  ‘snitching’. What if we could make it extremely easy for anyone to anonymously
  report criminal activity and crime tips from a smartphone?  






  With our easy to use smartphone, CitySourced proposes to give residents of Los
  Angeles a technology tool to report and monitor crime happening around them.
  The CitySourced crime reporting app will allow Los Angeles residents to log
  and categorize crime witnessed in their neighborhoods from their smartphones
  or the web. They will also be able to get a quick view into what crimes are
  happening around them by viewing other reports and public data on a map.






  Regardless if reports are submitted anonymously or a user chooses to include
  contact telephone and email information, the CitySourced app allows for
  communication between citizens and public safety officials through the secure
  app and platform. 






  In addition, the user would have several options for the crime information
  submitted in the reports, including discreetly adding a photo or video to a
  report, providing more valuable data for public safety organizations.
  CitySourced would be able to use this data to alert authorities to a crime in
  progress or add to the data available to police and the City.






  The data gathered will help Los Angeles citizens be more aware of their
  environment and allow them to understand the location of crime hotspots in the
  city. By allowing twoway communication through the mobile phone between
  citizens and the police force we provide better service for residents affected
  by crime.


What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >+

Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >+
  CitySourced will measure its success based off citizen engagement with the
  app.  






  Engagement is a measure of how many Angelenos download and interact with the
  application. We will measure download count across iPhone, Android,
  Blackberry, and Windows Phone and would expect 10,000 downloads in the first 6
  months.  






  We would also measure the total number of reports generated through the app,
  and would expect to reach 25,000 in the first 18 months. In order to drive
  adoption, we’ll run outreach and marketing campaigns to get users involved
  with the application. In addition, we’ll provide access to our metrics
  dashboard to any public safety officials in Los Angeles County. 


How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  CitySourced Crime Reporter will make it easier for citizens to report crime to

  also believe that increasing the visibility of what crime is happening and
  where, will make it easier for policy makers to come up with targeted data
  driven policy and for Angelenos to be informed voters on crime prevention
  policy.
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >+
  We envision our app to be the first step in a technological transformation
  between citizens and public safety organizations. By opening the lines of
  communication in an easy to use manner, we’re providing a voice for users to
  submit important crime activity, while simultaneously giving law enforcement
  richer, more accurate data.  






  As citizens generate more data for law enforcement, officials will be able to
  build better, smarter tools for reacting to crime in real time. In 2050,
  citizens will be walking sensors capable of transmitting and receiving
  important information around criminal activity. The net impact of terabytes of
  data points will be better, faster action on the part of public safety
  officers, more informed citizens, and a great reduction in crime. 






  We believe that law enforcement, citizens, and media will use technology tools
  extensively that will help lower crime rates and make Los Angeles a safer city
  to live in.
