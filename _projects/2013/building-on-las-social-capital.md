  brief: "<p>In Los Angeles, tens of thousands of low-income residents live on the margins of California’s economy. They have no bank accounts, credit scores or any hope of getting conventional loans to buy cars, start businesses, or apply for citizenship. Even renting an apartment may be out of reach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By working with two Los Angeles-based organizations, we propose propose to bring Lending Circles for Citizenship and the Security Deposit Loan Program for the first time to Southern California.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mission Asset Fund (MAF), a nonprofit organization, provides a way out of the financial shadows by capitalizing on the hidden strengths of people living on the financial fringes: networks of friendships and commitments to helping one another. In a time-honored practice of cultures throughout the world, low-income people come together to provide each other with support simply by lending and borrowing money from each other. Through its Lending Circles Program, MAF formalizes these social loans and provides financial education to participants. It reports loan repayments to credit bureaus, building credit files that improve participants’ financial standing. Many members establish credit scores for the first time, while others rebuild damaged scores. Each year, 12 million Americans who turn to payday lenders for small, short-term loans each year end up paying $7.5 billion in fees and charges (The Pew Center).  With a good credit score, participants are able to rent homes and apartments, access low-cost loans and avoid predatory lenders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In just five years, MAF’s social lending models have helped 1,700 people in six U.S. states, with annual loan capital skyrocketing from $15,000 to $660,230. Under this proposal, MAF will bring two new programs to Los Angeles to help low-income residents open the doors to citizenship and stable housing.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>WHY CITIZENSHIP?  Citizenship is an asset that provides individuals the ability to earn more money, lower rates of poverty, and increase financial stability. Yet, in California alone, hundreds of thousands of people eligible for U.S. citizenship are deterred by the $680 fee required to submit the N-400 naturalization application. In 2011, MAF piloted the Lending Circles for Citizenship program with three Bay Area organizations. The program has already yielded successful results, with 39 citizenship checks submitted to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and 14 citizenship applications approved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WHY HOUSING? Securing a first apartment and coming up with a rent deposit often keeps homeless and foster youth hopping from couch to couch or sleeping on the streets. In response, MAF launched the Security Deposit Loan (SDL) program in 2012 to help ease their transition into the mainstream financial system. This innovative approach helps young people overcome their challenges by providing the means to pay for a security deposit on their first apartment through a credit-building loan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TWO PROGRAMS, ONE CITY: MAF will expand these two models (Lending Circles for Citizenship and Security Deposit Loans) to Los Angeles, helping struggling people attain assets like citizenship and the ability to secure stable housing. Expansion will occur over one year by partnering with two community partners that serve economically excluded populations. MAF will help 50 people gain citizenship status through social loans, while another 50 people will use rent deposit loans to secure stable housing for their families. Participants will increase their credit scores and overall financial health because transactions will be reported to main credit bureaus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lending Circles for Citizenship will bring groups of people eligible for U.S. citizenship together to lend and borrow money to finance $510 to pay for their citizenship application fees. After they successfully work with legal services agencies to complete citizenship classes, each participant will receive a 25% match incentive ($170). All loans are secure, provided at 0% interest with $0 fees.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>The Security Deposit Loan project will transform security deposits into a responsible financial product and a savings and credit-building opportunity for disadvantaged young people who struggle to obtain stable housing. In partnership with agencies providing transitional housing, young people will sign promissory notes and program agreements for security deposit vouchers accepted by these landlords. MAF will collect monthly payments from participants, and reports payment activity to credit bureaus.  By the end of their graduation from transitional housing, participants will have saved enough for a security deposit on their next apartment, and they will have spent two years establishing positive credit histories and credit scores – assets they will need to get a new apartment.</p> "
  budget explanation: "<p>The one-year project budget for expanding the Lending Circles for Citizenship and Security Deposit Loan programs to the Los Angeles region is anticipated to total $100,000.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>$30,000 will be allocated to support two quarter-time staff positions (0.25 FTE each) for two LA-based partners (proposed partners: NEW and the Pilipino Worker’s Center). These staff positions are required to ensure program coordination, enroll participants, and provide individual support throughout the program duration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>$8,500 will be used to provide 25% match incentives of $170 for each of the 50 people enrolled in the Lending Circles for Citizenship program.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>$10,000 will be used to fund a loan loss reserve fund to be managed by MAF (10% of anticipated loan volume, in the case of defaults) as well to cover loan servicing and reporting costs (3.5% of loan volume).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>$51,500 will be used to fund a portion of three staff positions at MAF (totaling 0.65 FTE) required to implement and support the expansion of both programs. These staff positions (Program Manager, Program Coordinator, and Finance Director) will be responsible for providing ongoing technical support and training to the two Los Angeles partners, processing lending and repayment transactions, and evaluating the program.</p>"
  description: "<p>The driving force for creating the Lending Circles for Citizenship model is to simultaneously provide immigrants with tools for financial integration while enhancing the capacity of immigrant services organizations to support this process. Based on the success of the pilot, MAF is confident that the model has the potential for expansion among additional community-based partners in Los Angeles. Upon the passage of Comprehensive Immigration Reform (CIR), social lending can serve as a model for helping undocumented immigrants collectively pool their money to pay for any penalty needed to adjust their status.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>With respect to its impact in Los Angeles, the Lending Circles for Citizenship model will increase civic participation among the region’s legal permanent resident population. Going beyond theoretical classroom knowledge, immigrants will have the opportunity to achieve real-life, tangible, and measurable outcomes, such as opening bank accounts at mainstream financial institutions, saving and applying for citizenship, and increasing credit scores. Moreover, the program will increase the capacity of Los Angeles nonprofit organizations to provide a responsible, trustworthy, and socially conscious financial product that improves financial outcomes for their clients.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Similar to Lending Circles for Citizenship, the benefits of the Security Deposit Loan program also have a tremendous impact on the ability of participants to achieve their goals. Through receiving an affordable loan repayable over two years, renting an apartment becomes accessible to participants. In addition to decreasing housing instability and homelessness, the program’s financial and social benefits on the Los Angeles population include:</p> \r\n\r\n<p>1.\tRenting a first apartment will become accessible to people who currently lack savings.\r\n2.\tThe loan will be paid back over two years, making monthly payments affordable.\r\n3.\tThe process will provide a safe lending experience that models and encourages responsible financial behavior and success.\r\n4.\tThe loan will improve credit scores and develop a pot of savings for future rent deposits.</p>"
  collaborators: "<p>Pilipino Worker’s Center was formed in LA in 1997 to meet the immediate needs of low- to moderate-income workers & advocate for long-term change. They have partnered with MAF since 2011. Grant funding will expand our partnership to include Lending Circles for Citizenship.</p>\r\n<p>Since 1985, New Economics for Women has reduced poverty by creating & building wealth opportunities for families & neighborhoods. MAF proposes to pursue a new partnership with NEW to help 50 formerly homeless single mothers (ages 16 to 24) in a transitional housing program enroll in the SDL program. Another partner, Citibank, has the largest financial services network in the world, with 16,000 offices in 140 countries around the globe and provides access.</p>"
  success: "<p>Over a one-year period, MAF will support two LA-based community organizations to successfully implement the Lending Circles for Citizenship and Security Deposit Loan models.

  description3: "<p>Apart from predatory financial service providers that unfairly strip assets and income from low-income populations, MAF does not consider many other entities as direct competition. This is partly due to the circumstances under which our organization was founded. Six years ago, the Levi Strauss Foundation made a large seed investment in San Francisco’s Mission District, a historic immigrant gateway community, before inviting community advocates and leaders to have a voice in how the funding should be allocated. As a result of these conversations, the community decided to create MAF to increase financial access and inclusion among financially invisible populations, such as unbanked immigrants. MAF’s inception was only possible because our founding Board of Directors, which included wise and experienced community leaders and executive directors, did not view MAF as competition, but as an innovative fledgling born out of community collaboration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout our brief history, MAF has continued this spirit of collaboration by encouraging partnerships whenever strategic opportunities arise. These partnerships include aligning ourselves with reputable financial institutions and banks, such as Citi, which provides loan servicing for our Lending Circles program and funding to support new initiatives such as Lending Circles for Citizenship. Whenever possible, MAF expands our models to new communities by joining forces with nonprofit organizations that have an interest in improving the financial capability and stability of low-income people in their community. In fact, the expansion of our Lending Circles model to Southern California and six U.S. states has only been possible by approaching partners from a collaborative perspective, rather than viewing them as competition.</p>"
  vision: >-
    <p>By the year 2050, MAF envisions a world in which all people have access
    to fair and responsible low-cost credit and high quality financial products
    and services. In this future world, predatory lenders and fringe financial
    establishments have been decimated or no longer exist because improved
    options widely exist for lower-income and economically disadvantaged
    populations. Success also means that people will learn to save and keep
    money in their pocket as a strategy for preventing financial calamity when
    unexpected emergencies and life occurrences occur. A large part of this
    vision means that MAF must ensure people have the opportunity to qualify for
    prime rates and quality financial products, resources that will help them
    build assets and invest in their futures through things like citizenship,
    homeownership, and their children’s education.</p>

Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  <p>Over a oneyear period, MAF will support two LAbased community organizations
  to successfully implement the Lending Circles for Citizenship and Security
  Deposit Loan models. Through the project, a total of 100 participants will be
  served, including 50 who will enroll in Lending Circles for Citizenship and 50
  who will enroll in the Security Deposit Loan program. Process objectives will
  include:</p>



  <p>* Supplying technical assistance, training, program development, and a
  packaged curriculum (including howtokits, model program agreements, promissory
  notes, selection criteria, etc.) to the two selected organizations.</p>



  <p>* Engaging a total of 100 people in the Los Angeles area over the oneyear
  grant cycle.</p>






  <p>As a result of these activities, the project will achieve the following
  indicators:</p>



  <p>* 100 participants will be enrolled.</p>



  <p>* Lending Circles for Citizenship participants will achieve $51,000 in
  social loan volume (savings for citizenship).</p>



  <p>* SDL participants will achieve an estimated in loan volume of $37,500
  (based on an average security deposit of $750).</p>



  <p>* Citizenship participants will receive a 25% match totaling $8,500.



  <p>* 100% of participants will be banked and on the road to financial
  mainstream.</p>



  <p>* Participants will establish a credit score, or will build thin credit
  files into thick ones.</p>






  <p>To evaluate the impact of these efforts, MAF will collect data related to:
  1) the number of participants enrolled in Lending Circles for Citizenship and
  the SDL; 2) the percentage of individuals with bank accounts; 3) repayment
  rates; 4) savings accumulated toward citizenship and apartment security
  deposits; and 5) the number of successful citizenship applicants and apartment
