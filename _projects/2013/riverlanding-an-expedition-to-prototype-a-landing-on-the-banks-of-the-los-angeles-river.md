  RiverLAnding : An expedition to prototype a “landing” on the banks of the Los
  Angeles River
indicator: ' Environmental Quality'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >+
  This summer we propose to install River Landing, a temporary park that
  inhabits the concrete channel of the Los Angeles River, making its banks and
  dryseason waters accessible and universally enjoyable. This park and accessway
  in Elysian Valley will serve as a precedent for future parks on the 51 miles
  of river banks, a continuous blank space that is almost as large as New York’s
  Central Park. The project seeks to address immediate open space shortages and
  create a platform where the citizens of Los Angeles can develop a relationship
  with their river and deepen their involvement in the eventual largescale
  modification of the river channel. <p>






  A standard film permit will enable us to install River Landing for a weekend,
  and we will make a movie about the event to spur community and political
  support for future, public installations during all the summers until the
  river banks are permanently improved. River Landing will use a temporary
  scaffolding system and innovative designs to turn the bank into an accessible
  and multipurpose space without threatening the integrity of the channel.
  Because this intervention is only currently possible as a film shoot, we will
  cast the local community, river stakeholders, and other interested citizens to
  be in our film about inhabiting the river in this new and visionary way. <p> 






  Inspired by Parking Day LA, which transforms parking spaces into semipermanent
  Parklets, we believe that this project will lay the groundwork for the city
  and river adjacent neighborhoods to advocate and execute summerlong riverbank
  parklets all along the Los Angeles River. By building and filming our River
  Landing we will demonstrate the value and feasibility of these installations.
  Furthermore, the project introduces a format by which Angelenos will become
  instrumental in reinventing their river, while also beginning to enjoy it
  now.* We believe that the L.A. River has the potential to rival the beach and
  mountains as the premier accessible openspace in L.A. but it needs our voices,
  vision, and support to help it realize its full potential! What better way
  than to actually inhabit the river with communitygenerated designs! <p>






  *This summer, due to a city pilot program, a portion of the River Channel will
  actually be legally accessible! However, under the current public trust
  doctrine agreement you can only enter the channel through limited access
  points and there will be no amenities. <p>

  Furthermore, we have discussed this idea with members of the community,
  multiple open space and river managing entities, and other stakeholders and
  received universally positive feedback. We expect our team to keep growing!
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  The primary measure of success will be whether we can generate enough support
  and interest to enable a publicly accessible River Landing next summer and for
  years to come.  We would also gauge the success of the project by the amount
  of interest and dialogue that it spurs in terms of thinking about how
  communities effectively engage with the redesign of the river channel now and
  in the future. <p>






  Furthermore, we would measure the success of the actual design interventions
  with useroccupancy surveys conducted by the same folks who are organizing them
  for the Spring Streek Parklets www.parkletstudies.carbonmade.com. They will
  conduct surveys during the actual installation and do studies of users along
  the existing channel prior to our installation. 
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  By creating a prototype for temporary summer parks on the banks of the L.A.
  River, River Landing will become a precedent for the entire 51 miles of the
  river, thus potentially alleviating immediate openspace shortages throughout
  the city and county. Furthermore, by creating a format by which Angelenos can
  reinvent how they inhabit the river, future River Landings will both galvanize
  public support for permanent modifications and allow us to collectively build
  a new vision of the river through actual use. The river will be the landmark
  open space improvement in Los Angeles for this century — this project both
  helps this happen and ensures we know exactly the kind of space we all want
  and need. 
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  The Los Angeles River will be transformed into the most valued openspace of
  our city — rivaling our mountains and beaches and reflective of Los Angeles
  and the unique and creative spirit of its citizens.
