  RiverLAnding : An expedition to prototype a “landing” on the banks of the Los
  Angeles River
indicator: ' Environmental Quality'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >+
  This summer we propose to install River Landing, a temporary park that
  inhabits the concrete channel of the Los Angeles River, making its banks and
  dryseason waters accessible and universally enjoyable. This park and accessway
  in Elysian Valley will serve as a precedent for future parks on the 51 miles
  of river banks, a continuous blank space that is almost as large as New York’s
  Central Park. The project seeks to address immediate open space shortages and
  create a platform where the citizens of Los Angeles can develop a relationship
  with their river and deepen their involvement in the eventual largescale
  modification of the river channel. <p>






  A standard film permit will enable us to install River Landing for a weekend,
  and we will make a movie about the event to spur community and political
  support for future, public installations during all the summers until the
  river banks are permanently improved. River Landing will use a temporary
  scaffolding system and innovative designs to turn the bank into an accessible
  and multipurpose space without threatening the integrity of the channel.
  Because this intervention is only currently possible as a film shoot, we will
  cast the local community, river stakeholders, and other interested citizens to
  be in our film about inhabiting the river in this new and visionary way. <p> 






  Inspired by Parking Day LA, which transforms parking spaces into semipermanent
  Parklets, we believe that this project will lay the groundwork for the city
  and river adjacent neighborhoods to advocate and execute summerlong riverbank
  parklets all along the Los Angeles River. By building and filming our River
  Landing we will demonstrate the value and feasibility of these installations.
  Furthermore, the project introduces a format by which Angelenos will become
  instrumental in reinventing their river, while also beginning to enjoy it
  now.* We believe that the L.A. River has the potential to rival the beach and
  mountains as the premier accessible openspace in L.A. but it needs our voices,
  vision, and support to help it realize its full potential! What better way
  than to actually inhabit the river with communitygenerated designs! <p>






  *This summer, due to a city pilot program, a portion of the River Channel will
  actually be legally accessible! However, under the current public trust
  doctrine agreement you can only enter the channel through limited access
  points and there will be no amenities. <p>


What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >2-
   Worked on the Los Angeles Revitalization Master Plan <p>


   Developed and implemented extensive community outreach programs <p>


   Designed and permitted the Spring Street Parklets <p>


   Built and employed hydraulic models to help design the Los Angeles River <p>


   Developed vacant lots into community gardens, farms and yards  <p>


   Directed and filmed groundbreaking theater and movies. <p>





  Alexander Robinson is a landscape architect and assistant adjunct professor of
  landscape architecture at the University of Southern California. He worked on
  the Los Angeles River Revitalization Master Plan and is currently working with
  regional engineering agencies to develop new L.A. River designs with his
  students at USC. <p>






  Abigail Feldman is a landscape architect and the founder of, Heavy Meadow,
  based in New Orleans, Louisiana. She launched and directed the Growing Home
  program for the New Orleans Redevelopment Authority. She helped transform over
  a 1000 vacant lots into community gardens, farms, and yards with families from
  The Lower 9th Ward to Lakeview. <p>






  Margot Jacobs currently works as a project manager and designer at Mia Lehrer
  + Associates. Drawing on her background in art and design, Margot focuses on
  combining innovative ideas and sustainable practices while seeking out
  solutions that greatly enhance living environments, evoking connections
  between built, social and natural realms. <p>






  Jodie Bass’s work centers on the confluence of design and social engagement by
  conscientious construction through both critical and handson methods. She is
  an  Exhibition Designer at Los Angeles County Museum of Arts her recent work
  includes Drawing Surrealism, Lost Line, and Shinique Smith. <p>






  Kelly Majewski’s design work has covered a wide range of scales and types;
  from street furnishings to large scale urban and landscape master planning
  projects. Kelly has worked for multiple award winning Landscape Architecture
  firms. She is a strong advocate for community involvement in the design
  process and has led multiple public outreach meetings and workshops. <p>






  Daveed Kapoor is an architect who contributes a diverse range of experience,
  united by his consistent passion for space that improves the quality of
  people’s lives. Daveed founded Utopiad.org, a land development and
  architecture collective focused on redressing social justice issues. With the
  DLANC Complete Streets Working Group he helped design and was permit architect
  of the Spring Street Parklets. <p>






  Lars Jan is writer, filmmaker and the artistic director of Early Morning
  Opera, a genrebending performance + art lab.  He has made artworks about TED
  talks, Laika the Soviet space dog, land art, and suicide bombing.  Lars’ work
  has been supported by many significant artistic institutions.  He is also a
  2013 TED Senior Fellow and is currently developing a public spectacle about
  flooding and the future of empathy.

  Furthermore, we have discussed this idea with members of the community,
  multiple open space and river managing entities, and other stakeholders and
  received universally positive feedback. We expect our team to keep growing!
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  The primary measure of success will be whether we can generate enough support
  and interest to enable a publicly accessible River Landing next summer and for
  years to come.  We would also gauge the success of the project by the amount
  of interest and dialogue that it spurs in terms of thinking about how
  communities effectively engage with the redesign of the river channel now and
  in the future. <p>






  Furthermore, we would measure the success of the actual design interventions
  with useroccupancy surveys conducted by the same folks who are organizing them
  for the Spring Streek Parklets www.parkletstudies.carbonmade.com. They will
  conduct surveys during the actual installation and do studies of users along
  the existing channel prior to our installation. 
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  By creating a prototype for temporary summer parks on the banks of the L.A.
  River, River Landing will become a precedent for the entire 51 miles of the
  river, thus potentially alleviating immediate openspace shortages throughout
  the city and county. Furthermore, by creating a format by which Angelenos can
  reinvent how they inhabit the river, future River Landings will both galvanize
  public support for permanent modifications and allow us to collectively build
  a new vision of the river through actual use. The river will be the landmark
  open space improvement in Los Angeles for this century — this project both
  helps this happen and ensures we know exactly the kind of space we all want
  and need. 
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  The Los Angeles River will be transformed into the most valued openspace of
  our city — rivaling our mountains and beaches and reflective of Los Angeles
  and the unique and creative spirit of its citizens.

    There are many other groups that are also working to bring the Los Angeles
    River to life. We know many of these groups intimately and are even members
    of them. Thus, our working relationship with these groups is very healthy
    and open, and we would expect their support if this project were to proceed.
    In fact we would be hard pressed to define them as our competition.
