  What’s the BF(B)D? Connecting Neighborhoods through BicycleFriendly Business
  Districts
indicator: ' Social Connectedness'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: "&nbsp;</p>Green Octopus Consulting will partner with local business associations, the Los Angeles County Bicycle Coalition (LACBC), and LA Streetsblog to create five bicyclefriendly business districts in Los Angeles. A bicyclefriendly business district is where a community comes together around bicycles to bike to area shops and restaurants — and where merchants and employees ride, too. It’s the integration of bicycling into a business district’s operations, events, and promotions. \n\n\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n\nBicyclefriendly business districts improve local economies by strengthening connections between residents and their local businesses, increasing small business revenues, and improving neighborhood vitality and connectedness, all the while improving public safety, environmental health, and GLH — Gross Local Happiness. \n\n\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n\nThe ‘alienation’ that has historically defined the LA urban landscape — largely due to fastmoving cars that move through a place but don’t stop and connect with it — is starting to change. Bicyclefriendly neighborhoods are one of the strongest trends to emerge around the U.S. as a way to improve social connectedness in our communities. Getting people out of their cars and onto bikes as a mode of transport — particularly on the weekends for neighborhood shopping, dining and errands — is creating lasting, meaningful change for individuals, neighborhoods, and our local economies.\n\n\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n\nAt the heart of this idea is to facilitate connections between business owners, local residents, and advocates. These stakeholders will work together to integrate bicycling into the neighborhoods’ existing events, online and print promotions, and business association operations. We’ll:\n\n\n&nbsp;</p>*\tProduce a bike map and destination guide for each district\n\n\n&nbsp;</p>*\tHost community rides through the districts\n\n\n&nbsp;</p>*\tIncorporate bicycling into each district’s events through bike valets, free basic bike repair, bike portraits, and more\n\n\n&nbsp;</p>*\tOutfit the districts with bikes for errands and deliveries\n\n\n&nbsp;</p>*\tProduce two LA Streetsblog videos introducing people to the program and shopping by bike\n\n\n&nbsp;</p>*\tCreate a snazzy program website with everything you'd want to know about the program\n\n\n&nbsp;</p>*\tEstablish lasting relationships between business districts and their local bike shops and the LACBC\n\n\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n\nThrough interactive workshops, each district will decide what else they’d like to incorporate into their neighborhood. Business districts will benefit from free publicity as their efforts are recognized in the bicycling community and general media.\n\n\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n\nBicycling goes handinhand with placemaking — creating a ‘sense of place’ for a neighborhood. Increased bicycling in a business district results in more women and children coming to that area, increased small business sales helps retain the diversity of our locallyowned businesses and each area’s unique character, and the increased vitality makes an area more welcoming to people allaround. The result is a socially connected community anchored by vibrant local business districts that are safe and pleasant for residents to bike and walk to."
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: "&nbsp;</p>*\tWorking with Business Improvement Districts and community groups in LA and around the U.S. since 1999 on sustainable urban transport and placemaking, urban operations, events, marketing, and public outreach.\n\n\n&nbsp;</p>*\tCreating BicycleFriendly Business District programs across the U.S. and Canada, including: the first such program in Long Beach, CA, in four districts (video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEYlfdxGGs); the second program in San Diego, CA, in 18 districts (video: https://vimeo.com/60624768); inspiring the third program in New York, NY; creating the fourth effort in Oakville, ON; and starting the creation of many other efforts around the U.S. and Canada.\n\n\n&nbsp;</p>*\tHaving our work featured in several bicycling, urban planning, and general media publications, and helping Long Beach garner significant media attention. Receiving awards for our BicycleFriendly Business District work and being asked to speak around the continent at 30 conferences/cities over the past year and a half.\n\n\n&nbsp;</p>*\tProducing free community rides and lasting media, such as this one in Long Beach’s Cambodia Town with the notable band Dengue Fever: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeqc8exO1oo.\n\n\n&nbsp;</p>*\tBeing the subject of Copenhagen’s Bicycle Manager, Andreas Rohl’s grant to study our work in Long Beach and San Diego in an effort to implement our ideas in Copenhagen."
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  &nbsp;</p>Los Angeles County Bicycle Coalition and its local chapters and
  neighborhood bike ambassadors, L.A. Streetsblog, local Business Improvement
  Districts and other business associations, small business owners, student
  interns, and neighborhood councils.
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: "&nbsp;</p>We believe in evaluating our projects through both data and personal stories. For this project we will measure in four primary ways:\n\n\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n1.\tBusiness Perception Survey: Ask business association leaders and business owners how they feel about bicycling, bicyclists, bike lanes, and so on, and what percentage of their customers they think arrive via bike, walking, transit, or car. Survey issued at start of the program and again at the end (same survey, same people).\n\n\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n2.\tCustomer Behavior Survey: Conduct intercept surveys of customers to see how they arrived at each district. Survey issued at start of program.\n\n\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n3.\tProgram Element Tracking: Track the results of each program element (number of people who park their bikes at bike valets, participate in the free basic bike repairs, attend community rides, and so on).\n\n\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n4.\tBusiness and Customer Testimonials: Stories gathered from BID leaders, business owners, and other district stakeholders about how bicycling is/has become part of their life/business.\n\n\n"
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  &nbsp;</p>There are currently 38 Business Improvement Districts in the City of
  Los Angeles, several other business associations, and hundreds of other
  business groups around LA County. Several have approached us, wanting to
  create bicyclefriendly business district initiatives after seeing our success
  in other cities, but lacking the seed money to kickstart them. This grant will
  create five successful programs and serve as examples for others to replicate.
  Program work will be broadcast by LA Streetsblog to countywide and national
  audiences and through media releases. 



  &nbsp;</p>Through this program, we are cultivating future leaders in this
  emerging sector by building ties between local advocates and business owners
  and by engaging interns with diverse backgrounds to learn a unique blend of
  business, planning, and communication skills. Our future economy will rely on
  individuals who can bridge barriers and collaborate with people in the public,
  private, and nonprofit sectors.



  &nbsp;</p>Why is bicycling important for LA’s neighborhoods and local
  businesses? Bicyclists travel at human scale speed and are more connected to
  their surroundings than if whizzing by in a car. They can easily stop and say
  hi to friends, hop off, park for free, and patronize a business. Bicyclists
  shop more frequently and spend more money cumulatively than those arriving by
  other modes. Sometimes they become repeat customers and get to know the
  business owner by name. It’s oldfashioned Americanism at its best. It’s when a
  family of four chooses to spend its Saturday afternoon bicycling to the local
  toy or ice cream shop instead of driving across town to a mall. 



  &nbsp;</p>When businesses make deliveries and run errands via bicycle —
  whether it’s one company’s bike or shared district bikes — business owners who
  never met before become acquainted and interact more. Business Improvement
  Districts who conduct some of their operations and promotions via bike instead
  of car become more connected to the communities they’re representing. 



  &nbsp;</p>Bicyclists in business districts bring more ‘eyes and ears’ to keep
  an area safe, vibrant, and connected. Increased bicycling also correlates to
  decreased driving, traffic, car speeds, and parking congestion. It brings
  safer public streets for all users.



  &nbsp;</p>Bicycling — exercise, fresh air, and social interaction — improves
  the emotional, mental and physical health of children and adults. It increases
  happiness, improves school and work performance, and decreases obesity, heart
  disease, asthma, depression, and social alienation.



  &nbsp;</p>Encouraging humanscale traveling and interaction is key to
  revitalizing our struggling small business districts and putting LA on the map
  as a livable place and destination.
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  &nbsp;</p>By 2050, all business districts in LA County will have integrated
  bicycling into their existing operations and promotions. They will do this
  after becoming aware — through the success of other districts — that it’s a
  core part of their emergency preparedness, business revenues, community
  vitality, and the social fabric that supports their existence. The education
  and actions by local businesses to integrate bicycling meaningfully into their
  districts will have created a business advocacy base for safer bicycle
  infrastructure so that by 2050, LA will have a more developed system of safe
  bike lanes and increased ridership.



  &nbsp;</p>



  Vibrant local business districts will be at the center of community life, with
  safe and convenient biking and walking connections to neighborhoods. The 38
  BIDs in the City of LA and hundreds across LA County will multiply as the
  economy shifts to favor local retail, prompting redoubled investment in
  currently struggling commercial corridors. Bicycling and walking to local
  destinations will be how families choose to spend their leisure time because
  it is pleasant and social.
