  description3: >-
    L.A. Currents emerged during a period of great financial tumult for the
    local-media industry, and thus we are charting a new way forward. Our
    business model does not rely on one or even two revenue streams but on four
    unique revenue sources. The business model for the news industry changes
    almost daily. Aware of this, we remain nimble and ready to adapt. We
    hesitate to use the word “competitors,” but as a company that is partially
    dependent on advertising dollars, we are, in a way, competing with certain
    legacy- and new-media brands for online advertising dollars. But the media
    ecosystem is far more interdependent than ever before, especially in a
    localized marketplace like Los Angeles. L.A. Currents ascribes to the adage
    “a rising tide lifts all boats.” The tide in question is civic awareness,
    local engagement, and a public who cares deeply about education, politics,
    the environment, trends, lifestyle, and improving the quality of life in Los
    Angeles. We firmly believe that the local-media market can support many
    businesses that provide a unique, quality product.
  vision: >-
    Success in 2050 would reveal Los Angeles residents who are ardently aware of
    local issues and comfortable in their connection to their city. There are
    many positive transformative forces at work that, if recognized and
    harnessed, could drastically improve social connectedness in Los Angeles by
    2050. Transit-oriented development, viable public-transportation
    alternatives, open-data initiatives by the local government, greater
    awareness of local politics and cultural offerings, honest discussions about
    the importance of public education and our relationship to the natural
    environment are all current topics that if cultivated could result in
    creating a higher, local consciousness. Technology is a tool to further us
    along this path.

  about_you: 'Los Angeles, California'
  Does your project impact Los Angeles County?: 'yes'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  <p>We are living in a golden age of cartography. Google, Geographic
  Information Systems (GIS), locationbased services, and the explosion of
  socalled big data have combined to create a wellspring of information that —
  if utilized with ethics, intelligence, and vision — can provide customized,
  actionable intelligence for local communities in real time. If Los Angeles
  really is just a “patchwork of disparate communities,” then the goal should be
  to bind these communities as one. For thousands of years, maps have served as
  a unifying tool and as a cornerstone of a knowledgebased society born from the
  Enlightenment.</p> 






  <p>Our idea is to create the most informationrich, dynamic, and engaging
  digital map of Los Angeles’ neighborhoods that has ever existed. This map
  would be platform agnostic, primarily Webbased but also customized for mobile
  phones and ereaders, and built in an opensource coding language such as
  Django, a highlevel Python Web framework.</p> 






  <p>We would start by promoting a request for proposal that calls for local
  artists to submit designs of a large, comprehensive map of Los Angeles. An
  online, crowdsourced competition would select the winning design. Hyperlinks
  embedded within the actual map would connect users to dozens of specific
  community pages representing and supporting the unique features of individual
  neighborhoods and communities.</p> 






  <p>The depth, texture, and relevance of the information provided on each
  community page is limitless, but the goal is simple: Provide local citizens
  with an invaluable resource to learn more about their immediate communities
  while engaging one another, the city at large, and their elected
  officials.</p>






  <p>Imagine a single destination where you could find out how much green space
  is available to your kids, what the teachertostudent ratio is at your local
  high school, what building permits have been issued for construction, where
  you could find opportunities to volunteer, what the agenda is for the upcoming
  school board meeting, or whether the crime rate in your neighborhood is rising
  or falling, Then imagine a way to complement that information in a dynamic
  forum where you could exchange ideas, comments, goods, even your best
  recipes.</p> 






  <p>Companies like Google, Esri, and Fwix have created a powerful technological
  foundation for these smart maps, but a vital, localized service requires
  customization, collaboration with local entities (both public and private),
  and a deeply nuanced understanding of the neighborhoods and communities
  targeted. That is the complementary value that L.A. Currents can provide to
  this project.</p>
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  <p>L.A. Currents is a digital news publication about life in Los Angeles. Our
  aim is to to chart the changing face of Los Angeles by melding technology and
  storytelling. We report on important local people, institutions, and trends.
  Since our beta launch in November, we have seen our traffic double every
  month.</p> 






  <p>We recently announced a contentandcommunity partnership with USC Annenberg
  School for Communication and Journalism, and together we are coordinating our
  local L.A. coverage. This type of collaboration — in which a journalism
  program serves as an anchor institution for a local, upstart media company —
  is an innovative way for graduate students to get realworld experience and
  handson training while allowing a media company to get its sea legs in a
  rather unstable media marketplace.</p>  






  <p>Additionally, L.A. Currents is currently the only West Coast partner of The
  Guardian’s n0tice technology, which allows us to engage our readers in new and
  innovative ways. We have cast a wide net to our area’s creative community, and
  our stable of professional writers includes traditional reporters, bloggers,

Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >+
  <p>Success will be measured by interactivity and revenue. Analytical metrics
  embedded into the map will measure where, when, and how it is being utilized.
  We would also reserve editorial space for individual bloggers in each
  neighborhood to focus on news and commentary about hyper local issues to
  stimulate further discussion. In addition to online engagement activated by
  this map, we would provide instructions that users could employ to organize
  and produce live events in their neighborhoods, events such as discussions,
  block parties, and cleanups. Success in activating facetoface engagement among
  neighbors and across communities would be another measure.</p>






  <p>Furthermore, by its very nature, this map would be an obvious platform on
  which local retailers could advertise. Another measure of success would be the
  creation of a revenuepositive product built around a webbased, auction
  marketplace for local retailers. The goal is a sustainable, if not profitable,
  product.</p> 


How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
