title: Digging Deeper/ Making Connections/ Doing Better
indicator: ' Social Connectedness'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >+
  We propose to integrate 4 tracks of existing and new activity initiatives for
  greater depth, synergistic connections and “doing more better” for our youth
  and community as follows:






  Young Docents and Young Docents After Hours - continuing and deepening the
  experience for LA County high school students to receive paid employment and
  training through hands-on cross use customer service business, public speaking
  and problem solving skills plus direct experience of museum operations, and
  program development and delivery.






  Artpreneurs program enhancement with 10 increased opportunities for
  participation and promotion fostering creative and economic vitality for
  visual artists through monthly on-site vending and marketing opportunities to
  the public.






  Kids Gloves project to be tested with our YDs to empower learning and pride in
  uncovering school and neighborhood history through professional experiences in
  cataloging & preserving historical artifacts, gathering oral histories and
  determining if we can replicate the program for at schools throughout Los
  Angeles. 






  Art on CAAM’s Footprint program which is a 2 year program designed to develop
  deeper community based relationships and engagement in the placement, curation
  and creation of CAAM’s exterior footprint as a “gallery” for public
  exhibition 






  For 6 months we would blend and cross purpose these initiatives for a more
  integrated and richer public, experience for both our youth, audiences,
  general public that will not only meet the arts and cultural vitality
  indicators, but also serve as boosters for education, social connections, and
  provide direct impact on income and employment for area youth as well as the
  overall enhancement of the physical Exposition Park neighborhood and
  environment. 





What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  Despite the economic downturn and budget reductions we have grown attendance
  at CAAM over the last 10 years from35K to over 100,000 visitors representing
  an average 20% increase each year.  We are now presenting 80+ public programs
  each year and 9 — 13 exhibitions while continuing to maintain an active and
  growing research library and collection.  We are proud of these numbers and
  equally as proud that they represent a connection to content that has ranged
  from presenting the more than 20 exhibitions that have been directly related
  to telling the story of the African Diaspora around the world…and all still
  for Free Admission!  We have proudly collaborated with numerous organizations
  from the Skirball Cultural Center to the Japanese American National Museum,
  the Chinese American Museum and others like Self Help Graphics to the obvious
  connections with the Watts Towers, St. Elmo’s Village, and commercial
  galleries owned by African Americans.  We encourage artmaking and training by
  children and showcase the work of other organizations serving this purpose
  like Ryman Arts. But perhaps we are just as proud of our outreach efforts with
  Target that were designed to allow us to showcase the achievements and
  contributions of the African American and collaborative communities through
  our Target Sundays at CAAM programs.  Through this effort, we have not only
  created places for the community to showcase what they do but this showcasing
  of talent also included bringing to the public important discussions and
  representatives that could assist with everything from healthy living to
  safety in the water.  Target Sundays even helped us create our Artpreneur
  program making it possible for solo art entrepreneurs to have a place to sell
  and expose audiences to their work and earn income accordingly. Our most
  heartfelt achievement is the growth of our Young Docents program having grown
  it from a 2 person 4 week program that is an integral part of our program
  today employing, training and educating 30 high school youth year round for
  their personal and professional career development.
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  Role of Partners in Planning and Implementation (if any): The California
  African American Museum (a State Agency) provides the facility, utilities,
  equipment and co-workers that drive our mission; Funding Donors, such as
  Target, Bank of America, Annenberg Foundation, Department of Cultural Affairs,
  Los Angeles County Arts Commission, SEMPRA Energy, SCE and others generously
  fund programs through our Friends Foundation; People of the African Diaspora,
  African American Artists, Collectors, History Makers and Gallery Owners who
  through their need, support and participation drive our mission and increased
  the demand for continued growth and vitality. 
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >+
  For the Young Docents we have evaluation forms that are regularly used to
  assess the individual students and the program as a whole. Students keep
  journals, are tested on information, given feedback and opportunities to lead
  tours, assist guests and engage in other projects and research.  We determine
  success by not only the number of students that complete the summer portion of
  the program, but by the increased number of students that want to return for
  the year long portion of the program.  The increased number of applications
  further advises us that there is a need and we seek advise from consultants
  and specialists for improvements.  The deeper offerings centered around
  graphic design, AV tech training, social media protocols and direct engagement
  with the community for the YD participants under this grant would be
  scrutinized in the same manner.






  For Artpreneurs we seek to increase the current 25 art vendors on our roster
  by another 10 participants having customer access.  This program is evaluated
  based on the number of returning vendors which is currently at a 75% success
  rate in terms of returning Artpreneurs.  Having resources to expand outreach
  and promotion for this program should increase vendor sales and CAAM
  attendance simultaneously, and the quantity and quality of artist
  entrepreneurs seeking to participate.  We will count these increases
  accordingly as a measurement of the program’s success.






  Kid Gloves is a new pilot and if it works with the Young Docents, we will seek
  to have the YDs be part of a professionally led team that goes into the
  schools to share ways in which the program can become part of a classroom or
  an after-school club experience.  We seek to have this program achieve a
  greater awareness of neighborhood, history and relationships between cultures
  as neighborhood demographics evolve.






  Art on the Footprint at CAAM is the other new initiative which is developing
  and going into operation this fall.  With each phase we will have an
  exhibition and increased engagement with the community not only participating
  in workshops but serving as community curators selecting art to be on the
  exterior of CAAM and in the making of such art.  This program digs deep to
  create long lasting relationships that will also evolve and morph as we get
  further feedback from and engage the community.


How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  Some suggest that museum’s have largely supplanted churches as institutions
  that are emblematic of American cities.  For the California African American
  (CAAM), situated in the heart of LA, this is idea applies as related to the
  on-going challenge of engaging a multiplicity of demographics and subjects
  matters.  At CAAM we go beyond daily programming to invest in developing human
  infrastructures and relationships that will serve the unmet needs of the local
  and larger community, and bring together the experiences of generations.  It
  is in this context that we seek support for our multifaceted vision to “Dig
  Deeper, Connect the Dots & Do More.”






  CAAM is physically located in a neighborhood that was residentially Black
  through a good part of LA’s history.  It is also in the midst of a fairly
  dramatic demographic shift.  While nestled across from USC, the 2000 US census
  reveals an Exposition Park neighborhood that is 21% African American, 57%
  Latino and 11% White.  This is also a very working class neighborhood
  grappling with difficult socio — economic issues such as 40% of families
  living in poverty with an African American unemployment rate at 13.8%, higher
  than any other ethnic group.  CAAM has met this shift employing youth;
  providing wider opportunities for people of all backgrounds as a part of our
  exhibitions and programs; welcoming all as a part of the story of art and
  history that we recount from an African American voice; and promoting artists
  as entrepreneurs to strengthen their position economically.  






  Even in the United Kingdom, where tradition is almost holy, they recognize
  that museums in the future will be “less about us as the guardians of
  collections and delivering our services to communities and more about us
  facilitating communities to celebrate their own heritage and create their own
  experiences using our resources (collections, buildings, people etc).”(Keith
  Merrin)  Since our 1977 CAAM has embraced these concepts.  Progress in the
  past 10 years in the past includes an increase in collaborations and outreach
  despite the economy.  We are responsive and are comfortable letting our
  audiences have a say.  This is what CAAM has done, but we need to better
  connect the dots between what has worked, where we have found surprise gems,
  change as needed and reach a new better.  We exist on a mission that requires
  the integration of all facets of life for public engagement and enhancement. 
  A world that requires multi and cross-cultural, discipline, education,
  economic, skill recycling and social integration is not new territory for
  CAAM.  This is not and never has been a “traditional” museum, and we are proud
  to be grounded in such a wide berth, but now is the time for us to dig deeper
  into our foundation to find ways to connect successful initiatives, and
  incorporate in necessary elements in order to reach better.  
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  By 2050 we fully expect CAAM to have moved into its expanded 172,000 sq ft
  facility that will provide better storage, classrooms, multi-use presentation
  spaces, a larger library and exhibition galleries as well as greatly improved
  physical presence in the park and in the neighborhood.  However, we are driven
  first by further providing the content and programs that we think are vital to
  our relationship in this neighborhood.  We seek to have strong give back
  programs like the ones we describe in this application to be a part of our
  base of operations in the same way that we began our Young Docents program16
  years ago with only 2 students being served. We will remain responsible for
  employing our youth, providing Art on the Footprint so as to create changing
  and engaging experiences for our Park users.  Even pieces created today will
  be a part of our collection and the history of our neighborhood.  Our Kid
  Gloves project will be a regular part of school education outreach efforts as
  new generations of students need to remain connected to their school
  community, even if they are bused into the area.  Success for CAAM is a full
  integration of all of the multi-facets of art and culture, education,
  employment and income, and neighborhood enhancement…these are the elements
  served by our mission but expanded upon to include even greater community
  input and involvement.
