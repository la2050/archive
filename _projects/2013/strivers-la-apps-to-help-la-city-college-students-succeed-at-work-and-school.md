    STRIVERS.LA: from New Economy Campaigns and the LA Community College
    Foundation
  Indicator: ' Income & Employment'
  brief: "<p>Los Angeles in 2050 will need an educated workforce prepared for the job market of tomorrow. In order to increase the employability and earning potential of our city, we need to help working college students succeed in class and raise graduation rates. STRIVERS.LA will give students tools to balance work and school hours that too often overlap, by involving employers in supporting their employees’ academic success. STRIVERS.LA is a web- and mobile-based platform that will improve outcomes on both educational and employment indicators, helping to build a stronger Los Angeles through an educated workforce. STRIVERS.LA is partnering with the Los Angeles City College Foundation (LACCF) to bring innovative technology to low-income working students in Los Angeles, creating a more robust economy and a better-employed population.The Los Angeles Community College District (LACCD) serves more than 250,000 students annually, and Los Angeles City College (LACC) serves 18,000 of them. Many of these largely low-income students struggle to balance employment and school.  Nationally, 74% of students worked during the academic year, and 15 % are working full-time.  Juggling work and school schedules leads to skipped classes, missed sleep, and even no-show exams. Research shows that every extra hour a student works above 10 hours/week lowers GPA by a measurable amount.  Sixty percent of community college students work more than 20 hours per week and 25% work more than 35 hours per week.  In California, fewer than 28% of students who begin a two-year college program complete a degree within six years; for those studying part time, this percentage falls to less than 12%, in both cases significantly below the national average.  Los Angeles must improve its college completion rates in order to reach its economic potential.</p><p>Students often face calendar conflicts between work and school. \r\nEmployers use sophisticated software to chop up the day and schedule shifts to meet business needs, not employees' academic goals. Employers may want to support their employees’ educational commitments, but lack the tools to do so.  STRIVERS.LA is a way to solve the problem using digital tools so students can request schedule adjustments to protect their lecture, study and exam times, while providing a platform that brings benefits for employers. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many students lack the experience and personal savvy to negotiate work requirements. STRIVERS.LA provides student employees a comfortable digital tool - just formal enough to communicate class, exam, and homework routines effectively. Using a simple point and click interface, students enter their schedule information on the STRIVERS.LA website. They can then share the information with an employer via print, email, or link to their schedule at STRIVERS.LA. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>STRIVERS.LA will move students toward earning “family supportive wages” by increasing their likelihood of maintaining a balance between work and school, facilitating completing their education, and thereby preparing them for middle-class employment and higher-wage jobs. Current LACC students are primarily low-income, with 70% receiving tuition waivers. STRIVERS.LA will affect multiple employment-related indicators when brought to scale throughout the region, helping students move from their current, part-time, low wage work into readiness for jobs that will help them sustain and grow their families. Preparing people for well-paying jobs in technology, entertainment, tourism, and healthcare is an essential part of reducing income inequality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When they use the STRIVERS  tool to communicate class, exam, and homework routines, students also agree to achieve, comply with basic standards of employee responsibility and to work hard in return for employer support. Students can choose to upload grades for employers to follow, and earn incentives for academic and work performance. We will both secure incentive donations from local businesses, as well as fund some targeted incentives through a partnership with the LACCF partnership.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>When employers sign on to support employees, they receive dividends in positive ratings, employee loyalty and retention, and social media kudos. We will work closely with employers located in proximity to LACC that employ large numbers of students, getting detailed input from store managers about the challenges and benefits of supporting their student workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By participating in STRIVERS.LA, both students and their managers can earn simple incentives for focusing needed attention on how to better balance work and school: gas cards, bus passes, textbook credits, as well as concert or movie tickets, coffee vouchers, and mormore. Employers support students’ educational goals, and in return, students agree to do the right thing.  STRIVERS.LA: Everybody wins.</p>"

    To our knowledge, this project doesn’t have direct competitors. A recent
    national apps challenge contest that focused on supporting low-income
    college students in education only yielded one winner (out of 21) focused on
    helping students stay in school. THat organization, Beyond12.org, has some
    programs designed to help students stay in school, but they are not focused
    specifically on the work-school balance issue. We hope to collaborate with
    them and learn from their successes. Our colleagues in LA that create
    engaging new opportunities in education and technology include Gamedesk,
    Two-Bit Circus, Imagination Foundation, LA Makerspace and others, but as far
    as we are aware there is no other technology initiative based in Los Angeles
    focused on college completion and employer engagement.
  vision: >-
    In 2050, if our initiative is successful, our community college system will
    have graduated tens of thousands more better-prepared, employed and
    employable students, ready to work in growth industries that will power the
    LA economy for the subsequent 50 years; healthcare, technology, hospitality
    and tourism. We’ll demonstrate success by increasing the percentage of
    low-income working students who successfully complete college; we’ll improve
    profitability for businesses by reducing personnel and retraining costs,
    encouraging increased hiring and local investment.  Most importantly, we’ll
    have created deep relationships between our community college system and
    local employers, developing a collaborative understanding of how supporting
    student workers will result in an improved economic environment for the
    entire community.  We'll create new norms for employers about how to
    interact with working students, and new expectations for students about how
    best to balance work and school. Success will mean lower income inequality,
    more families earning wages that support their needs, and a more flexible,
    better-educated workforce able to adapt to changing economic conditions.

How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
  <p>The goals of STRIVERS.LA are to increase graduation rates, involve
  employers in their employees’ success, and help grow an educated, responsible
  workforce for the city of Los Angeles. This project will focus the new
  technology of STRIVERS.LA on students in Los Angeles, and by partnering with
  LACC we will engage some of the most ambitious, but also some of the
  lowestincome students in the LACCD. Serving residents of Los Angeles' Metro
  urban cluster, LACC's student population is among the most diverse in the
  nation. Of the College’s more than 18,000 students, 54% are immigrants to the
  United States and 50% are firstgeneration college students. Current LACC
  students are lowincome, with 70% receiving a Board of Governors waiver for
  tuition and 53% receiving some form of financial aid. A number of students are
  even homeless and hungry. Through our partnership with LACCF, we will be able
  to engage directly with this population, helping to bolster the employment
  that most students use to support their educational goals and improving their
  likelihood of completing an associate’s degree or transferring to a fouryear
  school. By increasing graduation rates and educational achievement,
  STRIVERS.LA will increase the number of students who go on to earn “family
  supportive wages," improving the overall economic health of Los Angeles.  </p>






  <p>In addition, this will be the first publicprivate technology partnership
  initiative for LACCF, beginning opportunities for innovation partnerships
  focused on the advancement and success of LA’s college students.</p>






  <p>Using LACC's student population as proof of concept, we hope to scale our
  efforts to reach all campuses in the LACCD and eventually have a presence in
  the Cal State and UC systems as well, improving key indicators for students
  and graduates throughout the Los Angeles region.</p>


What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  In 2050, if our initiative is successful, our community college system will
  have graduated tens of thousands more betterprepared, employed and employable
  students, ready to work in growth industries that will power the LA economy
  for the subsequent 50 years; healthcare, technology, hospitality and tourism.
  We’ll demonstrate success by increasing the percentage of lowincome working
  students who successfully complete college; we’ll improve profitability for
  businesses by reducing personnel and retraining costs, encouraging increased
  hiring and local investment.  Most importantly, we’ll have created deep
  relationships between our community college system and local employers,
  developing a collaborative understanding of how supporting student workers
  will result in an improved economic environment for the entire community. 
  We'll create new norms for employers about how to interact with working
  students, and new expectations for students about how best to balance work and
  school. Success will mean lower income inequality, more families earning wages
  that support their needs, and a more flexible, bettereducated workforce able
  to adapt to changing economic conditions.
