project_summary: >-
  In 2009 the c3 created a partnership with The Millennium Project
  www.millennium-project.org, a global futurists think tank, and the founder of
  c3 serves as the Chair of their Global Arts and Media Node.  Together with the
  Millennium Project, we have present an annual STATE OF THE ARTS event since
  2010.  In 2011 we co-presented the STATE OF THE ARTS with the PGA:  Producers
  Guild of America and also hosted a think tank to address how arts and media
  professionals could help to address 15 global challenges through their work. 
  The event was held in The Vortex Dome, a 50 foot immersive dome theater and
  was streamed globally.  During the think tank several ideas were generated
  including an idea to create an educational program called MYTHIC CHALLENGES
  that would help to inspire youth to create modern day myths addressing the 15
  Global Challenges and create films about their stories.  In 2012 the first
  class was launched and students from Grove Cleaveland High School Media Lab in
  Reseda collaborated with High School students in Afghanistan through the
  internet to create Mythic Challenges projects.  Fantastic!  Seven films were
  created by these students.  To view these films visit the c3 site page and
  scroll down to the bottom of the page: 
  http://consciouscreativity.com/millennium-project/mythic-challenges  Not only
  did the students learn about mythic challenges storytelling and filmmaking
  they also learned about what a professional futurist is and does.  In 2012 we
  were also awarded a $50,000 grant to produce an immersive ballet in the dome
  with a renowned 83 year old ballet dancer/choreographer.  The piece, BLUE
  APPLE, was successfully premiered in September 2012 in the Vortex Dome to a
  very appreciative audience.

    The f2 will be deemed a success by evaluating the number of artists and
    attendees who participate in the festival and the symposium who have a
    positive experience.  Optimal financial success will be measured by the
    total income and profit made from the event so that the f2 can continue to
    be produced and evolve into the future.  
  Organization Name: 'c3: Center for Conscious Creativity'
  Indicator: Arts & Cultural Vitality
  brief: "The f2: FutureFest LA \r\n\r\nThe c3: Center for Conscious Creativity www.consciouscreativity.org proposes producing the launch of an annual \"worlds fair\" type LA cultural event featuring emerging entertainment technologies and the latest creations in the arts, entertainment and media industries with emphasis on how the arts, entertainment and creativity can create a better world. \r\n\r\nInitially, the f2 will take place downtown LA at LA Center Studios www.lacenterstudios.com and will feature a futures film festival, an arts and emerging technologies showcase and a music concert for a challenge/cause.  The buildings at the LA Center Studios will become canvases for unique digital projection mapping creations and the Vortex Dome www.vorteximmersion.com located at the studio will house a fulldome festival showcase as well.  The first of its kind in Los Angeles.  \r\n\r\nThe festival will also include the STATE OF THE ARTS symposium featuring thought leaders and experts addressing the latest trends in the arts and entertainment industries and will provide ideas and case studies around how the arts, creativity, entertainment and storytelling can be used to create a better world/future.  \r\n\r\nThe c3 has presented the STATE OF THE ARTS since 2010 when it first launched as a collaborative partner with the LA Opera's RING FEST LA www.c3so.com and www.c3visionlab.org and would now propose adding the f2 to its offerings in honor of the City of LA.  \r\n\r\nThe f2 will serve as an annual magnet attracting the world's greatest artists and creators and technology innovators to participate along the city's own talent pool.   It will be modeled after the tremendously successful Venice Biennale, SXSW in Austin, Texas, and the Fringe Festival in Endinburgh, Scotland (Statistics for 2011 Edinburgh Festival Fringe concluded that it was the largest on record: there were over 40,000 performances of over 2,500 different shows in 258 venues.  Ticket sales amounted to around 1.8 million.  There are now 12 full-time members of staff.  For more details visit:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_Festival_Fringe).  \r\n\r\nThe f2 has the potential to become a global event that could rival the Edinburgh Fringe Festival potentially attracting millions of visitors to the city for this annual event as it seeds in the Fall of 2013 and then gradually involves the entire City of Greater Los Angeles, the Creative Capital of the World, to participate.  \r\n\r\nThe arts and creativity of children and students will also be included and arts and media colleges will also participate by encouraging their students to participate in the annual event.  \r\n\r\n  "

    Los Angeles would benefit by hosting a unique annual world famous arts and
    entertainment event much like SXSW has done for Austin, Texas, the Venice
    Biennale has done for Venice, Italy and the Fringe Fest has done for
    Edinburgh, Scotland (which touts itself as the largest arts festival in the
    world).    It would bring together the worlds of technology, entertainment
    and the arts and engage citizens of all ages to participate from across the
    city and globally.  The artist and creative professionals will benefit by
    the publicity they will gain from participating in the f2, the  tourism
    industry in LA will benefit and LA will stay at the cutting edge of
    creativity and technology due to being inspired to showcase this event each
    year.

  vision: >-
    Much like the World's Fair and the Venice Biennale, the f2: FutureFest LA
    will have grown to become a prestigious citywide global festival that
    persons of all ages participate in.  It will inspire year round innovative
    project creation and engage students and youth to learn new creative skill
    sets like filmmaking, dance, music -- from classical to new music, art,
    fashion, design, architecture, photography and art forms we've yet to
    invent.  The world will admire LA for continuing to serve as the Creative
    Capitol of the world and countries will send their artists to the f2 to
    represent and present the greatest innovative art from their country. 
    Inherent in the mission of the f2 will be the spirit and goal of art and
    entertainment and culture to uplift and transform humanity -- to create a
    better and more evolved future.  LA will have benefitted by being host to
    this remarkable festival showcasing the great genius of humankind.

  The f2: FutureFest LA 






  The c3: Center for Conscious Creativity www.consciouscreativity.org proposes
  producing the launch of an annual "worlds fair" type LA cultural event
  featuring emerging entertainment technologies and the latest creations in the
  arts, entertainment and media industries with emphasis on how the arts,
