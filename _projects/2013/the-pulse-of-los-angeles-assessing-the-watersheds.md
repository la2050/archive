project_summary: "Council for Watershed Health will build a dynamic, publicly accessible and scientifically valid web-based report card to show how the efforts of our cities, nonprofit organizations, agencies, businesses and academia are working together to catalyze improvements in the environment. This report card will be based on the collaborative efforts of the many agencies and organizations that are tracking specific measures but are perhaps not able to see the big picture from their individual scales. \r\n\r\nCalled “The Pulse of Los Angeles,” the project will measure environmental indicators within a geographic context over time and compare where we are to where we need to go. The web portal will use maps to display the status and trends of environmental health, social equity, and economic sustainability in the region, based on already-existing and newly-developed measures.\r\n\r\nWe will focus on tracking environmental quality measures, but will also uncover important connections between the eight realms: Education, Income & Employment, Housing, Health, Environmental Quality, Public Safety, Social Connectedness, and Arts & Cultural Vitality. We need to show, for example, how education impacts environmental quality and how safety is strengthened by arts and culture; in this way we can see the big picture of Los Angeles. By working together, we will demonstrate how collective impacts can make life better for all Angelenos.\r\n\r\nWorking with multiple project partners and continuing on the work we’ve already started, the Council will demonstrate that “if you don’t measure it, you can’t change it!” By understanding how the region is performing and how all the work is interrelated, the paths forward will reveal themselves.

And yet we are in danger of not achieving this LA 2050 vision if we do not work together to deliberately monitor, track, and report important indicators of the future vision. In 2050, we will accept synergy and collaboration as a normal way of getting things done and this project will help build towards that future."

  success: "“The Pulse of Los Angeles: Assessing Watershed Health” is a two-phase project. \r\n\r\nThe first phase brings together an advisory group and partners into an LA network; by bringing together these organizations and agencies, the project sets the stage for a new era of collective action designed to last through to 2050. Building the network through working together and creating a dynamic product will be a lasting result. Thus, the project will be evaluated based on the creation of a network, including commitments of appropriate partners to making contributions of data and analyses to the Pulse. \r\n\r\nThe second recognizable and lasting product is the very first Pulse of Los Angeles web portal, a dynamic mapping application that displays multiple indicators of health and allows users to query them for more details. We expect to accomplish this task by the end of 2013. Populating the data of the portal, of course, will be a continuous process that will get started in 2013, as expected for such a long-lasting project. The success of the project will be measured by the successful creation of a web portal. "

  budget explanation: "The Pulse of Los Angeles project has four tasks with a total budget of $191,394, of which $100,000 is requested. Administration ($11,019) includes project management, contract management, budgeting, reporting, staff management, and office supplies and equipment. Technical Analysis and Coordination ($48,000) includes collection and analysis of data for the final project web interface, stakeholder coordination, and indicators analysis. Report Card Portal Development ($88,850) includes an ArcGIS Server license renewal for the year, as well as the bulk of CWH’s web designer and applications developer salaries. Communication and Transfer of Results ($43,525) includes working with communications and marketing experts, report writing, public presentations, and the staff time necessary to support a forum where the Pulse report card is revealed. This task also covers any public events that might be required by the grantor. A small amount is set-aside to support CWH participation in a professional conference where the project is shared with other practitioners from a broader region.\r\n\r\nThe remaining budget of $91,394 is contributed by match or leveraged resources as follows: $4,275 from an ongoing US EPA grant for a project called “Indicators of the Los Angeles River Watershed”; $15,000 in time from Executive Director Nancy Steele’s current Stanton Fellowship from the Durfee Foundation on urban water sustainability; $36,400 in time (est. value) from our Ann C. Rosenfield graduate research fellow from the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs; and $35,719 from the Council’s general budget to partially support salary for the in-house applications developer. This is an ongoing multi-year project for which we will continue leveraging support."
  description: "Today, we know that many Angelenos don’t have a strong connection to the systems they rely upon and have only a vague idea of the impact of climate change on their lives. The truth is that if we don’t figure out how to live with the environment and within our water constraints, Los Angeles will fail as a major city. In thinking about how to catalyze the necessary changes, the Council for Watershed Health looks to its organizational “Vision 2025.” We envision a future for LA with clean water, reliable local water supplies, ample parks and open spaces, revitalized rivers, and vibrant communities.  Looking at our own experience and examples throughout the region, we believe the creation of a report card is the most effective way to describe the progress towards this vision for all Angelenos to make them believe it is possible, and then update them regularly on how things were going.\r\n\r\nIn creating a clear and easily understood way to regularly inform Angelenos about the health of our environment, the Pulse of Los Angeles project will create the knowledge needed to embody ecological health, social equity, and economic vitality. By using water and watersheds as the organizing principle, the Pulse will reconnect people to their landscape and waterways. It will become one of the critical tools for changing how people imagine the city, pointing the way towards so many of the changes we now hold dear.\r\n\r\nWe recognize that human well-being is intrinsically tied to clean air, access to clean water, parks, and natural open spaces, and healthful food. The services provided by healthy ecosystems are essential to healthy communities and healthy people. In developing a tool that measures, values, and tracks progress towards urban water resources sustainability for the Los Angeles area we will catalyze the changes that lead to a healthy environment and strong economy."
  collaborators: >-
    We will be taking a big tent approach, working with partners in our US
    EPA-funded Indicators of the Los Angeles River Watershed and the LA Urban
    Waters Federal Partnership. These include Los Angeles City and other cities,
    Los Angeles County, over ten federal agencies, and NGOs. Specific partners
    include Friends of the Los Angeles River, Los Angeles Waterkeeper, Urban
    Semillas, Climate Resolve, TreePeople, and Materials & Applications, Inc. We
    will invite other Goldhirsch LA2050 awardees to join a project advisory
    committee, assuring a multi-disciplinary collaborative approach that is
    fundamental to the effort. We will also invite interested businesses to join
    the project.

  description1: "The Council for Watershed Health has collaboration in its DNA. The Los Angeles Basin Water Augmentation Study, begun in 2000, assembled a technical and funding advisory committee of federal, state, and local agencies and nonprofits to investigate the challenges and solutions for capturing stormwater in an urban environment. Early findings showed that it is safe to use polluted water runoff to increase our underground water supplies. Our publication “Stormwater: Asset Not Liability” (2nd ed. 2010) changed the way the region thinks about stormwater as a source of local water supplies.\r\n\r\nIn 2005 the Council brought together additional partners to design and build the Elmer Avenue Neighborhood Retrofit Project. With phase I completed in 2010, the award-winning project is the most comprehensive “green street” in Los Angeles, converting a disadvantaged street in Sun Valley into a model of urban sustainability. Elmer Avenue captures and cleans more water than is used annually by the 24 houses on the block. The project is a focal point in the community with its meandering sidewalks, solar street lights, and diverse native and drought-tolerant plants. In 2012 the second phase, a mid-block alley-way, Elmer Paseo, was completed. The formerly asphalted alley now is a visually pleasing connector between the block and schools nearby that also captures and infiltrates water. \r\n\r\nIn 2005, the Council began management of the first watershed monitoring program in the region for the San Gabriel River. In 2007 we began management of a similar research program on the Los Angeles River. In 2011 we produced an authoritative State of the San Gabriel River report and symposium; the State of the Los Angeles River report and symposium will be produced in 2013. Both programs operate with a workgroup of stakeholders that set the annual research and monitoring agenda. \r\n\r\nIn 2008 we began work on a framework of indicators of watershed health in urban regions, the first such project in California to focus on cities. Completed in 2010, the project included a report card-style analysis of the state of the Arroyo Seco watershed. We are now working with the Santa Ana Watershed Project Authority on indicators development and we have a US EPA grant for the Los Angeles River Watershed. Executive Director Nancy Steele focuses her 2012-2013 Stanton Fellowship on this topic and we will have a UCLA graduate fellow from the Luskin School of Public Policy for 2013-2014.\r\n\r\nWe host a Watershed Symposium series in which we bring divergent viewpoints together around timely topics. Examples include “Restoration and Development Challenges of the Los Angeles River” (2013), “On Track? High Speed Rail and the Los Angeles River” (2010), and “Nature Needs Water, Too” (2009). In 2012, the Council convened a multi-day international conference, “The Mediterranean City: A Conference on Climate Change Adaptation” which kicked off the Mediterranean Cities Climate Change Consortium (mc-4.org)."
  description3: "In 1996, the Council for Watershed Health was formed by a group of stakeholders, led by environmentalist Dorothy Green, who wanted to change the paradigm for how the local environment was managed. Despite lawsuits, tangible improvements in the environment were elusive. We believed we could develop better solutions through dialog and understanding of other's agendas and missions. Our mission is “to facilitate an inclusive consensus process to enhance the economic, social and ecological health of the region’s watersheds.”\r\n\r\nOur competitors, then, are also our partners. Among them, for example, are the SCCWRP (Southern California Coastal Water Research Project), a JPA which conducts environmental monitoring and has partnered with us on the watershed monitoring programs; UCLA IOES, which produces environmental report cards although on a different scale and which is supervising the PhD program of one of our staff; and the nonprofit TreePeople, which has an urban stormwater program and has both partnered (on Elmer Avenue) and competed with us on grants. Some of our competitor/partners, including TreePeople, even have representation on our Board of Directors.\r\n\r\nWhen times were toughest, in 2009, we worked hard to bring back bond funding to all non-profits. We took the initiative to survey our competitor-partners, traveled to Sacramento to testify at budget hearings, and convened two meetings to strategize. We continued this philosophy in 2011 when we began planning for our Environmental Funders and Media Forums, seeing a gap in the usual “meet the funder” programs that rarely focused on the environmental sector. We held two of these forums in 2012 and have planned two more for 2013. We believe that the health of the environment in Los Angeles depends on the health of the environmental sector.\r\n\r\nOur philosophy is to work with our competitors whenever we can, to be open and honest about our projects, to give a hand up when we see the need, and to strive to be the best at what we do because it is only through collaboration that we can achieve great social changes."
  vision: "In our 2050 the streams of the region meander inside their flood plains, sinking to replenish our groundwater or winding down to the ocean. The air is clear and clean. Beloved by Angelenos, people fish along the banks of the Los Angeles River & tributary streams while bikers, joggers, and walkers take up the river-side paths and enjoy the parks, set like jewels along the riverways. You can find native fish (tasty ones, too) in the rivers because the channels have been re-engineered to remove barriers for fish swimming upstream. Trees overhang the water, cooling it off and providing organic inputs for stream health. Formerly endangered birds and amphibians are common. \r\n\r\nWherever we’ve built or rebuilt, our houses and businesses joyfully face towards the river; restaurants have river-side dining and diners enjoy watching nature flow by, along with kayakers and paddle boarder. When waters are high in the storm season, movable barriers automatically rise to protect our economic investments and save lives. No one who falls in the river is in danger anymore because of the automated safety lines that detect and snag you out of the water. \r\n\r\nBeyond the river, Southern Californians have embraced sustainable landscapes. The community of Sun Valley, having realized its envisioned Watershed Management Plan, enjoys a unique watershed culture in the San Fernando Valley. Researchers, practitioners and community leaders come from around the world to learn the story of Sun Valley. There, members of the community have set the standard for an urban landscape that ‘lives with the land’.\r\n\r\nThe days when Los Angeles was considered as the most park-poor metropolis in America are a distant memory. Nearly every city resident lives within walking distance of a safe, clean park. These oases of nature amidst our urban landscapes are for human respite and wildlife habitat. Thanks to improvements in water quality, our beaches have never been healthier. \r\n\r\nAt the mid-point of the twenty-first century while we will be leaning on the successes of our forbearers, we will still have challenges to meet. The climate will still be changing in the face of the 20th century excesses but Los Angeles will have learned the value of adaptation through respecting its climate and geography.\r\n\r\nOur healthy, sustainable, equitable and prosperous Los Angeles depends on all of us, working knowledgably together, towards this common vision. The Pulse of Los Angeles allows us to transform knowledge into action.\r\n"

What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  Council for Watershed Health will build a dynamic, publicly accessible and
  scientifically valid webbased report card to show how the efforts of our
  cities, nonprofit organizations, agencies, businesses and academia are working
  together to catalyze improvements in the environment. This report card will be
  based on the collaborative efforts of the many agencies and organizations that
  are tracking specific measures but are perhaps not able to see the big picture
  from their individual scales. 






  Called “The Pulse of Los Angeles,” the project will measure environmental
  indicators within a geographic context over time and compare where we are to
  where we need to go. The web portal will use maps to display the status and
  trends of environmental health, social equity, and economic sustainability in
  the region, based on alreadyexisting and newlydeveloped measures.






  We will focus on tracking environmental quality measures, but will also
  uncover important connections between the eight realms: Education, Income &
  Employment, Housing, Health, Environmental Quality, Public Safety, Social
  Connectedness, and Arts & Cultural Vitality. We need to show, for example, how
  education impacts environmental quality and how safety is strengthened by arts
  and culture; in this way we can see the big picture of Los Angeles. By working
  together, we will demonstrate how collective impacts can make life better for
  all Angelenos.






  Working with multiple project partners and continuing on the work we’ve
  already started, the Council will demonstrate that “if you don’t measure it,
  you can’t change it!” By understanding how the region is performing and how
  all the work is interrelated, the paths forward will reveal themselves. As a
  result, Los Angeles in 2050 will be one of the most soughtafter places to
  live, learn, do business, and retire. 






  We are on that path, with so many strong and purposeful organizations,
  agencies, and individuals pushing us forward. And yet we are in danger of not
  achieving this LA 2050 vision if we do not work together to deliberately
  monitor, track, and report important indicators of the future vision. In 2050,
  we will accept synergy and collaboration as a normal way of getting things
  done and this project will help build towards that future.

  “The Pulse of Los Angeles: Assessing Watershed Health” is a twophase project. 






  The first phase brings together an advisory group and partners into an LA
  network; by bringing together these organizations and agencies, the project
  sets the stage for a new era of collective action designed to last through to
  2050. Building the network through working together and creating a dynamic
  product will be a lasting result. Thus, the project will be evaluated based on
  the creation of a network, including commitments of appropriate partners to
  making contributions of data and analyses to the Pulse. 






  The second recognizable and lasting product is the very first Pulse of Los
  Angeles web portal, a dynamic mapping application that displays multiple
  indicators of health and allows users to query them for more details. We
  expect to accomplish this task by the end of 2013. Populating the data of the
  portal, of course, will be a continuous process that will get started in 2013,
  as expected for such a longlasting project. The success of the project will be
  measured by the successful creation of a web portal.
