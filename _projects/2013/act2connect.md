  Indicator: ' Social Connectedness'
  brief: "<p>The South Bay Center for Community Development (SBCC) aims to develop tools and solutions that can be owned and operated by community residents themselves. If programs addressing social concerns like economic development, early education, and community safety are like a kind of “social software,” then SBCC's approach differs from the standard practice of installing off-the-shelf products on every system (i.e., neighborhood). We see ourselves instead as open source developers, creating a basic framework for innovation (a project or initiative), then offering training and support in that framework to independent developers (community residents) operating on their own to solve their own unique problems. </p><p>Given this philosophy of change, our idea is not a surprising one, but one that we believe has the capacity to improve lives, families, and whole communities. Building on the power of networked relationships to “crowd-source” solutions to seemingly intractable social challenges, we will identify 10 key communities across Los Angeles County that we believe are primed to enter a positive feedback loop of relationship-driven social capital-building, creating a neighborhood infrastructure that amplifies and intensifies the potentials and resources already present in the community to support wellness, safety, and further connectedness. This feedback loop can be broken down into three phases:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Phase 1: Connect to Plan</p><p>* Phase 2: Plan to Act</p><p>* Phase 3: Act to Connect</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is in the final phase—Act to Connect—that the core innovation of our approach takes place. Having built a network of community relationships in order expand the possibilities for effective action, having planned an action in collaboration with neighbors, and having successfully carried out that action, a neighborhood group finds itself in a strengthened network of relationships. This intensified network is both an end in itself (effective, supportive social relationships are a primary indicator of overall quality of life within the emerging methods of measuring the “wellness index” of a place or community), and a means to further, more effective and larger-scale action. We believe that this “feedback” stage is the critical, and too-often overlooked, component in any agenda for lasting social change. For this reason, we have adopted it as the name of our overall initiative, which we call Act2Connect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crucial to achieving effective feedback is a long-term investment in neighborhood relationships themselves, which SBCC has been making for more than 5 years in communities across L.A. County, working with neighborhood groups to establish a solid network of relationships, habits of trust, and expectations of mutual support. Many of the low-income communities in which we work are characterized by highly transient populations, large numbers of recent immigrants without their own social support and kinship networks, and the high “opportunity costs” associated with underdeveloped social capital: underutilization of supportive resources, overpayment for basic financial and consumer services, lack of access to job and economic opportunities, etc. Thus, helping individuals and families in these communities navigate a path to social connectedness is a valuable end in itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 10 communities selected for high levels of development among these resident groups, and for a self-identified focus on issues of community safety and violence prevention, SBCC will deploy the resources of an LA 2050 grant to take the next crucial step in this process. Residents in each community will leverage their network of relationships to plan a project focused on community safety and/or violence prevention, carry that plan into action at a neighborhood level with the assistance of leadership development coaches and community organizers, and use the base of participants in the project to expand overall participation in the community network. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The choice of community safety and violence prevention is not an arbitrary one. Unsafe and violent communities, streets, and homes are problems that grow in the context of social isolation. By collaborating to establish community safety teams, collective commitments to non-violent streets, and trusted neighbor-listeners to help move families suffering from abuse out of the shadows, these projects will achieve two key objectives:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Contribute to safer communities, thus increasing another crucial element of the neighborhood's “well-being index,”</p>\r\n<p>* Build more extensive, more effective social networks, leading to expanded trust, higher levels of civic participation and engagement, increased community-wide knowledge of and access to resources and public forums for action, and a greater sense of investment in the community leading to lower levels of transience and the building of durable neighborhood traditions and resident-controlled institutions</p>"

  description: "Our project is anticipated to have short-term, measurable impacts on levels of violence and features conducive to community safety (traffic planning, street lighting, etc.) in the neighborhoods we target. Increased rates of early disclosure and assistance for domestic violence and child abuse—among populations that are often extremely difficult for more traditional social-services approaches to reach effectively—may be another key beneficial outcome.\r\n\r\nHowever, while these outcomes are worthwhile on their own, we believe that the most significant neighborhood-level change (and one that could provide a template for a broader, L.A. County-wide set of practices) will be found in increased levels of social connection in neighborhoods often characterized by precisely the opposite: transient populations, physically dense but largely anonymous living and housing patterns, very low rates of voting and civic engagement, low rates of volunteerism, and pronounced disengagement between generations. By mobilizing a core group of resident volunteer leaders, setting in motion and supporting a project development approach in which they themselves develop and intensity a network of social relationships in the community, and tying this network to a series of safety outcomes explicitly related to neighbor-to-neighbor trust and support, and to engagement with public institutions and systems, we hope to establish a self-sustaining, growing movement toward connection in each of our 10 targeted neighborhoods. \r\n\r\nWe know from data and evaluation (both our own, and a growing research literature) that networks of effective and supportive social relationships are the “keystone” factor among a group of characteristics variously called “protective factors,” “well-being indicators,” or “components of resiliency.” The presence of these characteristics are what sets successful communities apart from others, even in cases where more traditional indicators of community vitality (wealth and income, levels of educational attainment, etc.) are low. To put it simply, even economically “poor” neighborhoods may be experienced by their residents as desirable places to live and interact if these other factors are present in high levels.\r\n\r\nDemonstrating the effectiveness of an approach to promote these connectedness-related factors at the neighborhood level could have far-reaching impacts in L.A. County. Approaches to community safety, economic development, and civic engagement rooted in enforcement, job training, and formal education will always have their place. However, addressing and moving beyond the limits of these approaches—and thus producing real and lasting change in some of the most intractable issue areas facing our under-resourced communities—becomes possible only through reliance on strategies mobilizing resident-to-resident networks of trust and mutual support. These small-scale, resident-led institutions are the future of a safe, vibrant, healthy, and just Los Angeles County."
  collaborators: >-
    The only collaborating partner identified in advance for the full scope of
    the project (i.e., participating across all 10 neighborhoods) is the
    evaluation team identified above. Individual neighborhood collaborators may
    include schools, community centers, faith organizations, local social
    service nonprofits, regional offices of County of City of Los Angeles public
    agencies, and law enforcement agencies. Determination of these partnerships
    will be one of the planning goals of the project development phase outlined
    in our program plan above, and will vary with each individual neighborhood
    group.
  success: "<p>SBCC will work with independent evaluators, Dr. Todd Franke and Dr. Jorja Leap of UCLA, both of whom have extensive experience evaluating the impact of community-based social networking, capacity-building, and relationship development initiatives for clients including First 5 LA, the LA County Department of Children and Family Services, and The California Wellness Foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Evaluators will design survey, interview, and focus group evaluation instruments based on Dr. Franke's existing “Protective Factors Survey.” These instruments will measure from baselines established when the organizing initiative began in the targeted communities, and will re-measure at or near the start of Act2Connect project planning, and at 6-month and 12-month intervals, for five individual, family and community “protective factors” which provide indicators of neighborhood well-being. These assessments will be conducted with participants in the Act2Connect action groups, community members participating in their actions and projects, and family members and peer network members not directly involved in the project. These factors are:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Social connections: Number and intensity of supportive relationships \r\n  to other individuals and families in the community.</p>\r\n<p>* Access to and utilization of concrete support in times of need: Families \r\n  need to meet their basic needs (shelter, food, clothing, health care) in \r\n  order to ensure their own stability and the healthy development of \r\n  children. This factor is linked to social connection, as families with \r\n  active networks and community relationships tend to access more \r\n  resources.</p>\r\n<p>* Parental resilience: Capacity to creatively problem-solve parenting \r\n  challenges. This factor is strongly linked to optimism and belief in self-\r\n  efficacy, which are in turn linked to social connections.\r\n<p>* Knowledge of parenting and child development: Ability to create \r\n  nurturing and healthy family environments; strongly linked to \r\n  involvement with resilient, parenting peers.\r\n<p>* Social and emotional competence of children: Children's ability to \r\n  interact positively with others, self-regulate their behavior and \r\n  effectively communicate their feelings. This factor is strongly linked to \r\n  parental resilience which (as indicated above) is in turn linked to social \r\n  connection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We hope to establish through this evaluation that overall levels of social connectedness in the community:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* increase over the one-year Act2Connect project cycle </p>\r\n<p>* increase for participants as well as for the broader community</p>\r\n<p>* are linked in time to key project milestones (completion of project \r\n  planning, and completion of project); </p>\r\n<p>* increase following the project; and</p>\r\n<p>* are sustained for several months beyond project completion</p>"

  description3: "<p>In the sense of competition for scarce economic resources (philanthropic grants, individual donations, public-sector contracts), SBCC has many competitors in L.A. County, as do all community-based organizations. However, we have chosen to focus on the more meaningful sense of competitors: organizations and institutions proposing a different method of addressing some of the same core challenges among the neighborhoods and populations where we conduct the most significant share of our work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this understanding, SBCC has three central groups of competitors: </p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Large nonprofit organizations with an intervention and treatment focus, in areas including mental health services, job training, and violence prevention. We have developed relationships with these organizations on the basis of our understanding that our two approaches, while decidedly different, need not be entirely mutually exclusive. There may be instances in which mental health or substance abuse treatment, for example, is a necessary component of an approach to reconnecting a family to its community. Wherever possible, we have worked to incorporate this treatment and intervention capacity as a stage in our overall strategy. However, we have always been clear that our first commitment is to community ownership and capacity-building, and that at its most basic level our organizational philosophy is that treatment and intervention become necessities when insufficient resources and ingenuity have been applied to building community capacities for well-being and connectedness. Thus, while we welcome these organizations' capacity to help, we also continue to work to build communities that will be capable of ultimately minimizing the need for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Small grassroots nonprofit organizations based on direct neighbor-to-neighbor community relationships. Whenever SBCC begins the initial process of relationship-building in a new neighborhood, we rely extensively on the participation of these organizations, whose knowledge, trust, and engagement in the fine grain of community life simply cannot be replicated by other means. Wherever possible, we work to build neighborhood collaboratives (including economic resource-sharing) that include these organizations on a long-term basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Public institutions for child welfare, education, economic development, health, etc. Here the set of issues is similar in many ways to those we face with #1 above, but is exacerbated in many cases by deep distrust felt by community residents for these organizations, which are often perceived as focus-points for the surveillance and punitive “management” of low-income communities. Mediating between these institutions and the community, allowing their extensive resources to be applied to community problems while serving as a representative of the community under the direction of community leadership, is the core of our strategy in this case.</p>"
  vision: "<p>Thirty-seven years from today, the children of Act2Connect participants will be nearing fifty. Many will be parents themselves. Some will be grandparents. Three generations of active, engaged, invested community members will have sustained and deepened the strategies and community-led institutions developed in the project. Neighborhoods will continue to face many of today's challenges. But these neighborhoods' capacity to address and productively answer these challenges will have undergone a complete transformation:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* At the neighborhood middle school, a fight breaks out between students. Teachers convene a meeting of the school's Student Justice Team, which provides a mediated resolution of the conflict and restitution of injuries. This community service involves the previous adversaries in the activities of:</p><p>* The Neighborhood Co-operative Economic Council, whose projects include a network of community gardens whose produce is distributed through a CSA box service. Subscribers can pay cash, or use a local scrip currency accepted throughout the:</p><p>* Local Trading Network, a barter-based system of consumer economics designed to allow for full participation by those employed in the wage economy as well as those who for various reasons (stay-at-home parenthood, undocumented immigration status) do not conduct all of their economic activities on a monetary basis. Clothing, food, household repairs, bulk-purchased staple commodities and more are available, along with many of the services of:</p><p>* Community worker-owned co-ops, providing employment opportunities beyond traditional job development programs, and equally accessible to the documented and undocumented. Services include landscaping and gardening, baking and catering, financial services, and:</p><p>* A neighborhood childcare co-op, informed by current best practices in child development and making full use of the neighborhoods public spaces and buildings. These public spaces are accessible through:</p><p>* A robust network of bike and pedestrian lanes which converge on a neighborhood “core” incorporating a creative arts block, youth development programs, and community entertainment and convening spaces. Travel to and from events in these spaces is made safe by:</p><p>* A community volunteer Street Team, trained in conflict de-escalation and connected to restorative justice councils in the neighborhood as well as a:</p><p>* Domestic violence and abuse prevention drop-in center, providing a safe space staffed with trusted neighborhood members in which community residents can seek referrals for help, shelter, mediation and legal services, all before involving:</p><p>* The public child welfare system, which, like other public institutions, now coordinates its work with resident volunteer organizations in the neighborhood, learning from them, leveraging their local knowledge-base and trust relationships, and responding quickly to the resident concerns that they raise.</p>"

  Does your project impact Los Angeles County?: 'yes'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  <p>The South Bay Center for Community Development (SBCC) aims to develop tools
  and solutions that can be owned and operated by community residents
  themselves. If programs addressing social concerns like economic development,
  early education, and community safety are like a kind of “social software,”
  then SBCC's approach differs from the standard practice of installing
  offtheshelf products on every system (i.e., neighborhood). We see ourselves
  instead as open source developers, creating a basic framework for innovation
  (a project or initiative), then offering training and support in that
  framework to independent developers (community residents) operating on their
  own to solve their own unique problems. </p><p>Given this philosophy of
  change, our idea is not a surprising one, but one that we believe has the
  capacity to improve lives, families, and whole communities. Building on the
  power of networked relationships to “crowdsource” solutions to seemingly
  intractable social challenges, we will identify 10 key communities across Los
  Angeles County that we believe are primed to enter a positive feedback loop of
  relationshipdriven social capitalbuilding, creating a neighborhood
  infrastructure that amplifies and intensifies the potentials and resources
  already present in the community to support wellness, safety, and further
  connectedness. This feedback loop can be broken down into three phases:</p>






  <p>* Phase 1: Connect to Plan</p><p>* Phase 2: Plan to Act</p><p>* Phase 3:
  Act to Connect</p>






  <p>It is in the final phase—Act to Connect—that the core innovation of our
  approach takes place. Having built a network of community relationships in
  order expand the possibilities for effective action, having planned an action
  in collaboration with neighbors, and having successfully carried out that
  action, a neighborhood group finds itself in a strengthened network of
  relationships. This intensified network is both an end in itself (effective,
  supportive social relationships are a primary indicator of overall quality of
  life within the emerging methods of measuring the “wellness index” of a place
  or community), and a means to further, more effective and largerscale action.
  We believe that this “feedback” stage is the critical, and toooften
  overlooked, component in any agenda for lasting social change. For this
  reason, we have adopted it as the name of our overall initiative, which we
  call Act2Connect.</p>






  <p>Crucial to achieving effective feedback is a longterm investment in
  neighborhood relationships themselves, which SBCC has been making for more
  than 5 years in communities across L.A. County, working with neighborhood
  groups to establish a solid network of relationships, habits of trust, and
  expectations of mutual support. Many of the lowincome communities in which we
  work are characterized by highly transient populations, large numbers of
  recent immigrants without their own social support and kinship networks, and
  the high “opportunity costs” associated with underdeveloped social capital:
  underutilization of supportive resources, overpayment for basic financial and
  consumer services, lack of access to job and economic opportunities, etc.
  Thus, helping individuals and families in these communities navigate a path to
  social connectedness is a valuable end in itself.</p>






  <p>In 10 communities selected for high levels of development among these
  resident groups, and for a selfidentified focus on issues of community safety
  and violence prevention, SBCC will deploy the resources of an LA 2050 grant to
  take the next crucial step in this process. Residents in each community will
  leverage their network of relationships to plan a project focused on community
  safety and/or violence prevention, carry that plan into action at a
  neighborhood level with the assistance of leadership development coaches and
  community organizers, and use the base of participants in the project to
  expand overall participation in the community network. </p>






  <p>The choice of community safety and violence prevention is not an arbitrary
  one. Unsafe and violent communities, streets, and homes are problems that grow
  in the context of social isolation. By collaborating to establish community
  safety teams, collective commitments to nonviolent streets, and trusted
  neighborlisteners to help move families suffering from abuse out of the
  shadows, these projects will achieve two key objectives:</p>






  <p>* Contribute to safer communities, thus increasing another crucial element
  of the neighborhood's “wellbeing index,”</p>



  <p>* Build more extensive, more effective social networks, leading to expanded
  trust, higher levels of civic participation and engagement, increased
  communitywide knowledge of and access to resources and public forums for
  action, and a greater sense of investment in the community leading to lower
  levels of transience and the building of durable neighborhood traditions and
  residentcontrolled institutions</p>
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  <p>SBCC has achieved significant communitylevel and countywide impacts in
  areas including:</p>



  <p>Economic Development: For nearly 20 years, SBCC's career training and
  placement programs have opened up access to livingwage employment for
  residents of lowincome communities. Over the past 5 or more years, these
  programs have provided training and placement assistance to more than 150
  individuals per year in employment sectors including energy, renewables,
  digital arts and media, film and video production, and K12 teaching. Placement
  rates exceed 75%, and 24month community college completion and transfer rates
  have been as high as 90% (as compared to statewide, 6year rates of less than
  30%).</p>






  <p>SBCC has adapted this approach to youth entrepreneurship with our
  innovative Streetcraft LA project, which supports atrisk youth as they develop
  and market their own lines of apparel and accessories. Additional projects in
  communitybased agriculture, food service, and neighborhood financial services
  are currently in development.</p>






  <p>Finally, SBCC has used our community organizing project's extensive reach
  into lowincome, immigrantdense communities to launch a highly successful
  Deferred Action initiative, placing young adults on the path toward legal
  residency and full participation in the legitimate economy.</p>






  <p>Healthy Childhood and Early Education: SBCC's Community Doula program
  mobilizes community advocates for women during pregnancy, birthing, and in the
  postpartum months. These doulas help new mothers navigate the medical system,
  form healthy attachments with their infants, promote good nutrition and
  breastfeeding, and engage from birth onwards in activities that support
  children's cognitive, social and emotional development. The program has proven
  effective at eliminating infant mortality, significantly increasing rates of
  breastfeeding, and significantly reducing numbers of lowweight births.</p>



  <p>Our Preschool Without Walls program works with families in these
  communities to address critical gaps in early learning and preschool
  resources. PWW brings early learning experiences to more than 500 parents and
  children in community institutions and locations that serve as learning and
  development resources. In homes and neighborhoods, parks, libraries, and
  community centers, the program engages parents and children in a shared early
  learning experience leading to improved child development and school readiness
  through supporting parents' role as their children's primary educators.</p>






  <p>In all of our work, our primary commitment is to develop community capacity
  to address education, economic development, and other issues in an ongoing
  way. Provision of highquality direct services is necessary, but does not go
  far enough: what is needed is the growth of leadership and ownership within
  communities themselves to carry these initiatives forward on a selfsufficient,
  sustainable basis.</p>
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  The only collaborating partner identified in advance for the full scope of the
  project (i.e., participating across all 10 neighborhoods) is the evaluation
  team identified above. Individual neighborhood collaborators may include
  schools, community centers, faith organizations, local social service
  nonprofits, regional offices of County of City of Los Angeles public agencies,
  and law enforcement agencies. Determination of these partnerships will be one
  of the planning goals of the project development phase outlined in our program
  plan above, and will vary with each individual neighborhood group.
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  <p>SBCC will work with independent evaluators, Dr. Todd Franke and Dr. Jorja
  Leap of UCLA, both of whom have extensive experience evaluating the impact of
  communitybased social networking, capacitybuilding, and relationship
  development initiatives for clients including First 5 LA, the LA County
  Department of Children and Family Services, and The California Wellness
  Foundation.</p>






  <p>Evaluators will design survey, interview, and focus group evaluation
  instruments based on Dr. Franke's existing “Protective Factors Survey.” These
  instruments will measure from baselines established when the organizing
  initiative began in the targeted communities, and will remeasure at or near
  the start of Act2Connect project planning, and at 6month and 12month
  intervals, for five individual, family and community “protective factors”
  which provide indicators of neighborhood wellbeing. These assessments will be
  conducted with participants in the Act2Connect action groups, community
  members participating in their actions and projects, and family members and
  peer network members not directly involved in the project. These factors
  are:</p>






  <p>* Social connections: Number and intensity of supportive relationships 


    to other individuals and families in the community.</p>


  <p>* Access to and utilization of concrete support in times of need: Families 


    need to meet their basic needs (shelter, food, clothing, health care) in 


    order to ensure their own stability and the healthy development of 


    children. This factor is linked to social connection, as families with 


    active networks and community relationships tend to access more 


    resources.</p>


  <p>* Parental resilience: Capacity to creatively problemsolve parenting 


    challenges. This factor is strongly linked to optimism and belief in self


    efficacy, which are in turn linked to social connections.


  <p>* Knowledge of parenting and child development: Ability to create 


    nurturing and healthy family environments; strongly linked to 


    involvement with resilient, parenting peers.


  <p>* Social and emotional competence of children: Children's ability to 


    interact positively with others, selfregulate their behavior and 


    effectively communicate their feelings. This factor is strongly linked to 


    parental resilience which (as indicated above) is in turn linked to social 


    connection.</p>





  <p>We hope to establish through this evaluation that overall levels of social
  connectedness in the community:</p>






  <p>* increase over the oneyear Act2Connect project cycle </p>



  <p>* increase for participants as well as for the broader community</p>



  <p>* are linked in time to key project milestones (completion of project 


    planning, and completion of project); </p>


  <p>* increase following the project; and</p>



  <p>* are sustained for several months beyond project completion</p>
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  Our project is anticipated to have shortterm, measurable impacts on levels of
  violence and features conducive to community safety (traffic planning, street
  lighting, etc.) in the neighborhoods we target. Increased rates of early
  disclosure and assistance for domestic violence and child abuse—among
  populations that are often extremely difficult for more traditional
  socialservices approaches to reach effectively—may be another key beneficial
  outcome.






  However, while these outcomes are worthwhile on their own, we believe that the
  most significant neighborhoodlevel change (and one that could provide a
  template for a broader, L.A. Countywide set of practices) will be found in
  increased levels of social connection in neighborhoods often characterized by
  precisely the opposite: transient populations, physically dense but largely
  anonymous living and housing patterns, very low rates of voting and civic
  engagement, low rates of volunteerism, and pronounced disengagement between
  generations. By mobilizing a core group of resident volunteer leaders, setting
  in motion and supporting a project development approach in which they
  themselves develop and intensity a network of social relationships in the
  community, and tying this network to a series of safety outcomes explicitly
  related to neighbortoneighbor trust and support, and to engagement with public
  institutions and systems, we hope to establish a selfsustaining, growing
  movement toward connection in each of our 10 targeted neighborhoods. 






  We know from data and evaluation (both our own, and a growing research
  literature) that networks of effective and supportive social relationships are
  the “keystone” factor among a group of characteristics variously called
  “protective factors,” “wellbeing indicators,” or “components of resiliency.”
  The presence of these characteristics are what sets successful communities
  apart from others, even in cases where more traditional indicators of
  community vitality (wealth and income, levels of educational attainment, etc.)
  are low. To put it simply, even economically “poor” neighborhoods may be
  experienced by their residents as desirable places to live and interact if
  these other factors are present in high levels.






  Demonstrating the effectiveness of an approach to promote these
  connectednessrelated factors at the neighborhood level could have farreaching
  impacts in L.A. County. Approaches to community safety, economic development,
  and civic engagement rooted in enforcement, job training, and formal education
  will always have their place. However, addressing and moving beyond the limits
  of these approaches—and thus producing real and lasting change in some of the
  most intractable issue areas facing our underresourced communities—becomes
  possible only through reliance on strategies mobilizing residenttoresident
  networks of trust and mutual support. These smallscale, residentled
  institutions are the future of a safe, vibrant, healthy, and just Los Angeles
  County.
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  <p>Thirtyseven years from today, the children of Act2Connect participants will
  be nearing fifty. Many will be parents themselves. Some will be grandparents.
  Three generations of active, engaged, invested community members will have
  sustained and deepened the strategies and communityled institutions developed
  in the project. Neighborhoods will continue to face many of today's
  challenges. But these neighborhoods' capacity to address and productively
  answer these challenges will have undergone a complete transformation:</p>






  <p>* At the neighborhood middle school, a fight breaks out between students.
  Teachers convene a meeting of the school's Student Justice Team, which
  provides a mediated resolution of the conflict and restitution of injuries.
  This community service involves the previous adversaries in the activities
  of:</p><p>* The Neighborhood Cooperative Economic Council, whose projects
  include a network of community gardens whose produce is distributed through a
  CSA box service. Subscribers can pay cash, or use a local scrip currency
  accepted throughout the:</p><p>* Local Trading Network, a barterbased system
  of consumer economics designed to allow for full participation by those
  employed in the wage economy as well as those who for various reasons
  (stayathome parenthood, undocumented immigration status) do not conduct all of
  their economic activities on a monetary basis. Clothing, food, household
  repairs, bulkpurchased staple commodities and more are available, along with
  many of the services of:</p><p>* Community workerowned coops, providing
  employment opportunities beyond traditional job development programs, and
  equally accessible to the documented and undocumented. Services include
  landscaping and gardening, baking and catering, financial services,
  and:</p><p>* A neighborhood childcare coop, informed by current best practices
  in child development and making full use of the neighborhoods public spaces
  and buildings. These public spaces are accessible through:</p><p>* A robust
  network of bike and pedestrian lanes which converge on a neighborhood “core”
  incorporating a creative arts block, youth development programs, and community
  entertainment and convening spaces. Travel to and from events in these spaces
  is made safe by:</p><p>* A community volunteer Street Team, trained in
  conflict deescalation and connected to restorative justice councils in the
  neighborhood as well as a:</p><p>* Domestic violence and abuse prevention
  dropin center, providing a safe space staffed with trusted neighborhood
  members in which community residents can seek referrals for help, shelter,
  mediation and legal services, all before involving:</p><p>* The public child
  welfare system, which, like other public institutions, now coordinates its
  work with resident volunteer organizations in the neighborhood, learning from
  them, leveraging their local knowledgebase and trust relationships, and
  responding quickly to the resident concerns that they raise.</p>
