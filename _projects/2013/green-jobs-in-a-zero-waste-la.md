title: Green Jobs in a Zero Waste LA
indicator: ' Income & Employment'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  <p>The Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy proposes to partner with Isidore
  Electronics Recycling in a project that has the potential to generate tens of
  thousands of good green jobs in the City of Los Angeles by 2050 and improve
  the quality of thousands of existing jobs, all while contributing to a cleaner
  environment. </p>






  <p>LAANE’s Don’t Waste LA project has taken the first step in this initiative
  by winning City Council endorsement of an exclusive franchise system for
  collection and diversion of waste from customers not served by the City. 
  Currently the city of LA picks up trash at single family and small multifamily
  homes while private haulers receive city permits to collect waste from all
  other users based on service agreements with building owners and businesses. 
  </p>






  <p>Commercial trash accounts for over 70 percent of the city's waste but
  neither the city nor the private haulers are subject to any landfill diversion
  requirements. Private haulers are not required to recycle and the companies
  are not regulated. Due to this lack of regulation, recycling facilities often
  create major health and safety concerns for workers and nearby residents.</p>






  <p>Most materials are collected together and then sorted by hand, sent off to
  the Central Valley or overseas for reuse, and not necessarily reused in the
  most sustainable way.  Most of LA’s ewaste is shipped out of the county or the
  state for processing.  </p>






  <p>The policy that LAANE proposed and the Council endorsed will establish
  designated service zones with haulers competing for the exclusive right to
  service each of those areas. Successful bidders would have to adhere to strict
  environmental, recycling and labor standards. Recycling will be mandatory and
  increase exponentially, and the companies engaged in recycling will be held to
  new high standards. 



  The Don’t Waste LA project aims to make LA a national model for resource
  management by creating a system that allows us to reach zero waste goals,
  while insuring that both the new jobs created as a result of recycling, and
  existing jobs in the industry, are good ones.  </p>






  <p>We are currently working with the City to prepare the regulations and
  standards for the new system.   We aim for the new system and accompanying
  environmental review to be finalized and approved by the Council in the next
  year, followed by the request for proposals process and award of franchise
  agreements, which begins the transition to the new system.  All the new
  contracts will not be in place and operating until 2017, but the system will
  begin to be implemented in 2014 as the RFP process starts and contracts are
  awarded.</p>






  <p>Full implementation of the franchise and stopping the export of recycling
  will result in the creation of at least 14,400 new living wage jobs in
  processing.  The franchise policy will ensure a steady stream of recyclables
  enabling companies like our partner Isidore Recycling to expand their
  business, and can lay the groundwork and provide incentives for
  remanufacturing locally.   In addition, incentives could be built into the
  policy to benefit companies like Isidore.  For example, in addition to
  educating their customers about ewaste, franchisees could be required to
  choose responsible subcontractors located in LA. 



  With Isidore Recycling, we are proposing to pilot a model for how social
  entrepreneurs can take advantage of this new policy to expand their businesses
  and create good new jobs. Our proposal includes: 1) full implementation of the
  franchise to reach citywide zero waste, improve existing impacted jobs, create
  14,400 good new processing jobs, and lay the groundwork for the creation of
  quality jobs in recycling and remanufacturing:  2) ensuring the franchise
  policy includes a goal and plan for recycling ewaste (the fastest growing
  waste stream in the city) in the implementation of the policy in each service
  zone; 3) a specific marketing plan to educate people and businesses about
  recycling their ewaste, and to increase ewaste recycling from 20% to 100% by
  2050; 4) research on the current landscape of recycling and remanufacture in
  order to determine which incentives, both through this policy and otherwise,
  can help seed the expansion of local remanufacturing.



  Development of the market for recycling and remanufacture in the City will
  require marketbased incentives and a focus on capital investments in order to
  bolster the infrastructure.  It will also benefit from government procurement
  policies that are more stringent and prioritize higher percentages of recycled
  content, as well as a database of processors, manufacturers, and material
  brokers.  We will need to do a study on material recovery facilities’
  processing standards and the recovery rates for each material that enters a
  facility. The next step in the ewaste recycling industry in LA is better
  recovery of minerals, metals and plastics for remanufacture—another source of
  new green jobs.</p>
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  <p>LAANE was formed in 1993 to improve the quality of life and the environment
  in lowincome communities in LA.  Using research, organizing,
  coalitionbuilding, policy advocacy and communications, LAANE has won programs
  that uplift job quality in local industries, provide health benefits for
  workers, and increase the number of and access to good jobs as well as
  training for them. Our work has won policies that link economic development to
  cleaning up the environment in lowincome communities.</p>



  <p>LAANE helped to launch the Community Benefits movement in 2001 and built
  coalitions that won Community Benefits Agreements for major economic
  developments, guaranteeing a wide range of environmental, economic and other
  benefits for communities. Our groundbreaking work on the CBA for LAX Airport
  allocated $500 million to environmental studies and mitigations that have
  reduced noise and air pollution generated by the Airport.</p>



  <p>LAANE’s work on trucking at the Ports of LA and Long Beach established a
  “concession” program that has resulted in scrapping 16,000 polluting trucks
  and replacing them with trucks meeting the highest standards for low
  emissions—reducing truckcaused pollution by 80% to date.</p>



  <p>We have won approval of policies to uplift job quality and improve job
  access and training in construction, including developments at the Port of LA,
  work under the Department of Public Works, and, most recently, major transit
  projects planned by the County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. These
  Construction Careers Policies have already yielded training and employment for
  thousands of disadvantaged workers and will ultimately reach close to 90,000. 
  One of our newest projects provides for training disadvantaged LA workers to
  carry out energy efficiency measures in buildings all over the City in
  partnership with the Department of Water and Power.</p>



  <p>Much of our work has been about job quality—beginning with our victory in
  the 1997 landmark LA Living Wage Ordinance.  Since then, we have won other
  living wage policies and upgraded the original policy several times.</p>



  <p>We have produced the highest quality research reports on the industries
  that we have targeted and on poverty and jobs.  We developed a communications
  program that rivals those of many much larger nonprofit organizations.</p>



  <p>Isidore Electronics Recycling is in its second year collecting ewaste and
  training and employing the previously incarcerated. A staff of 6 operates out
  of a warehouse in northeast LA. Trainees learn to demanufacture ewaste, repair
  and refurbish electronics for reuse, staff collection events and operate the
  ecommerce store. Isidore has collected and/or processed over 110,000 pounds of
  electronics and earned revenue through escrap sales and its Ebay store.
  Clients include American Apparel, Pitches County Detention Center, LA Car Guy,
  and Helms Bakery Properties. All employees make at least $10/hour with
  opportunities for advancement.</p>
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  LAANE comes to this project with key partners in place, including Isidore
  Recycling, which will provide the model for a responsible LAbased industry. We
  have also partnered with the City Bureau of Sanitation and key political
  officials including a Councilmember and State assembly member.  Moreover, the
  Don’t Waste LA coalition has some 40 members including labor, environmental
  and environmental justice organizations, communitybased organizations and
  groups, neighborhood councils, students, and small businesses—including some
  high road waste haulers.  We hope to add more responsible entrepreneurs to the
  team as the project develops, most notably the businesses that locate
  recycling and remanufacturing facilities in the City.
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  Success will mean that 1) a massive waste diversion program is adopted and
  implemented in a way that yields a minimal 75% diversion rate by 2017, and a
  90% diversion rate by 2025, 2) the program is innovative and serves as a model
  for other regions, and 3) tens of thousands of disadvantaged workers are
  trained and employed in the revamped recycling industry and the new local
  remanufacturing industry.  In addition, existing jobs in the industries—from
  collection to remanufacture—will be upgraded to familysupporting standards.



  Our criteria for success over the next fiveyear period are:



  1) All of our criteria, including standards for recycling facilities and
  management of ewaste, are included in the final ordinance enabling the
  exclusive franchise policy, the implementation plan, and the subsequently
  issued RFPs.



  2) The ordinance is approved by the City Council by early 2014 at the latest
  and transition to the new system is put into motion in 2014. 



  3)  A major initiative to attract recycling and remanufacturing businesses to
  LA will be successful, leading to at least five recycling and at least three
  remanufacturing businesses that locate or remain in the city and meet high
  standards.  



  4)  The ewaste pilot project will spur more responsible entrepreneurs in this
  field to start up in LA, resulting in virtually all ewaste being recycled and
  remanufactured locally.



  5)  By 2025, the City achieves 90% recycling of ewaste.  



  LAANE staff has established the baseline data on existing conditions in the
  waste collection industry, including cleanliness of trucks, job quality, and
  impact on neighborhoods as well as numbers of recycling facilities and their
  practices, and the lack of local remanufacturing facilities.  Progress
  following implementation of the exclusive franchise system will be measured
  against these baselines.  The tools we will use to document impact will
  include citygenerated reports, interviews with residents, business owners, and
  industry workers, and direct observation of the collection system and the
  recycling and remanufacturing facilities in operation.
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  <p>The exclusive franchise that meets our zero waste goals (all waste
  recycled, composted or otherwise processed) will create over 2,800 new jobs
  even while 80% of recycling is exported. With robust new infrastructure for
  recycling and remanufacturing that ends export of recycables, an additional
  11,500 jobs can be added, building to nearly 50,000 jobs in these industries
  in LA by 2050. </p>






  <p>While this project can be a huge generator of jobs, if the region does not
  develop new recycling infrastructure, recycling/remanufacturing will continue
  to be exported overseas. Absent this change, within the next decade, an
  estimated 11,500 new manufacturing jobs will be lost— and we estimate that
  every job sent overseas could mean seven jobs in our region.  For example,
  upon implementation of the exclusive franchise, if plastics and compost
  infrastructure is developed, it will immediately create 6,000 jobs that would
  otherwise go out of the country.</p>



  LAANE, Isidore and our other partners in this work will ensure that the jobs
  created in waste hauling, diversion and remanufacture pay family supporting
  wages, offer health care and are safe and green.</p>






  <p>Ewaste is one of the most promising areas for job creation in recycling. 
  Now, over 200,000 tons of ewaste end up in landfills annually, though it is
  toxic and illegal. The benefits of the proper stewardship of ewaste are
  considerable. Electronics can be demanufactured for valuable materials such as
  titanium and platinum. Handled correctly, these increasingly rare commodities,
  along with other materials, can be remanufactured to benefit LA workers,
  industry and the community. </p>






  <p>LA will benefit from incubating manufacturing businesses that make new
  products out of highvolume recycled materials like compostable organics and
  plastics as the demand for highquality compost from farmers and recycled
  plastic goods for remanufacture increases. The demand from residents and
  businesses that prefer products made of recycled materials will boost the
  economy. </p>






  <p>At the core of the issue is making sure we have highquality materials for
  businesses that need them the most: processors and remanufacturers. By keeping
  a "closedloop" on recycling, we ensure that we have more materials in the
  recycling stream, we can attract and incubate entire recycling supply chains,
  and we are able to create more jobs. Part of our research will include
  exploring promising new policy strategies including government procurement
  policies and tax incentives as a means of encouraging the expansion of this
  industry — one that already has created 128,000 jobs in California.</p>






  <p>The implementation of the exclusive franchise will not only lead to new job
  creation and the uplift of existing jobs, the project will include significant
  environmental benefits leading to a zero waste city, cleaner air due to newly
  required cleanfuel trucks, and streets that are safer and relieved of
  nuisance.</p>
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  <p>In 2050, Los Angeles will be a zero waste city.  All waste will be recycled
  or diverted.  There will be no landfills or incineration and the streets will
  be cleaner.</p>






  <p>We envision a new ecosystem for LA where waste and recycling jobs are part
  of the new green economy; where we reimagine what we view as “trash,” and see
  it as a potential resource, and where we encounter less waste overall and
  virtually no plastic or other nondegradable trash.  Households and businesses
  will recycle and compost, there will be no incineration and no landfills.  All
  trash will be recycled by local businesses and made into useful products by
  local residents paid living wages and provided benefits and clean, safe
  working conditions.  This new system will represent the transformation of a
  dirty, unsustainable industry into a just and green one that provides tens of
  thousands of good new jobs in LA. </p>






  <p>In 2050, 100% of ewaste will be diverted from landfills and properly
  recycled. It will be collected and processed within the region, and the
  materials recovered (metals, plastic, circuit boards and glass) used in local
  remanufacturing industries. The regional ewaste recycling industry will have
  grown in publicprivate partnership between social enterprises, local
  government and public agencies so that 1) the public is informed and empowered
  to properly dispose of their ewaste, 2) government and local ewaste companies
  have the capacity to collect and process the city's ewaste, and 3) local
  social enterprises will utilize the entire waste stream to train and hire
  workers in Los Angeles for quality career ladder jobs. </p>






  <p>There will be fewer trucks collecting waste and they will be clean
  vehicles.  Their routes will not overlap and they will not be a nuisance in
  neighborhoods.  Rates will be fair and affordable.</p>






  <p>Employment in the waste collection, recycling and remanufacturing
  industries will be high quality with familysupporting wages and full
  benefits.</p>






  <p>There will be at least 50,000 new or improved jobs in the LA recycling and
  remanufacturing industries and these will be high quality jobs with career
  ladders.</p>






  <p>The ewaste pilot project will spur more responsible entrepreneurs in this
  field to start up in LA resulting in all ewaste being recycled and
  remanufactured.</p>






  <p>All recycled materials will be reused in the most sustainable way.</p>






  <p>All of LA’s recycling and remanufacturing will be done by businesses
  located in the City that will employ residents.</p>
