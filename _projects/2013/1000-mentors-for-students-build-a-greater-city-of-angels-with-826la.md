title: '1000 Mentors for Students: Build a Greater City of Angels with 826LA!'
indicator: ' Education'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  <p>Imagine Los Angeles in the year 2050 when we all play a part in educating
  our city’s youngest citizens. Volunteering is as common as going to the gym.
  Adults feel fulfilled because they are connecting with others. School children
  are thriving because they have a community of role models who serve as
  mentors. Los Angeles is flourishing because everyone lends a hand.</p>






  <p>In this vision of Los Angeles, education reaches beyond the classroom.
  Children have a wealth of teachers because adults volunteer a few hours of
  their time each week. With so many caring adults cheering them on, students
  are more focused and excited to learn.</p>






  <p>To make our vision of L.A. in 2050 a reality, 826LA will inspire over 1,000
  Angelinos to make volunteering part of their lives in 2013. By sharing their
  talents and their time, these volunteers will help students across Los Angeles
  to make great leaps in learning. Studies show that students who receive
  oneonone attention from adults improve their academic outcomes, behavior, and
  selfesteem. All of these attributes are crucial for the future parents,
  workers, and leaders of our city.</p>






  <p>This idea will not only improve the existing problems in Los Angeles’
  education system, it will encourage a culture of compassion in our city. As
  volunteer Kelly told 826LA, “It feels good to give yourself to something
  else.” By sharing their experiences with their friends and families, these
  1,000 volunteers will encourage even more people to volunteer to lead a
  workshop, to coach a soccer game, or to help a child with their homework.
  Pretty soon, everyone in L.A. will be doing it, and we’ll all be the better
  for it, too.  </p>
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  <p>Since opening our doors in 2005, 826LA has served more than 30,000 students
  from across Los Angeles County. Thanks to the hard work of over 3,000
  volunteers and countless supporters, 826LA has increased its reach
  substantially over the past few years. In 2008, 826LA opened a new center in
  Echo Park. This fall, 826LA moved its Westside operations to Mar Vista. This
  new Mar Vista center increases 826LA’s capacity significantly, providing 2,625
  squarefeet of creative space for students as well as better visibility and
  accessibility for the organization. 826LA will have the capacity to serve 30%
  more students each day through AfterSchool Tutoring in Mar Vista; to add a
  series of evening workshops targeted at middle and high school students; and
  to recruit and train up up to 35 volunteers per week.</p>






  <p>Last year, 826LA served 10,105 students last yeara 23% increase from the
  previous year. We are not only serving more students, but we are increasing
  the benefits of our programs across the academic curriculum. Over six years of
  assessments and surveys demonstrate that 826LA’s programs build selfesteem,
  teach literacy skills, and improve educational outcomes. Last year:</p>






  <p> 93% of students reported that they understood their writing assignment
  better thanks to the help of 826LA volunteers;</p>



  <p> 90% of students reported that working with an 826LA volunteer in their
  classroom increased their confidence about writing;</p>



  <p> 95% of students reported that they were proud of what they created during
  an 826LA workshop;</p>



  <p> 100% of students reported that their grades have improved since receiving
  tutoring at 826LA.</p>






  <p>Other notable achievements include:</p>



  <p>* In 2006, 826LA received a Proclamation of Recognition from Los Angeles
  Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, and in honor of our 5th Anniversary in 2010, 826LA
  received an award from the Los Angeles City Council, acknowledging 826LA’s
  dedication to the community;</p>



  <p>* 826LA received a Proclamation of Recognition from Los Angeles Supervisor
  Eric Garcetti for our work in the Echo Park community in March 2010;</p>



  <p>* 826LA was named a “Nonprofit to Follow” by Philanthropy magazine in
  2012;</p>



  <p>* On April 9, 2013, 826LA will be honored during the Mayors Day of
  Recognition for National Service at City Hall by Los Angeles Mayor Antonio
  Villaraigosa for our work with the Corporation for National and Community
  Service and Volunteers In Service To America (VISTA). </p><p>Thanks in part to
  recruitment, training, and retention practices strengthened by AmeriCorps
  VISTA members, hours contributed by volunteers at 826LA increased by 40% last
  year!</p>
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  826LA will collaborate with AmeriCorps VISTA; local colleges and universities
  including Cal State LA, Cal State Northridge, USC, and UCLA; and its volunteer
  corps of over 3,000 individuals in order to successfully implement this
  project. To recruit volunteers, 826LA will collaborate with LA Works as part
  of their California Volunteers Service Enterprise Initiative.
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >+
  To evaluate this project, 826LA will measure its success towards reaching the
  following goals:






  1) Recruit, register, and train at least 1,000 volunteer mentors in 2013;



  2) Share volunteer stories through 826LA's website, blog, events, and external
  communications in order to promote volunteering in Los Angeles;



  3) A minimum of 85% of students participating in 826LA’s inschool programs
  will report that the adults they worked with cared about their success in
  school.


How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
  Los Angeles students attend some of the most overcrowded schools in the United
  States. With so many students in their classrooms, teachers are unable to
  offer the oneonone time that is crucial for young people. 826LA seeks to give
  students the individual attention they need to become effective learners,
  confident leaders, and engaged citizens. 826LA’s project will do this by
  inspiring over 1,000 citizens to get involved in our community and mentor
  local students. Even a few hours of volunteer time can have a huge impact on a
  child: studies show that with 3540 hours of tutoring, a student can increase
  his or her reading by an entire grade level!






  Beyond the educational boon to students, this project will benefit the whole
  city by encouraging a culture of compassion. The impact of helping others is
  significant: studies show that volunteering reduces stress and alleviates
  depression. The impact of receiving help can be transformative, too. Students
  will grow up knowing that they are an important part of a community that cares
  about them. Volunteers become mentors to the children they work with, and, by
  modeling good citizenship, they will teach children that giving back is just
  part of what we do in Los Angeles. 






  Our vision of a connected future starts today. The more we volunteer in 2013,
  the more we perpetuate this cycle of giving. And by 2050, today’s students
  will become tomorrow’s mentors for a new generation of Angelinos. 


What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  <p>If 826LA is successful in shaping the future of the city, every student in
  Los Angeles will receive the oneonone help they need to succeed. Individual
  attention helps students build leadership skills that are essential for 21st
  century life, including focus, strong communication, decisiveness,
  selfrespect, and compassion. Volunteers will make it possible for every
  student to receive individual attention regardless of their socioeconomic
  status. Talent, experience, and kindness abound in the City of Angels, and by
  volunteering just a few hours a week, Angelinos can share this wealth with
  young people. </p>






  <p>It’s projected that there will be more than 39 million people in Los
  Angeles County in 2050—that’s a lot of volunteers! By making volunteering part
  of our lives, we will give our students a diverse group of role models.
  Students will have opportunities to explore filmmaking from film
  professionals; to visit science labs; to discover other cultures; and to
  practice their Englishlanguage skills with their neighbors.</p> 






  <p>By 2050, citywide volunteering will create a more united Los Angeles.
  Generous adults not only provide the oneonone attention that students need,
  but also show them that they are part of a community that cares. It’s
  important that young people find the inspiration and guidance that they are
  seeking; and see first hand what the work of volunteers can do for others, and
  ultimately, for themselves. As 826LA volunteer Vicente explains:</p>






  <p>"I [volunteer] because I can relate to the students. I grew up this way. I
  struggled with English writing and English speaking. I know the importance of
  receiving positive reinforcement, and that's what students get when they come
  to 826LA. I volunteer because my heart is in helping students." </p>






  <p>By giving our attention and volunteering our time, everyone will contribute
  to the education of our children in 2050. Our students—and all of Los
  Angeles—will benefit from this culturally rich, engaged, and united city. </p>

Generous adults not only provide the one-on-one attention that students need, but also show them that they are part of a community that cares. It’s important that young people find the inspiration and guidance that they are seeking; and see first hand what the work of volunteers can do for others, and ultimately, for themselves. As 826LA volunteer Vicente explains:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"I [volunteer] because I can relate to the students. I grew up this way. I struggled with English writing and English speaking. I know the importance of receiving positive reinforcement, and that's what students get when they come to 826LA. I volunteer because my heart is in helping students.\" </p>\r\n\r\n<p>By giving our attention and volunteering our time, everyone will contribute to the education of our children in 2050. Our students—and all of Los Angeles—will benefit from this culturally rich, engaged, and united city. </p>"

project_summary: "<p>Since opening our doors in 2005, 826LA has served more than 30,000 students from across Los Angeles County. Thanks to the hard work of over 3,000 volunteers and countless supporters, 826LA has increased its reach substantially over the past few years. In 2008, 826LA opened a new center in Echo Park. This fall, 826LA moved its Westside operations to Mar Vista. This new Mar Vista center increases 826LA’s capacity significantly, providing 2,625 square-feet of creative space for students as well as better visibility and accessibility for the organization. 826LA will have the capacity to serve 30% more students each day through After-School Tutoring in Mar Vista; to add a series of evening workshops targeted at middle and high school students; and to recruit and train up up to 35 volunteers per week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last year, 826LA served 10,105 students last year--a 23% increase from the previous year. We are not only serving more students, but we are increasing the benefits of our programs across the academic curriculum. Over six years of assessments and surveys demonstrate that 826LA’s programs build self-esteem, teach literacy skills, and improve educational outcomes. Last year:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- 93% of students reported that they understood their writing assignment better thanks to the help of 826LA volunteers;</p>\r\n<p>- 90% of students reported that working with an 826LA volunteer in their classroom increased their confidence about writing;</p>\r\n<p>- 95% of students reported that they were proud of what they created during an 826LA workshop;</p>\r\n<p>- 100% of students reported that their grades have improved since receiving tutoring at 826LA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other notable achievements include:</p>\r\n<p>• In 2006, 826LA received a Proclamation of Recognition from Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, and in honor of our 5th Anniversary in 2010, 826LA received an award from the Los Angeles City Council, acknowledging 826LA’s dedication to the community;</p>\r\n<p>• 826LA received a Proclamation of Recognition from Los Angeles Supervisor Eric Garcetti for our work in the Echo Park community in March 2010;</p>\r\n<p>• 826LA was named a “Nonprofit to Follow” by Philanthropy magazine in 2012;</p>\r\n<p>• On April 9, 2013, 826LA will be honored during the Mayors Day of Recognition for National Service at City Hall by Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa for our work with the Corporation for National and Community Service and Volunteers In Service To America (VISTA). </p><p>Thanks in part to recruitment, training, and retention practices strengthened by AmeriCorps VISTA members, hours contributed by volunteers at 826LA increased by 40% last year!</p>"
