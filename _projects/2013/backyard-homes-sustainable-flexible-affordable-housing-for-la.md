title: 'Backyard Homes: Sustainable Flexible Affordable Housing for LA'
project_summary: "cityLAB proposes to build, study, and publicly display a prototype Backyard Home using innovative, simple technologies that will create sustainable, affordable, flexible, livable housing for Los Angeles.\r\n<br><br>\r\nLos Angeles developed as a city of suburbs, where yards and gardens surround individual homes to create our distinctive neighborhood identity. But LA’s suburban sprawl also created a laundry list of problems, from traffic congestion to unaffordable home prices. cityLAB, a think tank at UCLA, along with Daly Genik Architects, have developed a new concept and construction technology for “Backyard Homes” that will maintain the beauty of the Los Angeles home-in-the-garden pattern, yet has the potential to provide a substantial supply of new housing. The idea is simple: on a house-by-house basis, owners can acquire and customize a Backyard Home. It arrives to the site packed flat, allowing it to squeeze past side yards and tight spaces. Once in the backyard, a foundation is erected, the flat-packed walls expand to become rooms, and a skin is added to the walls. Homeowners can customize a studio, one-bedroom, and two-bedroom arrangement, much like purchasing a new car with various interior packages to choose from.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn fact, there are 500,000 single-family home sites in the City of Los Angeles alone. Already a number of those half-million lots have illegal rental units in their garages and backyards. In 2003, the State of California passed the Granny Flat Law, to permit second units on single-family lots, and in 2009, the City Council acted to make backyard housing possible across Los Angeles. Our project recognizes that the illegal units reflect a real need for backyard housing that is safe, legal, affordable, and easy to construct. The recent state and city rulings provide the guideposts to creating safe, legal units; the cityLAB prototype will create a model of affordable, easy-to-construct Backyard Homes. With the laws and the model home, everything is in place for homeowners to build Backyard Homes that will create a much more diverse housing supply and a more livable Los Angeles."

  success: "We propose to build a demonstration prototype specifically so that we can evaluate its performance on a number of measures. This is a real research project as well as a public demonstration of new housing technologies. We will measure the success of the Backyard Homes demonstration project in the following ways:\r\n<br><br>\r\n1. Cost. We will evaluate the prototype in terms of cost, with the goal that it should cost less than half of prevailing per-square-foot residential construction, or approximately $50,000 for a small unit.\r\n<br><br>\r\n2. Environmental Impacts. The prototype will be evaluated in terms of environmental impacts on a range of measures, with the goal that it should outperform standard home construction by a factor of 10. We will study approximately two dozen different impacts such as recyclable materials, production of carcinogens, summer smog, acidification, sourcing and shipping, assemble-to-disassemble impacts, etc.\r\n<br><br>\r\n3. Ease of Construction. The assembly of the prototype will be documented to both evaluate and record how easy it is to install. The installation in the Hammer Museum courtyard will itself be part of the exhibition, allowing the public to observe, first-hand, the methods of construction and the “backyard squeeze” in practice.\r\n<br><br>\r\n4. Public Response. We will collect responses from visitors to the Backyard Home exhibition during the two to four weeks it will be installed in the museum’s publicly accessible courtyard and will begin to develop relationships with potential developers and owners of Backyard Homes."
  description: "Backyard Homes will benefit Los Angeles by making it more livable in three substantial ways.\r\n\r\nFirst it will improve our housing, by making it more affordable, more flexible, more sustainable, and more livable. According to a preliminary study by Stanford University engineers, compared to a typical house of the same size, the Backyard Home has a ten times to as much as a hundred times lower environmental impact. The simple construction system will make it possible to acquire a Backyard Home the way you might buy a car, will leave no foundation if and when it is disassembled, and will be adjusted or customized to each yard and household need. A family that needs more space can find it in their own backyard. A family that wants to reduce its mortgage payment can do so. A Backyard Home can provide a home office now, and become a caregiver apartment later.\r\n\r\nSecond, it will improve neighborhoods. Now, when a family’s circumstances change, they often need to move to a new community where housing is cheaper, bigger, smaller, or in some way more suitable to their new needs. This creates neighborhoods in constant flux. Neighborhoods will have greater stability when people can stay in place through the various stages of their lives. Neighborhood stability has profound benefits for the residents, from improved quality of life, to improved educational outcomes, to improved health outcomes. In addition, Backyard Homes is a solution that can replace unwanted infill housing development such as large apartment buildings or condominiums that change neighborhoods in unwanted ways.\r\n\r\nThird, Backyard Homes will improve the city as a whole, by helping reduce sprawl, traffic, and greenhouse gas emissions. The innovative construction and design technology can set a new standard for housing in the city, demonstrating that Los Angeles can grow inward instead of outward, while at the same time growing more sustainably, more beautifully, and more affordably. In the same way that mid-century modernists championed a new form of home through technology and design in 50s-era LA, Backyard Homes can make Los Angeles more Angeleno for the twenty-first century."

    The project will be undertaken by the internationally recognized team of
    UCLA’s cityLAB and Daly Genik Architects who have been collaborating for the
    past six years. Our partners have included the LA City Planning Department,
    Los Angeles Housing Department, non-profit housing corporations, various
    departments and faculty members at UCLA, a range of community organizations,
    Habitat for Humanity, Stanford University’s Engineering Department, and Buro
    Happold Engineers. Because cityLAB is a university-based research center,
    students are involved in all the work we undertake. About 100 architecture
    and planning students have been part of the Backyard Homes effort to date.
    All collaborators have donated their services and will continue to do so.

  vision: "In 2050, if Backyard Homes had spread to just 20% of the 500,000 single family lots across Los Angeles, we would have a full 100,000 new, affordable, sustainable homes and yet our neighborhoods would hardly look any different!

  following ways:



  <br><br>



  1. Cost. We will evaluate the prototype in terms of cost, with the goal that
  it should cost less than half of prevailing persquarefoot residential
  construction, or approximately $50,000 for a small unit.

How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  Backyard Homes will benefit Los Angeles by making it more livable in three
  substantial ways.






  First it will improve our housing, by making it more affordable, more
  flexible, more sustainable, and more livable. According to a preliminary study
  by Stanford University engineers, compared to a typical house of the same
  size, the Backyard Home has a ten times to as much as a hundred times lower
  environmental impact. The simple construction system will make it possible to
  acquire a Backyard Home the way you might buy a car, will leave no foundation
  if and when it is disassembled, and will be adjusted or customized to each
  yard and household need. A family that needs more space can find it in their
  own backyard. A family that wants to reduce its mortgage payment can do so. A
  Backyard Home can provide a home office now, and become a caregiver apartment
  later.






  Second, it will improve neighborhoods. Now, when a family’s circumstances
  change, they often need to move to a new community where housing is cheaper,
  bigger, smaller, or in some way more suitable to their new needs. This creates
  neighborhoods in constant flux. Neighborhoods will have greater stability when
  people can stay in place through the various stages of their lives.
  Neighborhood stability has profound benefits for the residents, from improved
  quality of life, to improved educational outcomes, to improved health
  outcomes. In addition, Backyard Homes is a solution that can replace unwanted
  infill housing development such as large apartment buildings or condominiums
  that change neighborhoods in unwanted ways.






  Third, Backyard Homes will improve the city as a whole, by helping reduce
  sprawl, traffic, and greenhouse gas emissions. The innovative construction and
  design technology can set a new standard for housing in the city,
  demonstrating that Los Angeles can grow inward instead of outward, while at
  the same time growing more sustainably, more beautifully, and more affordably.
  In the same way that midcentury modernists championed a new form of home
  through technology and design in 50sera LA, Backyard Homes can make Los
  Angeles more Angeleno for the twentyfirst century.
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  In 2050, if Backyard Homes had spread to just 20% of the 500,000 single family
  lots across Los Angeles, we would have a full 100,000 new, affordable,
  sustainable homes and yet our neighborhoods would hardly look any different!

  If we could see inside each home, what we would notice would be fewer misfits
  between the old suburban housetype and the wide variety of current households:
  fewer families doubled up, fewer college kids struggling to make ends meet,
  fewer households moving when they reach the “empty nest” stage of life, fewer
  homeless people, fewer nannies and caregivers having to commute long distances
  to their jobs, fewer aging parents placed in institutions far from their
  families.



  <br><br>



  In 2050, we could look at measures of Backyard Homes’ success via quantifiable
  measures: there would be fewer home foreclosures, more affordable rental
  housing available, shorter commute times from home to work, increasing numbers
  of legal backyard units, and an abundance of new types of Backyard Homes in
  addition to this prototype developed by cityLAB.
