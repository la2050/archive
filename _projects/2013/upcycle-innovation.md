  success: "Creative reuse, such as the Upcycle Innovation project, provides a triple bottom line for the city by benefiting its people, the environment and the economy. We will measure the project through these three criteria. \r\n\r\nPeople: Our goal will be to serve 8,500 people (doubling the number served last year) in the first year through our various programs. We will also work with our network of educators to refine and evaluate our programs to serve a wide range of learning styles and ages. \r\n\r\nEnvironment and Economy: There are many ways of measuring the positive environmental and economic impact reuse has on our city. These include, but are not limited, to:\r\n•\t# of tons diverted from the landfill\r\n•\t$ avoided disposal costs (donor/seller)\r\n•\t$ avoided purchase costs (recipient/buyer)\r\n•\t$ value of materials donated (donor)\r\n•\t$ revenues earned (donor/seller)\r\n•\t# of job created or retained\r\n•\t# of families/individuals/organizations assisted\r\n\r\nWe will work with Arts Earth Partnership and the Reuse Alliance to create an appropriately scaled evaluation tool.\r\n"

  brief: "Ready to Innovate? Imagine an entire generation of young Angelenos who grow up molding, repurposing, and upcycling discarded material bound for the landfill?  Thomas Edison said, “To invent, you need a good imagination and a pile of junk.” The Upcycle Innovation project will provide the “junk” and the tools needed for creative exploration and invention. Thomas Edison also said, “Just because something doesn’t do what you planned it to do doesn’t mean it’s useless.”  By procuring “junk” for reuse the Upcycle Innovation project makes it easy and affordable to experiment and fail…. and try again.\r\n\r\nAn award of $100,000 will provide key seed funding for the development of an exciting full service facility, dedicated to providing year-round tinkering, hands-on, arts projects for children, families, teachers and artists. Our project increases the opportunity for cultural participation through engaging artistic activities and fosters support for increased cultural participation.  By turning an abundant local resource – trash – in creative material we make it affordable.\r\n"

  collaborators: "We are currently working with the UCLA Social Enterprise Academy on the business plan for this project. This plan will be completed this May. \r\n\r\nWithin the non-profit sector we have had success collaborating with other organizations. The Skirball Center, PS Arts, Otis School of Art and Design and the UCLA Lab School are current organizations utilizing our materials and teacher training services.

  description3: "Our type of arts education is unique in the Los Angeles area. While another organization, Trash for Teaching, provides a similar service to us they differ in that they are a volunteer based organization and mostly a provider of reusable materials. Also, their founder and main sponsor has announced his retirement. Small neighborhood based arts schools could also be considered competition. \r\n\r\nWithin the non-profit sector we have had success collaborating with other organizations that could be considered our competitors. We team with artists and provide programs for students, families, educators and museums. The Skirball Center, PS Arts and the UCLA Lab School are current peer organizations utilizing our materials and teacher training services. "
  vision: >-
    In 2050 Los Angeles will still be a global leader in the arts and design
    fields due to its strong arts education infrastructure. Every child and
    their various learning styles, will have an outlet for their creativity
    providing more opportunities for their career and for a vibrant, connected
    life. The reDiscover Center will be successful when it can support these
    goals.

  Ready to Innovate? Imagine an entire generation of young Angelenos who grow up
  molding, repurposing, and upcycling discarded material bound for the
  landfill?  Thomas Edison said, “To invent, you need a good imagination and a

  it easy and affordable to experiment and fail…. and try again.






  An award of $100,000 will provide key seed funding for the development of an
  exciting full service facility, dedicated to providing yearround tinkering,
  handson, arts projects for children, families, teachers and artists. Our
  project increases the opportunity for cultural participation through engaging
  artistic activities and fosters support for increased cultural participation. 
  By turning an abundant local resource — trash — in creative material we make
  it affordable.


What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >+
  Using everyday discards donated by local businesses reDiscover’s range of
  handson, educational programs and workshops has served 24,500 people. We are
  proud of our Arts Earth Partnership certification and our 2007 Sustainable
  Quality Award from the City of Santa Monica. We strive to maintain a low
  carbon footprint and our current warehouselike facility for reusable waste
  helps our local businesses and households to do the same.



  Our artistic caliber has been recognized by the Los Angeles County Arts
  Commission, the Santa Monica GLOW Festival (2008 and 2013), the San Jose Zero1
  Festival, the Long Beach Arts Council A LOT Initiative and Ryman Arts with a
