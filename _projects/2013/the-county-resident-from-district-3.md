    The goal is to build a loyal following and thus success will be measured by
    site traffic and other metrics that measure the consumption of CRD3
    content.  "Likes" and recommendations will build the site into a
    respect-based community forum, where records and reports can be accessed and
    shared widely across social media.

  brief: "<p>Los Angeles county is famously apathetic. Twenty-one percent of eligible voters cast ballots in our recent mayoral election. It was even less when Villaraigosa was elected.

Imagine a \"Daily show\" for Los Angeles County with its own website, documentary, how-to-be-more-civically-engaged amazon kindle book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The county  board of supervisors meeting that takes place every Tuesday is videotaped, transcribed and broadcast the following night on KCLS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The content is in the public domain.  As a TV professional who has\r\nworked extensively in all forms of television including serialized\r\ndrama [Santa Barbara, Poor Nastya], comedy [Reba, Popular, Head Case], and late night [The Tonight Show with Jay Leno], the weekly board meeting has all the elements of a weekly tv show, which is why I've cast myself as a quasi-anchorman,  charged with translating the\r\nconfusing weekly agenda for the public while politely holding each of the five county supervisors accountable.  Not to mention Sheriff Baca, who was recently named Sheriff of the year for 2013!!!

    Since the purpose of the organization is to foster better civic engagement,
    there is no competition, only camaraderie.  There are eleven million county
    residents, if we all payed a bit closer attention, it would help.  CRD3 is
    looking for partnerships with individuals and organizations that value
    information and knowledge and power through paying attention.
  vision: >-
    In 2050  engaged, informed citizens will be 'liking' their favorite
    commenters and elected representatives will be forced to take notice.  The
    power of an informed individual, will cause friends and neighbors to educate
    friends and neighbors about how to be better informed.  80% of the
    electorate will vote in the Los Angeles election in 2050.

  Does your project impact Los Angeles County?: 'yes'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  <p>Los Angeles county is famously apathetic. Twenty-one percent of eligible
  voters cast ballots in our recent mayoral election. It was even less when
  Villaraigosa was elected. Filling halls with engaged county residents and
  constituents will be the overarching goal of this organization.</p>






  <p>The County Resident from District 3 is a public advocate fighting for 



  civic engagement across numerous county platforms.</p>






  <p>Paying attention to the county government and its 24 billion dollar budget
  is critically important but also fun and funny. Imagine a "Daily show" for Los
  Angeles County with its own website, documentary,
  how-to-be-more-civically-engaged amazon kindle book.</p>






  <p>The county  board of supervisors meeting that takes place every Tuesday is
  videotaped, transcribed and broadcast the following night on KCLS.</p>






  <p>The content is in the public domain.  As a TV professional who has



  worked extensively in all forms of television including serialized



  drama [Santa Barbara, Poor Nastya], comedy [Reba, Popular, Head Case], and
  late night [The Tonight Show with Jay Leno], the weekly board meeting has all
  the elements of a weekly tv show, which is why I've cast myself as a
  quasi-anchorman,  charged with translating the



  confusing weekly agenda for the public while politely holding each of the five
  county supervisors accountable.  Not to mention Sheriff Baca, who was recently
  named Sheriff of the year for 2013!!! See, it's a comedy!!!</p>






  <p>CRD3 is a watchdog, who is very focussed on the flow of information -



  from the board to the public, but also from the public to the



  board.  </p>






  <p>All CRD3 activities are aimed at promoting open government, transparency
  and the belief that public scrutiny is teachable, fun and effective.  
  Empowering the public to raise it's voice respectfully while fighting for
  better navigability and clean plain language.</p>






  <p>CRD3 advocates for the public because the agenda is so dense that
  translation is needed to bring understanding.  Awareness leads to engagement. 
  The Board has representatives, the unions have representatives, and now the
  public... has an representative too!  And he didn't get elected and owes no
  favors. </p>
What are some of your organizationâ€™s most important achievements to date?: >+
  <p>-Attended the last two years of Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors
  meetings</p>



  <p>-Identified as the "Target" of a failed effort to limit public comment.



  -Fought successfully to get Citizens Commission on Jail Violence 



  Transcripts.</p>



  <p>-Pressed for Jail reform meetings on Tuesdays, despite Supervisorial 



  resistance.</p>



  <p>-Brought KCET's Socal Connected the "Family Ties" story about undue
  Lobbying influence.</p>



  <p>-Exposed Sheriff Baca as out-of-town during jail crisis, in 



  LA Weekly.</p>



  <p>-Heightened awareness about Board of Supervisors tooling around DC in
  limos.</p>



  <p>-Exposed conflict-of-interest for fundraiser, Erin Pak, to serve as 



  City Ethics Commissioner.</p>
