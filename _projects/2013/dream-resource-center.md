title: Dream Resource Center
indicator: ' Education'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >+
  This year, the Dream Resource Center (DRC), within the UCLA Labor Center, is
  launching a new highschool educational program in partnership with the
  Children’s Defense Fund and the Los Angeles Unified School District. Our goal
  is to develop an immigrant rights curriculum that focuses on contemporary
  issues facing immigrant youth. The program includes high quality academic
  enrichment, parent and family involvement, civic engagement and social action,
  intergenerational leadership development, and nutritional and mental health.






  The curriculum will integrate the two publications that have captured the
  voices of immigrant youth throughout the country, Underground Undergrads and
  Undocumented and Unafraid, along with a book that highlights the history of
  the Los Angeles labor and immigrant rights leader, Miguel Contreras: Legacy of
  a Labor Leader.  Highschool youth will be exposed to contemporary social
  issues and gain the unique opportunity to connect their classroom learning to
  community empowerment. 






  The program will involve highschool students from grades 9—12, with the
  intention of engaging a community of new leaders. Ninthgraders will be able to
  form an early connection to their new school and peers, while older students
  will be able to mentor the younger students and impart the knowledge gained
  from their high school tenure.  Coordinators of the outreach program are
  active members and leaders of the immigrant youth movement and bring with them
  the experience and knowledge to overcome economic, social, and linguistic
  barriers to maintaining good grades in high school, excelling in college, and
  becoming models for the next generation. They will design curriculum for
  immigrant youth at various high school campuses in the Los Angeles area. 






  The DRC was created to promote access to education for undocumented immigrant
  youth. As an immigrantyouthled project, the DRC has played a significant
  education and research role in two immigrant youth movement victories recently
  celebrated in the United States: the California Dream Act, a policy that
  provides financial aid to undocumented college students, and Deferred Action
  for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), an Obama administrative action directing
  federal immigration authorities to defer deportation and provide twoyear work
  permits for undocumented youth. These victories were won by undocumented
  immigrant youth, and the leaders of this movement are in the best position to
  provide outreach and education to their peers regarding policy changes that
  affect their access to work permits and higher education. 






  Both of these victories were won by the courage, determination, and
  perseverance of immigrant youth themselves, without staff, lobbyists, or
  funding.  With these new policies in place, now is the time to educate the
  next generation of immigrant youth about their educational and employment
  opportunities. 






  Some Los Angeles innercity high schools have up to a 30 percent undocumented
  immigrant student population. Yet to date, there are no ongoing programs
  within the LA Unified School District to educate these youth, their parents,
  teachers, and counselors about how to take advantage of DACA and the
  California Dream Act. The curriculum being developed and piloted this summer
  will be the first of its kind and would contribute to the development of
  ongoing education and outreach to encourage undocumented immigrant youth in
  Los Angeles to pursue their dreams in higher education. 


What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >+
  In the last several years, the UCLA Labor Center has emerged as a national
  resource for undocumented immigrant students and immigrant youth leadership
  development. The Labor Center has conducted research on immigrant youth,
  actively promoted their civic engagement, taught the first courses in the
  country on undocumented students, and published two nationally acclaimed books
  written by and about undocumented students. The first, Underground Undergrads:
  UCLA Undocumented Immigrant Students Speak Out is currently in its fourth
  printing and has sold more than ten thousand copies. The second, Undocumented
  and Unafraid: Tam Tran, Cinthya Felix, and the Immigrant Youth Movement, is
  being promoted as part of a national book tour during the 2012—2013 academic
  school year. To drive activities in this area, the Labor Center established
  the Dream Resource Center, a project to promote equal access to education by
  developing educational resources, support, and leadership development for
  immigrant students across the country. 






  The Labor Center engages in other activities to address the needs of
  undocumented immigrant youth, including hosting Dream Summer, the first
  national internship program for undocumented students.  This program has
  placed 250 students and awarded a total of $1.25 million for interns to
  continue their education.  Through Dream Summer, interns learn skills and
  build the capacity of host organizations focused on specific issues or
  campaigns such as health and health care access, civic engagement, education,
  youth leadership, and LGBTQ issues. 






  Both Dream Summer and the Undocumented and Unafraid book publication and tour
  have been models for developing online resources that have connected with
  thousands of undocumented immigrant students throughout the country who are in
  need of basic information. These activities are just two among several at the
  Dream Resource Center that have served to create an online and inperson
  support network to give undocumented students the encouragement they need to
  pursue their dreams. 


Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  Los Angeles Unified School District; United We Dream; Dream Team Los Angeles;
  Children’s Defense Fund. 
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: "The Dream Resource Center will evaluate our outreach project and measure success in three ways: 1) Participant feedback from highschool youth; 2) Partner response from school staff, city representatives, and local immigrant youth organizations; and 3) Operational assessment.  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe specific evaluation processes are below.\n\n\n1)\tThe Dream Resource Center will conduct surveys with participants at educational events and trainings to learn about their assessment of the materials, presentations, and accessibility of our facilitators, along with their suggestions for improvements. We will also collect data on the number of attendees. \n\n\n\n\n\n2)\tWe will interview partners about their experiences in the collaboration, troubleshoot during project implementation, and assimilate their recommendations into the development of new collaborative efforts. The DRC also measures the success of partnerships by interest from new partners. \n\n\n\n\n\n3)\tThe DRC’s Dream Summer was recently evaluated by an external team and will apply the assessment of our strengths and shortcomings to operations and implementation of other projects. In addition, the DRC conducts periodic assessments of programs by debriefing with staff, reviewing participant surveys, and analyzing attendance statistics. Evaluations guide the DRC’s strategic planning process to improve operations, partnership development, and project implementation. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe overall success of our outreach will be measured by the number of undocumented youth who graduate from high school, apply to college, and participate in activities and projects with local organizations. \n\n\n"
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
  Los Angeles will benefit from higher rates of highschool graduation and
  increased civic engagement among youth.  The proposed project will thereby
  advance the UCLA Labor Center’s commitment to promote access to higher
  education for underrepresented communities. We expect our Dream Resource
  Center model will provide information, leadership development opportunities,
  and infrastructure for building support networks among immigrant youth to be
  replicated on campuses throughout the city. This will increase opportunities
  for immigrant youth to participate in leadership development programs, promote
  civic engagement, and encourage greater access to higher education.






  Positive immigration policy change is currently being debated nationally and
  will happen within the near future. Immigrant youth leaders trained through
  this program will achieve their educational goals, emerge as leaders in their
  own communities, and advance policies and programs to promote immigrant
  integration. 


What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  In 2050, Los Angeles will embrace the rich immigrant traditions of our city.
  Immigrant youth will have full access to educational and employment
  opportunities, and former students who benefitted from the work of the Dream
  Resource Center will have gone on to become college professors, doctors,
  scientists, engineers, lawyers, teachers, artists, entrepreneurs,
  philanthropists, and members of school boards, state legislatures, and the US
  Congress. 






  Los Angeles 2050 will be a worldclass city filled with immigrants and children
  of immigrants from throughout the world. The rich immigrant traditions will
  have energized our educational institutions, our economy, and the cultural
  life of the city. Los Angeles 2050 will serve as a beacon of hope for the
  country and for the world, as a city where human relations are harmonious,
  where the economy is thriving, and where immigrants and their children and
  grandchildren are fully integrated in all aspects of the city’s economic and
  social life.
