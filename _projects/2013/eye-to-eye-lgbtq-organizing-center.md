title: Eye to Eye LGBTQ Organizing Center
indicator: ' Social Connectedness'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  Our goal is to create a center for communitybuilding, political education,
  action and organizing in Los Angeles, particularly for women and Lesbian, Gay,
  Bisexual, Transgender, Queer (LGBTQ) communities of color.   This project will
  recruit and develop new community leaders who can participate in organizing
  efforts and who will be engaged in community change work.






  In the short term, we will increase community activism, including voter
  engagement through basic outreach and education on critical issues affecting
  our community.  In the longer term, our goal is to develop individual and
  collective leadership among communities that are currently underrepresented in
  decisionmaking circles. These include LGBTQ people of color, LGBTQ immigrants,
  women and transgender people of color.  We are creating a gathering space and
  space for organizing and political education for these communities.
What are some of your organizationâ€™s most important achievements to date?: >-
  In 8 years, our organization has grown into one of the most wellestablished
  organizations dedicated to organizing and political engagement of LGBT people
  of color.  We are one of the largest nonservicebased groups, based on staff
  size and member involvement, representing Asian and Pacific Islander LGBT
  people.  We have a robust volunteer base of hundreds of activists and 5
  standing committee, which plan and execute a yearround calendar of
  activities.  The creation of this space and organization in itself is perhaps
  our greatest achievement, since prior to our existence there was not an
  organization dedicated to political empowerment of API LGBT people.  Along
  with our allies, we provide an important foundation for further organizing in
  LGBT communities of color.
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  We work in a collaborative called Q*POC (Queer People of Color Alliance) who
  will be partners with us.  This alliance includes Latino Equality Alliance and
  Gender Justice LA.  As an API organization, we prioritize collaboration with
  other communities of color.  We also have very close working relationships
  with numerous LGBT organizations in LA and throughout CA and the nation, who
  may provide insight and resources as this project continues to develop.
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  We will measure our success by the number of people we engage and the number
  of activities we execute.  We will evaluate qualitatively the impact of our
  programming.  In addition, we will seek and independent consultant with
  community organizing experience to help evaluate our work and impact. 
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
  This project will provide a space for organizing, education, selfempowerment,
  communitybuilding, and collection action among LA's community members, who are
  often underrepresented in our city's circles of power.  By institutionalizing
  programs for political education, leadership development and ongoing civic
  engagement, our project will amplify the voices and political power of LGBT
  people in communities of color, including and particularly women. 






  In the course of a year, we expect to recruit and provide workshops or other
  opportunities to over 200 individuals, with the goal of sustaining the
  involvement of at least 30 who will invest in the ongoing development of the
  center.  We will explore the possibility of establishing an independent center
  and community space.  This work is currently led by our existing organization,
  staff and steering committee, and housed within a broader agency.  Ultimately,
  we believe there is a need and a space for an autonomous space that can
  continue to evolve and a political organizing center.






  Los Angeles has a vibrant social justice movement and community of activists. 
  Our goal is to increase the active involvement and influence of LGBTQ people
  of color and women in our community's collective efforts to improve the city. 
  By organizing this community to address their lives at the intersections of
  race, gender and sexuality, we believe we can help organize a more inclusive
  and effective movement for change. 


What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  By 2050, we will have established a wellknown and stable foundation for
  community empowerment in LGBT communities of color, with an intersectional
  analysis and action plan to address the multiple challenges this community
  faces.  LGBT people of color in LA, propelled by their involvement in our
  center, will occupy decisionmaking positions and will collectively be
  spearheading efforts to improve our communities.  Robust voter engagement
  would be a given and strategic organizing projects would be the norm in our
  communities.
