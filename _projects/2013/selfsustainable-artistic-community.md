title: 'SelfSustainable Artistic Community '
project_summary: "A community of a self-sustainable Earthships where artistic and innovative youths, (though not solely limited to this demographic), may pursue their dreams. This would serve as a sister community to Valhalla Montreal.\r\n\r\nWe do not have the opportunity to act on our dreams at an early age. This freedom requires money. We become trapped. Youth is wasted in a materialistic and capitalistic world as we vie to become financially secure enough to pursue our passions. We get caught in the pursuit of material fulfillment. We become jaded. We lose sight of our true selves. Few die happy or fulfilled. Our dreams are stunted. Our energy is wasted in support of a business model that provides little for humanity's greater good.\r\nWe have no option than to partake in the rat race. Unless we are blessed by being born into the correct family or experiencing a wild stroke of luck, we cannot survive and succeed in the physical manifestation of our innermost artistic desires. We have little time to spend on the person that truly matters: ourselves.\r\nSelf-sustainable communities have the potential to revolutionize not just Los Angeles... but the world. They require a pioneer investment, but from that point forward sustain themselves by the upkeep of their inhabitants. After all is established and runs smoothly, money may cease as a necessity.\r\nEach day would be devoted toward inner growth and creating whichever art form we wished to pursue. There would be free exchange of materials. \LIf inhabitants lived in complete harmony and felt positive energy toward their beautiful community, any negative tension or struggle for power would be eliminated.\r\nA screening process would be implemented until proven unnecessary. This society can only flourish with positive people who demonstrate true compassion. These people would channel their energy into its love, abundance, growth, and advancement. There are many negative beings who do not well-wish the world at present. If they were to became members early-on, their thoughts and vibrations could cause the community to fail. This is why Valhalla Montreal has an application process that includes multiple interviews and tasks to test the talent of potential members. \r\nStructure and stagnancy would entail a few hours daily devoted to community upkeep. Upkeep would be crafted in a fun, engaging manner. This would be views as acts of loving kindness that respect and nurture the environment that offers them its support, (cleaning, building, harvesting food, etc).\r\nA mandatory hour of daily meditation would be tailored as the individual sees fit. This would provide internal growth, healing, and evolution of well-being.\r\nIt would be highly recommended that an hour be devoted to daily exercise. The body is a temple. It is the only thing we truly own. Exercise stimulates endorphins. Endorphins make us feel better and provide us with more energy. Innovative and fun exercise classes would be offered.\r\nVarious offbeat and \"un-mainstream\" or uncommon classes and discussions about any and all interests would be offered.\r\nDifferent divisions would include: art, song, dance, poetry, sculpture, innovation, holistic healing, culinary, gardening, etc. Collaboration between divisions would be highly recommended.\r\nMajor goals are to make everything as creative, innovative, thought-provoking, positive, and unique as possible. This would require members to think beyond, break boundaries, and firmly believe that anything is possible.\r\nCommunity participants would be surrounded by nurturing and open-minded people who do not pass judgement. It is hypothesized that, under such circumstances, members would feel such bliss that word of this lifestyle would spread. Others would open their minds, challenge their beliefs, and consider a new perspective toward community and reason for existence.\r\nUnlike other ‘hippie communities’, we are not shutting ourselves off from the world. We are doing everything possible to make this lifestyle universally appealing. We will be as loud as possible so that we’re either loved or hated, but never unheard of.\r\nThe art, ideas, and inventions that could come to fruition from such surroundings would be of high commodity in the marketplace, should a system centered on monetary value continue to exist. \r\nIt is time to try something new. The old methods have been tried and are not true. Once this idea is tested, there is no doubt of its success. Yes, it is an idea vastly different from that which we are accustomed; a functioning base for all ideas that have changed the world."

  success: "Success will first be measured by awareness and support. People need to be inspired and willing to group together to create a self-sustainable community. The determination of its individuals mixed with the varying degrees of talent, ideas, and skills are what will cause Valhalla LA to truly take off. The next step is to put the idea in motion. This will happen quickly as word of the idea spreads. \r\nAfter Valhalla LA is created, success will be measured by the happiness and health index of its people. The ultimate goal is to make self-sustainable communities mainstream. \r\n"
  description: "Earthships are modernized sustainable structures made from recyclable materials. They are 100% off-the-grid. They heat and cool themselves. They provide their own energy, food, and water. Bills, utilities, and grocery bills then become extinct. This allows members complete freedom. \r\nEach Earthship hosts 1-2 greenhouses with the ability to produce crops year-round. Water is recycled through a rain-harvesting system and is used for showers, toilet-water, and plants. It can even work in an LA climate with minimal rain!\r\nTires filled with dirt comprise an Earthship. They absorb and store solar heat, so temperatures within homes register around 70 degrees in any weather condition. There are an overabundance of discarded tires; supply would not be a problem. Walls are made of a mixture of concrete + plastic and glass bottles. Solar panels provide the home with energy. \r\nThis project addresses each indicator. It would benefit Los Angeles in all aspects. \r\nIt would: improve the environment by eliminating fossil fuels and other hazardous chemicals that damage our health, create cheap housing, provide organic food, allow inhabitants complete freedom to create a new culture in a social community that encourages collaboration and artistic expression, and would allow us to experience a well-rounded education tailored to our interests. We would also learn how to build homes and support ourselves by being resourceful and respecting our environment, instead of destroying it for profitable gain. We would have more time. We would use this time to be healthy, to learn, to work together, and to produce things that could cause the world to truly progress. "
  collaborators: "Valhalla LA is a seed that hopes to spread into a forest.\r\nApart from Valhalla Montreal, this project does not currently have any local partners or collaborators... though a meetup was created earlier this week!\r\nHowever, it has also not had enough time to build its resources. Once awareness is spread, this will change. Valhalla Montreal was formed last summer and already has plans to begin building this spring.\r\nThere are many groups in Los Angeles that work on and support the varying aspects necessary for Valhalla LA to thrive. LA2050 is the best opportunity to allow these moving parts to come together to advance the common goal of community and change."
  description1: "Valhalla Montreal formed in the summer of 2012. They then launched the website and spread the word to garner support. They have 60 acres of land and will begin building this spring. They have raised almost $8,000 of $10,000 in 4 days through Kickstarter for the first 100% off-the-grid, affordable, low-maintanence greenhouse. \r\nValhalla Washington has also started taking its first steps toward spreading awareness so that it may also sprout into a sister site. "
  vision: >-
    We will have prevented our current problems in time to save our future.
    Success of self-sustainable communities will spread, and LA will have
    transformed into an all-inclusive sustainable city. Its inhabitants will
    have the freedom to follow their dreams and create what they desire. Each
    person will be seen as an individual and will express themselves without
    judgement. All will be conscious of their impact on the environment and will
    be extremely resourceful. We will work together for the greater good. 
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: "A selfsustainable habitat for and run by young artists. Inhabitants live in an Earthship/Superadobe hybrid. Both the Earthship and Superadobe structure are 100% offthegrid. Its design allows it to produce its own food, renewable energy, and water. It heats and cools itself. Bills become extinct. Participants gain complete freedom from the stressors of modern society. Artistic passions are pursued without dependence on a capitalistic structure. Members may act on their dreams at a much younger age than is custom. This serves as a sister community to Valhalla Montreal, which was pioneered last spring.\n\n\n<p>\n\n\nThe pillar of ValhalLA's success is hinged upon community. Collaboration is highly encouraged. Individuals possess positivity and an openmind. They demonstrate true compassion and commit to live in harmony. Their energy is channeled into their environment's love, abundance, growth, and advancement. They support one another in the creation of progressive and innovative work. An application process is necessaryValhalla Montreal has implemented multiple interviews and tasks to test the talent of potential members.\n\n\n<p>\n\n\nMembers use their sustainable safehaven to encourage victims of abuse or troubled backgrounds along the correct path. They provide a program that accepts these individuals and allows them to acquire sustainable skills. Knowledge of healthy nutrition, critical thinking, earth building, and permaculture principles are gained through assistance growing food on the base property and empty city lots. This education helps prepare them to enter the workforce and enforces positive social connectivity. Â\_\n\n\n<p>\n\n\nIt is time to challenge that which we've been accustomed. This community serves as an ulterior model. It unites and strengthens each indicator to provide a harmonious option for the future of LA."
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  ValhaLA being founded. The establishment of partnerships within a short time
  frame; solidifying a heavy interest in making this idea a reality. The
  formation of a concrete plan that would allow it to move forward.



  <br>



  Valhalla Montreal formed in the summer of 2012. The website was then launched
  and members spread awareness to garner support. They will begin building on
  their 60 acres of land this spring. They raised $10,000 in less than a week
  through Kickstarter for the first offthegrid, affordable, lowmaintenance
  greenhouse.



  <br>



  Valhalla Washington has also started taking its first steps toward spreading
  awareness so that it may also sprout into a sister site.
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  Valhalla Montreal, CalEarth, Gaia Earth and Technologies, Uncommon Good,
  Earthship Biotecture, Ethos Art Gallery



  <p>



  ValhalLA is a seed that will spread into a forest. Awareness is the water
  which allows growth. Partners and collaborators will flourish as word spreads
  and it becomes more established.
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  Success cannot be measured in absolute terms. It is measured by progress. Each
  step advances ValhalLA further on the path to success. Awareness, website,
  acquisition of land, initiation of the building process, member movein,
  happiness and health index of inhabitants are a few limbs of the everevolving
  tree.
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: "According to the LA 2050 report, workers aged 25 and below have the highest unemployment rate of any labor force group. The experience of unemployment is one of the strongest negative impacts on subjective wellbeing. Once unemployed or working an entrylevel position, it is a struggle to afford housing in a healthy environment. Health is compromised as affordable homes are only available in neighborhoods with heavily polluted air that may cause cancer. Time is spent working to afford the cost of living. More than half spend 30% or more to afford housing. They become disconnected from the community. The fundamental nature of human social bonds is a crucial determinant of wellbeing. Neighborhoods with perceived social disorder and a lack of collective efficacy are more associated with crime related outcomes. Â\_\n\n\nIndividuals become polarized and trapped in this cycle. They gather to live in an area but are disjointed from one another. They lack the education and skills to create a positive change for themselves.\n\n\n<br>\n\n\nValhalLA benefits Los Angeles by creating a different cycle.\n\n\n<br>\n\n\nHouses are affordable. Earthships and Superadobe are created from recyclable materials. They have been tested, proven, and permitted in LA county. While both Earthship and Superadobe designs are revolutionary, they have not yet been integrated. This insemination promotes the recurring theme of innovation and collaboration. It involves experts in both fields and offers a long term solution to the increasing need for housing. Low material and operational costs allow homes to start at $7,000.\n\n\n<br>\n\n\nThe habitat utilizes permaculture principles. Its structure has zero carbon footprint qualities and zero emission. This has immediate and large scale effects on environmental quality.\n\n\n<br>\n\n\nPeople are healthier with an improved environment and organic, locally grown food.\n\n\n<br>\n\n\nAccording to LA 2050, the current cost of living and unemployment rate place the future vitality of arts and culture at risk. Public arts expenditures are below the national average. There is a lack of artsnurturing policy. ValhalLA members work together to give back to the city. They produce progressive art and maintain a beautiful environment. This heightens social connectivity, which, in turn, promotes public safety. Those who feel they can work with friends, family, and neighbors to bring about positive, collective change are more likely to report feeling safer.\n\n\n<br>\n\n\nValhalLA educates others with knowledge that prepares them to change their own direct community. Others learn selfsustainable skills that enable them to seek and find employment in an emerging market with increasing demand for sustainable, low cost small business and residential buildings.\n\n\n<br>\n\n\nValhalLA introduces an innovative concept; the functioning base for all ideas that have changed the world."
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >+
  Success in the year 2050 is measured by growth.



  <br>



  We will consider it an enormous success if we double the number of lives we
  impact each year.



  <br>



  We will have started and made a biotectural movement mainstream success by
  2050. This will be one of the most influential factors in defining the face of
  a new community of evolved Los Angelenos. This metropolis will set an example
  of what can be accomplished when we work together with one another and with
  our environment. Urban agriculture, like community gardens, will have a place
  in everyday life. Artists will demonstrate an innovative approach to education
  and showcase compassionate involvement. Citydwellers will strive to brainstorm
  new ways to shape LA into an even more desirable place to live. This will not
  be a city free from problems, but it will be a city equipped with sustainable
  and communitybased solutions.
