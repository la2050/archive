title: 'SelfSustainable Artistic Community '
indicator: ' Housing'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: "A selfsustainable habitat for and run by young artists. Inhabitants live in an Earthship/Superadobe hybrid. Both the Earthship and Superadobe structure are 100% offthegrid. Its design allows it to produce its own food, renewable energy, and water. It heats and cools itself. Bills become extinct. Participants gain complete freedom from the stressors of modern society. Artistic passions are pursued without dependence on a capitalistic structure. Members may act on their dreams at a much younger age than is custom. This serves as a sister community to Valhalla Montreal, which was pioneered last spring.\n\n\n<p>\n\n\nThe pillar of ValhalLA's success is hinged upon community. Collaboration is highly encouraged. Individuals possess positivity and an openmind. They demonstrate true compassion and commit to live in harmony. Their energy is channeled into their environment's love, abundance, growth, and advancement. They support one another in the creation of progressive and innovative work. An application process is necessaryValhalla Montreal has implemented multiple interviews and tasks to test the talent of potential members.\n\n\n<p>\n\n\nMembers use their sustainable safehaven to encourage victims of abuse or troubled backgrounds along the correct path. They provide a program that accepts these individuals and allows them to acquire sustainable skills. Knowledge of healthy nutrition, critical thinking, earth building, and permaculture principles are gained through assistance growing food on the base property and empty city lots. This education helps prepare them to enter the workforce and enforces positive social connectivity. Â\_\n\n\n<p>\n\n\nIt is time to challenge that which we've been accustomed. This community serves as an ulterior model. It unites and strengthens each indicator to provide a harmonious option for the future of LA."
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  ValhaLA being founded. The establishment of partnerships within a short time
  frame; solidifying a heavy interest in making this idea a reality. The
  formation of a concrete plan that would allow it to move forward.



  <br>



  Valhalla Montreal formed in the summer of 2012. The website was then launched
  and members spread awareness to garner support. They will begin building on
  their 60 acres of land this spring. They raised $10,000 in less than a week
  through Kickstarter for the first offthegrid, affordable, lowmaintenance
  greenhouse.



  <br>



  Valhalla Washington has also started taking its first steps toward spreading
  awareness so that it may also sprout into a sister site.
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  Valhalla Montreal, CalEarth, Gaia Earth and Technologies, Uncommon Good,
  Earthship Biotecture, Ethos Art Gallery



  <p>



  ValhalLA is a seed that will spread into a forest. Awareness is the water
  which allows growth. Partners and collaborators will flourish as word spreads
  and it becomes more established.
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  Success cannot be measured in absolute terms. It is measured by progress. Each
  step advances ValhalLA further on the path to success. Awareness, website,
  acquisition of land, initiation of the building process, member movein,
  happiness and health index of inhabitants are a few limbs of the everevolving
  tree.
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: "According to the LA 2050 report, workers aged 25 and below have the highest unemployment rate of any labor force group. The experience of unemployment is one of the strongest negative impacts on subjective wellbeing. Once unemployed or working an entrylevel position, it is a struggle to afford housing in a healthy environment. Health is compromised as affordable homes are only available in neighborhoods with heavily polluted air that may cause cancer. Time is spent working to afford the cost of living. More than half spend 30% or more to afford housing. They become disconnected from the community. The fundamental nature of human social bonds is a crucial determinant of wellbeing. Neighborhoods with perceived social disorder and a lack of collective efficacy are more associated with crime related outcomes. Â\_\n\n\nIndividuals become polarized and trapped in this cycle. They gather to live in an area but are disjointed from one another. They lack the education and skills to create a positive change for themselves.\n\n\n<br>\n\n\nValhalLA benefits Los Angeles by creating a different cycle.\n\n\n<br>\n\n\nHouses are affordable. Earthships and Superadobe are created from recyclable materials. They have been tested, proven, and permitted in LA county. While both Earthship and Superadobe designs are revolutionary, they have not yet been integrated. This insemination promotes the recurring theme of innovation and collaboration. It involves experts in both fields and offers a long term solution to the increasing need for housing. Low material and operational costs allow homes to start at $7,000.\n\n\n<br>\n\n\nThe habitat utilizes permaculture principles. Its structure has zero carbon footprint qualities and zero emission. This has immediate and large scale effects on environmental quality.\n\n\n<br>\n\n\nPeople are healthier with an improved environment and organic, locally grown food.\n\n\n<br>\n\n\nAccording to LA 2050, the current cost of living and unemployment rate place the future vitality of arts and culture at risk. Public arts expenditures are below the national average. There is a lack of artsnurturing policy. ValhalLA members work together to give back to the city. They produce progressive art and maintain a beautiful environment. This heightens social connectivity, which, in turn, promotes public safety. Those who feel they can work with friends, family, and neighbors to bring about positive, collective change are more likely to report feeling safer.\n\n\n<br>\n\n\nValhalLA educates others with knowledge that prepares them to change their own direct community. Others learn selfsustainable skills that enable them to seek and find employment in an emerging market with increasing demand for sustainable, low cost small business and residential buildings.\n\n\n<br>\n\n\nValhalLA introduces an innovative concept; the functioning base for all ideas that have changed the world."
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >+
  Success in the year 2050 is measured by growth.



  <br>



  We will consider it an enormous success if we double the number of lives we
  impact each year.



  <br>



  We will have started and made a biotectural movement mainstream success by
  2050. This will be one of the most influential factors in defining the face of
  a new community of evolved Los Angelenos. This metropolis will set an example
  of what can be accomplished when we work together with one another and with
  our environment. Urban agriculture, like community gardens, will have a place
  in everyday life. Artists will demonstrate an innovative approach to education
  and showcase compassionate involvement. Citydwellers will strive to brainstorm
  new ways to shape LA into an even more desirable place to live. This will not
  be a city free from problems, but it will be a city equipped with sustainable
  and communitybased solutions.
