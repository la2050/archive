title: The Beacon Network presented by Jovenes Inc.
indicator: ' Social Connectedness'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  <p>Jovenes is a place of personal transformation for homeless youth ages
  1825.  A home and family for those without, Jovenes provides an innovative
  program of stable housing options, compassionate care, life skills training
  and employment support to young adults seeking a path to life change. Our
  experience working with homeless and atrisk youth shows us that when young
  people are disconnected from empowering opportunities and supportive networks
  (families, schools, communities), they end up languishing on the fringes of
  society.</p> 






  <p>In 2010, Jovenes began asking the question “how can we do a better job of
  connecting youth with the help they need, and leverage the resources and
  opportunities provided by our partners?” Easytouse technology was our answer,
  so we developed and launched The Beacon Network (TBN). TBN uses the Internet
  to offer youth a means to connect and evaluate their options linking both
  themselves, and their loved ones, to local free or lowcost solutions.  </p> 






  <p>Youth in lowincome communities throughout Los Angeles have many needs and
  challenges, and finding out where to go for help can be overwhelming because
  there is no one organization that can address all these issues. They also
  often shoulder responsibility for their families, performing tasks of
  childcare for younger relatives, getting jobs to support their parents, and
  translating for nonEnglish speaking family members. This expanded role can be
  overwhelming. Los Angeles, and Boyle Heights in particular, has a rich fabric
  of nonprofit organizations and social service providers who do outstanding
  work that leads clients to selfsufficiency and societal integration. However,
  community members, particularly youth, have trouble finding out how to access
  the help they need. </p> 






  <p>The Beacon Network Connect (www.tbnconnect.org) is a bilingual online
  referral directory tailored to youth in Boyle Heights and East LA. It offers
  over 250 free to lowcost services that are locally available, allowing youth
  to find and access the help they need. There are seven core service
  categories: 1) Youth Community Resources (after school programs, mentoring,
  arts & culture, volunteer opportunities and more), 2) Education, 3) Health, 4)
  Basic Needs (including childcare, food, clothing, employment,
  housing/shelter), 5) Counseling and Support Groups, 6) Legal Assistance, 7)
  Financial Services. It’s a site that helps youth search, connect, and
  thrive.</p> 


   


  <p>The Beacon Network features a second online platform that is changing the
  way nonprofits collaborate (www.thebeaconnetwork.org). By including other
  nonprofit agencies on our site, and allowing these organizations to collect,
  pool and share data over time, we are better able to understand the
  community’s gaps in service and changing needs. It also connects agency staff
  with resources and events throughout our community via a constantly updated
  calendar and biweekly enewsletter. Identifying needed services and new
  community partners is a vital part of this effort.</p> 






  <p>Our 2050 idea is continue and expand the reach & depth of TBN while
  training homeless youth that we serve to provide outreach to the teens and
  young adults of Boyle Heights.   This outreach is vital to reaching youth who
  might otherwise feel disengaged and unconnected.  In addition it will provide
  work experience, confidence building, leadership training, and a stipend to
  youth who are experiencing homelessness.  We have pilot tested this
  peer—topeer outreach model and know that inspires our youth and connects with
  young people in the community.</p> 
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  <p>Jovenes, Inc. is a growing organization that is changing the way homeless
  youth access opportunities for a brighter future. In the last year, we’ve
  doubled our housing capacity through the creation of permanent supportive and
  affordable housing. We used to only be able to house 20 youth in our shortterm
  shelter programs (for lengths of stay less than 18 months). Now, we are able
  to provide youth with their own apartments and continually support them as
  they grow into selfsufficient adults. At this point, Jovenes is housing 41
  youth across our continuum of care more than at any other point in our
  history. Our permanent housing programs have a 96% retention rate since
  opening in 2012.</p>






  <p>Launching The Beacon Network in 2011 was a major accomplishment for our
  organization. As a traditional socialservice organization that focuses
  primarily on the 1:1 work with our clients, taking on TBN required a different
  skillset, vision, and capacity. TBN was developed through a process that
  included gaining input from many different nonprofit partners on what
  information would be most useful to their clients & staff, as well as holding
  focus groups of youth to test the functionality and clarity of the system, as
  well as marketing strategies. As a result, TBN Connect has over 4,800 searches
  per year!</p>
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >+
  The Beacon Network lists over 250 programs and resources readily available in
  Boyle Heights and East LA. The California Endowment and the Building Healthy
  CommunitiesBoyle Heights initiative are major sources of collaboration for
  this project.






  In late 2013, TBN will be officially housed at the brand new Wellness Center
  at USC + LAC General Hospital. The Wellness Center will house likeminded
  nonprofit organizations that have the vision of making Boyle Heights a
  healthier community. 






  TBN would not be possible without Idealistics, Inc., a social sector
  consultancy that helps organizations learn from their outcomes data, increase
  impact, and demonstrate results to funders and stakeholders. 


Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  <p>TBN was launched in 2011, and since then, TBNConnect averages over 1,200
  searches every quarter. More than 40 organizations are connected through The
  Beacon Network, and our enewsletters and shared calendars reach dozens of case
  managers who are then able to refer their clients to needed resources and
  activities. With LA 2050 behind TBN, these numbers will grow.</p> 






  <p>One of the strengths of TBN is its focus on data and analysis. We are able
  to collect the demographic profile of people who voluntarily submit
  information during the TBNConnect intake page, as well as the services they
  are searching for and what they need. This capability allows us to know who we
  are reaching.  We can measure how many youth are using the system.  We can
  track through a privacy protected system the general locations where youth are
  accessing the platform and focus outreach on areas where usage is low.  Other
  measures would be how many trainings our youth are able to facilitate and how
  many nonprofit partners regularly use The Beacon Network.  </p> 
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: "As beacons are guides that steer wayward ships into shore, nonprofits and social service agencies help our clients overcome the obstacles they face on a daily basis.  The Beacon Network online resource directory provides an easy, efficient way for youth and others in need to find resources  housing, job training, educational opportunities, legal assistance, after school activities  without the need for a case manager.  We believe that this fosters independence and a sense of control.  In addition, the system can be used by caseworkers to quickly find a complete list of opportunities for their clients.  \n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that many organizations, despite being geographic neighbors, are not connected with each other and need ways to share information about available programs, resources, and events to each other’s clients. By adding webbased tools that target both the youth of our community and the agencies that serve them, we have an opportunity to increase the level of communication across agency lines and improve our shared neighborhoods.  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe project would increase usage of TBN and engage homeless youth. Homeless youth are one of the most socially disconnected subpopulations in the city, yet everyday we hear our youth say they want ways to give back to the community. We believe by creating leadership and developmental opportunities that are combined with the promotion of TBN, we are able create an empowering experience for youth that also provides them with marketable skills. \n\n\n\n\n\nExpanding TBN would benefit Los Angeles in the following ways:\n\n\n1)\tIncrease access to vital resources in highneed communities.\n\n\n2)\tProvide training and leadership opportunities for homeless youth.\n\n\n3)\tProvide a replicable, techbased model for other areas of LA to create neighborhood based solutions and connections.\n\n\n4)\tContinue building and strengthening the lines of communication between nonprofit organizations and provide the best combination of service and care for a community in need. \n\n\n"
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  <p>Los Angeles is a decentralized city of neighborhoods. Each local community
  has its own unique history, characteristics, challenges, and flavor. </p>






  <p>We hope that by 2050, these communities will have developed placebased
  strategies that successfully integrate their residents into the social fabric
  of Los Angeles. It means that youth live in communities where they can take
  full advantage of the resources available to them, and that organizations,
  funders, politicians, and stakeholders break out of their silos to expand
  opportunity for all. </p>






  <p>We see technology and the Internet as a tool to accomplish this, not a
  solution in of itself. Logging onto TBN and conducting a search will not
  “solve” the problems faced by an individual youth or their family, but it is
  the first step towards arriving at a better life. For the homeless youth at
  Jovenes, social connectedness means that our youth know they are valued
  members of a community, that their personal futures matter, and that they are
  not alone anymore. We can only build that connectedness through personal
  relationships and trust, but first we have to get them to our doors. The same
  goes for youth facing other challenges, and while there may not be enough case
  managers or guidance counselors to connect with every young person, TBN is the
  tool that can create that linkage.</p>






  <p>It is from that place that we can then work on the crucial tasks of social
  connection through voting, volunteering, raising the voices and aspirations of
  our youth.</p>
