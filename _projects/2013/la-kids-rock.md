title: LA Kids Rock!
project_summary: "We want to end the cycle of under-achievement and prove that LA kids really can “ROCK” in their learning! \r\n\r\nLA Kids Rock! will be an online extravaganza for elementary students to come together in fun reading and math games. LA Kids Rock!  will take place from 15 October to 15 December, 2013.\r\n\r\nWe are passionate in our belief that every child can learn to read and gain confidence with numbers. We also believe firmly in the African proverb “It takes a village to raise a child.” LA Kids Rock! will mobilize community role models and celebrities to help motivate the children. We need everyone to play their part to help children love learning and reach their potential.\r\n\r\nLA Kids Rock! will be completely free of charge for the more than 1.2 million elementary school children in the Greater Los Angeles Area (Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino, Riverside and Ventura counties). We expect more than 100,000 children will take part.  \r\n\r\nLA Kids Rock! will be based on two fundamental premises:\r\n\r\n1)\tChildren do best when learning is fun.\r\n2)\tPositive affirmation is essential.\r\n\r\nWe will use a specially customized version of the Skoolbo eLearning platform. Skoolbo is the largest ever educational game and since its launch in June 2012, has been attracting both rapid growth and extremely high levels of improvement in reading and math.\r\n\r\nHow will LA Kids Rock! work?\r\n•\tLAKidsRock! will be multi-platform and can be played on the web browser or as a downloadable app (iOS, Android, Windows 8).\r\n•\tChildren will play fun reading and math games anywhere, anytime.\r\n•\tEvery child will receive a personalized learning program based on individual needs.\r\n•\tChildren will be encouraged to connect with their parents, grandparents and teachers.\r\n•\tLAKidsRock! will be fully compliant with COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act).\r\n\r\nHow will LA Kids Rock! mobilize the entire LA community?\r\n•\tThroughout the two months we will have a total of 12 special live events at various venues around Los Angeles. These live events will complement the online event and will help take LA Kids Rock! to the whole community. The live events will involve local school children playing learning games with community leaders.\r\n•\tIn addition to the live events, we will convert an old school bus into a mobile learning lab. This bus will be equipped with study desks and tablets. The bus will visit more than 100 schools, shopping malls and community centers over the two months.\r\n•\tParents and Grandparents will share the experience. They will see their child’s results and be able to play with him or her.\r\n•\tWe will work closely with teachers and help support them in their vital role. There will be a sub-section called LA Teachers Rock! where teachers will be honored. Teachers will be provided a special portal to view powerful learning analytics and reports.\r\n•\tWe will invite community role models and celebrities to use their privileged position to encourage and motivate the children.\r\n\r\nWhat about children who do not have access to the internet at home?\r\n•\tWe will work closely with schools (especially enrichment after school programs) and libraries to provide access to LA Kids Rock! outside of school hours.\r\n•\tBoth the 12 live sites and the mobile learning lab school bus will play an important role in assisting children without internet access at home.\r\n•\tChildren will also be able to use LA Kids Rock! at school.\r\n\r\nWhat about children from non-English backgrounds?\r\n•\tThere will be a special section for the more than 30% of Los Angeles children who are English language learners. This will assist children in their vocabulary and speaking skills.\r\n\r\nHow will the curriculum be chosen?\r\n•\tThe reading and math content will be closely aligned to Common Core State Standards.\r\n\r\nHow will LA Kids Rock! motivate children?\r\n•\tChildren will find the actual learning games highly engaging.\r\n•\tThere will be inbuilt game rewards designed to encourage optimal use.\r\n•\tChildren and schools will be entered into a draw for “money can’t buy” prizes. We are planning for 20 children and accompanying parents to attend an LA Lakers game along with a “meet the players” afterwards. There will also be three school prizes where key LA sport franchises will visit the winning schools.\r\n•\tLA Kids Rock! will make it easy for parents, grandparents and teachers to say “Great Job!” to children. We know this to be one of the most important motivators of all.\r\n\r\nHow will it impact the education indicator?\r\n•\tLA Kids Rock! will lift reading and math test scores\r\n•\tChildren will be more engaged and positive in their learning\r\n•\tLA Kids Rock! will support teachers in their vital role\r\n•\tLower high school dropout rates in years to come\r\n•\tBring the community together to focus on supporting children’s learning\r\n•\tDecrease the disparity between the education “haves” and “have-nots.”\r\n"

For measurement purposes we will use data from LAUSD – the largest school district.\r\n"
  description: "LA Kids Rock! will lift reading and math test scores\r\n“Thank you so much for this program. I have a young man in 4th grade who has a severe reading disability and SKOOLBO has been one of the programs he has taken to!!! We are so excited to see how much he has improved.  Thanks a million…” – A teacher from Florida.\r\n\r\nLearning pedagogies underpinning LA Kids Rock! include:\r\n•\tMake learning fun!\r\n•\tIndividualized, differentiated curriculum.\r\n•\tImmediate feedback and support.\r\n•\tFast paced efficient learning.\r\n•\tMulti-layered rewards and motivation mechanism.\r\n•\tReports and analytics for parents and teachers.\r\n•\tProvide many opportunities for positive affirmation.\r\n•\tBuild a culture of engagement and success for every child.\r\n\r\nChildren will be more engaged and positive in their learning\r\n“I have to say my students are “crazy” about Skoolbo. They have become so loud during the play as they shout when they win. – A teacher from Illinois.\r\n\r\n “Our children LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this app!” – a teacher from Maine.\r\n\r\nEngagement and success in learning are essential for creating sustained positive attitudes towards learning.\r\n\r\nLA Kids Rock! will support teachers in their vital role\r\n“One of the main challenges a teacher faces is providing differentiation to their struggling students and their advanced students. Skoolbo allows my students to work at a pace and challenge that is most appropriate for them.”  – A teacher from California.\r\nTeaching is difficult and teachers need as much support as they can get from the entire community. LA Kids Rock! will support teachers by:\r\n•\tProviding powerful learning analytics and reports.\r\n•\tDifferentiating learning through sophisticated, in-built algorithms.\r\n•\tCreating exciting learning environments which lead to less behavioral issues.\r\n•\tEngaging and including parents and wider famly members in the students’ achievements.\r\n•\tAlerting teachers to critical learning milestones in the student’s progression.\r\n\r\nLower high school dropout rates in years to come \r\n“For many students the dropping out process commences in elementary school. The two most consistent indicators of ultimate school dropout are early academic performance and students’ academic and social behaviour.” - The California Dropout Research Project.\r\n\r\nSuccess breeds success, conversely failure often leads to more failure. A happy, successful elementary education will result in a reduction of high school dropout rates.\r\n\r\nBring the community together to focus on supporting children’s learning\r\n•\tWe believe society as a whole needs to take greater ownership of education. Each and everyone of us has this responsibility.\r\n•\tLA Kids Rock! will connect parents, grandparents, teachers and community in one common purpose – supporting children’s learning.\r\n\r\nDecrease the disparity between the education “haves” and “have-nots” \r\n•\tLA Kids Rock! will be completely free of charge and accessible to every child regardless of economic circumstances."

  description1: "Our dream is that every child learns to read and gains confidence with numbers... these are life's essentials. We believe technology can dramatically help and that the best way to do it is to make it lots of fun and to make it free! We are committed to making great learning resources accessible to every child.\r\n\r\nPrior to founding Skoolbo in 2010, Shane Hill also founded Mathletics and World Math Day. These programs have seen millions of children from around the world participate in fun learning events and they have demonstrated highly rapid improvement.\r\n\r\nOver the last three years Skoolbo has created the world's largest educational game. Our focus is literacy and numeracy for 4 to 10 year olds. Shortly we will be adding 26 languages to the Skoolbo platform.\r\n\r\nSkoolbo was invited to be part of the Global Social Innovators Accelerator program, a sub-strand of the Global Social Innovators Forum 2012 (GSIF). GSIF is the foremost forum on social enterprise and innovation in Asia and it aims to create a community of change-makers for sustainable and meaningful impact.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, Skoolbo organized an online educational event named Smartest Singapore for Singapore primary school children. The event partners were Samsung, Microsoft, Collins, the Media Development Authority of Singapore, and several regional and local businesses.  Within one month, children from 118 primary schools in Singapore answered correctly a total of 2,725,288 questions on Smartest Singapore. There was an average improvement of 42.6% among children who played more than 100 games.\r\n\r\nIn February 2013, Shane Hill was honored with the Social Innovation Leadership Award at World CSR Congress and Awards 2013 in Mumbai, India. This is the most prestigious award an individual can receive for contribution in Corporate Social Responsibility. The World CSR Congress brings over 130 countries under one roof to unite and celebrate leadership in building a better society and making a better world.\r\n \r\nIn March 2013, Shane Hill was invited to speak at the Global Education & Skills Forum (GESF), Dubai. Shane co-presented with Senator David Coltart, Minister of Education, Zimbabwe and Dr. Matthew Kam, Senior Technology Strategist, American Institutes for Research, Washington D.C., in a session titled “Smarter Content, Better Learning”. The GESF aimed to explore how governments and the private sector can work together to create real, sustainable and scalable education change in developing countries at global and local levels. The GESF was keynoted by Bill Clinton and attended by more than fifty Heads of State / Education Ministers.\r\n  \r\nIn September 2013 Skoolbo will be hosting FriendOurWorld.org which is a collaboration with Peace One Day and Microsoft. Children from across the world will unite and play friendship games of geography, languages and culture on the Skoolbo platform. We anticipate this will be one of the largest educational events ever held.\r\n"
  vision: "Our vision for 2050 is a Los Angeles where every child has the opportunity to reach his or her potential. It will be a society where educational outcomes are not pre-determined by zip code or race. Education of our children will be valued as the highest of all society’s priorities. It will be prosperous, cohesive and innovative where Angelenos are employed in ways that fully utilize their considerable skills and passion. We are convinced this is within our power, however it will not occur naturally.\r\n\r\nWe thank the Goldhirsh Foundation for this important initiative."
