title: Innovation Saturday for Los Angeles Youth
indicator: ' Income & Employment'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >+
  Together with our partners, NFTE Greater Los Angeles proposes to address youth
  unemployment in the African American and Latino communities, by creating a
  youth entrepreneurship and innovation conference for 300 youth, to be held at
  USC in partnership with USC Marshall’s Greif Center for Entrepreneurial
  Studies. The event will reach underserved Los Angeles teens with the goal of
  promoting youth entrepreneurship in the face of high unemployment rates for
  African American and Latino youth in lowincome neighborhoods. 



  The conference will be held on Innovation Saturday in Fall 2013 in tandem with
  NFTE’s World Series of Innovation, a competition designed to challenge teens
  to solve realworld business problems posed by companies like CocaCola,
  Microsoft, JC Penney, Sean John, and others. Students who attend the
  conference will participate in sessions led by diverse LA entrepreneurs who
  will share the entrepreneurial lessons they have learned. Youth will also work
  with a team of established entrepreneurs and their fellow teens to launch a
  project to submit to the World Series of Innovation. Featured conference
  speakers will include young African American and Latino entrepreneurs and
  innovators in Los Angeles, introducing underserved LA youth to the growing
  community of diverse innovators in Los Angeles shaping the business climate in
  LA.  






  The stories shared by entrepreneurs at this event will be documented on video,
  and shared with the broader Los Angeles community through a webbased library
  of entrepreneurial stories, in the model of Ted talks, thus affecting the
  wider LA community of youth seeking economic opportunities. 






  This project can impact the income and employment outlook for these youth by
  introducing them to an alternative vision for generating income to support
  their life goals, inspiring them with the stories of entrepreneurs who reflect
  their communities, and sharing resources that can assist them on an
  entrepreneurial path.


What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: "*\tNFTE Greater LA celebrated our 5th Anniversary in 2012.  Since our launch, we have trained over 6,000 of our city’s hardesttoreach students in our rigorous entrepreneurship curriculum.  By the end of this school year, we will have reached a cumulative total of 7,800 local youth. (April 2012)\n\n\n\n\n\n*\tOut of over 20,000 NFTE students across the country, NFTE Greater LA students have won our National Youth Entrepreneurship Challenge three out of the past 4 years, winning both First and Second Place in 2011:\n\n\no\tFirst Place: Kalief Rollins “Phree Kountry Clothing” (2009)\n\n\no\tFirst Place: Hayley Hoverter “Sweet (dis)SOLVE” (2011)\n\n\no\tSecond Place: Shomari Patterson “Shamazzle’s Dazzles” (2011)\n\n\no\tFirst Place: Vincent Quigg “Tech World” (2012)\n\n\n\n\n\n*\tOur Advisory Board Chair Jeff Green was honored with NFTE’s Lowell B. Mason Volunteer of the Year Award for exemplary service. (April 2012)\n\n\n\n\n\n*\tDuring 2012, NFTE Greater LA embarked on a Strategic Planning process for FY13FY15 which included an assessment of our current situation, outreach to our communities for feedback, and the creation of strategic priorities as we move forward. This process culminated in a Strategic Planning Retreat, where participants weighed in on our initiatives and engaged in creating our case for support and picture of success.  We look forward to utilizing this grander vision as a guide to building a more impactful organization in the years to come.  In November, we were awarded a Strategic Scorecard Grant from the Taproot Foundation to better enable us to track our success. (2012)\n\n\n\n\n\n*\tDue to an anchor gift from one of our funders, we were able to expand our program enrollment and build capacity by growing our NFTE Greater LA Team to 4 fulltime staff, and 4 consultants, as well as embark on a research project to assess our impact on LA youth. (October 2012)\n\n\n"
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  Our strategic partner, USC’s Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies, as well
  as The American Dream Revised, will work with us on this project. Should we
  receive funding, we will seek support from Young Presidents’ Organization

  The Hub LA and NAWBOLA to actualize our project.
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  In order to measure the value of our conference for the youth involved, we
  will collect preand postsurvey data, gathering feedback on what they learned
  from the conference and how useful they found it in informing them about
  entrepreneurship opportunities that are available to them. We will seek
  feedback from our conference presenters, as well as our partners, in order to
  document successes and gather feedback for future improvements. We will be
  able to monitor the use of our video library and encourage our community of
  supporters to promote the resource among their networks. 
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
  There is an exciting groundswell of entrepreneurship and innovation in Los
  Angeles that must be extended to our city’s low income youth. Youth in Los
  Angeles who live in underresourced neighborhoods suffer at the crossroads of
  two major crises affecting our city: the education crisis and the economic
  crisis. These crises disproportionately affect our city's AfricanAmerican and
  Latino communities, who bear the burden of struggling schools and a depressed
  local economy, where better paying employment is difficult to find. When a
  segment of our population is cut off from full participation in the economy,
  the broader community suffers.






  A youth innovation conference specifically targeting our lowincome youth works
  at the intersection of these crises to provide a fresh outlook for youth
  confronted by their community’s challenges. By directing resources and
  opportunities toward these underserved youth, our goal is to educate and
  motivate students to adopt an entrepreneurial vision for their own future.
  This conference will introduce students to  the skills necessary for
  entrepreneurship (project planning, future forecasting, opportunity
  recognition, financial planning, public speaking, negotiating), and our
  digital library of resources will serve as a lasting source of information to
  enable our youth  to think beyond their environment and to pursue
  opportunities that help them realize their full potential.


What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  In 2050, our vision is that selfemployment for youth in lowincome communities
  exists as a recognized and viable alternative to seeking a traditional job,
  and youth unemployment rates have declined significantly. Meaningful
  educational tools, seed funding, mentorship and role models are readily
  available to youth in lowincome communities who wish to pursue an
  entrepreneurial path.
