    In order to measure the value of our conference for the youth involved, we
    will collect pre-and post-survey data, gathering feedback on what they
    learned from the conference and how useful they found it in informing them
    about entrepreneurship opportunities that are available to them. We will
    seek feedback from our conference presenters, as well as our partners, in
    order to document successes and gather feedback for future improvements. We
    will be able to monitor the use of our video library and encourage our
    community of supporters to promote the resource among their networks.

  Indicator: ' Income & Employment'
  brief: "Together with our partners, NFTE Greater Los Angeles proposes to address youth unemployment in the African American and Latino communities, by creating a youth entrepreneurship and innovation conference for 300 youth, to be held at USC in partnership with USC Marshall’s Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies. The event will reach under-served Los Angeles teens with the goal of promoting youth entrepreneurship in the face of high unemployment rates for African American and Latino youth in low-income neighborhoods. \r\nThe conference will be held on Innovation Saturday in Fall 2013 in tandem with NFTE’s World Series of Innovation, a competition designed to challenge teens to solve real-world business problems posed by companies like Coca-Cola, Microsoft, JC Penney, Sean John, and others. Students who attend the conference will participate in sessions led by diverse LA entrepreneurs who will share the entrepreneurial lessons they have learned. Youth will also work with a team of established entrepreneurs and their fellow teens to launch a project to submit to the World Series of Innovation. Featured conference speakers will include young African American and Latino entrepreneurs and innovators in Los Angeles, introducing under-served LA youth to the growing community of diverse innovators in Los Angeles shaping the business climate in LA.  \r\n\r\nThe stories shared by entrepreneurs at this event will be documented on video, and shared with the broader Los Angeles community through a web-based library of entrepreneurial stories, in the model of Ted talks, thus affecting the wider LA community of youth seeking economic opportunities. \r\n\r\nThis project can impact the income and employment outlook for these youth by introducing them to an alternative vision for generating income to support their life goals, inspiring them with the stories of entrepreneurs who reflect their communities, and sharing resources that can assist them on an entrepreneurial path.\r\n"

  description: "There is an exciting groundswell of entrepreneurship and innovation in Los Angeles that must be extended to our city’s low income youth. Youth in Los Angeles who live in under-resourced neighborhoods suffer at the crossroads of two major crises affecting our city: the education crisis and the economic crisis. These crises disproportionately affect our city's African-American and Latino communities, who bear the burden of struggling schools and a depressed local economy, where better paying employment is difficult to find. When a segment of our population is cut off from full participation in the economy, the broader community suffers.\r\n\r\nA youth innovation conference specifically targeting our low-income youth works at the intersection of these crises to provide a fresh outlook for youth confronted by their community’s challenges. By directing resources and opportunities toward these under-served youth, our goal is to educate and motivate students to adopt an entrepreneurial vision for their own future. This conference will introduce students to  the skills necessary for entrepreneurship (project planning, future forecasting, opportunity recognition, financial planning, public speaking, negotiating), and our digital library of resources will serve as a lasting source of information to enable our youth  to think beyond their environment and to pursue opportunities that help them realize their full potential.\r\n"

    Locally, NFTE shares the entrepreneurship space with three key
    organizations:  Junior Achievement, Project ECHO and Academy of Business
    Leadership. NFTE and JA provide complementary programming at a handful of
    local schools, and our leaders have convened to advance entrepreneurship
    education through the Aspen Institute’s Youth Entrepreneurship Initiative.
    We are also currently engaging with the Executive Director of Project ECHO
    to strategize on methods for increasing our mutual impact. NFTE promotes the
    summer programming of Academy of Business Leadership, hosting staff members
    to share their opportunities with NFTE students.
  vision: >-
    In 2050, our vision is that self-employment for youth in low-income
    communities exists as a recognized and viable alternative to seeking a
    traditional job, and youth unemployment rates have declined significantly.
    Meaningful educational tools, seed funding, mentorship and role models are
    readily available to youth in low-income communities who wish to pursue an
    entrepreneurial path.

  The conference will be held on Innovation Saturday in Fall 2013 in tandem with
  NFTE’s World Series of Innovation, a competition designed to challenge teens
  to solve realworld business problems posed by companies like CocaCola,
  Microsoft, JC Penney, Sean John, and others. Students who attend the

  speakers will include young African American and Latino entrepreneurs and

  community of diverse innovators in Los Angeles shaping the business climate in
  LA.  






  The stories shared by entrepreneurs at this event will be documented on video,
  and shared with the broader Los Angeles community through a webbased library
  of entrepreneurial stories, in the model of Ted talks, thus affecting the
  wider LA community of youth seeking economic opportunities. 






  This project can impact the income and employment outlook for these youth by
  introducing them to an alternative vision for generating income to support
  their life goals, inspiring them with the stories of entrepreneurs who reflect
  their communities, and sharing resources that can assist them on an
  entrepreneurial path.
