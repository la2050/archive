  Indicator: ' Health'
  brief: "The Pick Up, Pop-Up Produce Station provides reliable access to fresh, affordable and healthful food grown in community gardens to commuters and local residents in the vicinity of transit stations.  The project impacts community health by improving food access and proposes a replicable prototype implementable across the county.\r\n\r\nThis prototype is adjacent to the 103rd Street / Watts Towers Blue Line Station. We propose to install a dismountable produce stand in close proximity to the station accessible from 103rd street, capturing pedestrian activity. The produce station will be packable, transportable and will transform into an active and engaging retail environment accommodating daily selling of produce, as well as serving as a backdrop for special events. Mudtown Farms in conjunction WLCAC will provide the fresh produce from their local farm located five blocks from the station.\r\n\r\nThe Watts Labor Community Action Committee will provide operational support for the Pop-Up Produce Station through training and administering a workforce, offering other administrative support, and community outreach.   In order to make people aware of the project, a series of events centered on the Pop-Up Produce Station will be staged by Project Food LA to activate the relationship between the transit hub and the food system.\r\n \r\nOsborn Architects will design and oversee the construction and initial deployment of the produce stand, obtain necessary approvals, and involve the stakeholders in the design process.  Project Food LA will administer programming and special events to the Pop-Up Produce Station at its initial installation.  Civic Projects, along with Osborn, will coordinate implementation and communication between the stakeholder organizations and agencies, and provide a strategic planning infrastructure so the project can be successfully maintained for the ongoing, achievement of project goals for a duration of five years by the WLAC and Project Food LA – the project goals being to provide reliable access to fresh, affordable and healthful food to commuters and local residents at the 103rd Street / Watts Towers Blue Line Station.\r\n"

  The Pick Up, PopUp Produce Station provides reliable access to fresh,
  affordable and healthful food grown in community gardens to commuters and
  local residents in the vicinity of transit stations.  The project impacts
  community health by improving food access and proposes a replicable prototype
  implementable across the county.






  This prototype is adjacent to the 103rd Street / Watts Towers Blue Line
  Station. We propose to install a dismountable produce stand in close proximity
  to the station accessible from 103rd street, capturing pedestrian activity.
  The produce station will be packable, transportable and will transform into an
  active and engaging retail environment accommodating daily selling of produce,
  as well as serving as a backdrop for special events. Mudtown Farms in
  conjunction WLCAC will provide the fresh produce from their local farm located
  five blocks from the station.






  The Watts Labor Community Action Committee will provide operational support
  for the PopUp Produce Station through training and administering a workforce,
  offering other administrative support, and community outreach.   In order to
  make people aware of the project, a series of events centered on the PopUp
  Produce Station will be staged by Project Food LA to activate the relationship
  between the transit hub and the food system.


   


  Osborn Architects will design and oversee the construction and initial
  deployment of the produce stand, obtain necessary approvals, and involve the
  stakeholders in the design process.  Project Food LA will administer
  programming and special events to the PopUp Produce Station at its initial
  installation.  Civic Projects, along with Osborn, will coordinate
  implementation and communication between the stakeholder organizations and
  agencies, and provide a strategic planning infrastructure so the project can
  be successfully maintained for the ongoing, achievement of project goals for a
  duration of five years by the WLAC and Project Food LA — the project goals
  being to provide reliable access to fresh, affordable and healthful food to
  commuters and local residents at the 103rd Street / Watts Towers Blue Line
  Station.

Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >+
  Success will be measured by multiple, and wideranging, factors, including but
  not limited to the following:






  1. Overall health of the community as determined by studies carried out by
  parties independent of the project, over a period of five years.



  2. The number of people served by the stand over the course of days, weeks,
  months, up to a period of five years.



  3. The amount of produce sold by the stand over the course of days, weeks,
  months, up to a period of five years.



  4. The number of people participating in the workforce and job training
  aspects of the program.



  5. The revenue versus the costs of the program.



  6. The length of time the workforce and job trainees stay with the produce
  stand.


How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
  The immediate station area, and the larger neighborhood, is notably
  underserved by grocery stores, both in terms of quality and number. Access to
  nutritious food in grocery stores is taken for granted in more affluent
  neighborhoods. In this station area, residents' options are severely limited
  to fast food outlets or overpriced and substandard produce and groceries. The
  station serves a moderately dense residential area, with pedestrian traffic
  around the station throughout the day, and heavy pedestrian traffic at rush
  hour. The PopUp Produce Station will be a community resource besides offering
  access to nutritious produce by providing work and job training opportunities
  for neighborhood residents.


   


  Our proposal links the products of Mudtown Farms, five blocks from the
  station, to the pedestrians around the 103rd Street / Watts Towers Blue Line
  Station, providing convenient, affordable and reliable access, by transit
  users and pedestrians, to nutritious produce grown in the community garden.
  Our project will supplement the Mudtown Farms Phase III plan, which recently
  received a Proposition 84 State Parks Grant to enhance and maintain their
  urban farm. The PopUp Produce Station will act as a vendor outpost to the
  Farms. Produce grown and harvested at the farm will supply the produce stand,
  providing the local farmers with a reliable pedestrian consumer pool.


What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  The residents of Watts would be as healthy by all measures as the residents of
  Santa Monica.
