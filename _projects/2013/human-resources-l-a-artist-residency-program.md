title: Human Resources L.A. Artist Residency Program!
indicator: Arts & Cultural Vitality
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >+
  Human Resources L.A. Artist Residency Program would create Los Angeles' first
  centrally focused artist residency to hosts L.A. based artists and actively
  work to support their surrounding communities. Although there are several
  Artist residencies currently in place that support international artist in
  L.A. there is yet to be a program that serves L.A. locally. 






  By hosting 6 artists in the coming year Human Resources L.A. (HRLA) would act
  as a frame for a diverse set of vital yet under supported artist practices
  already occurring in Los Angeles. Each artist would be given studio space, a
  stipend and be asked to contribute to a public program that engages the city
  of Los Angeles. The residency would promote exchange between these cooccurring
  artist practices as well as foster educational and community impact;
  contextualizing the work in a noncommercial environment in order to bring
  global attention to the city of Los Angels as an international arena for
  culture and the arts. 






  Our goal in supporting our residents would be to create an exceptional
  environment in which to further personal practices while engaging them in
  HRLA’s existing community and beyond. Community outreach will be activated by
  facilitating exhibition, performance, publication and symposium inside our
  existing Chinatown gallery space and institutional frame as well as activating
  our partners — including major institutions, galleries and fellow artistrun
  spaces. 






  Part of our effort would be to extend geographical bridges between the artist
  communities established on the west side of L.A. in the last 25 years — Santa
  Monica, Venice beach, Culver City — and the new migrations east — Chinatown
  artist run space already in close collaboration with HRLA including KChung
  Radio, Ooga Booga, Machine Projects in Echo Park, Night Gallery. 








What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >+
  HRLA was a collaborator and grant receiver of Getty Museum for PST festival
  2012, We have collaborated with REDCAT Gallery, UC Riverside, CalArts, LAND,
  Machine Projects on cooperative programs. Human Resources is a team of
  creative individuals, whose mission is to broaden public engagement with
  contemporary and conceptual art. Our organization emphasizes underexposed
  modes of expression and interdisciplinary arts practices that do not fit
  easily within existing institutionalized structures.






  Human Resources was identified by the Los Angeles Weekly in 2012 as one of the
  city's "most dynamic arts venues." We foster active public appreciation of
  performative, participatory and multidisciplinary art practices by encouraging
  maximum community access. Events are free or very low cost. Members of our
  broad community generate exhibitions, performances and readings  artists who
  attend our events are encouraged to bring proposals to directing members. Our
  programming procedures encourage direct conversation with artists, musicians
  and writers in order to educate our audiences about our mission. These
  conversations also shape our understanding of the needs of artists working in
  noncommercial and experimental paradigms. 






  Human Resources serves as an important point of convergence for diverse and
  sometimes disparate art communities. We offer regular platforms for
  conversation and ideasharing in order to promote the sustainability of
  nontraditional art forms. We nurture the kinds of artistic intelligence
  produced by working closely with different artistic communities  such as that
  of experimental music and performance art. We have also collaborated with
  other art spaces and events, including Pacific Standard Time, Silvershed's
  Collective show, fundraisers and events for Les Figues Press and Darin Klein's
  Box of Books, and the Chinatown Perform!Now! Festival.  We continue to provide
  a substantial venue for large events, installations, video screenings, music
  performance, performance art and hybrid events in the Chinatown area of Los
  Angeles. 





Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  18th Street Arts Center in Santa Monica is a nonprofit 25 yearold artist
  residency program that hosts over 30 international artists annually and 20 mid
  and long term local artist residents. 18th Street Arts Center would act as our
  mentor through consultation, collaborative exchanges and joint staffing. We
  would look to 18th Street and Santa Monica City’s support of this institution
  as a model to build from. 
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  We will hold extensive interviews with each artist in residence at the end of
  their stay and create documents that evaluate their experience. We will
  collect data addressing the impact of events, exhibitions and publications 
  all programs currently implemented by Human Resources L.A.’s existing
  infrastructure  that will be available platforms for Artists in Residence to
  engage. Current systems of collecting data addressing viewership, visitors,
  community impact, marketing, education and outreach will be applied towards
  the residency at the end of the grant cycle and complied into a responsive
  document of accountability. 
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  While Los Angels is designated a thriving global art market it is now just
  approaching designation as a global arts city. Recently initiated endeavors
  including PST 2012, the first L.A. Biennial at Hammer Museum and upcoming PST
  2017 are placing Los Angeles as a powerful center for culture and the arts on
  the international stage. A  artist residency, which surprisingly Los Angeles
  does not yet have, would act as an important platform to support generation of
  high caliber artist works, discourse and exchange. This residency could grow
  to support a cross section of arts institutions within Los Angeles and artists
  working within them through concerted participation. 






  Through our participation with 18th Street Arts Center in Santa Monica,
  Southern California’s largest artist residency program, we would hope to
  create public art works that tie together the larger geographical landscape of
  Los Angeles. In December 2015 the L.A. City Metro is scheduled to open it’s
  Bergamont Station and 17th Street Stations completing a long awaited
  thoroughfare connecting central Los Angeles to the west side. 18th Street is
  an early partner with Metro to select public arts commissions designated for
  these new transit sites. Meanwhile, HRLA is only blocks away form the existing
  Chinatown station. Both institutions would like to partner to implement a
  public arts program in collaborated effort with Metro in the future. Our focus
  would be to engage the ridership of Metro and support artists’ projects that
  address the unique geographical web that is Los Angeles.






  These geographical bridges would parallel generational bridges and serve to
  elaborate upon the rich history of 18th Street Arts Center and it’s support of
  an older generation of west side artists by creating platforms for exchange
  between the two residencies. Both 18th Street and HRLA have existing
  exhibition venues and publication presidents that can support the public
  extension of work produced from these exchanges.






  The core immediate audience and community for Human Resources are artists and
  art appreciators living on the east side of Los Angeles. This community is
  diverse in terms of age, race, gender and socioeconomic status with community
  members ranging from the early20s to their mid60s. The Artist residency
  program would allow us to continue to grow this community and extend it
  further out into the public sphere.
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  HRLA has a dream of Los Angeles in 2050 as a global arts city, a pioneer and
  center for innovative crosspollination of creative thought. Artist residencies
  provide environments for artist to flourish not only in their private practice
  but also in unexpected conversation with the larger community. Artist
  residencies become active breeding grounds for experimental practices,
  educational outreach and exchange. Any established global arts city must
  competitively foster a vital artist residency program that facilitates the
  production and practice of crucial working artists first locally and then
  beyond as it promote its cultural production abroad. HRLA Artist Residency
  Program would work towards creating supported space for creative thinking,
  action and education with the mission to prove that art, creativity, critical
  discourse and cooperation promotes a higher quality of life and engaging of
  mind for all members of a society.
