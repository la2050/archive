title: 'Camp Hollywood HEART '
indicator: Arts & Cultural Vitality
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >+
  Our idea is providing a second week of Hollywood HEART's innovative annual
  arts summer camp, Camp Hollywood HEART (CHH). CHH is a weeklong interactive
  arts experience for youth impacted by HIV/AIDS. Participants from ages 1521
  primarily from Los Angeles have the opportunity to explore, by choice, one of
  seven arts disciplines: acting, creative writing, culinary arts, documentary
  filmmaking, fashion, music, and visual arts.  









  CHH enhances human development because our youth are given the opportunity to
  interact positively with arts professionals and one another as they explore
  their creativity and receive both personal and careercentered insight. Led by
  experienced artists and mentors, participants enjoy comprehensive instruction
  and training in their chosen art, steering them in the right direction for
  pursuing their creative passions. The camp culminates with a professionally
  produced live performance, empowering our young artists to showcase their
  creativity and artistic vision with the entire camp community. The opportunity
  to celebrate each other’s talents is an experience that brings smiles, pride,
  and confidence to the participants for years to come.









  The campers also get to choose exciting elective programming such as comic
  book artistry, fashion design, culinary arts, stunt choreography, and
  photography, providing campers with a wellrounded experience beyond their
  initial focus. In addition to electives and focused workshops, camp provides a
  variety of fun, enlightening experiences ranging from the exciting talent
  showcases by wellknown entertainers to beach time, sports, and games. Before
  departing camp each participant is provided with a resource packet full of
  information and direction on how to further their professional development.
  The week at CHH allows participants to understand the responsibilities of
  adulthood and build selfesteem in a trusted, caring, and fun environment.


What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >+
  Since its inception in 1995, Hollywood HEART hasn’t stopped providing amazing
  programs and support staff. Hollywood HEART was initially created as Camp
  Pacific Heartland (CPH) in 1995, and has since welcomed more than 1,750
  campers. Created by entertainment executive David Gale, the camp was founded
  to address the social and recreational needs of Southern California children
  affected by HIV/AIDS. 






  Camp Pacific Heartland was held for 17 years in Malibu, California for kids
  aged 616 — providing them with opportunities to build skills, confidence, and
  hope. CPH allowed campers to take a break from the stress and stigma of living
  in a family impacted by HIV/AIDS while providing a safe, healthful environment
  in which these children could enjoy themselves and experience the normalcy
  they often lacked in their lives.






  The Movie Team sought to utilize the film industry backgrounds of Hollywood
  HEART’s founders, board members and volunteers to give children and teens the
  opportunity to participate in the art of filmmaking. Through the Movie Team
  experience, the youths learned to write, produce, and star in their own short
  films. The program collaborated with local social service agencies including
  foster homes, community groups and Boys and Girls Clubs to produce over 70
  films throughout the United States and South Africa. The model has since been
  integrated into Camp Hollywood HEART as well as the ongoing Educational Arts
  Workshops.






  Our Educational Arts workshops are a condensed version of Camp Hollywood HEART
  and distill performing and visual arts skills into afterschool and weekendlong
  formats throughout Los Angeles. Collaborating with local social service
  agencies and community groups, these workshops continue to share industry
  expertise and creativity with dozens of atrisk youth across Los Angeles. The
  goal of the Educational Arts Workshops is to provide skill sets to groups one
  workshop at a time. Programs include everything from intensive writing and
  documentary filmmaking workshops to fashion and set design. This allows our
  participants ample time to absorb, practice, and sharpen skills passed on from
  Hollywood professionals. Being able to provide these opportunities in
  collaboration with volunteers and small budgets have allowed Hollywood HEART
  to achieve unforgettable programming. 





Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >+
  Hollywood HEART is proud to be able to partner with several amazing
  organizations to make CHH a reality every year. These organizations include:






  One Heartland



  Young Variety of Southern California



  CITYstage



  Alternative Intervention Model



  Artists In Motion



  San Fernando Valley Partnership



  Mobile Film Classroom


Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  Participants fill out qualitative and quantitative pre/mid/post surveys to
  gauge effectiveness and impact of the program. Volunteers, staff, and program
  partners also provide feedback. Our staff then measures the change in pre and
  postprogram answers to determine any change in attitudes over the course of
  the program and whether changes in attitude continue after the program is
  over.






  End of program evaluations for both participants and program partners also ask
  for qualitative feedback on items such as program structure, content, what you
  learned, favorite/least favorite parts, and suggestions for the future. We use
  this feedback to help guide our future program planning. 






  Reviewing participant feedback every year is very important and has helped
  evolve programming to ensure success for everyone involved. Some positive
  feedback we received about CHH was that one participant now has arts and
  crafts fairs on the weekends with her siblings, another received a scholarship
  to Northern Arizona University for film thanks in part to films she created at
  camp, and another now cooks with plant based foods in order to directly combat
  the side effects of HIV/AIDS medications. These success stories are just a few
  reasons CHH needs to be expanded and offered to more youth from Los Angeles.
  More youth need opportunities to obtain professional and personal skills that
  will help ensure their success. 
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  Our project will specifically benefit Los Angeles because it will contribute
  to number of artists in the city that contribute to the economy as well as the
  culture. Los Angeles is one of the most artistically rich cities in the world
  in part thanks to the Hollywood industry. With schools continually eliminating
  arts programs, where will Los Angeles create, develop, and maintain identity?
  Hollywood HEART believes by providing these opportunities for youth in Los
  Angeles, they will use their skills to enhance the quality of life for all
  Angelenos.
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  Success in the year 2050 regarding our indicator would vibrant and abundant.
  We will have touched the lives of more than a million youth through our arts
  programming by opening the doors to a successful future for them. Participants
  of Camp Hollywood HEART would then grow up to be strong, confident individuals
  that will want to give back to society as they are grateful for opportunities
  that were provided for them.  They will spread the spirit of creativity and
  expression to educate others about the different lives and people that make
  Los Angeles the best city in the world.
