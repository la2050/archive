  Organization Name: WriteGirl
  Indicator: ' Education'
  brief: "<p>Between texting and tweeting, it may seem the that the need for “real” writing has gone out the window. But writing is important, and creative writing is more important still. The ability to express oneself, in public, professional and private contexts, is critical for success, effective communication and the development of community. </p><p>WriteGirl has more than 12 years of success in guiding young people to express themselves through creative writing and mentoring. The results have been extraordinary and despite the rapid digitization of the globe, reports of writing’s obsolescence are greatly exaggerated! </p><p>The purpose of the Power of the Pen: Writing Together project is to leverage the abundant creative writing and educational talent pool of Los Angeles, and to foster the joy of writing. We hope that this project will serve as the pilot program for annual city-wide writing events. The project website will remain active year-round, showcasing selected writing and inspiring stories. We want to guide our city to write together, to empower any individual to express his or her stories in creative ways.</p> <p>Everyone has a story to tell. Los Angelenos have rich personal histories and perspectives. The Power of the Pen: Writing Together project emphasizes the community’s role in education. The project will be kicked off by a week-long co-ed program of creative writing workshops in middle schools and high schools throughout Los Angeles. </p><p>Who would lead these workshops? We believe that with the right tools and training, anyone who loves to write can be an effective, powerful mentor. WriteGirl would recruit and train men and women from all walks of life to become Writing Guides during the week-long Power of the Pen: Writing Together project. </p><p>Simultaneously, the Power of the Pen project would galvanize the city through a series of creative writing activities around the city, so that Angelenos can write and create together, with the carefully scoped guidance that we specialize in (and that helps us get great writing from virtually anyone). The entire community of Los Angeles would be invited to participate by sharing their written stories through a website specifically dedicated to this program. The theme for the kick-off week will focus on writing personal stories about where we’ve been and where we’re going.</p><p>These events can be presented with the many organizations we partner with or who currently support our work, but also in settings that are both new to our traditional work and also new as settings for creative writing. That means outdoors, in the middle of the workday (and workplace), on public transportation, in the chambers of government, at the schools and universities, in the company of people you love and value, and in the company of strangers (or not-yet-met friends). We propose to write in the shadow of Los Angeles landmarks to draw inspiration from our unique landscape and culture, to write with the inclusion of the many, many professional writers who congregate to our city and its various media-driven enterprises, and to connect online with groups and individuals, inviting them to write with us, in real time, to reiterate the value of writing together.</p><p>When people participate in creative writing (which is distinct from school-based writing), they often experience transcendence. Gone are the red pencil marks from a teacher who didn’t understand, the feelings of exclusion because a mandate for perfection excluded you from one of humanity’s core activities – expressing our true, uncensored creative instincts – the things we make up entirely on our own, often in a completely unique way. Creative writing is different because it prompts the writer to take risks, to explore ideas that are not yet fully formed or perfected. Creative writing presents a standard to meet that is entirely self-designed. It is freeing, fortifying, and prompts people to travel even further along their own journeys of personal development. Creative writing brings what is inside to the outside so you can share it with the world around you and, if need be, create that world for yourself.</p><p>You are what you write. That has been the experience of WriteGirl over the past 12 years. We have guided young writers and adults to produce writing that has thrilled those near enough to hear it read aloud. Our books have been lauded with 48 national and international awards. We have mostly worked with high school girls, but have also very effectively developed events for boys, co-ed groups, middle schoolers, adults, and youth who are critically at risk, such as those who are pregnant, parenting, or incarcerated. Even the audiences at all of our large events get to connect with the power of the pen – you can’t attend a WriteGirl event without being prompted to write something!<p>\r\n"

  description3: "<p>While other organizations provide literacy tutoring or writing workshops (826 LA, PEN in the Classroom, Young Storytellers) or one-on-one mentoring (Big Brothers/Big Sisters, Fulfillment Fund, WYSE), WriteGirl is unique in offering a year-long program of creative writing workshops, one-on-one mentoring, college guidance and publishing opportunities within a community of women writers. Most girls stay in the program for 4 to 5 years, an unusually long period of involvement for a high school teen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several agencies that provide college guidance but we don’t consider them competitors when there is such a great need for more programs and services to help our youth graduate from high school and attain higher education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WriteGirl has partnered with 826LA, Homeboy Industries and PEN on several events, and we hope to collaborate with many other organizations on future activities, including the Power of the Pen: Writing Together project. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>WriteGirl Executive Director Keren Taylor has been selected to serve as a Community Champion and facilitator for the Annenberg Foundation's Alchemy Program, helping guide nonprofit leaders to organizational success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WriteGirl staff have also led leadership development workshops for the California Paraeducator Conference, California School-Age Consortium, California Department of Education, Los Angeles County Office of Education, L.A.’s BEST and the New York Partnership for After School Education, among others, sharing best practices in youth arts education, mentoring and community engagement.</p>\r\n"

Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >+
  WriteGirl has longstanding partnerships with many organizations who we will
  approach to help us implement this project. Educational partners include the
  Los Angeles County Office of Education, the Los Angeles Unified School
  District and the Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs Youth Arts
  Division. Prominent civic institutions who have partnered with WriteGirl to

  Los Angeles Times, The National Center for the Preservation of Democracy, the
  Autry Museum, the Petersen Automotive Museum, the Los Angeles Central Public
  Library, Skylight Books, Book Soup, Vroman’s, the Writers Guild Theater and
  the GRAMMY Foundation. 


Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >+
  <p>The success of the Power of the Pen: Writing Together project can be
  measured through the selected writing that will be showcased on the project’s
  website. The online conversation will demonstrate how effectively the project
  connected and inspired people. </p>






  <p>We will survey participants and stakeholders about their involvement in the
  project. Our committee will meet for a wrapup event to evaluate all aspects of
  the project’s success. </p>






  <p>WriteGirl will complete a detailed report documenting each aspect of the
  program and its effectiveness. This project will add to the civic dialogue
  about the necessity for creative education, and the ways that we can bring the
  city together to participate in that process. </p>






  <p>Through the Power of the Pen: Writing Together project we anticipate that
  many great stories will be shared, in a way that can transform a city.</p>


How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
  The Power of the Pen: Writing Together project will benefit Los Angeles by
  raising to prominence the value of creative writing and selfempowerment. The
  joy of sharing our stories can contribute much to the quality of life in Los
  Angeles. If we want to address the dire high school dropout rate of nearly 50%
  at many Los Angeles public schools, if we want to shift that number by 2050,
  we need to plant seeds now that will inspire students to want to write, and
  engage the community to help make that happen.






  In order to implement this project, we would assemble a committee of local
  teachers, students, parents, arts education professionals, corporate partners
  and experienced WriteGirl mentors and volunteers. The team would develop the
  slate of writing events, refine curriculum and establish recruitment and
  volunteer training criteria for the Power of the Pen Writing Guides. Each
  committee member would receive a modest stipend to help secure their
  commitment of time and energy. The committee would be led by a paid project
  coordinator, who would spearhead communications and project goals. 






  The Power of the Pen: Writing Together project would integrate writing,
  education, arts education and community activism, giving all Los Angeles
  residents the chance to take part in the educational success of the youth of
  Los Angeles and connect with the creative energy of their own personal voices.


What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >+
  <p>The goal of the Power of the Pen: Writing Together project for success in
  2050 is multifaceted: 1) improve creative writing skills and education
  outcomes in students, 2) train and inspire an army of Writing Guides and
  leverage the creative talent in Los Angeles, 3) guide and support teachers to
  bring out the best creative writing in students, 4) empower the community to
  be part of the solution, 5) build a lasting archive of personal creative
  writing from Angelenos, connecting generations, connecting disparate parts of
  Los Angeles, and connecting our personal histories to our collective
  future.</p>






  <p>In the words of one of our teen writers, “One voice does matter.” Success
  in 2050 depends on success now. </p>






  <p>WriteGirl’s success rate compared to the current high school dropout rate,
  is a direct demonstration of how students can be successful when they are
  given tools and a safe environment in which to express themselves and their
  ideas. We want to use the impetus of WriteGirl’s 11 years of success to bring
  the joy of creative writing into the community and engage the city of Los
  Angeles in Writing Together to help educate and inspire our youth and
  ourselves.</p>
