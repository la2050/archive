title: The CITYstage Arts Discovery Project
indicator: Arts & Cultural Vitality
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  <p>Imagine the anticipation: a curtain rises on a magnificent stage; the crowd
  hushes as orchestral horns and violins burst forth; dancers leap and seem to
  defy gravity; something magical has occurred. It’s happening right here in
  your own community, but you’ll never experience it. You’re just a kid, you
  could never afford a ticket, and no one could take you there. In fact, this
  world of captivating performance and art isn’t part of your world at all.</p>



  <p>But it could be. Thousands of LA kids ages 1218 have never been to a
  professional performing arts production in dance, music or theatre. Many have
  never even taken a performing arts class. In fact, less than 10% of LAUSD
  middle school students receive instruction in a comprehensive arts
  program.</p>



  <p>CITYstage would like to change that. Founded in direct response to the
  diminishing performing arts programs in LA, CITYstage is a nonprofit dedicated
  to inspiring and preparing inner city youth to become the future performers
  and arts leaders in the Los Angeles community. Currently, CITYstage provides
  tuitionfree summer and afterschool programs in the performing arts for
  underserved middle and high school students of LAUSD. But this is not enough.
  Answering the Goldhirsh Foundation’s call to provide more opportunities for
  participation in and support of cultural and artistic activities, CITYstage
  proposes an Arts Discovery Project for youth. The goal of this program is to
  recruit, train and retain the next generation of creative artists.</p>



  <p>How would the Arts Discovery Project do this? To start, youth would take
  part in “field trips” to professional stage events, such as Alvin Ailey at the
  Music Center, Lion King at the Pantages, or the LA Phil at Walt Disney Concert
  Hall.</p>



  <p>It’s Saturday. Imagine going to the Pantages Theatre with 49 of your
  classmates to see the Lion King. Before leaving for the show, you learn about
  the costumes and puppetry that bring the animals to life, explore the themes
  of the story, and learn the lyrics to “Hakuna Matata” which you discover
  means, “No worries.” With much excitement, you are finally off to see the
  show! You arrive at the most beautiful theatre you have ever seen — the
  historic Pantages — where 50 ft. high dancers and giraffe puppets ascend the
  aisles amid thundering African beats. You’ve never experienced anything like
  it. Something magical is happening! After the performance, you meet the cast,
  see the puppets up close and get to ask all your burning questions. After
  school on Monday, the Arts Discovery staff brings in a puppet from the show
  and introduces you to African drumming and dance classes that you weren’t even
  aware were available in your very own neighborhood.</p>



  <p>In an effort to increase access for youth participation in “formal” arts in
  Los Angeles, the CITYstage Arts Discovery Project would provide tickets and
  transportation for 50 LAUSD youth to attend 9 events (3 Theatre, 3 Dance, 3
  Music) for a total reach of 450 youth per year. The project would foster
  awareness and appreciation of LA’s rich cultural offerings, making
  professional performing art accessible for lowincome youth. According to a
  recent study by the Arts Education Partnership, even a small exposure can
  effectively result in longterm participation in the performing arts.</p>



  <p>In addition to arts “field trips,” the Arts Discovery Project would host
  free weekly community events, where art would be taught, learned, appreciated
  and shared. Fridays, from 68 p.m., LA residents would present art from their
  neighborhood and culture in an informal setting at Art Share LA. For example,
  dancers from Ballet Folklorico de Los Angeles might perform and instruct the
  audience in Mexico’s traditional dances.</p>



  <p>It’s Friday night. Female dancers appear in colorfully embroidered skirts
  that seem to spin and dance on their own. Live mariachi guitars and trumpets
  resound with joyful, energetic melodies. Men in traditional Mexican costume
  stomp out powerful, percussive dance steps that interweave with the music.
  Your pride as an Angeleno grows as you begin to realize the diverse cultural
  heritage of LA. The eyes of parents in the audience light up as the value of a
  traditional art is passed down to a new generation.</p>



  <p>With the Arts Discovery Project’s collaborative approach, we can impact the
  indicators identified by the Goldhirsh Foundation. Fieldtrips for 450 teens to
  attend professional arts performances will increase youth access to and
  participation in the arts, as well as fostering support and building a youth
  audience for formal art in the concert setting. Additionally, the project’s
  community events provide weekly opportunities for youth arts enrichment within
  their own neighborhood. Exposing our youth to a mix of formal and informal,
  institutional and community arts affords our students many points of entry to
  recruit, retain and train the next generation of artists and leaders in the LA
  arts scene.</p>
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  <p>Since our inception in 2010, CITYstage has served over 100 of LA’s atrisk
  middle and high school youth with tuitionfree performing arts instruction in
  the disciplines of dance, music and theatre. Our first pilot program at Manual
  Arts High School provided 25 students with free dance instruction and resulted
  in all program graduates going on to attend 4year universities, as well as
  continuing to pursue the arts. </p>






  <p>In 2012, we expanded our pilot program to include instruction in all three
  performing arts disciplines for 35 students at Dr. Maya Angelou Community High
  School. CITYstage also ensured highquality instruction by employing working
  professionals in the LA performing arts community. During an Arts Discovery
  pilot, 25 students were taken to a variety of events including youth standup
  comedy at The Improv, Hubbard Street Dance Chicago at the Ahmanson Theatre and
  music and dance performances at the Colburn School. </p>






  <p>Students who visited the Colburn School live in the shadow of Downtown LA,
  yet had never visited the cultural center of their own city — less than 3
  miles from home. They marveled at the sight of LA’s skyline; the discipline
  and training required to develop the ballet dancer physique and enjoyed the
  opportunity to apply their newfound knowledge of classical ballet positions in
  their discussion of the performance.</p>






  <p>In late 2012, CITYstage formed a partnership with All About Kids to serve
  50 additional children who are victims of domestic violence and abuse. With
  this partnership, mental health support was made a new priority for CITYstage.
  </p>






  <p>In a conscious effort to provide our youth with leadership opportunities,
  we have added a former graduate of the Manual Arts High CITYstage pilot
  program to our Board of Directors as the first Student Director. We believe
  that including students on our board empowers them to become the next
  generation of leaders and advocates of LA culture and art. The Student
  Director role also gives a powerful voice to our most important stakeholders —
  our students. We can only ensure the viability of our programs and build a
  lasting foundation for the arts if we actively listen to and address the needs
  of the communities we serve. </p>
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  CITYstage will create partnerships across the education, arts, business and
  nonprofit sectors. Art Share LA will provide theatre and rehearsal space for
  Arts Discovery events. To recruit youth participants, CITYstage will work with
  LAUSD middle and high school principals and faculty at the following schools:
  Audubon, Carver, Clinton, John Muir, Crenshaw, Dr. Maya Angelou, Manual Arts,
  Jefferson, Foshay Learning Center. We intend to partner with venues including:
  Music Center, The Pantages, Disney Concert Hall, Comedy Sportz, and Center
  Theatre Group. Corporate partners Goldstar Events, LA Weekly and ADVOC8 will
  be key to successful outreach. Collaborations with nonprofits KKJZ, KCRW, UCLA
  GSE&IS, will provide exposure and project support.
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  <p>A balanced evaluation of the CITYstage Arts Discovery Project would include
  meeting measurable objectives set by the CITYstage Board of Directors, as well
  as an external study and analysis by an accredited academic research
  organization to inform and improve learning opportunities and model change in
  education research, policy and practice.</p>






  <p>Measurable objectives include: </p>






  <p>450 innercity youth exposed to the professional LA arts scene through Arts
  Discovery field trips (50 youth per fieldtrip x 9 events = 450
  students/year)</p>






  <p>1,000 local residents and youth participating in performing arts in Arts
  Discovery community events (up to 50 weekly participants x 20 weeks of
  programming = 1,000 participants/year)</p>






  <p>CITYstage partnerships with at least 3 professional performing arts
  venues</p>






  <p>Partnerships with at least 4 LAUSD schools to continue Arts Discovery
  beyond year one</p>






  <p>In addition, CITYstage would perform an internal audit and survey of
  participants to evaluate learning and enrichment experience, with feedback and
  suggestions to improve future programming. </p>






  <p>A third party evaluation is necessary to fully assess the project and
  identify opportunities for improvement. CITYstage would seek a partnership
  with the UCLA Graduate School of Education and Information Studies Department
  of Education to conduct research and analysis of the project’s impact on
  students, families and schools. The UCLA GSE&IS Department of Education is an
  international leader in the study and practice of K16 urban education, student
  testing and assessment, teacher and continuing education and development 
  particularly in urban, multiethnic environments, and issues of access, equity,
  and quality. </p>






  <p>Data could be collected on whether local youth continue participating in
  the arts beyond the Arts Discovery field trip experience, and what impact the
  project has on academic performance, student retention rates and the pursuit
  of continued education. Alternately, participants might be interviewed about
  perceptions of community, race relations and future levels of interest in
  participating in the arts.</p>






  At the end of each year, CITYstage would formally review the project’s
  internal audit survey results alongside the findings and recommendations of
  UCLA GSE&IS. This combined evaluation would inform future plans for Arts
  Discovery to provide opportunities for community arts enrichment in LA. In
  addition to significantly enhancing the development of innercity youth and the
  underserved communities that they live in, and contributing to the body of
  academic work that strengthens support for artsrelated policy, our hope is
  that the Arts Discovery Project would become a model for successful arts
  enrichment programs in other metropolitan areas.
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
  A diversity of LA’s stakeholders stand to benefit from the CITYstage Arts
  Discovery Project including innercity youth, LAUSD schools, local artists,
  professional artists and venues, arts nonprofits and the local community.
  Below outlines the specific benefits each group would acquire along with a
  list of advantages gained from their participation.






  Innercity youth would gain: opportunities to participate in and contribute to
  the cultural landscape of LA; chances to explore and develop their creative
  mind; access to afterschool arts programs that provide safe and productive
  environments; pathways and possibilities for success in the future including
  higher education and careers in the arts and other creative industries.






  LAUSD middle and high schools would benefit from: outside resources to address
  the lack of comprehensive arts programming in public schools; improved
  academic achievement, student retention and graduation rates; solid research
  to build the case for lasting policy and curriculum change in support of the
  arts in schools.






  Local artists would gain: a venue for sharing their talent and art; a
  supportive space for experimentation, growth and development of their craft;
  free event marketing resources for greater visibility of upandcoming artists;
  financial support for their participation.






  Professional artists and arts venues would benefit in the following ways:
  growth of a new generation of young audience members to sustain future
  support; access to previously untapped markets (innercity youth and the
  underserved communities of LA); direct financial support to metropolitan
  arts/cultural venues with an additional 450 attendees per year; opportunities
  to make the “formal” concert arts more accessible to our youth in the form of
  discount group tickets, “talkbacks” with youth after performances,
  “sneakpeeks” into rehearsals, guest lectures, and artist workshops.






  Arts nonprofits would gain: opportunities to collaborate with other nonprofit
  arts providers that will strengthen youth arts programs across the county; a
  model for collaboration between local arts programs.






  The LA community, as a whole, will benefit from: weekly opportunities to
  participate in free classes and performances that celebrate the diversity of
  LA; a stronger business climate due to the growth of creative industries; a
  betterinformed, connected and engaged citizenry; the development of a more
  vibrant and inclusive arts community; a public mandate for greater arts
  support in schools and the community.






  In order to change the future of Los Angeles and further enrich the arts and
  cultural vitality of the city, projects like CITYstage Arts Discovery need to
  engage all members of our communityregardless of race, income or geography. It
  is through this inclusive approach that we will see continued growth into 2050
  and beyond, ensuring Los Angeles as a model and leader in sustained arts and
  cultural vitality. 


What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  <p>It’s 2050. You are 49 years old and have been teaching dance in the LAUSD
  for the past 26 years. You just finished teaching your 7th grade students the
  history of Alvin Ailey, an African American choreographer and activist who
  formed the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre over 90 years earlier. You are
  reminded of 6th grade when you took your fist CITYstage Arts Discovery “field
  trip” to see the Alvin Ailey company at the Music Center. The agility and
  grace of the dancers inspired you to try a dance class in your community. For
  the next 7 years, you attended classes at CITYstage and Lula Washington Dance
  Theatre and experienced breathtaking performances through the annual Arts
  Discovery “field trips.” You realize now that the introduction and continued
  exposure to the arts as a child helped you grow into the passionate, creative
  and dedicated teacher you are today. </p>






  <p>We believe that if we introduce resources like the CITYstage Arts Discovery
  Project in 2013, we can help develop and support the future artists and
  leaders of 2050. The ability to ignite creativity and passion in our youth,
  and to empower our citizens, organizations and policymakers is the key to
  sustaining a vibrant arts and cultural scene in our region.</p>






  <p>How would this specifically impact the artistic and cultural vitality of LA
  in 2050? If we start now, over the next 37 years CITYstage can provide a
  minimum of 16,576 of LA’s most atrisk teens opportunities to participate and
  contribute to LA’s vibrant arts landscape. 



  Using the inspiration, training and support provided by the Arts Discovery
  Project, we believe that a significant number of our youth will discover
  pathways out of poverty through careers as artists or in artsrelated fields
  such as education, artsbusiness or advocacy. </p>






  <p>With success and possibilities born from the arts, advocates will not leave
  their fate to chance, but will demand commonsense legislative support such as:
  creating comprehensive arts programs for LAUSD middle and high school
  students; earmarking funds for increased percapita arts spending; tax breaks
  to encourage film production in LA, and the like. The revitalization of the
  business of the arts is crucial to expanding the LA arts scene and realization
  of the city’s full potential as both an economic and a creative
  powerhouse.</p>






  <p>We believe in the power of innercity youth to shape the future of arts in
  Los Angeles. With this in mind, we will work toward a Los Angeles 2050 in
  which we nurture home grown artists and artsleaders to help maintain LA’s
  dominance as the leading US arts center for generations to come. Furthermore,
  securing a future in which a concentration of these artists and leaders are
  from the underserved communities of LA ensures that all Angelenos have access
  to the arts, regardless of race, income or geography.</p>
