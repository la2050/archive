  Tia Chuchas Centro Culturals Arts Transforms Community  A Multimedia Wellness
  Project
project_summary: >-
  The Northeast San Fernando Valley is a community of 500,000 – the size of the
  City of Oakland -- yet it had no bookstores, movie houses, art galleries, or
  full fledged cultural spaces until Tia Chucha's opened its doors twelve years
  ago. We now provide a bookstore, a deli/ artisan shop, arts workshops, an art
  gallery, film nights, weekly Open Mics, community dialogues, and author
  readings. In addition we host Young Warriors, a youth empowerment group, often
  working with troubled youth through mentors, rites of passage, and the arts as
  well as own poetry press, Tia Chucha Press, and the only outdoor annual
  literacy festival for the greater San Fernando Valley: “Celebrating Words:
  Written, Performed & Sung.” We have a Mexica (so-called Aztec) danza resident
  group, Temachtia Quetzalcoatl, officially sanctioned to teach and perform this
  art form from pre-conquest Mexico and Central America. Also since Tia Chucha's
  creation we've seen the birth of independent groups like El Hormiguero (the
  Anthill), Bikesanos Bike Club, the San Fernando Arts Collective, Youth Speak
  Collective's Sports, Mural, Gardening and Digital Arts projects, and the
  establishment of a new high school with academies in Social Justice and
  Humanities, the Arts as well as Engineering and Technology called the Cesar
  Chavez Learning Academies. Our presence in a mostly run-down strip mall with
  many uninhabited spaces has brought new small businesses and even a major
  market chain. Tia Chucha's has proven that the arts stimulates economic
  activity while helping reduce violence, apathy, and low school participation.

    We presently serve 14,000 children, teens, adults, and seniors a year at Tia
    Chucha's. Our staff has surveys on paper and from head counts. We also do
    analysis of all our workshops for content, form, and outcomes. Already in
    twelve years, we have seen higher school participation and the rise of
    imaginative ways to do the arts and projects like gardening, mural projects,
    activist collectives, and more. Our facilitators and instructors work with
    us to evaluate the growth of each participant in the arts and in the
    community. We also hold monthly Community Council Meetings open to the
    staff, facilitators/instructors, volunteers, and board members to evaluate
    and propose what we do at Tia Chucha's and how we can do better.
  Indicator: Arts & Cultural Vitality
  brief: "<p>Poor communities are usually portrayed as fonts of violence, stagnant thinking and deficit outcomes. But we at Tia Chucha's Centro Cultural see the poor as rich with talents, skills and imaginations. Every person, even without outside resources, is by nature regenerative. The concept behind arts-based healing workshops is to tap into and draw out this abundant capacity to establish healthy lives, families, and culture – even in a faltering economy. A new currency of restoring and transforming from one's own gifts opens up a new imagination of how to relate by giving and getting, with healing practices and disciplines. This is about renewing community rooted in caring and sharing.</p>\r\n<p>The objective is to get everyone to live out their passions, their innate story, the \"dream\" they were born with. These yearlong weekly workshops in 2013 will pull from this largely indigenous concept and set up the nexus where people are expressive in modern times. There is enough evidence and anecdotal illustrations of how the arts transform lives and communities.</p> \r\n<p>Presently we are held in the paralysis of a market driven scarcity society. Mortgages, the wage system, and money are man-made illusions that have blinded us to the true source of our liberation – the abundance in nature, in our imaginations, and in the proper relationships between our natures and the nature around us. The goal is to reclaim the personal authority and autonomy for every person so they can properly intertwine with and grow from community on a basis of cooperation.</p> \r\n<p>The Northeast San Fernando Valley is made up of indigenous rooted people, primarily from Mexico and Central America, with significant numbers of African Americans, Asians, and European Americans. The majority are Christians/Catholics; Arts Transforms Community workshops are not meant to challenge or change anyone's belief systems. Through the arts and imaginative practices, everything gets renewed and reaffirmed. Still we go back to indigenous sources of knowledge because of their perennial quality across time, places and circumstances.</p> \r\n<p>Our complex industrial world has disconnected us from these and many people are lost as a result. Our basic premise is that the healthy well-being of each is dependent on the healthy well-being of all – and the inverse: the healthy well-being of all is predicated on the healthy well-being of each. The goal of Tia Chucha's arts workshops – including music, dance, theater, writing, puppetry, photography, painting, and more – is to create a new basis for wellness with indicators and outcomes not clinical or bureaucratic.</p> \r\n<p>We aim to be the example that a whole community approach to addressing trauma and economic instability utilizes the arts to heal and revitalize. Tia Chucha's Centro Cultural & Bookstore has seen such possibilities whenever people are given spaces to learn, to create, and to deliver. We use a process of turning original ideas to execution with research/study, mentorship and organization. The arts are not just a “nice thing to do,” but vital to the new economy and digital world we are all entering. We need a new imagination – with new content and new forms – to align to the possibilities in this world.</p>"

    Los Angeles is called "the Entertainment Capital of the World." It has a
    creative economy that generates close to $4 billion in state tax revenues,
    employs a million people in Los Angeles and Orange counties, and accounts
    for $100 billion in sales/receipts in L.A. County alone. Yet there are whole
    areas, whole neighborhoods, often for miles on end, where there are no
    bookstores, no movie houses, no art galleries, no cultural spaces. These
    culturally barren sections include South Central L.A., East L.A., the
    Harbor, and the Northeast San Fernando Valley. The arts are concentrated in
    downtown, the shoreline, Hollywood, museum row, and such. We are not opposed
    to these vital tourist-laden centers of culture and commerce. But we need a
    neighborhood arts policy in Los Angeles so that every community can benefit
    from cultural store fronts, independent bookstores, public art projects
    including murals, workshops in all the arts, digital arts, and more. Tia
    Chucha's Centro Cultural's "Art Transforms Community" workshops prove this
    works in any neglected and resource-limited area of the city. Flavored by
    the people of the Northeast San Fernando Valley, Tia Chucha's is a model of
    how every community can have its own cultural wellness center -- they can
    name it for someone else's aunt if they wish. The point is that the arts are
    they key "log," the one stake that when moved opens up a logjam. The arts
    reach across ethnicity, race, religion, and culture. The arts are the
    unity-in-diversity that finds commonality and wholeness to one of the most
    divided and contentious cities in America.  
  collaborators: >-
    We presently facilitate arts workshops and the Young Warriors project with
    El Nido Family Resource Center in Pacoima, one of the poorest communities in
    Los Angeles County. We have partnered with Los Angeles Mission Community
    College in Sylmar to do our "Celebrating Words" festivals. We have done
    workshops and talks at the Barry Nidorf Juvenile Hall in Sylmar, the largest
    juvenile lockup in North America. We have conducted talks and workshops in
    Sylmar and San Fernando high schools, Discovery Prep Charter, the Cesar
    Chavez Learning Academies, the Maclay and Olive Vista middle schools, among
    others. And we have had about 10 schools from the L.A. area a year do field
    trips to Tia Chucha's to see first hand what we do. We plan to extend these.

    We effectively have no competition. Every organization working to reduce
    violence, poverty and alienation can be our partner. Our biggest obstacles
    are narrow and unimaginative ways of thinking. Tia Chucha's is presently
    located in the second-largest gang injunction in the state--almost ten
    square miles. This has been detrimental to working with and mentoring the
    most troubled youth. We work on transformative and restorative ways of
    giving back, of justice, of social change. This includes working with the
    probation department and gang intervention groups like Communities in
    Schools. It includes working to change such policies as drug-sniffing dogs
    and random searches of students in the high schools and replace these with
    rehabilitation, treatment and arts to address drug use and violence. The
    more imaginative and embracing we can be the better this is for everyone.
  vision: >-
    Everyone is laden with creativity, ideas and an abundance of talent.
    Liberating this will make 2050 a more peaceful, cooperative and thriving
    time. The future is moving toward integrality: How to integrate mind, body
    and soul in people, but also aligning the economy, politics, and culture to
    the regenerative power in such people and the regenerative capacity in
    nature. We will move away from the brokenness, alienation and fracturing
    that is prevalent in our time. The main direction is this--to become a
    complete human being means becoming a complete artist. Oppressive and
    exploitative conditions, which are rife in today's post industrial
    realities, are already being pushed away by the technological advancements
    and the intellectual/creative developments in our society. 2050 should see
    all this taken to its conclusion--a world where the common love of beauty
    and truth brings science and art into a unified whole. A time when people's
    passions becomes their professions, and working for others means working for
    oneself. This does not mean homogenizing everyone, but a true individuation
    that at the same time leads to the common development, rise and enrichment
    of all. If there were cultural spaces like Tia Chucha's everywhere, we can
    begin to see the building blocks of such a future, such possibilities, such
    an integral time and place.

How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  Los Angeles is called "the Entertainment Capital of the World." It has a
  creative economy that generates close to $4 billion in state tax revenues,
  employs a million people in Los Angeles and Orange counties, and accounts for
