  “Hey I’m Walking Here!”: A Campaign Celebrating Pedestrians in the City of Los
  Angeles 
project_summary: "\"The future of the city is walking. Redesigning our cities for walkers and walking will help make our cities places where people want to be. But it’s not something we consciously think about. So every time you’re out there walking I want you to think “Hey, I’m Walking Here!” — Alissa Walker, Journalist and Los Angeles Walks Steering Committee member, at WIRED 2012\r\n\r\nLast December, Alissa’s talk at the WIRED 2012 conference in London became a dinner table discussion at a Los Angeles Walks meeting. We laughed over the clip Alissa referenced from Midnight Cowboy where Dustin Hoffman yells “Hey, I’m Walking Here!” at a fast-moving car rolling into a New York City crosswalk: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c412hqucHKw But in all seriousness, shouting “Hey, I’m Walking Here” was far too representative of our own Los Angeles experience—a place where walking doesn’t get enough respect.\r\n\r\nWe found ourselves becoming inspired by other entertaining yet educational stunts that highlighted pedestrians, like a group of pedestrians that actually moved a car which had stopped in the middle of the crosswalk in Brazil: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=UqhUeDTAyYs Or Peatónito, who takes to the streets in Mexico City as the masked Mexican defender of pedestrians: http://m.theatlanticcities.com/commute/2013/02/if-only-every-city-had-masked-lucha-libre-defender-pedestrians/4804/ We realized we needed the same kind of cultural touchstone for Los Angeles: a movement bringing attention, safety and a bit of fun to walking to help build a healthier, more vibrant Los Angeles\r\n\r\nWalking is a “magic app” for creating a healthy city. As the most common type of physical activity, walking is an easy and effective way to improve fitness. It reduces body fat and bad cholesterol, cutting the risk of some of the leading causes of death in Los Angeles. Walking extends life—walking 75 minutes per week adds 1.8 years of life; walking 2.5 hours per week adds 7 years of life. Walking regularly also improves mood and reduces fatigue.\r\n\r\nThe benefits of walking reach beyond individual fitness to make communities into healthier places to live, work and play. Walking instead of driving, even for short car trips, decreases air pollution and reduces respiratory and cardiovascular ailments as well as some kinds of cancer. Car crashes are the leading cause of death for Angelenos under the age of 5 and the second-leading cause of death for children and young adults ages 5 to 24. Making the city safer for pedestrians can also make the city more equitable: Most pedestrian deaths in L.A. occur in low-income neighborhoods where many residents do not own cars. But the solution is not simply to get more people walking—it also requires that streets and sidewalks be redesigned to protect pedestrians from roadway traffic, slow down cars and trucks, and keep walkers feeling safe.\r\n\r\nWith these ideas in mind, Los Angeles Walks proposes to launch \"Hey, I'm Walking Here!\"  (or in Español, “¡Ay, Estoy Caminando!”)—a campaign which will not only increase pedestrian safety, but also highlight and celebrate walking as a conscious act that’s happening all over the city.  And by expanding upon our existing Los Angeles Walks work including awareness, events, community meetings and action, we’ll be able to support long-term efforts to build a more walkable Los Angeles by 2050.\r\n\r\nActivities funded through our “Hey, I’m Walking Here!” campaign will include:\r\n\r\n    Creating a bilingual “Hey, I’m Walking Here!”/ “¡Ay, Estoy Caminando!” publicity campaign using posters, stickers, public art, infographics and social media.\r\n\r\n    Authoring “Hey, I’m Walking Here!”/ “¡Ay, Estoy Caminando!” materials which will highlight the benefits of walking as a healthy and civic-minded action.\r\n\r\n    Convening community meetings in three neighborhoods where residents will assess the “good, bad and the ugly” for pedestrian activity, highlighting unsafe or unsavory walking environments to improve on the “Hey, I’m Walking Here” action days.\r\n\r\n    Organizing “Hey I’m Walking Here” action days where local communities will be empowered to make temporary, attention-getting improvements to local walking infrastructure (like a Parking Day focused on pedestrians).\r\n\r\n    Designing a pilot program for a pedestrian-focused urban wayfinding system that also serves as a publicity campaign throughout the city, to help Angelenos to understand the distance between neighborhoods and landmarks, and see that more places are walkable.\r\n\r\n    Holding regular group walks to underscore how walking is a fun way to explore the city and promote healthy lifestyles, where we will provide “Hey I’m Walking Here” materials.\r\n\r\n    Promoting pedestrian parades and events during CicLAvias (WalkLAvia) to make sure walkers have a  welcoming space when streets are closed to traffic.\r\n\r\n    Educating local residents about how to ask for higher-visibility crosswalks and lower speed limits on their streets (especially near schools).\r\n\r\n    "

  success: "Many Los Angeles residents already enjoy walking and are instinctively drawn to areas good for walking—places like parks, the beach and walkable commercial districts. But most Angelenos have not taken the next step to consider how their neighborhoods can become more walkable. Los Angeles Walks’ “Hey, I’m Walking Here!”  campaign is intended to tap into this latent desire to help Angelenos request more pedestrian amenities, build more vibrant communities, and elevate the act of walking in the City of Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nWe plan to work closely alongside existing community efforts, reaching thought leaders, policymakers, and media to help us outline key steps which will not only build safer and more accessible city, but a more fun place to walk as well.\r\n\r\nTo evaluate the immediate goals of our project, we will track the number of events and community forums that Los Angeles Walks holds and the number of participants in these events. We will also capture and quantify the different ways that the campaign shares its “Hey, I’m Walking Here!” message, and count how often campaign slogans and themes are picked up and references in news articles and interviews, like minded organizations, social media likes and shares, political and policy debates and other public forums.\r\n\r\nAnd will evaluate the campaign’s success in the short term by increased attention to walking. Over the long term the project can help improve metrics related to rates of walking, spending on pedestrian infrastructure, walkable land uses, and health outcomes.\r\n\r\nLos Angeles walks blogs regularly with updates on upcoming and past pedestrian-related events and news and produces a year-in-walking round-up of highlights. Comparing past updates with updates if this project is funded can help show whether there is an upsurge in interest in walking in LA, and Los Angeles Walks plans to participate in the Fall 2013 City of Los Angeles Bicycle and Pedestrian Count, led by the Los Angeles County Bicycle Coalition which helps establish much needed data and understanding of current travel patterns in the City.\r\n\r\nAt the same time as we track the strength of our messaging and participate in data collection, we will be laying the groundwork for analyzing longer term improvements in walking-related indicators. We will collect baseline data for rates of walking, funding for pedestrian programs and infrastructure, injuries and fatalities to pedestrians, staffing for pedestrian programs, and land zoned for mixed uses and/or with pedestrian overlays.

  description: "Los Angeles has incredible potential to become one of the world’s most walkable cities. Our mild climate is one obvious advantage, providing us with perfect walking weather almost every day of the year. Even our reputation for sprawl works to our advantage: Los Angeles developed as a series of small towns, meaning that there are multiple historic downtowns and commercial corridors that provide interesting places to walk. We also have the fastest-growing transit system in the United States, providing an extensive “walk extender” because it allows people to walk to a bus or train, take transit, then continue walking to destinations. New rail and bus rapid transit stops can evolve into walkable hubs that can allow more Angelenos to reduce driving or live without a car. Just raising the visibility of walking a little bit will have a tremendous impact with multiple co-benefits, and has potential to support a transformation the way the city thinks about walking and travels.\r\n\r\nThe Los Angeles region is also home to a health-conscious population and to many immigrants from countries with walkable cities where public space is valued. Certain demographic groups like young people and empty nesters of all backgrounds have been shown to be increasingly drawn to walkable neighborhoods. From street food to art walks to stair climbs, Los Angeles is slowly embracing walking as a key component of a great city.\r\n\r\nBut we shouldn't downplay the remaining challenges to creating a more walkable L.A. During the 20th century, Los Angeles was redesigned as a city for automobiles. Our streets were engineered to move as many cars and trucks as possible as fast as possible. Los Angeles was zoned to keep businesses away from homes, so new buildings were required to add parking. As a result, parking lots, driveways, strip malls and drive through restaurants carved up the city, creating barriers to safe, convenient and pleasant walks.\r\n\r\nAlthough the city and region are beginning to support transit, biking and walking, L.A. is still not a safe enough environment for pedestrians. Sidewalks are in a poor state of repair. Speed limits for cars are too high, and because roads and driving lanes are wide, many drivers speed even beyond the legal limit. There are not enough crosswalks. As a result, pedestrians in Los Angeles are disproportionately likely to be victims of fatal car crashes compared to national statistics. Approximately 100 pedestrians are killed each year in Los Angeles by hit-and-run drivers. Drivers who kill pedestrians often escape detection or are given light sentences, sending a message that that we care more about moving cars than we do about human life. Creating more awareness about walking and shifting L.A. to become a more walkable city will save lives through improved safety and extend and save and improve even more lives through the health benefits of a more physically active population.\r\n\r\nA pedestrian advocacy movement is overdue in Los Angeles, yet the timing c"

  vision: "By 2050, Los Angeles will be known globally as one of the best cities for walking in the world. The biggest change can be easily seen from the air: All of L.A.’s once-famous freeways have been removed, their multiple lanes of traffic replaced with extensive linear parks. Down the center of each of these parks are wide, green boulevards with clean energy rapid buses, protected cycling lanes and excellent walking paths. This network of “urban trails” connects each of L.A.’s neighborhoods so it’s completely possible to get nearly anywhere in the city on dedicated foot or bike infrastructure, although the extensive rail system is usually faster.  L.A. City overall health will be significantly improved with most citizens naturally getting in the public health reccomended minimum 10,000 steps a day as they go about their daily living, and collision rates for pedestrians and the city with drastically decrease. Drivers stop, with tender caution for pedestrians as they cross the street.  Hit n’ runs are a thing of the past. people take responsibility for their actions and realize that the guilt of running away from the scene of the crime is more harmful to them than owning up to their actions, and individuals will recognize the serious responsibility in their hands while as drivers.  90% of kids walk or bike to school as they attend quality schools close to where they live.  Walking Meetings will be a common occurence in the workplace.  And streetwalkers will come to take on a whole different meaning in Los Angeles.  A remake of “No One Walks in LA,” will be made with the title changed to “We all walk in LA” and mashed up to Randy Newman’s infamous “I Love LA”.  Mayor of Los Angeles will champion themselves as “Sidewalk Mayors” and other urban regions will look to Los Angeles with envy and questions for advice for how their neighborhoods can be as awesome as ours.\r\n\r\nAll neighborhoods in the city have been redesigned to be more walkable. A cultural shift has occurred and Angelenos in general choose to live close to where they work and shop. When they want to visit other parts of the city, people walk or bike to a rail station. Or they take a short walk to any commercial street to catch the frequent, convenient, attractive zero emissions buses which are the main form of motorized transportation in 2050. Although cars are still legal, all roads have tolls, surface parking lots are banned, speed limits are 10 mph in residential neighborhoods. Most people don’t own cars and those who do, rarely drive them.  Freeway capped park projects will pop up all over the city, reclaiming loved space that had been previously sacrificed.\r\n\r\nMore and more people walk in Los Angeles. The percentage of trips in Los Angeles taken on foot will have increased from 20 percent to 50 percent or more.  These shift into trips taken on foot will enjoy multiple co-benefits that will result in better air quality, reduced carbon emissions, and improved public health. The average resident wa"

  want you to think “Hey, I’m Walking Here!” — Alissa Walker, Journalist & Los
  Angeles Walks Steering Committee member, at WIRED 2012</p>



  <p>Last December, Alissa’s talk at the WIRED 2012 conference in London became
  a dinner table discussion at an LA Walks meeting. We laughed over the clip
  Alissa referenced from Midnight Cowboy where Dustin Hoffman yells “Hey, I’m
  Walking Here!” at a fastmoving car rolling into a New York City crosswalk:
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c412hqucHKw But in all seriousness, shouting
  “Hey, I’m Walking Here” was far too representative of our own LA experience—a
  place where walking doesn’t get enough respect. We found ourselves becoming
  inspired by other entertaining yet educational stunts that highlighted
  pedestrians, like a group of pedestrians that actually moved a car which had
  stopped in the middle of the crosswalk in Brazil:

  PeatÃ³nito, who takes to the streets in Mexico City as the masked Mexican
  defender of pedestrians:

  We realized we needed the same kind of cultural touchstone for LA: a movement
  bringing attention, safety & a bit of fun to walking to help build a
  healthier, more vibrant LA.</p>



  <p>The benefits of walking reach beyond individual fitness to make communities
  into healthier places to live, work & play. Walking instead of driving, even
  for short car trips, decreases air pollution & reduces respiratory &
  cardiovascular ailments as well as some kinds of cancer. Car crashes are the
  leading cause of death for Angelenos under the age of 5 & the secondleading
  cause of death for children & young adults ages 5 to 24. Making the city safer

  <p>But the solution is not simply to get more people walking—it also requires
  that streets & sidewalks be redesigned to protect pedestrians from roadway
  traffic, slow down cars & trucks, & keep walkers feeling safe. With these
  ideas in mind, LA Walks proposes to launch "Hey, I'm Walking Here!"  (or in

  <p>1. Creating a bilingual “Hey, I’m Walking Here!”/ “Â¡Ay, Estoy Caminando!”
  publicity campaign using posters, stickers, public art, infographics & social

  <p>2. Authoring “Hey, I’m Walking Here!”/ “Â¡Ay, Estoy Caminando!” materials
  which will highlight the benefits of walking as a healthy & civicminded
  action.</p>



  <p>3. Convening community meetings in three neighborhoods where residents will
  assess the “good, bad & the ugly” for pedestrian activity, highlighting unsafe
  or unsavory walking environments to improve on the “Hey, I’m Walking Here”
  action days.</p>



  <p>4. Organizing “Hey I’m Walking Here” action days where local communities
  will be empowered to make temporary, attentiongetting improvements to local
  walking infrastructure (like a Parking Day focused on pedestrians).</p>



  <p>5. Designing a pilot program for a pedestrianfocused, smartphonecompatible
  urban wayfinding system that also serves as a publicity campaign throughout
  the city, to help Angelenos to understand the distance between neighborhoods &
  landmarks, & see that more places are walkable.</p>



  <p>6. Holding regular group walks to underscore how walking is a fun way to
  explore the city & promote healthy lifestyles, where we will provide “Hey I’m
  Walking Here” materials.</p>



  <p>7. Promoting pedestrian parades & events during CicLAvias (WalkLAvia) to
  make sure walkers have a  welcoming space when streets are closed to
  traffic.</p>



  <p>8. Educating local residents about how to ask for highervisibility
  crosswalks & lower speed limits on their streets (especially near
  schools).</p>



  <p>9. Building partnerships & coalitions with organizations interested in
  public health, transportation, urban design, sustainability, equity &
  more.</p>



  <p>10. Increasing advocacy efforts with elected officials & decisionmakers to
  make LA more walkable, including addressing design & maintenance of
  sidewalks.</p>



  <p>11. Sending action alerts to the growing list of walking activists when
  there are opportunities to improve safety.</p>
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  <p>Deborah Murphy, a native Angeleno, founded Los Angeles Walks in 1998 after
  a key appointment as the Chair of the City of Los Angeles Pedestrian Advisory
  Committee, which she continues to hold today. Deborah has consistently worked
  to bring attention to the act of walking in the city of Los Angeles as a way
  to build a healthier, more livable city. For 15 years, Los Angeles Walks has
  been the goto organization for the press regarding pedestrian safety issues,
  appearing in media including KCRW, KCET, KPCC, LA Times, LA Weekly, Curbed LA,
  Streetsblog LA, LAist, Atlantic Cities and more.  </p>






  <p>Starting in the fall of 2011, Alexis Lantz, Jessica Meaney, Colleen
  Corcoran and Alissa Walker joined Deborah under the fiscal umbrella of the Los
  Angeles County Bicycle Coalition to launch a major grassroots efforts to
  increase awareness of walking in L.A. In 2012 the group expanded even more,
  adding My La, Karen Mack, Mark Vallianatos, Daveed Kapoor and Tilza Castillo
  to the Steering Committee.</p>






  <p>Key accomplishments include:</p>






  <p> Advocated for the City’s first Walkability Checklist that is used by City
  Planning Staff in their review of new development projects</p>



  <p> Organized the Great Hollywood Walkabout in 2006</p>



  <p> Organized the Great Glassell Park/Cypress Park Walkabout in 2007</p>



  <p> Organized the Downtown Pasadena Walkabout in 2008</p>



  <p> Part of the team that prepared the Nationally recognized Living Street
  Model Street Design Manual in 2011</p>



  <p> Part of the Green LA Coalition Living Streets Campaign</p>



  <p> Served on County of Los Angeles Pedestrian Safety Task Force



  <p> Advocated for 15 years for Continental Crosswalk installations in the City
  of Los Angeles</p>



  <p> Advocated for 20 years for the creation of the Pedestrian Coordinator
  positions, which were finally created in 2012</p>



  <p> Advocated with a coalition of Active Transportation advocates for a 5%
  setaside of Measure R Local Return funds for pedestrian projects and 5% for
  bicycle projects in the City of Los Angeles</p>



  <p> Advocated for pedestrian and bike safety projects in Silver Lake including
  a Road Diet for Rowena Avenue for six years, which was implemented in 2013</p>



  <p> Facilitated pedestrian safety charrettes in two Los Angeles neighborhoods:
  Silver Lake community in August 2012 and Leimert Park in November 2012</p>



  <p> Conducted pedestrianrelated events during CicLAvia including a WalkLAvia

Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  <p>We will evaluate the campaign’s success in the short term by demonstrating
  that walking is top of mind for Angelenos. Over the long term the campaign
  will measure several other metrics related to walking, like an increase in the
  number of Angelenos who walk, an increase in the amount of spending on
  pedestrian infrastructure, the addition of walkable land uses, and improved
  health for Angelenos.</p>






  <p>We will track the number of events and community forums that Los Angeles
  Walks holds and the number of participants in these events to see how many
  people we’re reaching through our message. We’ll also administer surveys at
  these events to see if our campaign changed the way people felt about
  walking.</p>






  <p>We will capture and quantify the different ways that the campaign shares
  its “Hey, I’m Walking Here!” message, and count how often campaign slogans and
  themes are picked up and references in news articles and interviews,
  likeminded organizations, social media likes and shares, political and policy
  debates and other public forums.</p>






  <p>We will also use data collection to measure an increase in pedestrian
  activity. Los Angeles Walks plans to participate in the Fall 2013 City of Los
  Angeles Bicycle and Pedestrian Count led by the Los Angeles County Bicycle
  Coalition, which helps establish muchneeded data about how many people are
  walking and provides a better understanding of current travel patterns in the
  city.</p>






  <p>We will track local and online sentiment for walking and pedestrian
  advocacy. Los Angeles Walks blogs regularly with updates on upcoming
  pedestrianrelated events and news and produces a yearinwalking roundup of
  highlights. Comparing past updates to next year’s yearinwalking report can
  help show whether there is an upsurge in interest in walking in L.A.</p>






  <p>We will work with local public health organizations to learn if more
  Angelenos are walking for exercise or for transportation, and compare this to
  health data from previous years to see if walking is making an impact in the
  overall health of the city.</p>






  <p>As we track the strength of our messaging and participate in data
  collection, we will be laying the groundwork for analyzing longer term
  improvements in walkingrelated indicators. We will collect baseline data for
  rates of walking, funding for pedestrian programs and infrastructure, injuries
  and fatalities to pedestrians, staffing for pedestrian programs, and land
  zoned for mixed uses and/or with pedestrian overlays.</p>






  <p>We plan to work closely alongside existing community efforts, reaching
  thought leaders, policymakers, and media to help us outline key steps which
  will not only build safer and more accessible city, but a more fun place to
  walk as well.</p>
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  As the most common type of physical activity, walking is an easy and effective
  way to improve fitness. It reduces body fat and bad cholesterol, cutting the
  risk of some of the leading causes of death in Los Angeles. Walking extends
  life—walking 75 minutes per week adds 1.8 years of life; walking 2.5 hours per
  week adds 7 years of life. Walking regularly also improves mood and reduces
  fatigue.






  And these health benefits can also lead to larger social change. Walking
  increases our contact with our neighbors, builds social capital and civic
  awareness and puts more eyes on the street to reduce crime. In a city like
  L.A. with a diverse population but a history of social inequality and
  residential segregation, walking also allows people to explore new
  neighborhoods and can help reduce barriers of class, race, language and
  location.






  Walking also brings significant economic benefits. In other cities, studies
  show that streets that have received pedestrian improvements such as street
  porches, pedestrian plazas and traffic calming have often found a boost in
  sales. Property values are also higher in walkable neighborhoods than in
  comparable sprawling places. As living in a walkable area becomes more
  desirable, walkable cities have an easier time attracting businesses and
  people with ideas for starting new businesses.






  Despite what some ‘80s pop songs might say, Los Angeles has incredible
  potential to become one of the world’s most walkable cities. Even our
  reputation for sprawl works to our advantage: Los Angeles developed as a
  series of of neighborhoods connected by an interurban rail system, meaning
  that there are multiple historic downtowns and commercial corridors that
  provide interesting places to walk. We also have the fastestgrowing transit
  system in the United States, a “walk extender” because it allows people to
  walk to a bus or train, take transit, then continue walking to destinations.






  A pedestrian advocacy movement is overdue in Los Angeles, yet the timing could
  not be better. The City has not addressed the funding and maintenance of its
  sidewalks in a comprehensive manner since the 1970s, but there is growing
  interest from the City and residents to change this. In the Fall of 2012, the
  City of Los Angeles hired its firstever pedestrian staff as a result of
  leadership and advocacy from groups such as Los Angeles Walks. Walking events
  like the Great Los Angeles Walk, Big Parade and Secret Stairs have steadily
  increased in numbers over the last few years. And in the past year the local
  press have covered more walkingrelated stories, from Christopher Hawthorne’s
  recent series on L.A. boulevards in the Los Angeles Times to the LA Weekly’s
  focus on hitandrun collisions.






  In a city where less than 20% of all trips are taken on foot or bike, we
  believe that even a small increase in awareness around the benefits of walking
  will have a dramatic impact across the city. We believe our campaign is
  perfectly timed to build upon this momentum.
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  <p>By 2050, Los Angeles will be known globally as one of the best cities for
  walking in the world. The biggest change can be easily seen from the air: All
  of L.A.’s oncefamous freeways have been removed or capped with parks, their
  multiple lanes of traffic replaced with extensive linear parks. Down the
  center of each of these parks are wide bus boulevards, protected cycling lanes
  and excellent walking paths. This network of “urban trails” connects each of
  L.A.’s neighborhoods so it’s completely possible to get nearly anywhere in the
  city on dedicated foot or bike infrastructure, although the comprehensive rail
  system (once again the largest in the country) is usually faster.  </p>






  <p>The other notable transformation can be seen at the neighborhood level. A
  cultural shift has occurred throughout the city and Angelenos in general
  choose to live close to where they work or cowork, with more than half of
  Angelenos working from home. When they need to visit other parts of the city
  to shop, eat or play, people generally walk or bike to a rail station or a bus
  boulevard, where they can catch a train or the frequent, convenient,
  attractive zeroemissions buses which are the main form of motorized
  transportation in 2050. Education has improved as well, with 90% of kids
  walking or biking to school as they attend quality schools close to where they
  live. Although cars are still legal, driving is not efficient since all roads
  have tolls, surface parking lots are banned, and speed limits are 15 m.p.h. in
  residential neighborhoods. Most people don’t own cars, and those who do
  usually only drive them as a hobby, since they’re relics of a bygone era.</p>






  <p>But perhaps the most important change to the city in 2050 is that the
  health of its residents has dramatically improved since the early 2000’s. Most
  Angelenos naturally take the Surgeon General’s recommended minimum 10,000
  steps a day, so Angelenos live longer and enjoy healthier lives. The
  percentage of trips in Los Angeles taken on foot, bike or transit will have
  increased from 20 percent to 95 percent. These shift into trips taken on foot
  result in better air quality, reduced carbon emissions, and improved public
  health. Rates of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular and respiratory illness are
  significantly lower. Plus collision rates for pedestrians have been reduced to
  practically zero.</p>






  <p>Because all neighborhoods are good places to walk, health disparities
  between ethnic groups and different parts of the city have been dramatically
  reduced. Families with children can live nearly anywhere in the city and be
  connected to their community. More importantly, our growing population can
  move to dense parts of the city to age in place without a loss of
