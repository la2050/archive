title: 36 Hours in L.A. 2050
project_summary: "Many exceptional thinkers have observed, “you need to picture your idea before you can achieve it.\"  With 36 Hours in L.A. 2050, ForYourArt pairs artists and urban visionaries together to imagine stops along a 36-hour itinerary in L.A. circa 2050. Through a series of roving conferences and an exhibition, 36 Hours in L.A. 2050 culminates in a future-forecast map stimulating thinking and creating new possibilities for our collective future.\r\n\r\n\r\nInternational arts figures will be invited to participate, broadening the reach of this conversation and integrating their perspectives to reflect the international nature of our city. \r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally, building upon the conversation started by LA2050, 36 Hours in L.A. 2050 will utilize LA2050’s eight well-defined success indicators as a touch point in discussions leading up to and during the roving summits. \r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the 2012 Otis Report on the Creative Economy of the Los Angeles Region, 1 out of 8 regional jobs is in the creative economy.  Imagine a Los Angeles in 2050 where 1 out 3 regional jobs is in the creative economy and this sector moves from the 4th to 1st largest employment cluster including an even more flourishing artist sector.  Likewise, the Goldhirsh Foundation’s LA2050 report that sites that L.A. ranks near the bottom of large U.S. cities for volunteerism.  Imagine a Los Angeles in 2050 where everywhere is a creative context and we have at least double social connectedness from 21.5 to 43 percent -- deeply increasing our civic and social engagement.  \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat would our Los Angeles look like and how would an Angeleno or someone visiting spend 36 hours in the city in 2050? \r\n\r\n\r\n36 Hours in L.A. 2050 creates a cross-disciplinary and participatory platform for visioning LA2050’s arts and cultural indicator and what everyday life will look like in L.A. 2050.  Specifically, utilizing an April 3, 1988 Los Angeles Times Magazine’s 25-year look ahead to 2013 article as a reference point, the project will future forecast art centric visions of L.A. 2050 through an exploration with artists, architects, creatives, thought leaders, institutions and more, answering these questions:\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2050: What kinds of new creative economy jobs exist? What ethical shifts will have taken place? What does an “artist” do?\r\nWhat new landmarks will we have?What new kinds of organizations will we have? What will arts organizations look like? How will Angelenos spend their time in a 24-hour day? How might arts organizations evolve as part of this growing ecosystem? How will arts and culture spur civic connections and engagement? What does L.A. as an arts and cultural capital look like?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe future forecast information collection will be multifold and will include roving talks and presentations taking place at 3-4 venues across L.A. -- all over the course of 36 hours.  Conversations will be documented and inform an exhibition at ForYourArt at 6020 Wilshire Blvd.  Through an invitational and open call process, artists, architects and others will be invited to exhibit their artwork, their ideas or concepts for “36 hours in L.A. 2050”.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conversations and exhibition are followed by a publication, MAP: ForYourArt L.A. 2050.  The overall activities and vision of 36 Hours  in L.A. 2050 will be captured in this “future map” that looks 37 years ahead to 2050.  The map will include an invitation to meet up at an L.A. landmark in 2050 on a certain day and a 36-hour 2050 itinerary.  ForYourArt will also utilize its platforms and partners to stimulate conversations around the forecasting and to further engage participation.\r\n\r\n"

  about_you: Los Angeles
  Does your project impact Los Angeles County?: 'yes'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >+
  <p>Many exceptional thinkers have observed, “you need to picture your idea
  before you can achieve it."  With <em>36 Hours in L.A. 2050</em>, ForYourArt
  pairs artists and urban visionaries together to imagine stops along a 36hour
  itinerary in L.A. circa 2050. Through a series of roving conferences and an
  exhibition, <em>36 Hours in L.A. 2050</em> culminates in a futureforecast map
  stimulating thinking and creating new possibilities for our collective
  future.</p>






  <p>International arts figures will be invited to participate, broadening the
  reach of this conversation and integrating their perspectives to reflect the
  international nature of our city. </p>






  <p>Additionally, building upon the conversation started by LA2050, <em>36
  Hours in L.A. 2050</em> will utilize LA2050’s eight welldefined success
  indicators as a touch point in discussions leading up to and during the roving
  summits.</p>






  <p>According to the <em>2012 Otis Report on the Creative Economy of the Los
  Angeles Region</em>, 1 out of 8 regional jobs is in the creative economy. 
  Imagine a Los Angeles in 2050 where 1 out 3 regional jobs is in the creative
  economy and this sector moves from the 4th to 1st largest employment cluster
  including an even more flourishing artist sector.  Likewise, the Goldhirsh
  Foundation’s <em>LA2050 Report </em>that sites that L.A. ranks near the bottom
  of large U.S. cities for volunteerism.  Imagine a Los Angeles in 2050 where
  everywhere is a creative context and we have at least double social
  connectedness from 21.5 to 43 percent  deeply increasing our civic and social
  engagement.</p> 






  <p>What would our Los Angeles look like and how would an Angeleno or someone
  visiting spend 36 hours in the city in 2050?</p>






  <p><em>36 Hours in L.A. 2050</em> creates a crossdisciplinary and
  participatory platform for visioning LA2050’s arts and cultural indicator and
  what everyday life will look like in L.A. 2050.  Specifically, utilizing an
  April 3, 1988 <em>Los Angeles Times Magazine’s</em> 25year look ahead to 2013
  article as a reference point, the project will future forecast art centric
  visions of L.A. 2050 through an exploration with artists, architects,
  creatives, thought leaders, institutions and more, answering these questions:
  </p>






  <p><em>In 2050:</em> What kinds of new creative economy jobs exist? What
  ethical shifts will have taken place? What does an “artist” do? What new
  landmarks will we have? What new kinds of organizations will we have? What
  will arts organizations look like? How will Angelenos spend their time in a
  24hour day? How might arts organizations evolve as part of this growing
  ecosystem?  How will arts and culture spur civic connections and engagement?
  What does L.A. as an arts and cultural capital look like? </p>






  <p>The future forecast information collection will be multifold and will
  include roving talks and presentations taking place at 34 venues across L.A. 
  all over the course of 36 hours.  Conversations will be documented and inform
  an exhibition at ForYourArt at 6020 Wilshire Blvd.  Through an invitational
  and open call process, artists, architects and others will be invited to
  exhibit their artwork, their ideas or concepts for “36 hours in L.A.
  2050.”</p>






  <p>The conversations and exhibition are followed by a publication, <em>MAP:
  ForYourArt L.A. 2050</em>.  The overall activities and vision of <em>36 Hours 
  in L.A. 2050</em> will be captured in this “future map” that looks 37 years
  ahead to 2050.  The map will include an invitation to meet up at an L.A.
  landmark in 2050 on a certain day and a 36hour 2050 itinerary.  ForYourArt
  will also utilize its platforms and partners to stimulate conversations around
  the forecasting and to further engage participation. </p>
