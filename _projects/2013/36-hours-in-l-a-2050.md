title: 36 Hours in L.A. 2050
indicator: Arts & Cultural Vitality
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >+
  <p>Many exceptional thinkers have observed, “you need to picture your idea
  before you can achieve it."  With <em>36 Hours in L.A. 2050</em>, ForYourArt
  pairs artists and urban visionaries together to imagine stops along a 36hour
  itinerary in L.A. circa 2050. Through a series of roving conferences and an
  exhibition, <em>36 Hours in L.A. 2050</em> culminates in a futureforecast map
  stimulating thinking and creating new possibilities for our collective
  future.</p>






  <p>International arts figures will be invited to participate, broadening the
  reach of this conversation and integrating their perspectives to reflect the
  international nature of our city. </p>






  <p>Additionally, building upon the conversation started by LA2050, <em>36
  Hours in L.A. 2050</em> will utilize LA2050’s eight welldefined success
  indicators as a touch point in discussions leading up to and during the roving
  summits.</p>






  <p>According to the <em>2012 Otis Report on the Creative Economy of the Los
  Angeles Region</em>, 1 out of 8 regional jobs is in the creative economy. 
  Imagine a Los Angeles in 2050 where 1 out 3 regional jobs is in the creative
  economy and this sector moves from the 4th to 1st largest employment cluster
  including an even more flourishing artist sector.  Likewise, the Goldhirsh
  Foundation’s <em>LA2050 Report </em>that sites that L.A. ranks near the bottom
  of large U.S. cities for volunteerism.  Imagine a Los Angeles in 2050 where
  everywhere is a creative context and we have at least double social
  connectedness from 21.5 to 43 percent  deeply increasing our civic and social
  engagement.</p> 






  <p>What would our Los Angeles look like and how would an Angeleno or someone
  visiting spend 36 hours in the city in 2050?</p>






  <p><em>36 Hours in L.A. 2050</em> creates a crossdisciplinary and
  participatory platform for visioning LA2050’s arts and cultural indicator and
  what everyday life will look like in L.A. 2050.  Specifically, utilizing an
  April 3, 1988 <em>Los Angeles Times Magazine’s</em> 25year look ahead to 2013
  article as a reference point, the project will future forecast art centric
  visions of L.A. 2050 through an exploration with artists, architects,
  creatives, thought leaders, institutions and more, answering these questions:
  </p>






  <p><em>In 2050:</em> What kinds of new creative economy jobs exist? What
  ethical shifts will have taken place? What does an “artist” do? What new
  landmarks will we have? What new kinds of organizations will we have? What
  will arts organizations look like? How will Angelenos spend their time in a
  24hour day? How might arts organizations evolve as part of this growing
  ecosystem?  How will arts and culture spur civic connections and engagement?
  What does L.A. as an arts and cultural capital look like? </p>






  <p>The future forecast information collection will be multifold and will
  include roving talks and presentations taking place at 34 venues across L.A. 
  all over the course of 36 hours.  Conversations will be documented and inform
  an exhibition at ForYourArt at 6020 Wilshire Blvd.  Through an invitational
  and open call process, artists, architects and others will be invited to
  exhibit their artwork, their ideas or concepts for “36 hours in L.A.
  2050.”</p>






  <p>The conversations and exhibition are followed by a publication, <em>MAP:
  ForYourArt L.A. 2050</em>.  The overall activities and vision of <em>36 Hours 
  in L.A. 2050</em> will be captured in this “future map” that looks 37 years
  ahead to 2050.  The map will include an invitation to meet up at an L.A.
  landmark in 2050 on a certain day and a 36hour 2050 itinerary.  ForYourArt
  will also utilize its platforms and partners to stimulate conversations around
  the forecasting and to further engage participation. </p>


What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >+
  <p>ForYourArt creates new contexts for art on and offline and applies an
  entrepreneurial spirit to producing and distributing artists’ work. ForYourArt
  experiments with a range of activities in its 6020 Wilshire Blvd. space that
  fall in between the nonprofit and the commercial sectors  generating patronage
  through conversations, popup shops, creative interventions, artist initiatives
  and family activities. </p>






  <p>ForYourArt has worked on significant projects including The Getty’s
  <em>Pacific Standard Time</em>, and the Hans Ulrich Obrist’s <em>The NOW
  Interviews</em> at the Venice Architecture Biennale, featuring interviews with
  leading artists, architects and urban planners by the celebrated curator.
  ForYourArt has published art maps for Los Angeles, New York, Miami and Chicago
  and developed an iPad app with artist John Baldessari. </p>






  <p>ForYourArt also organized the public art component for <em>Arts
  Matter</em>, a first of its kind, citywide public art exhibition and
  fundraising campaign to support arts education in the nation’s second largest
  public school system. Presented by the Los Angeles Fund for Public Education
  (LA Fund) and the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), <em>Arts
  Matter</em> addresses the importance of arts education in Los Angeles public
  schools, the “creative capital of the world.” Artists Barbara Kruger and John
  Baldessari created public art works that were presented on city buses and
  other outdoor media all across the greater metro area.</p>


Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  For <em>36 Hours in L.A. 2050</em>, the anticipated partners and collaborators
  are many including Los Angeles art and architecture schools, arts
  organizations, museums, artist, architects, urban planners, arts and service
  nonprofits as well as many business and technology entities and their
  innovators.  
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >+
  <p>Success will be measured through the strength of the visions presented for
  places and experiences.  <em>36 Hours in L.A. 2050</em> will be an opportunity
  to deepen engaged networks around these common visions for success in the
  future, and spread these ideas about Los Angeles internationally. </p>






  <p>Illuminating summits, an exhibition, and a map and its contents will be the
  results of this project.  Along with the field, these activities will provide
  new access points for the public to participate in the conversation, be
  inspired and emotionally connected to L.A.’s arts and cultural community of
  the future. </p>






  <p>ForYourArt is also a platform to explore new business models and ways for
  artists and institutions to monetize their value independent of the existing
  arts marketplace, which functions successfully for fine art.  As we imagine
  every artist as an entrepreneur, too, in L.A. 2050, this project also seeks to
  explore future art practices.</p>


How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
  <p>By creating an independent space for thinking about what ‘36 hours in L.A.
  2050’ will look like in the future, the project will generate concrete visions
  around places and experiences that reflect ideas, conversation and
  collaborations towards a general consciousness of L.A. in 2050. </p>






  <p>Whatever unfolds here continues to heighten L.A. as a leading cultural arts
  capital and spurs new inventions.  </p>


What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  Success in the year 2050 would have many embodiments including: increased art
  and cultural patronage for institutions and artists; free museum admissions
  across the city; access to quality, sequential arts education for all public
  K12 students; healthy, wellfunded government cultural agencies providing
  grants to nonprofits and artists; spaces and programs that support artist as
  entrepreneur and social practitioner; deep civic and social engagement
  including robust board governance, artists serving on public commissions, etc;
  easy use of public transportation to get to and from event venues, and more.
  Additionally, public policies that support: artists/creative live/work spaces,
  affordable artist housing, temporary and public art programs; engaging spaces;
  innovation in architecture for public buildings, more open space, incubator
  programs, etc.
