title: Dear Los Angeles
indicator: ' Social Connectedness'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >+
  "Dear Los Angeles" is a social media promotional network designed to get
  citizens of L.A. engaged in their society.  Creating videos and podcast
  content similar to the models forged by TedTalks and NPR, we plan on creating
  three brands that will engage citizens of Los Angeles in order to encourage
  political awareness, community involvement, and adult education opportunities:






  Dear Los Angeles  Our flagship brand focusing on great things about Los
  Angeles, and great people who love Los Angeles.  Shining a spotlight on young
  volunteers, local innovators, local businesses, and local political
  initiatives, the goal of this project is designed to encourage and excite
  people about how they can make a difference in their local community.  Weekly
  videos will update participants on what's going on in the city, and how they
  can be a part of movements that will improve their living conditions.






  The Producer's Lounge  Focusing on the multibillion dollar film & TV industry
  that many flock to L.A. for, this weekly audio podcast will focus on practical
  nuts and bolts of the entertainment industry, and how people can advance their
  careers and their financial stability within this field.  With financial
  stability, comes an increase in security, and an increase in long term
  community investment.






  DEKIT  Partnering with an already established magazine published out of New
  York, DEKIT (http://dekitdekit.com/), weekly videos will focus on young
  creators and emerging artistic influences in Los Angeles.  Part of the Dear
  Los Angeles/Dekit videos focus will be on young artists, in order to reach out
  to students, particularly middle school students.  






  All these pieces of content combined will tell the many varied stories of this
  very complex city.


What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >+
  None.  






  Our organization has not published anything public yet.  I conceived this idea
  about three months ago after talking with the CEO of Dekit Magazine.  If I
  were to receive this grant, I could have the website and social media channels
  up and running in less than a month, and weekly episodes for all 3 brands out
  in less than two months. 






  I can tell you that as an individual, I have line produced two feature films,
  one of which was acquired and released by Lionsgate (you can view my resume on
  IMDB at http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1336027/).  I have become a member of the
  Producer's Guild of America, and I partnered with others on two separate
  internet media companies, and while they fell short of expectations, I have
  learned from their mistakes.


Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >+
  After living in Los Angeles for over a decade, I have a large address book of
  contacts in industry, education, and politics.  I will utilize these contacts
  to build content on growing movements, and events that are affecting the
  greater Los Angeles metro area, and will continue to affect it for decades to
  come. 






  In addition to my own personal relationships, I have formed a partnership with
  the aforementioned Dekit magazine (http://dekitdekit.com/) based out of New
  York, and we will be capitalizing on crosspromotional opportunities, as well
  as brand sharing, in order to gain as large an audience as possible.   


Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >+
  This is one of the key indicators that will set Dear Los Angeles apart from
  other online media outlets.  Many organizations which broadcast information
  online measure their success by subscribers, sponsorship revenue, and Likes on
  their FaceBook page.  






  While this will be an important indicator for us, our real measure of success
  will be offline activity.  How many people will volunteer for a neighborhood
  improvement project after seeing our content?  How many people will
  investigate a new artist or artistic movement after viewing our coverage?






  Our measure of success is more than just views; it's our followthrough rate,
  which can be measured through website analytics and clickthroughs to other
  L.A. based organizations, and attendance at important L.A. events.  These can
  be traced through metrics following clickthroughs to tracking pages on our
  website, and seeing how many of these click through then proceed to our
  partners’ websites.


How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
  I've lived in Los Angeles for 12 years, first moving here from Connecticut to
  attend film school at USC.  Since then, I've seen many people move here and
  leave, and become angry and agitated about Los Angeles.  They viewed it as a
  city with no art, no connectedness, and no real opportunities.  However, the
  reason I love L.A. and have stayed here for so long is because of the art, the
  culture, and the limitless potential I find here.  I've received and witnessed
  endless opportunities, and I want to convey that to the people around me.  






  By conveying that excitement, we will mobilize hundreds of people across the
  greater metro area to get involved in beautification projects and voter
  initiatives.  We can motivate people to volunteer as a social activity, as
  well as an important lifelong goal.  We hope to engage in early outreach, in
  order to get ahead of the trends and the important movements, instead of just
  following them.  


What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >+
  In 2050, the Dear Los Angeles brand and organization will branch out using
  advancing forms of technology to bring Los Angelinos together.  






  If we can combine local resources to alleviate local problems, then we can
  make a difference in this city for the better.  By 2050, Dear Los Angeles will
  be responsible for increasing local volunteer work for neighborhood
  improvement threefold.  Currently 25% of Los Angeles residents rate their
  communities s fair or poor (California Community Foundation), but by 2050,
  Dear L.A. initiatives will help bring that number down to single digits, and
  make people excited to live in L.A. again.  Dear Los Angeles will focus on
  informing Los Angelinos on important local political matters, and on their
  political options.  






  This invites and empowers new residents of Los Angeles to take part in their
  city, accelerating the acclamation process, and as a result encourages trust
  in their neighbors, and increases the knowledge and resources they need about
  their social and civic institutions.
