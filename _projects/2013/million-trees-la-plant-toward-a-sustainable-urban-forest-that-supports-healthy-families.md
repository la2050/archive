  Organization Name: 'Million Trees LA, a project of Community Partners'
  Indicator: ' Environmental Quality'
  brief: "Million Trees LA (MTLA) is a citywide initiative launched in September 2006 by Mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa. MTLA is a collaborative effort of the City of Los Angeles, community groups, businesses and individuals, working together to plant and provide long-term stewardship of LA’s urban forest. Trees provide shade and save on energy costs, clean the air and help reduce green house gases that cause global warming, capture polluted urban runoff, improve water quality and add beauty to our neighborhoods.\r\n\r\n\r\nMillion Trees LA would like to have a series of fruit tree adoptions with a focus on food deserts and deliver fruit trees to people who live or own property within the City of Los Angeles. A fruit tree adoption is where tress are available for free to be planted on residential properties and people are provided information on to plant and care for trees. People adopt a tree and pledge to plant it on their private property. In addition to the environmental benefits of fruit trees, such as improving air quality, fruit trees give people access to healthy food that they grow. \r\n\r\nIt is important for everyone to have access to healthy food options, such as fruit. People’s geographic area should not prevent them from having fresh, healthy food. By providing fruit trees in the City of Los Angeles, including food deserts, we are giving people the opportunity to improve their health and help the environment. \r\n\r\nGiving away fruit trees either at fruit trees adoptions or by delivering the fruit trees to residential properties for planting, gives people access to fresh, healthy foods while planting a tree that will reduce greenhouse gases, help them save energy by providing shade and capture storm water to replenish groundwater tables. Locally grown food also reduces any pollution emitted by the transportation of fruit from far away places. This will also provide people with the ability to add green space where they live. \r\n\r\nThere are also social benefits provided by trees. More than 8% of children in Los Angeles-217,000- suffer from asthma. Studies have shown that an increase in tree-lined streets could lower that number by 25%. Research presented at the American Association for the Advancement of Science Conference in Chicago showed that the presence of trees could cut crime by as much as 7%. \r\n\r\nSpecific Activities:\r\n(1)\tMTLA will work with our partners to coordinate and host a series of fruit tree adoptions and to manage the delivery of the fruit trees to private property located in the City of Los Angeles \r\n(2)\tMTLA will work with our partners and community organizations to conduct community outreach and inform people of the availability of the free fruit trees.\r\n(3)\tMTLA will conduct outreach to community organizations and businesses to secure sites to do the fruit tree adoptions, focusing on food deserts.\r\n(4)\t Door to door canvassing before the fruit tree adoption will take place in the geographic area around the fruit tree adoption site.\r\n(5)\tOur goal is to adopt or deliver to homes 1000 (5 gallon) fruit trees.\r\n(6)\tIn order to adopt 1000 fruit trees we will need to have 5 fruit tree adoptions. The adoptions would take place during the June 2013-December 2013 grant period. \r\n(7)\t5 gallon fruit trees will made available for MTLA’s Residential Tree Program, so residents of the City of Los Angeles can obtain free fruit trees to be planted on their private property. The tree will be delivered to them with the instructions and the materials needed to plant the tree. \r\n\r\nMillion Trees LA is currently able to deliver free shade trees to people who live or own property in the City of Los Angeles through our Residential Tree Program. With the support of this grant we can expand the Residential Tree Program to include fruit trees and have fruit tree adoptions focused in food deserts in the City of Los Angeles. This will give people access to healthy foods and reduce their energy costs. \r\n"
  budget explanation: "Cost of the Fruit Trees: The price for fruit trees varies between $15-$25. This budget reflects a project of 1000 trees at $25. If we are able to obtain trees for $15 a tree then our project will be contain more trees. \r\n\r\nDelivery, coordination, ordering, indexing: The fruit trees will be ordered by our partner/contractor who receives the trees into the nursery. Million Trees LA will contract with non-governmental organization planting partners, who will receive funds for coordinating and indexing of trees. They will also maintain the trees until the date of adoption or residential delivery. This provides our partners with the opportunity to hire for green jobs.\r\n\r\nDelivery of tree and materials for tree adoption or residential program: This budget reflects the cost to deliver the trees to the site of the fruit tree adoption and to residential properties. \r\n\r\nMaterials for trees: In order to properly plant a tree, materials are needed. These materials include stakes, ties, and fertilizer tablets, which will be provided to the individual adopting the tree.\r\n\r\nCanvassing: This budget reflects the cost of a 5 person team who will do door-to-door canvassing to inform people who live near the adoption site when the fruit tree adoption will be taking place. This is another way we are creating green jobs.\r\n\r\nGrant Management & Administration: 9% reflects Million Trees LA’s fiscal agent’s fee to administer this grant.\r\n\r\nProject Management & Administration: Budget also reflects the following: staff time for coordinating with sites for the fruit tree adoptions and processing tree requests; production of materials that will inform people how to plant a tree and educate them on the benefits of trees; office supplies or other items that will be necessary for the successful completion of this project.  \r\n\r\nItem\t                        Unit\t             Unit Cost\t             Qty\t          Total\r\nFruit Trees                     1\t                    $25\t               1000\t $25,000.00\r\nDelivery,                   \r\ncoordination, \r\nordering, etc                per tree\t            $25\t               1000\t$25,000.00\r\nDelivery of \r\ntree and materials      per tree\t             $21              \t1000\t$21,000.00\r\n\r\nMaterials for trees\tper tree\t               $4\t                 1000\t$4,000.00    \r\n\r\nCanvassing\t                 per day\t             $1,120\t                5          \t$5,600\r\n                                                                                              Sub-total\t      $80,600 \r\n\r\nAdministrative                                                 9% of grant                       $9,000                                                 \r\nOverhead\r\n\r\nProject Management & \r\nAdministration                                                9% of grant\t                 $9,000\r\n                                                                                             Sub-total\t       $18,000\r\nGrand Total \t$98,600 for 1000 trees.\r\n"

What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >+
  400,000 Trees by July 2013



  Million Trees LA’s publicprivate collaboration has planted over 380,000 trees
  and is on track to plant 400,000 trees by July 2013. 






  Rate of Planting6X the last two administrations






  According to the City of Los Angeles Urban Forest Division, Los Angles
  (including the City, NGOs and developers) planted an average of 10,000 trees
  annually during the previous two administrations. With limited resources and
  no direct funding from the City’s General Fund, MTLA has increased the annual
  tree planting sixfold (average 60,000/year).






  Rate of Survival Double the National Average



  Research conducted by the US Forest Service, the national new tree mortality
  rate is between 10% and 12%. MTLA’s mortality rate is half the national
  average at 4% and 5%. 






  A National Model



  The US Forest Service conducted a national study of large municipal tree
  planting programs in 2010/11 and found Million Trees LA to be a top model. 






  Awards Received



  2012“Best Urban Forestry Program” Award received from California urban Council






  2009“Outstanding Achievement Award” from the Environmental Protection Agency. 


Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >+
  The Los Angeles Conservation Corps (LACC) is currently our partner who
  coordinates with us to deliver trees to private properties in the City of Los
  Angeles through our residential tree program. LACC is also our partner who
  obtains the trees for both the Residential Program and the Fruit Tree
  Adoptions. 






  MTLA also partners with Fuego TechFire Rangers , Hollywood/Los Angeles
  Beautification Team, Koreatown Youth and Community Center, North East Trees,
  and TreePeople to plant trees and conduct fruit tree adoptions. 


Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >+
  The metrics we will utilize for success will be determined by how many fruit
  trees are adopted or secured. In addition success will also be measured by
  community engagement, creation of new collaborations and the success of
  continued partnerships. 






  The project goal is to enhance environmental benefits and provide access to
  healthy food. This project will also allow us to educate the next generation
  on the importance of trees. 


How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: "The trees planted will sequester the carbon dioxide in the air and provide oxygen to breathe.

What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >+
  Success in the Year 2050 would be to increase the percentage of City of Los
  Angeles residents having fruit or shade trees in their home. For the City of
  Los Angeles to continue to serve as the model to replicate, so that other
  cities within Los Angeles County also provide fruit trees to its residents.






  Clean Air and Healthy Lifestyle 



  Success would be for each of the families who received a fruit tree to have
  enjoyed the environmental benefits of the tree including breathing cleaner air
  and enjoying a healthy lifestyle. 






  A new generation of environmental leaders



  The young adults who worked to make this happen continue to work to protect
  the environment either professionally or in their personal time and are giving
  the youth of 2050 the opportunity to work on protecting the planet. 






  A healthy urban forest



  A healthy urban forest that makes the City of Los Angeles a greener, healthier
  place to live is what success would like for our indicator in 2050. Although
  our focus is the City of Los Angeles, a healthy urban forest is necessary for
  our planet.
