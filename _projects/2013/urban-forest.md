title: Urban Forest
indicator: ' Environmental Quality'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >+
  Since the inception of the automobile, Los Angeles has been dramatically
  altered by the increasing amount of asphalt and concrete covering ground
  surfaces, which absorb incoming solar radiation and reradiate it as heat
  energy that raises the local air temperature. The higher temperatures 
  increase the formation of smog, heatrelated illnesses and the demand for
  energy as well as decrease the health level of people, plants and wildlife.
  Exacerbating this trend is the impact of the overall heating of the planet
  caused by global warming — something has got to give.<br><br>






  With a population of over 12 million people, the Los Angeles region is a major
  contributor of ozone and other pollutants that adversely affect climate  and
  temperature as well as air and water quality. As the population continues to
  grow, the demand for land and services near Los Angeles’ urban center
  continues to increase, thereby increasing the amount of traffic, concrete and
  asphalt. The city is expected to reach a population of almost 40 million by
  2050  so the time to approach this problem increasing heat island effect is
  now.  This problem is a significant opportunity to create a robust and
  effective program that addresses the issue in a truly innovative way.  The
  City has already embraced tree planting programs with admirable results
  however, we propose to address this problem holistically in a twofold manner —
  by providing more trees while also mitigating the effects of the asphalt
  surfaces already in abundance throughout the urban core.<br><br>






  Urban Forest is a pilot program for a nursery on private property, such as a
  privatesector business, that will provide trees to be planted in public
  spaces. Built on the idea of partnership, collaboration and exchange, the
  business (in this case American Apparel) will house the trees on their parking
  lot, allowing them to grow and be cared for in boxes. The Los Angeles
  Conservation Corps, a nonprofit organization, will lend a hand in maintaining
  the trees  offering up their expertise to American Apparel to ensure that the
  trees are properly cared for. When the trees are large enough to be
  transplanted, they will be picked up by partnering nonprofits and government
  agencies to be planted in public spaces throughout the City. <br><br>






  In return for space allotment, utilities, operations and maintenance, American
  Apparel will create a greener, healthier, and more beautifulparking lot  that
  reverses the heat island effect and the City will gain more trees. In
  addition, Urban Forest also has the potential to be replicated in parking lots
  across the City  positively impacting even more acreage through the production
  of more trees at more locations around the City. As an increasing number of
  businesses join the program, the amount of trees available to be planted in
  the City will grow exponentially.<br><br>






  Through this program, as a true multibenefit solution, several indicators will
  be addressed, primarily impacting health and environmental quality but also
  positively affecting the education,  income and employment indicators. 
  Initializing a program that not only improves upon existing inuse parking
  lots, but simultaneously provides trees for the greening of the City, will
  improve the environmental quality of the City and provide a healthier
  environment for both the employees of American Apparel and the locations where
  the trees are eventually planted. <br><br>






  The program will not only improve the environment, but also provide jobs for
  local urban youth (through the participation of the Los Angeles Conservation
  Corps) as well as educate staff and create new jobs at American Apparel. 
  Through the visibility of the parking lot at American Apparel, the trees that
  are planted throughout the City, and a campaign initiated both online and
  through signage, awareness will increase about the program and the importance
  of green space in the City enhancing human development and making Los Angeles
  a better place to live.

How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  Today, Southern California has the poorest air quality in the United States.
  The combination of copious amounts of asphalt, a distressed urban forest, and
  low amounts of accessible public park land are the largest contributors of
  this effect. Not to mention that city temperatures are getting higher — but
  this trend can be reversed!<br>






  As a catalyst for sustainable thinking and partnerships, the Urban Forest
  program has the potential to improve the overall environmental quality and
  positively impact the public health of the City transforming Los Angeles from
  a concrete jungle into a greener city — perhaps to be known as the City of
  Trees.<br>






  The trees will be planted throughout the City with a special emphasis on low
  income neighborhoods, industrial corridors, public school and public parks.
  The trees will provide cooling through evapotranspiration and by providing
  shade. The trees will also help improve our air quality by removing excess CO2
  from the atmosphere and replacing it with oxygen, making it easier for 
  Angelenos to breathe and decreasing the asthma and respiratory health problems
  in the City. Furthermore, vegetation acts as a natural filter for water,
  picking up contaminants that will improve the overall water supply. <br>






  In sum Los Angeles will greatly benefit from this program through improving
  air quality, decreasing the heat island effect, improving water quality,
  increasing awareness, decreasing health related risks and creating a
  healthier, more livable Los Angeles for generations to come. 
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >+
  In 2050, Los Angeles will be transformed from a City of Asphalt to a City of
  Trees and a true Urban Forest will have been created. The heat island effect
  will decrease and the City will be more livable for future generations to
  come.<br><br>






  One of the most exciting possibilities of this endeavor is its ability to be
  replicated in parking lots across the City creating a greener city at an
  expedited pace as the program grows. This means that over time, Los Angeles
  will become greener at a faster pace with the potential to be fully
  transformed into a sustainable city of the future in 2050.<br><br>






  This will only increase the positive effect Urban Forest will have on all the
  aforementioned indicators. Environmental quality and health will be improved
  while there will be an increase in education and employment of LA city at risk
  youth, the work sector that engages in the program, and the City’s community
  at large. <br><br>






  In addition to a citywide adoption of private parking lot nurseries for public
  benefit, the awareness and education that is raised could also spur other
  projects that capitalize on this type of private public partnership for the
  good of the City overall increasing the City’s well being and changing the
  course of the City’s future into a sustainable regenerative metropolis.<br>
