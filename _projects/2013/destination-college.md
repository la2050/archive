  Organization Name: Fulfillment Fund
  Indicator: ' Education'
  brief: "The Fulfillment Fund is a Los Angeles based 35 year old nonprofit that has evolved into a leading college access organization with a multipronged model for success. The Fulfillment Fund’s mission is to make college a reality for students growing up in educationally and economically under-resourced communities. A college degree is more important than ever in creating a pathway out of poverty.  We promote higher education and college bound culture through our high school program in partnership with several LA Title 1 high schools.  Our program is designed around our classroom-based proprietary College Access Curriculum, one-on-one college counseling, and experiential learning opportunities such as college tours and our annual signature event, Destination College.  We are unique in that our program is part of the regular school day, making us an integrated part of our students’ school day.  Our holistic approach and commitment of “One Student a Time” enables us to extend educational opportunity and create long-term positive change for our students, their families and the surrounding community. Numerous students do not see college as a reality due to the cycle of poverty, cost of attendance, and lack of college graduate role models in their communities.  Compounding the problem are budget cuts that lead to overcrowding 1:35 students and few or nonexistent college counselors 1:1250 students in area Title 1 high schools; the Fulfillment Fund is bridging this gap to service these students.  We partner with the schools to provide students with the much needed guidance and information to graduate high school, apply to and attend college.  The education of one student not only impacts the student, but it can also increase the economic growth of their family and surrounding community exponentially.  Our hope for 2050 is that the greater LA community believes in our vision that all students, regardless of their circumstances, should have the opportunity to attend college, graduate, and actively participate in transforming their communities and creating a better society.  Our students are LA’ future business leaders, parents, and community advocates that will help spread the importance of the value of higher education. Our immediate goal for the future is to reach more students, families, and educators by expanding our signature event, Destination College beyond our current students. The Fulfillment Fund has successfully held 16 Destination College events for high school program students, their parents and mentors; it is often the first time many of them visit a higher education institution and begin to see attending a college or university as within their grasp.  \r\n\r\nDestination College is always held on a local college campus such as Loyola Marymount University, the University of California Los Angeles and the University of Southern California.  Grade specific workshops are delivered by Fulfillment Fund program staff and outside content experts that include: Overview of the 4-college systems, Financial aid options, Personal essay writing, College Applications 101, and Leadership 101. Several workshops, led by professionals in creative fields, incorporate youth development and creative self-expression to further engage students. The event also includes a robust college fair attended by 60 or more national college recruiters who provide general information and address our students’ concerns about financial aid, cultural challenges, and support services.\r\n\r\nFor many students, Destination College is a pivotal, life-changing experience as it marks the first time they realize that they can belong in the college community.  After attending the event, students are armed with critical information and have a sense of empowerment which translates into certainty that they can attend their dream school no matter the cost because they have options.  The event provides parents and mentors with valuable resources and support about the importance of their student attending college in addition to providing guidance on how best to prepare their teens for college.  In LA County, where only  32% of students complete college prep coursework A-G\\;  Destination College has the ability to ignite passion in students and stress the importance of succeeding in high school in order to be accepted to college.  \r\n\r\nThe main goals of Destination College are to:\r\n1.\tMotivate students to apply for and attend college by connecting them with college representatives and current college students.\r\n2.\tSpread practical knowledge about the college admissions process and financial aid through informative workshops.\r\n3.     Educate more parents in the college going opportunities that exist for their children and help remove the financial barriers they may think hinder these opportunities\r\n\r\n"

Our goal is to increase the total number of students from low-income areas over the next several years and eventually scale our event to a broader Los Angeles community wide event.  Funding from LA2050 would allow the seed money to begin immediately casting a wider net in Los Angeles.  The $100,000 LA 2050 funds will increase our budget to provide stipends to additional high schools to participate in Destination College.  We will be able to accommodate up to an additional 600 students and parents each year for four years.  The high schools will receive stipends from the program budget for a specific number of slots for the event (the number of slots per school is dependent on the number of high schools that apply for the stipends).  \r\n*Transportation includes rental buses for participants to and from the event.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

A 2009 U.S. Department of Education study showed that the average income by a high school dropout was $19,540, those with a high school diploma increased to $27,380, an associate’s degree earned an average of $36,190, and a Bachelor’s degree earned more than double a dropout salary at $46,930.  These statistics clearly indicate that the average high school dropout is likely to earn wages that are below the federal poverty level and that the higher the education level, the greater chance for economic self-sufficiency.  Study after study has also shown that a higher education will deter one from crime, lowering incarceration rates and also promotes a higher degree of engagement in community and civic activities.

  description3: "The Fulfillment Fund recognizes that there are other organizations that provide facets of college assistance programs and/or mentoring for high school students in the Los Angeles area.  Since our county is one of the largest in the country it takes collaborative efforts in order to serve our Los Angeles student population.  Where possible, we work in tandem in order to better fulfill the needs of students in Los Angeles.  Our program is unique because we offer a more holistic approach to programming.  We are able to successfully assess the needs of first generation students and develop a comprehensive model that provides them with the necessary skills to be confident about the accessibility of college.  We also award scholarships to many of our students and see them through graduating college and often into their careers.   \r\n\r\nThe Fulfillment Fund currently collaborates through a Memorandum of Understanding with C5 Youth Foundation of Southern California (C5LA) and extended the Destination College opportunity to around 60 of their students in the 2012 event.  We also have agreements with Communities in Schools and Beating the Odds who had around 55 combined students attend Destination College 2012.  Our collaboration partner students are extended the same opportunities in the college fair, tour, and grade-specific workshops as our Fulfillment Fund program students.    \r\n\r\nOur partnership with Communities in Schools includes joining forces to provide technology workshops and trainings through our partnership with Creative Arts Academy.   \r\n\r\nThe Fulfillment Fund was one of the founders of the Southern California College Access Network which is comprised of 51 nonprofit organizations to increase access and completion of postsecondary education for low-income students.\r\n"
  vision: "By 2050, we would like to see thousands of students filling local college campuses – perhaps over multiple days to engage in workshops and college fairs.  Our hope is for first generation students to have confidence that they can and should be part of a college community.  We envision thousands of Fulfillment Fund alumni serving as positive role models for the generations to come and giving back to their communities.  Parents will know that college is viable for their children and will understand how to support them through the college going process.  As our participants in Destination College become the parents, business leaders, educators and community leaders of the future Los Angeles we will shift the conversation in Los Angeles so that all students have the opportunity to attend college regardless of their circumstances.  \r\n\r\n"

  The Fulfillment Fund has been able to gauge the need of the Los Angeles
  community and build a successful model that works for students.   The
  Fulfillment Fund provided mentoring to help students graduate high school and
  educate them about college access.  Through the interactions with students,
  parents, and educators, we saw the great need for the community to be educated
  on college acccess for all students especially those in first-generation,
  low-income or under-resourced areas.  We were able to build on our mentoring
  program and develop proprietary high school curriculum that is delivered in
  partnership with schools during class-time and one-on-one counseling through
  our College Access Program Advisors.  We also have a CAP (College Access
  Program) Leadership Crew that meets once a month.  






  Experiential learning opportunities are provided for the students in our
  program including college overnight tours and the annual Destination College
  event.  Destination College has successfully been held for 16 years and we
  have been able to provide a unique college experience for thousands of high
  school students.  Fulfillment Fund provides financial aid workshops and also
  has a robust scholarship program open to students that go through our
  program.  Parent workshops during Destination College are provided in English
  and Spanish to help them provide support for their children in high school and
  college. 





   A testament to our success has been the recent ability to provide the city of Las Vegas the tools to replicate the Fulfillment Fund model as a pilot in their schools.  The participating schools have already started seeing a shift in perceptions on attending college from the students.





  The Fulfillment Fund program students have a 90% high school graduation rate
  compared to 64.2% in LAUSD overall.  In 2012, 90% of our students planned to

  nationwide.  An impressive 81% of Fulfillment Fund students become the first
  in their family to attend college, helping break the cycle of poverty in their
  family and community.






  We strive for the students in Los Angeles to have quality college access
  programs and have an experience similar to Nicole Harris Blackwell. Nicole
  shared that her family wanted her to be the first to go to a four-year college
  “but [they] didn’t know how to help [her] navigate through choosing a school

Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >+
  We measure success in multiple ways, but our primary indicator is a pre and
  post survey is distributed to student participants at our Destination College
  event.  The survey is designed to measure student impact and is reviewed for
  quality improvement measures.  In 2012, a parental survey was developed and
  distributed to parents and caregivers that attended Destination College with
  their students.  These two surveys will be the main form of assessing the
  event and students attitudes about attending college.  The survey gauges the
  students’ interest in attending college. 






  Follow up questions on the survey also help to gain more knowledge about the
  students and their attitudes toward attending college.  Some of the options
  students can select for reasons why their interest changed include: 1)
  participating in the grade-specific workshops; 2) listening to the student
  panel; and 3) attending the college fair.  For a majority of students, the
  financial aid workshop impacted their attitude shift because it began to
  demystify the financial aid process and encourage students to apply for any
  school of their choice regardless of cost concerns.






  Success will also be measured by increased numbers of parental involvement. 
  Parent involvement is key in the process since a majority of our students
  (81%) will be the first generation in their households to attend college.  For
  many of our parents, the idea of navigating the college going process is
  overwhelming.  Our parents want their children to succeed and often just need
  a little help to understand how to best they can help their children. 
  Together with parents, we can educate more students on the importance of
  attending college and create a broader college-going culture in the
  communities most in need in Los Angeles.


How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  A good education is key to helping elevate individuals from the cycle of
  poverty.  A 2009 U.S. Department of Education study showed that the average
  income by a high school dropout was $19,540, those with a high school diploma
  increased to $27,380, an associate’s degree earned an average of $36,190, and
  a Bachelor’s degree earned more than double a dropout salary at $46,930. 
  These statistics clearly indicate that the average high school dropout is
  likely to earn wages that are below the federal poverty level and that the
  higher the education level, the greater chance for economic self-sufficiency. 
  Study after study has also shown that a higher education will deter one from
  crime, lowering incarceration rates and also promotes a higher degree of
  engagement in community and civic activities.  This project will lead to a
  better educated workforce and create a ripple effect that impacts students,
  parents and families, and Los Angeles businesses by 2050.    






  The Fulfillment Fund will continue to support college access in Los Angeles
  while broadening our reach in partner high schools, serving more students and
  creating school-wide impact.  There is currently a lack of opportunities for
  students growing up in economically and educationally under-resourced
  communities to get the help they need to successfully navigate the college
  going process.  Among our students, the majority - 69% are Latino and 19% are
  African-American.   A combined 80% of the population we serve receive free or
  reduced lunch.  Nationally, for students from low-income families, only 54% go
  on to college as compared to 84% of their more affluent counterparts.  By
  increasing student and parent participation, we can have a positive impact on
  these statistics and increase of number of low-income students, in particular
  the number of Latino and African-American students graduating high school and
  attending college.  






  Our college matriculation rates over the past two years show that, as a result
  of our services, Fulfillment Fund students are matriculating to University of
  California colleges at a higher rate than Los Angeles County as a whole by a
  margin of 3%.  They are also matriculating to California state schools at
  nearly double the rate of LA County overall (43% vs. 23%).  Expansion of
  Destination College outside of current Fulfillment Fund students will allow us
  to serve Los Angeles students and families that are most in need by motivating
  students and demonstrating that college is an viable opportunity no matter
  what the obstacles or financial concerns.    
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >+
  By 2050, we would like to see thousands of students filling local college
  campuses — perhaps over multiple days to engage in workshops and college
  fairs.  Our hope is for first generation students to have confidence that they
  can and should be part of a college community.  We envision thousands of
  Fulfillment Fund alumni serving as positive role models for the generations to
  come and giving back to their communities.  Parents will know that college is
  viable for their children and will understand how to support them through the
  college going process.  As our participants in Destination College become the
  parents, business leaders, educators and community leaders of the future Los
  Angeles we will shift the conversation in Los Angeles so that all students
  have the opportunity to attend college regardless of their circumstances.
