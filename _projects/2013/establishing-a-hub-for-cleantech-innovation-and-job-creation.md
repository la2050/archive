title: Establishing a Hub for Cleantech Innovation and Job Creation
indicator: ' Income & Employment'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >-
  <p> Establish a Hub for Cleantech Innovation and Job Creation: We are
  revitalizing a blighted area of Los Angeles by creating new companies — and
  therefore thousands of jobs across the economic spectrum — in the fastest
  growing business sector on the globe.  The nonprofit LA Cleantech Incubator
  has launched 14 new companies in just the last 18 months, creating over 75
  direct jobs & millions of dollars in job opportunities for electricians,
  maintenance technicians, engineers, fabricators, plumbers, construction
  workers, office workers, executives, manufacturing workers, & more.  When the
  La Kretz Innovation Campus opens less than a year from today, we will have
  capacity to serve substantially more companies at various stages of growth, as
  well as a more robust workforce development capability — & this is just the
  beginning.</p>



  <p> Create a Roadmap for Revitalizing the Downtown Industrial District: Our
  goal is to transform what was once LA’s industrial core into a vibrant,
  growing Cleantech Corridor, thus creating a longlasting economy & sustainable,
  familysupporting jobs for Angelinos.  This project enlists a strong group of
  partners in economic development, policy, planning, architecture, higher
  education, local political & community leadership, as well as business leaders
  & entrepreneurs. Together, we will build on our assets to create, demonstrate,
  & promote a new Cleantech Corridor Roadmap that will serve as an actionplan
  for building this regional hub.</p>



  <p> Seize the Cleantech Opportunity: Cleantech innovation is critically
  important to the United States, & to Los Angeles in particular.  The sector is
  massive and growing at a tremendous rate. The global market volume of the
  cleantech sector today is $2.7 Trillion per year, and it is projected to
  double by 2025. Mirroring global trends, renewable energy is the fastest
  growing sector in the US economy, growing 49% between 2007 and 2011. </p>



  <p>Along with this enormous new market opportunity come opportunities for
  creating wellpaying, sustainable and diverse jobs. Nationwide, cleantech jobs
  pay 13% more than jobs outside the sector, and 26% of all cleantech jobs lie
  in manufacturing as compared to only 9% of jobs in the economy as a whole.
  These jobs are higher paying and growing at 10 times the rate of nongreen
  jobs. Los Angeles is already the second largest green economy in the US, but
  important as cleantech is to LA’s economy today, it will be orders of
  magnitude more important in the decades to come as the world rebuilds its
  transportation & energy infrastructure.</p>



  <p>Alongside these promising statistics, it is important to note another
  widely acknowledged fact: creating new companies is the best way to create new
  jobs.  For example, during the last three decades all net new jobs created in
  the United States — 44million — have come from companies less than five years
  old. The Kaufman Foundation did an important study about economic growth &
  found that new companies create an average of three million new jobs every
  year in the US while existing companies lose one million jobs.  This is why we
  focus on new company creation.</p>



  <p> Build a Cleantech Corridor: The next step is the creation of a hub for
  this burgeoning industry in Los Angeles. Encompassing a 4mile stretch of land
  straddling  the LA river from Union Station to Washington Blvd., from the Arts
  District to Boyle Heights, the Cleantech Corridor is that hub. We think of it
  as an Arts and Innovation District on the banks of the LA River.</p>



  <p> Our Action Plan: Over the sevenmonth period of this grant, LACI/CTLA will
  work with our partners and collaborators to produce an interactive roadmap
  that will demonstrate how current constraints, including existing policies,
  infrastructure, programs, etc. can be adapted to transform a blighted
  neighborhood in downtown Los Angeles into a thriving new industrial powerhouse
  that will serve as a hub for the region’s clean economy.</p>



  <p>Semesterlong, multidisciplinary studios will be conducted at USC’s public
  policy and architecture schools, as well as SCIArc. We will examine issues and
  opportunities and how these manifest in terms of buildings, infrastructure,
  and the way we interact. Most importantly, we will explore how this profound
  growth of new companies will change the picture in terms of number of jobs,
  job density, and wages accross the economic spectrum. </p>



  <p>The result will be a critical examination of the current policy
  environment, leading to an action plan for the City, and an interactive visual
  representation of how these exciting projects will be integrated into the
  community.  All findings will be published, and presented for review and
  comment.</p>



  <p>We will do all of this while expanding the LA Cleantech Incubator and Clean
  Tech Los Angeles, building the La Kretz Innovation Campus, supporting
  development of the Cleantech Manufacturing Center, and creating real, family
  supporting jobs every day.</p>
What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  <p>CTLA:  Created by the Mayor in 2009, CTLA is partnership of the region’s
  most important institutions dedicated to making Los Angles a huge green
  economy.  Today, LA is the second largest green economy in the US, is the
  largest market for EVs and solar in the country, has more cleantech startups
  than any other region in the country, and is leading the way in renewable
  energy generation.</p>






  <p>LACI:  In just 18 short months, LACI has created a vibrant cleantech
  innovation ecosystem that has spawned 14 new cleantech companies, attracted
  partnerships with industry/academia, and finalized the funding and planning
  for the $40M La Kretz Innovation Campus in the Cleantech Corridor.</p>
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-

  Economic Development Corporation, Pacific Asian Consortium in Employment,
  Wells Fargo Foundation
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  <p>The most important metrics all relate to jobs. We will need to ask the
  following questions: How many direct jobs have been created? How many indirect
  jobs? How sustainable are these jobs? Are they paying familysupporting wages?
  Are these truly “new” jobs, or are jobs being moved from one place to
  another?</p>






  <p>There are also enabling indicators. How many companies have been created?
  How much capital has been infused into these companies? How diverse and broad
  is our team of collaborators? Have we effectively engaged all of the
  stakeholders in the process? Are current projects coming online on time? Are
  other recommendations being implemented? Is our report and interactive app
  being utilized? Etc.</p>
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >+
  We will build new companies, that create new jobs, thereby revitalizing
  downtown Los Angeles’ industrial core.






  Broadly, we will bring back the industrial core of downtown Los Angeles by
  rebuilding it into the cleantech innovation and commercialization center of
  the region.  As a result, this area will once again provide familysupporting
  jobs for Boyle Heights, Lincoln Heights, East Los Angeles, Central and South
  Los Angeles, and beyond.






  In the next 4 years alone just one of the envisioned projects of the Roadmap —
  the Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator’s La Kretz Innovation Campus—will generate
  over 1700 jobs from companies who pay $45M per year in salaries and wages and
  generate more than $85M per year in sales.






  We will create a new industrial powerhouse dedicated to clean technologies and
  sustainable jobs.  We fully expect that by 2050, the LA Arts and Innovation
  District on the banks of the Los Angeles River will be the leading cleantech
  innovation and commercialization hub in the world.


What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  In 2050, Los Angeles will be as iconic for clean technology as Silicon Valley
  is for hitech. We will be worldrenown as a model for harnessing regional
  strengths to drive innovation, employment, sustainability, and livability in
  our diverse neighborhoods. We will be home to world’s largest cluster of
  cleantech companies, and with that, the largest population of workers in green
  jobs. The people who work these jobs will be well paid, highly respected, and
  proud to be building solutions to the worlds most pressing environmental,
  energy, water, and sustainability related challenges.
