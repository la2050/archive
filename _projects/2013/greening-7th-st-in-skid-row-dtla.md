title: Greening 7th St. in Skid Row/DTLA
project_summary: >-
  My idea is to plant 30 mature shade trees along 7th St. in the industrial
  district/Skid Row section of downtown. These trees would be protected by
  colorful and decorative metal tree guards. This neighborhood shelters the
  largest stable homeless population in America, so in an effort to put people
  to work, we would hire people from Chrysalis Enterprises, a local company that
  specializes in placing people transitioning out of homelessness to water and
  care for the trees. This portion of 7th St. is set to receive a bike lane
  within the next couple of years, so the addition of trees would further
  multiply the overall quality of  life along and near 7th St., which for
  decades has been a crime-ridden and blighted stretch.

  success: >-
    Simply stated, our success will be measured by how many trees we can plant
    and maintain along 7th St. between Main and Alameda Streets in the
    industrial district/Skid Row neighborhood of downtown. We will also measure
    our success by what sorts of sparks of economic revitalization happen along
    this boulevard after the trees have been planted. We will measure our
    success by our ability to engage the local community in this beautification
    process which will by demonstrated by our ability to attract volunteers for
    tree planting events, and finally our success will be measured by how many
    people are seen using 7th St. to walk, bike, socialize and rest under a
    shade tree in.

  description: "As the re-purposing of downtown Los Angeles continues apace, an eclectic mix of urban functions is taking root including commercial, residential, recreational, and social. The industrial district or Skid Row section of downtown currently hosts functions as diverse as wholesaling, retailing, warehousing, nightlife, housing as well as an array of social services. But in many of these areas there has been a lag in commensurate infrastructure development (which stands in stark contrast to other downtown districts which have experienced significant attention and investment in recent years). While this lag is evident on many levels, one in particular stands out: greening.

  description3: >-
    Sadly, there is no obvious competition in regards to beautifying the Skid
    Row portion of the industrial district of downtown Los Angeles. There is
    however a BID (Business Improvement District) called the CCEA- headed by
    Estela Lopez, which cleans the streets for approximately half of this
    district, as well as providing safety patrols. Decades of crime-ridden
    streets have created an environment where local property owners cared little
    about neighborhood beautification but instead have been primarily focused on
    public safety concerns and rightly so. Promisingly, the so-called
    Renaissance of downtown has begun to open people's minds about what
    industrial district/Skid Row area can and should blossom into in the future.
    We have already worked with the CCEA for past tree plantings and community
    improvement efforts and would consider them a key partner moving forward
    which we will likely be working closely with at every stage of  our proposed
    project.
  vision: >-
    Success would be mature, grown shade trees flanking 7th St. through the
    industrial district/Skid Row, which would compliment the proposed bike
    lanes. Success would be a cleaner, safer, more aesthetically pleasing
    boulevard where whole families can ride bikes, rest  and socialize on
    benches under majestic branches. Success would be full revitalization of a
    decades neglected stretch, economic vitality and a healthier population.

What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  Well before founding Industrial District Green, Katherine McNenny had begun
  laying the groundwork for future nonprofit greening activities. In December of
  2011 after 12 months of preparation, she conducted her first planting of 7
  trees along San Pedro St. in Skid Row between 4th and 5th Streets with the
  support of the Central City East Association (CCEA) and it's Executive
  Director, Estela Lopez. This successful first effort involved lobbying and
  coordinating with all relevant property owners, Jan Perry’s office, the Bureau
  of Street Services, and TreePeople, who managed the plantings.






  She is currently overseeing another tree planting also in Skid Row, with the
  LA Conservation Corps along Boyd & Omar Streets between 3rd and 4th. She has
  been working with property owners and sponsors on this project for several
  months now. The planting date will be March 23rd, 2013. Volunteers from Union
  Church (in Little Tokyo) and several local residents from the neighborhood
  will help plant the trees.
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  We intend to collaborate with the LA Conservation Corps (LACC) for their
  assistance in procuring the trees we plant & the concrete we cut. We intend to
  partner with TreePeople to train the workers we intend to hire to care for the
  trees.






  We intend to partner with Chrysalis Enterprises to hire workers who are
  transitioning out of homelessness to water and maintain the trees bimonthly.






  We intend to partner with Patrick Joyce of Canterbury International for
  fashioning the metal tree guards we feel are necessary to protect the trees
  (pictured in "Preview" document under "Website" heading).






  We intend to partner with the Downtown LA Neighborhood Council and Union
  Church (in Little Tokyo) when we need volunteers to help plant the trees.
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  Simply stated, our success will be measured by how many trees we can plant and
  maintain along 7th St. between Main and Alameda Streets in the industrial
  district/Skid Row neighborhood of downtown. We will also measure our success
  by what sorts of sparks of economic revitalization happen along this boulevard

How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  As the repurposing of downtown Los Angeles continues apace, an eclectic mix of
  urban functions is taking root including commercial, residential,
  recreational, and social. The industrial district or Skid Row section of
  downtown currently hosts functions as diverse as wholesaling, retailing,

  the industrial district/Skid Row area increasingly accommodates a diverse set
  of activities, in many cases it continues to exude a grim sunbleached
  austerity more in keeping with it's original single purpose function.






  Our project of greening 7th St. in downtown's underserved industrial area will
  not only improve community aesthetics but contribute to sustainability by
  addressing the urban heat island dynamic as well as improving the health and
  well being of it's growing population of residents and employees. 
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  Success would be mature, grown shade trees flanking 7th St. through the
  industrial district/Skid Row, which would compliment the proposed bike lanes.
  Success would be a cleaner, safer, more aesthetically pleasing boulevard where
  whole families can ride bikes, rest  and socialize on benches under majestic
