title: Advancing Justice through Legal Social Enterprises
indicator: ' Income & Employment'
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >+
  ADVANCE builds a “Teach for America” for legal reform that produces socially
  responsible lawyers committed to restoring justice and access to legal
  services. 






  An experiential training program to transform how attorneys practice law in
  L.A., CA, ADVANCE helps millions gain unprecedented access to legal services
  and lawyers build satisfying careers committed to justice. We train law
  graduates to become socially responsible attorneys who:






  1) deliver legal services through a social enterprise model;



  2) make positive changes to a lawyer’s work-life balance; and



  3) restore integrity, trust, and access in the justice system for all.






  **The Problem**






  The outdated practice of law is a major cause of social problems. The justice
  gap between low to moderate income people and legal services is widespread,
  and grows as courts and legal nonprofits face budget cuts. In L.A., half of
  its 10 million residents come to court without a lawyer.  Meanwhile, new law
  grads remain unemployed or enter a dissatisfying profession that is reluctant
  to help advance legal access.






  Currently, legal self-help, nonprofit, and pro bono services have failed to
  close the justice gap. Public Counsel, Equal Justice Works, Legal Aid, and
  justice corps provide direct legal services to the poor but lack sustaining
  forms of revenue and fail to serve a large percentage of the population. Solo
  practice incubators train lawyers in traditional forms of law practice that
  ignore social enterprise values. Others, such as DOJ’s Access to Justice, are
  vulnerable to budget cuts and struggle to attract probono lawyers. Likewise,
  traditional firms only promote probono assistance and social responsibility as
  an aside.






  **ADVANCE--The Solution**






  Our model is the first legal training program that equips lawyers to build
  careers committed to closing the justice gap and approaches the legal practice
  as a social enterprise. Based on Harvard’s shared value concept, it dismantles
  the old law firm model and returns lawyers to the business of service and
  addressing societal needs and challenges.  In the end, ADVANCE not only helps
  to solve the justice gap by providing access to legal services for the
  majority of Angelenos, it also helps provide jobs for the nearly 50% of
  unemployed law school graduates who want to help their community but have no
  means to do so.  In addition, by addressing these two issues facing the legal
  system, ADVANCE will help alleviate the overcrowding and lack of resources
  facing Los Angeles court systems.






  **The Idea**






  A hybrid that places social responsibility at the core of legal services, we
  create a social enterprise law firm model that trains lawyers to provide
  affordable and innovative legal services to low and moderate income people. 






  Consisting of a B corp law firm and training program, new law graduates will
  enter a 2-year, salaried position to learn how to practice law that advances
  social responsibility, healing and restored justice. The program includes:
  trainings; workshops; leadership courses; law practice management courses;
  mentoring and coaching; online resources; and the creation of easy-access
  legal “minute clinics” at locations convenient to target populations. At the
  end, trainees will be equipped to offer holistic legal services in restorative
  justice, collaborative law, conflict resolution, mediation, and civil and
  criminal law. Trainees will also learn how to start and manage a law firm that
  reconnects legal business success with social progress.






  Having access to legal representation should never be limited to the rich.  
  Angelenos with low or moderate incomes, or who are unemployed, equally deserve
  legal representation.  ADVANCE delivers justice for this population that has
  long been left behind.  With ADVANCE, the impossible begins to become possible
  --  a model for justice provided to all.  


What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >+
  ADVANCE is still in its idea stages; however, as mentioned, we have been
  selected as a semi-finalist for the Echoing Green Fellowship, which would fund
  our organization for the next two years.  In addition, one of the
  organization's founders has seen how her work as a lawyer and social
  entrepreneur implementing a law firm model identical to ADVANCE's has made
  positive and lasting changes to low and moderate income people navigating the
  justice system in L.A. But her experience has been met with challenges when
  trying to address the needs of a large population. This led her to see
  potential in creating a training program so legal professionals like her can
  help people the law is meant to serve.





Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  We plan to work with private and public nonprofits, such as the CA Bar,
  American Bar Association, Department of Justice, Pro Bono Institute, Taproot
  Foundation and Public Interest Law Foundation, to garner support for our
  idea.  In addition, we are collaborating with legal experts, scholars, and
  entrepreneurs across the U.S. that are committed to solving the problems
  ADVANCE addresses and that promote innovative legal practices such as
  integrative law and holistic law.    Lastly, ADVANCE is a semi-finalist for
  the Echoing Green Fellowship, which  has provided more than $31 million in
  start-up funding to leaders in a variety of sectors to implement bold ideas
  aimed at affecting social change. 
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  In the first year, we will train 3 new law graduates and serve 500 clients. By
  year 5, we plan to have 50 socially responsible lawyers graduate from our
  training program, with 30,000 people served annually.






  We also plan to recruit 5 law experts each year for five years to staff the
  training program. By year 5, we plan to provide training, coaching and
  mentoring in 6 legal areas: bankruptcy, immigration, consumer law, family law,
  business law, and civil defense.






  Our impact will be measured annually by:






  1) # of people served;



  2) # of social enterprise law firms launched by alumni of our training
  program;



  3) % reduction of self-represented litigants in the justice system; and



  4) data recording clients’ changing attitudes towards the legal system and
  attorneys.






  In 10 years, we hope to:






  1) assist 45% of the 5 million people currently going unrepresented in court;






  2) create 40% of the legal jobs for new law graduates;






  3) reduce by 30% the number of cases clogging the court system; and






  4) increase by 50% the level of job satisfaction and work-life balance among
  lawyers.
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  ADVANCE will serve as a vanguard for the legal profession: inspiring,
  training, and producing cutting-edge, socially responsible lawyers committed
  to closing the justice gap in Los Angeles.  We help deliver affordable legal
  services to millions of people, and empower law graduates to become social
  entrepreneurs and practice law centered in restoring justice.  






  We focus on three groups affected by the justice system: 1) recent law school
  graduates; 2) low and moderate income people; and 3) local court systems.  






  In 10 years, we hope to build a revolution in law that:






  1) assists 5 million people currently going unrepresented in court;






  2) creates a majority of legal jobs for new law graduates;






  3) reduces the number of cases clogging the court system; 






  and






  4) increases the level of job satisfaction and work-life balance among
  lawyers.
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  Looking back at our measurables, in 2050, we hope that every woman and man in
  Los Angeles will have a lawyer, no matter their social or economic
  backgrounds.  Access to justice will no longer be a luxury.  100% of the 5
  million people currently going unrepresented in court will have legal
  representation, provided to them by new law graduates who will be equipped and
  able to serve their community.  The court systems will no longer face
  overcrowding and case overload issues.  And lawyers will return to the role
  they were meant to serve -- stewards of justice.
