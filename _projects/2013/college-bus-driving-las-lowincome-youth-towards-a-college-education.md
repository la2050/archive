title: 'College Bus: Driving LA’s LowIncome Youth Towards a College Education'
project_summary: "          “A Bresee college trip changed my life by making me decide to go to college,” describes Fonda Whitehead, a Bresee alumna who went on a college trip in 1988. “No one in my family had attended college, but that trip made it a reality for me.” Fonda, who has now worked at Bresee for 16 years, describes what has become a common story at Bresee; the story of how a simple college trip can change lives.\r\n\r\n          Bresee proposes a full-service college prep program that systematically targets the entire 450-member student body of Central City Value High School (CCVHS), a local charter school.  Every student will board Bresee’s newly renovated, 25-passenger College Bus, and spend a full day touring a local college.  That’s just the beginning.  Throughout the school year, every student will have the opportunity to take their college dreams a step further by enrolling in:\r\n•\tA-G requirement workshops for 9th grade\r\n•\tPSAT classes for 10th grade\r\n•\tPSAT and SAT prep, remedial CAHSEE prep and personal statement workshops for 11th grade\r\n•\tSAT prep, scholarship boot camps, FAFSA completion, and the opportunity to apply for a needs-based College Bus scholarship for the 12th grade\r\nPrograms will be available on the school’s campus, for free, to all students. This is a pilot program that is scalable and can be replicated at other schools in our community.  What if by 2050, every student in Los Angeles (LA) was afforded the same opportunity, the opportunity to overcome educational barriers and go to college?  Join us on the campaign.

  success: "The ultimate goal of the College Bus program is to intentionally prepare a full student body for college. This includes providing annual college trips to high schoolers using grade-specific curriculum and measuring improvement on grade-specific standards during the 2013-2014 school year (including A-G requirements, PSAT preparation, CAHSEE preparation, SAT preparation, personal statements, FAFSA, and scholarships).  Bresee’s College Coordinator will work collaboratively with Tutor Ted and CCVHS’ College Counselor to collect, maintain, and analyze the evaluation data supporting the following outcomes quarterly:\r\n\r\n100% of CCVHS Students (450) will:\r\n•\tVisit a college campus on Bresee’s College Bus, as measured by a pre- and post-test collected using Google Docs.\r\n•\tSet the goal of going to college, as measured by vision setting sheets, completed during the college tour.\r\n•\tReceive a tour of the Bresee Foundation and an overview of its Youth Programs while on their college tour, as measured by pre- and post- tests.\r\n\r\n95% of 9th grade participants will: \r\n•\tDevelop an A-G Completion plan to share with their College Counselor and parents will gain an understanding of college requirements, as measured by collected A-G Completion plans.\r\n\r\n95% of 10th grade participants will: \r\n•\tImprove on a PSAT practice test, as measured by pre- and post-tests collected by Tutor Ted.\r\n\r\n95% of 11th grade participants will: \r\n•\tIncrease their scores on PSAT and SAT practice tests, as measured by pre- and post-tests collected by Tutor Ted.\r\n•\tDemonstrate improvement on a CAHSEE practice test (if they haven’t already passed the CAHSEE), as measured by pre- and post-tests collected by two CCVHS teacher conducting remedial tutoring.\r\n•\tReceive individualized feedback on their personal statement, as measured by attendance at personal statement workshops.\r\n\r\n95% of 12th grade participants will: \r\n•\tIncrease their scores on a SAT practice test, as measured by pre- and post-tests collected by Tutor Ted.\r\n•\tComplete or receive individualized assistance completing their FAFSA, as measured by attendance at FAFSA bootcamps.\r\n•\tSubmit or receive individualized assistance completing a scholarship application, as measured by attendance at scholarship bootcamps.\r\n•\tBe eligible for the College Bus scholarship, as measured by College Bus program attendance and scholarship applications.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the outcomes based evaluation recorded above, students attendance at all of the workshops and tours will be tracked and analyzed to ensure that students take advantage of the full College Bus curriculum.  While short-term successes can be seen through the numerical goals described above, the true mark of success will be that more students graduating from CCVHS will enroll in post-secondary education. This data will be monitored and tracked by CCVHS’ College Counselor.  Additionally, success of the College Bus program on a whole will be demonstrated by replication of the program at other local schools.\r\n"
  description: "The College Bus will benefit LA by systematically ensuring that the most academically at-risk students are exposed to college, college-ready, and ultimately college-bound. This will immediately include exposing a full student body (450 students) to college and providing follow-up that results in A-G requirement completion; improved CAHSEE, PSAT, and SAT scores; and more college-ready students applying to college and enrolling with the necessary financial aid and scholarships. By piloting a scalable and replicable model, the impact of Bresee’s College Bus will not only be felt in our corner of the city, but eventually across LA. After successfully implementing this program at CCVHS, the model may be replicated by Bresee at any of the 10 high schools (with almost 11,000 students total) in a three-mile radius of Bresee. This would allow us to progress towards a day when all of the high school students in the Rampart area have been exposed to college and are college-ready. The model may also be adapted and replicated by other non-profits, to methodically ensure that all 1,632,427 students attending public schools in LA are college-ready.\r\n majority of people that Bresee serves live in an area defined as the Rampart Gang Reduction Youth Development (GRYD) Zone. This is the most densely populated area in the city of LA, with an estimated 75,000 residents, the highest concentration of recent immigrants in LA and 805 active gang members, responsible for nearly one-quarter of the city’s gang-related crimes (Advancement Project, 2008). It is estimated that 90% or more of the students Bresee serves are at the low to very low-income level. The area has an unemployment rate of 11% (Urban Institute), compared to 6% countywide (2010 Census). The majority of the students that Bresee serves attend schools in the bottom 10% of schools statewide, with the lowest graduation rates in the city (California Department of Education, 2013), and only 25% of graduates complete necessary college prep coursework (Rampart GRYD Assessment, 2008). In 2012, 100% of Bresee’s scholarship recipients were the first in their family to go to college.\r\n\r\nBy targeting the most at-risk youth with college prep and exposure services, Bresee’s College Bus will create a culture of college-readiness in partner schools, resulting in a wave of students like Laura, an undocumented student who was hesitant about college due to finances. She got college prep through Bresee, earned a Bresee scholarship, and is now attending CalState, Dominguez Hills. Laura states, “Without Bresee, I wouldn’t be where I am today.” Or a wave of students like Mario, who attributes the 100-point increase in his SAT score, which landed him in his dream school (University of Oregon), to Bresee’s SAT class. When the College Bus program is replicated across the city, not only will there be more Laura’s and Mario’s, but there will be long-term implications on the economic and social climate of the city at large (see below)."
  collaborators: "Bresee will continue its two-year partnership with CCVHS, a charter school one block away. In 2012, CCVHS’ graduation rate was 83%. Only 38% of graduates went to a 4-year college and 52% completedThe the A-G Requirements. With one college counselor, CCVHS is not equipped to provide college prep for all students. Given CCVHS’ record of academic gains, the College Bus is the ideal intervention to help CCVHS progress towards its goal of 75% of students going to college (CCVHS, November 2012).\r\n\r\nBresee will also partner with Tutor Ted to provide test preparation. Bresee will continue working with College Access Foundation, which contributes to Bresee’s scholarship fund, provides program support, and connects Bresee with training and networking. "
  description1: "Some of Bresee's most important achievements to date include:\r\n\r\n-  Awarding over 100 students\r\n-  Providing\r\n\r\nBresee is proud"
  vision: "In 2050, we envision a fleet of College Buses steering LA’s most academically at-risk youth from areas such as South Central, Compton, Watts, and East LA to college.  The program would have spread throughout LA and be on the road to becoming a national best practice in college prep.   The College Bus program would have raised a large scholarship endowment, to continue providing needs-based scholarships to students in LA.   Reputable local colleges and universities such as UCLA and CalState LA would partner formally with the College Bus program, committing to enroll low-income students from underperforming schools in their programs. \r\n\r\nBy creating systematic change for full high schools, the economic and social fabrics of the communities served by the College Bus will reap long-term rewards.  Having overcome barriers to higher education, College Bus alumni will become adults who have:  \r\n\r\n•\tA lower likelihood of unemployment; workers with their bachelor’s degree are more than half as likely to be unemployed (The Atlantic, 2013).  \r\n•\tAccess to a broader job market; Nearly 60% of all jobs nationally require higher education (American Public Media, 2013). \r\n•\tA better chance of increasing their income quintile; A college degree gives low-income children a 75% higher chance of increasing their income quintile (US Department of Education, 2012).\r\n•\tA variety of social benefits, including being more likely to volunteer, vote, exercise, and have health insurance and pension (New York Times, 2010).\r\n\r\nStudents who overcome the limitations imposed by their neighborhood, educational, economic or family circumstances and go to college exemplify the vision of the College Bus program.  This vision has been lived out by generations of Bresee alumni, including Bresee’s current College Coordinator, Chheav Em:\r\n“I first heard about Bresee’s college trip from my high school tennis coach [at Belmont High School.] She learned about the trip and suggested that I go. My parents always emphasized the importance of education. Although I didn’t know a whole lot about college, I always planned on going. On the college trip, I learned that college is all about independence and freedom. The trip showed me that there was a world out there that I knew nothing about and I was excited to be a part of it. One of the biggest impacts of this trip was the exposure to a small liberal arts university in Nampa, Idaho, a school I never would’ve considered attending but ended up going to. I looked at it as an opportunity to really experience something new. I got my degree in social work so that I could learn more about how to serve the youth and their families.”\r\n\r\nThe same College Bus that shaped Chheav’s future will now shape the lives of hundreds of youth in her neighborhood and the city at large.  The ultimate goal is that in 2050, all students in LA public schools will overcome their barriers to higher education and graduate from high school college-ready and college-bound."
What is your idea and how will it impact your indicator?: >+
  <p><b>"A Bresee college trip changed my life by making me decide to go to
  college,"</b> describes Fonda Whitehead, a Bresee alumna who went on a college
  trip in 1988. "No one in my family attended college, but that trip made it a
  reality for me." Fonda, who has now worked at Bresee for 16 years, describes
  what has become a common story; the story of how a simple Bresee college trip
  can change lives.</p>






  <p>Bresee proposes <b>a fullservice college prep program</b> that
  systematically targets the entire 450member student body of Central City Value
  High School (CCVHS), a local charter school. Every student will board Bresee's
  newly renovated, 25passenger College Bus, and spend a day touring a local
  college. Throughout the school year, every student will have the opportunity
  to take their college dreams a step further by enrolling in:</p>






  <ul>



  <li>AG requirement workshops for 9th grade</li>



  <li>PSAT classes for 10th grade</li>



  <li>PSAT/SAT prep, remedial CAHSEE prep and personal statement workshops for
  11th grade</li>



  <li>SAT prep, scholarship and FAFSA workshops, and the opportunity to apply
  for a needsbased College Bus scholarship for the 12th grade</li>



  </ul>






  <p>Programs will be available on the school's campus, for free, to all
  students. <b>This is a pilot program that is scalable and can be replicated at
  other schools in our community.</b> What if by 2050, every student in Los
  Angeles (LA) was afforded the same opportunity, the opportunity to overcome
  educational barriers and go to college? Join us on the campaign. Get aboard
  the College Bus.</p>






  <p>Bresee serves an area where local high schools have graduation rates
  ranging from 30% to 48% and only 25% of graduates exit high school
  collegeready, compared to 40% countywide (Rampart GRYD Assessment, 2008). The
  College Bus will address the four primary causes of low levels of
  collegereadiness and enrollment in Bresee's area: 1) a public education system
  that does not provide adequate preparation for postsecondary education; 2)
  limited exposure to college; 3) underperforming schools; 4) and low family
  educational attainment. First, it will partner with local public schools,
  which lack the resources to offer adequate preparation for postsecondary
  education, supplementing their curriculum with college prep. Second, it will
  systematically expose students to college by bringing all students on a
  college tour. Third, it will strategically partner with underperforming
  schools, maximizing the collective resources of the community. Finally, by
  providing an informed staff and intentional followup, students who are the
  first in their family to attend college will not navigate the application
  process on their own.</p>






  <p>During the pilot year of the College Bus, all CCVHS students will
  participate in a College trip to a local college, including an overview of the
  school and its application requirements, meeting a current student, a
  discussion of cost and financial aid, and a video of Bresee alumni sharing
  about their college experiences. This model will ensure that every CCVHS
  student is informed about key topics and has visited a private college, two
  junior colleges, a UC, and two CalStates by graduation.</p>






  <p>Though a college tour will create the desire for youth to attend college,
  it alone will not ensure that students are collegeready. Following the college
  trip, Bresee will partner with test prep expert Tutor Ted to offer
  comprehensive college prep for all students:</p>



  <ul>



  <li>9th graders and their parents will participate in a 2hour AG Requirement
  workshop, to ensure that they graduate collegeready.</li>



  <li>10th graders will participate in 4, 2hour sessions of PSAT prep, to give
  them test exposure and an opportunity to improve their scores.</li>



  <li>11th graders will participate in 4, 2hour sessions of PSAT prep and 15,
  2hour sessions of SAT prep, focusing on test taking strategies. Students who
  have not yet passed the CAHSEE will receive 8, 2hour sessions of remedial
  CAHSEE prep, to ensure that they graduate on time. They will also complete
  Personal Statement Bootcamps, to prepare to submit their college
  applications.</li>



  <li>12th graders will receive 4, 2hour sessions of SAT prep and
  FAFSA/scholarship bootcamps, to secure the required funds for college.</li>



  </ul>






  <p>Bresee's regular youth programs will also be available to CCVHS students,
  including tutoring, paid internships, athletics, arts, and family  services.
  College Bus participants will be eligible for Bresee's needsbased college
  scholarship, which has awarded 100 students with almost $500,000 in the last
  decade.</p>






  <p>After successfully implementing this pilot program at CCVHS, the  model may
  be replicated by Bresee at any of the 10 central LA high schools in a
  threemile radius of Bresee. The model may also be adapted and replicated by
  other nonprofits, to systematically ensure that all 1,632,427 students
  attending public schools in LA are collegeready by 2050.</p>

  <p>Bresee is proud of its many alumni who are living out its vision by serving
  the next generation. This success is exhibited by Cesar, who came to Bresee
  for a karate class and now has his own karate studio that offers its program
  at Bresee; by Pedro, who learned to make films in Bresee's media program and
  is now teaching film at a nonprofit; and by Roger, who was sent to Bresee by
  the probation department and recently served as assistant to assemblyman Mike
  Davis. <b>These young leaders acknowledge that Bresee was critical to their
  success.</b> Andy, a Bresee alumnus who now serves as a founding board member
  of MultiCultural Communities for Mobility, shares his story:



  <blockquote>"My mom struggled to make ends meet. I had no sense of direction.
  I began using drugs and stealing to find happiness. I got caught and was
  referred to Bresee, where my perspective on life changed. I took anger
  management classes and met weekly with my counselor Rene who helped me to look
  at life differently. Bresee gave me this sense of accomplishmentsomething I
  had never felt before. One day Rene told me about a job opening at Bresee. I
  took the job and began working with firsttime offenders, opening Bresee's
  first community service program. This was the first real job I had ever had. I
  worked parttime at Bresee, went to community college, and eventually
  transferred to UCLA. With the help of Bresee and their scholarship opportunity
  I graduated  something unimaginable during my younger days. Without Bresee's
  financial and emotional help I never would have gotten this
  far."</blockquote></p>
Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  <p>Bresee will continue its twoyear partnership with CCVHS, a charter school
  one block away. In 2012, CCVHS' graduation rate was 83%. Only 38% of graduates
  went to a 4year college and 52% completed the AG Requirements. With one
  college counselor, CCVHS is not equipped to provide college prep for all
  students. Given CCVHS' record of academic gains, the College Bus is the ideal
  intervention to help CCVHS progress towards its goal of 75% of students going
  to college.</p>






  <p>Bresee will also partner with Tutor Ted to provide test preparation. Bresee
  will continue working with College Access Foundation, which contributes to
  Bresee's scholarship fund, provides program support, and connects Bresee with
  training and networking.</p>
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  <p>The ultimate goal of the College Bus program is to intentionally prepare a
  full student body for college. This includes providing <b>annual college trips
  to high schoolers using gradespecific curriculum and measuring improvement on
  gradespecific standards during the 20132014 school year (including AG
  requirements, PSAT/SAT prep, CAHSEE prep, personal statements, FAFSA, and
  scholarships).</b> Bresee's College Coordinator will work collaboratively with
  Tutor Ted and CCVHS' College Counselor to collect, maintain, and analyze the
  evaluation data supporting the following outcomes quarterly:</p>






  <p>100% of CCVHS Students (450) will:</p>



  <ul>



  <li>Visit a college campus on the College Bus, as measured by a pre and
  posttest.</li>



  <li>Set the goal of going to college, as measured by vision setting sheets,
  completed during the college tour.</li>



  <li>Receive a tour of the Bresee Foundation and an overview of its Youth
  Programs while on their college tour, as measured by attendance.</li>



  </ul>






  <p>95% of 9th grade participants will:</p>



  <ul>



  <li>Develop an AG Completion plan to share with their counselor and parents
  will gain an understanding of college requirements, as measured by AG
  Completion plans.</li>



  </ul>






  <p>95% of 10th grade participants will:</p>



  <ul>



  <li>Improve on a PSAT practice test, collected by Tutor Ted.</li>



  </ul>






  <p>95% of 11th grade participants will:</p>



  <ul>



  <li>Increase their scores on PSAT and SAT practice tests, collected by Tutor
  Ted.</li>



  <li>Demonstrate improvement on a CAHSEE practice test (if they haven't already
  passed the CAHSEE), as measured by pre and posttests collected by teachers
  conducting remedial tutoring.</li>



  <li>Receive individualized feedback on their personal statement, as measured
  by attendance at personal statement workshops.</li>



  </ul>






  <p>95% of 12th grade participants will:</p>



  <ul>



  <li>Increase their scores on a SAT practice test, collected by Tutor Ted.</li>



  <li>Complete or receive individualized assistance completing their FAFSA, as
  measured by attendance at FAFSA bootcamps.</li>



  <li>Submit or receive individualized assistance completing a scholarship
  application, as measured by attendance at scholarship bootcamps.</li>



  <li>Be eligible for the College Bus scholarship, as measured by College Bus
  program attendance and scholarship applications.</li>



  </ul>






  <p>In addition to the outcomes based evaluation recorded above, students
  attendance at all of the workshops and tours will be tracked and analyzed to
  ensure that students take advantage of the full College Bus curriculum. While
  shortterm successes can be seen through the numerical goals described above,
  <b>the true mark of success will be that more students graduating from CCVHS
  will enroll in postsecondary education.</b> This data will be monitored and
  tracked by CCVHS' College Counselor. Additionally, success of the College Bus
  program on a whole will be demonstrated by replication of the program at other
  local schools.</p>
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  <p>The College Bus will benefit LA by systematically ensuring that the <b>most
  academically atrisk students are exposed to college, collegeready, and
  ultimately collegebound.</b> This will immediately include exposing a full
  student body of 450 to college and providing followup that results in AG
  requirement completion; improved CAHSEE, PSAT, and SAT scores; and more
  collegeready students applying to college and enrolling with the necessary
  financial aid and scholarships. By piloting a scalable model, the impact of
  Bresee's College Bus will not only be felt in our corner of the city, but
  eventually across LA. After successfully implementing this program at CCVHS,
  the model may be replicated by Bresee at any of the 10 high schools (with
  almost 11,000 students total) in a threemile radius of Bresee. This would
  allow us to progress towards a day when all of the high school students in the
  Rampart area have been exposed to college and are collegeready. <b>The model
  may also be adapted and replicated by other nonprofits, to methodically ensure
  that all 1,632,427 students attending public schools in LA are
  collegeready.</b></p>






  <p>The majority of people that Bresee serves live in an area called the
  Rampart Gang Reduction Youth Development (GRYD) Zone. This is the most densely
  populated area in LA, with an estimated 75,000 residents, the highest
  concentration of recent immigrants in LA and 805 active gang members,
  responsible for nearly onequarter of the city's gangrelated crimes
  (Advancement Project, 2008). It is estimated that 90% or more of the students
  Bresee serves are at the low to very lowincome level. The area has an
  unemployment rate of 11% (Urban Institute), compared to 6% countywide (2010
  Census). The majority of the students that Bresee serves attend schools in the
  bottom 10% of schools statewide, with the lowest graduation rates in the city
  (California Department of Education, 2013), and only 25% of graduates complete
  necessary college prep coursework (Rampart GRYD Assessment, 2008). In 2012,
  100% of Bresee's scholarship recipients were the first in their family to go
  to college.</p>






  <p>By targeting the most atrisk youth with college prep and exposure services,
  the College Bus will create a culture of collegereadiness in partner schools,
  resulting in a wave of students like Laura, an undocumented student who was
  hesitant about college due to finances. She got college prep through Bresee,
  earned a Bresee scholarship, and is now attending CalState, Dominguez Hills.
  Laura states, "Without Bresee, I wouldn't be where I am today." Or a wave of
  students like Mario, who attributes the 100point increase in his SAT score,
  which landed him in his dream school (University of Oregon), to Bresee's SAT
  class. When the College Bus program is replicated across the city, not only
  will there be more Laura's and Mario's, but there will be longterm
  implications on the economic and social climate of the city at large (see
  below).</p>
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  <p>In 2050, we envision a fleet of College Buses steering LA's most
  academically atrisk youth from areas such as South Central, Compton, Watts,
  and East LA to college. The program would have <b>spread throughout LA</b> and
  be on the road to becoming a national best practice in college prep.  The
  College Bus program would have raised a <b>large scholarship endowment</b>, to
  continue providing needsbased scholarships to students in LA.  Reputable local
  colleges and universities would partner formally with the College Bus program,
  committing to enroll lowincome students from underperforming schools in their
  programs.</p>






  <p>By creating systematic change for full high schools, <b>the economic and
  social fabrics of the communities served by the College Bus will reap longterm
  rewards.</b> Having overcome barriers to higher education, College Bus alumni
  will become adults who have:</p>



  <ul>



  <li>A lower likelihood of unemployment; workers with their bachelor's degree
  are more than half as likely to be unemployed (The Atlantic, 2013). </li>



  <li>Access to a broader job market; Nearly 60% of jobs require higher
  education (American Public Media, 2013). </li>



  <li>A better chance of increasing their income quintile; A college degree
  gives lowincome children a 75% higher chance of doing so (US Department of
  Education, 2012).</li>



  <li>A variety of social benefits, including being more likely to volunteer,
  vote, exercise, and have health insurance and pension (New York Times,
  2010).</li>



  </ul>






  <p>Students who overcome the limitations imposed by their neighborhood,
  educational, economic or family circumstances and go to college exemplify the
  vision of the College Bus program. This vision has been lived out by
  generations of Bresee alumni, including Bresee's current College Coordinator,
  Chheav Em:</p>



  <blockquote>"I first heard about Bresee's college trip from my high school
  tennis coach [at Belmont High School.] She learned about the trip and
  suggested that I go. My parents always emphasized the importance of education.
  Although I didn't know a whole lot about college, I always planned on going.

  would've considered attending but ended up going to. I looked at it as an
  opportunity to experience something new. I got my degree in social work so
  that I could learn more about how to serve the youth and their
  families."</blockquote></p>






  <p>The same College Bus that shaped Chheav's future will now shape the lives
  of hundreds of youth in her neighborhood and the city at large. <b>The
  ultimate goal is that in 2050, all students in LA public schools will overcome
  barriers to higher education and graduate from high school collegeready and
  collegebound.</b></p>
