title: 'Asphalt to Apples: Sprouting Healthy Kids and Gardens'
project_summary: "The Garden School Foundation was founded in 2005 with the mission to create a model of garden-based education for Los Angeles schools that would advance health outcomes and experiential learning opportunities for elementary students. Eight years later, we’ve created the most comprehensive program in the city, with students at our pilot site visiting the ¾ acre kitchen garden every other week during the school day for classes in everything from Science and Language Arts to Cooking and Nutrition. Our Seed to Table curriculum, to be published this June in partnership with the verynice.co design company, is the first of its kind to create a simple, concise, standards-based framework for integrating gardens into elementary schools, and stands to transform garden-based education in Southern California for many years to come.\r\n\r\nIn addition to piloting this program at the 24th Street Elementary School, GSF has worked with Widney High, a school for students with multiple physical and developmental disabilities, to create a Horticulture vocational program that includes a commercial greenhouse operation and vegetable garden. We are working with the school to create job opportunities for these students, connecting them with local urban agriculture organizations and farmers’ markets so they can make meaningful contributions to their local community.\r\n\r\nGSF has cultivated a sustained network of community volunteers that contribute over 4,500 hours of volunteer labor each year to our organization. We train 6 interns each semester that go on to hold jobs furthering garden-based education opportunities for Los Angeles youth, and host hundreds of visitors to our site each year that come to learn from our model.\r\n\r\nOur partner, the Urban & Environmental Policy Institute (UEPI) at Occidental College, was instrumental in creating, cultivating and expanding farm to school programs, which are now linked by a national network throughout the United States.

  brief: "The Garden School Foundation (GSF) has a vision of a Los Angeles community where every child grows, cooks, and eats fresh local produce every day of their lives - in school!  Angelinos should capitalize on our most famous characteristic - fabulous weather - to cultivate a city and county with green space and a bountiful harvest accessible to everyone.  In partnership with the Farm to Preschool program at the Urban & Environmental Policy Institute (UEPI) at Occidental College, which focuses on the early childhood years, we propose the following multi-pronged idea to get us there:\r\n\r\n1) Build the capacity of entire school communities to support the growth of healthy children through County-wide trainings for teachers, parents, and community volunteers to build the skills necessary to maximize the potential of gardens, thus transforming eating habits for a lifetime.\r\n2) Create the first LA School Garden Network Resource website.  While innovative school garden programs exist in the LA region, our urban sprawl tends to isolate programs and schools.  We propose to gather, share and leverage our resources to create a force of sustainable change in the region. \r\n3) Host a county-wide school garden forum and resource fair to gather teachers and garden advocates to celebrate the wonderful work happening while inspiring and supporting others to transform their own schools to include outdoor learning environments.  By working with and learning from each other we can cultivate a community that will nourish and support the growth of the whole child.\r\n\r\nCurrently, children in LA, particularly those from low income and historically underserved communities of color, suffer from poor health due in part to the debilitating effects of obesity, often stemming from an unbalanced diet lacking fresh fruits and vegetables.  Obesity rates in preschool-aged children enrolled in WIC (Women, Infants and Children) in LA are over 22% among Latino children and over 15% of Black children.  The link between obesity and low access to healthy food in “food deserts,” among other indicators, is well proven. Furthermore, we know that if children are eating more fresh fruits and veggies they have a lower risk of developing obesity and obesity-related diseases such as diabetes, with health effects that could stay with them their entire lives. The good news is that recent studies have shown that if children grow their own food, they are more likely to eat it, a fact that many teachers and parents can testify to firsthand. Given LA’s ideal conditions for growing food and a plethora of unused school land, we can ensure that every child has the opportunity of the benefits of growing fresh food as an integral part of their Prek-5th grade education.  This would transform the school and preschool landscape from asphalt to apples -and the hundreds of other fruits and vegetables kids can grow!\r\n\r\nWe propose to cultivate the conditions that will enable every child in LA to grow up having the knowledge, support, and resources at their fingertips to become healthy, connected, and activated adults. This will create a continuum and community of learning from the preschool years through elementary school, using schools as the most obvious setting for change.  Our idea builds on the important work that’s already being done and sets the stage for transformative change on a county-wide scale through capacity-building, networking and resource sharing. \r\n\r\n1. Capacity-building\r\nPreschool and elementary school teachers will be trained on age-appropriate core standards-based nutrition, garden curricula from GSF (Seed to Table) or UEPI (Farm to Preschool’s Harvest of the Month), and basic gardening skills. These curricula effectively link core learning standards such as math, literacy and science to gardens and local healthy food in a school-based setting.  In addition, parent workshops will focus on home gardening, affordable healthy foods, empowering parents to find their voice and advocate for healthier food at schools.  Community volunteers will be trained in school garden curricula, garden management best practices, and be connected to existing resources.\r\n\r\n2. Los Angeles School Garden Network website\r\nThis website will be designed to focus on school garden resources in the LA region, as well as providing up to date information on events and giveaways, and an online forum for parents, teachers and volunteers to communicate and share best practices, challenges, resources, and advice.  \r\n\r\n3. School Garden Forum\r\nA school garden forum will culminate the school year to bring together all preschool-grade 5 schools with gardens as well as those inspired to start their own programs.  This forum will host speakers, discussion roundtables, showcase gardens, programs and resources, provide skill building cooking demos and provide the type of interaction and capacity-building movement in Los Angeles that is sorely lacking"

Costs include small stipends for speakers, food, cooking demos, A/V, rentals and giveaways."
  description: "It’s a well examined and researched fact that the overall health of children in Los Angeles is poor, with children as young as age 3 suffering from pre-diabetic symptoms.  While childhood obesity rates have leveled off in Los Angeles, they continue to be high, with Latino and African American children experiencing disproportionate effects of obesity and related health impacts, due to many factors such as income, housing and food insecurity as well as low access to healthy food with high exposure to calorie and chemical laden junk food.  Children in L.A. and around the country are currently so unhealthy that their life expectancy is projected to be lower than that of their parents. \r\n\r\nResearch on school gardens has shown that children eat more fresh fruits and vegetables, perform better on tests, and are more likely to have higher attendance rates when they experience gardening at school.  In addition, gardens have been shown to increase children’s sense of ownership and pride of their accomplishments, an essential step toward taking control of their own health. As part of the regular school day, gardens provide a rich experience that improves both the capacity for learning and the ability to make healthy, informed decisions about their diets - and lives.  Even children as young as age 2 can garden and benefit from such experiential activities.  Farm to Preschool has found that children as young as 4 are asking their parents to buy and grow the foods they’ve eaten and grown themselves at school, something repeated in the feedback Garden School Foundation staff receive about the 6-11 year olds in their program.\r\n\r\nBy inspiring, creating and sustaining a culture of gardens at schools, children, their families and their teachers will all benefit.  Benefits are numerous and include (1) greater access to healthy foods; (2) increased consumption of healthy foods; (3) increased learning in all subjects and core standards; (4) skill building through the act of sowing, growing, harvesting and cooking food, as well as mentoring of older children to the young; (5) improved connection to and understanding of the environment that we live in; (6) more visually appealing schools that enhance learning and behavior; (7) a culture of connectedness to our land and each other by bringing schools and the community together; and certainly (8) the culminating effect of improved health outcomes for children as well as their families for generations."

  description3: "It is difficult to define competition in a field in such need of competitors, especially when our shared goal is the health of our children. With 1,000 schools just in Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) alone, there’s enough work for many times the number of organizations out there currently working on creating and integrating gardens into schools. Much of our strength, in fact, comes from partnering with organizations that have similar goals. For instance, we partner with Enrich LA, who builds school gardens, to come in and offer programming once the garden has been built. Another partner we work with is Root Down LA, who trains teens to teach kids about health and nutrition. These teens then come and teach our elementary students how to cook healthy, garden-fresh food!\r\n\r\nSharing best practices and operating in a transparent, collaborative way is going to be the thing that really moves forward innovation and transformation in Los Angeles, a city whose complete absence of cohesion is one of its biggest obstacles to change. GSF has as one of its core goals to support the efforts of those whose work is similar to ours in every way that we can, and we see “competition” merely as opportunity for collaboration."
  vision: "Los Angeles in 2050 has transformed its communities, harvesting its “lowest-hanging fruit” to make the best use of its most neglected yet abundant resources. In 2050 we see all children eating healthy foods because they’ve learned how to grow them, and they and their families know that there’s no better place on earth for kids to grow food and learn outside every day of the year than right here in L.A. We’ve capitalized upon the fact that LAUSD land is public land and therefore it is and should be open and trusted to the public to gather, garden, learn, play, and collaborate whenever school is not in session. We’ve created and sustained healthy communities throughout the county, because we’ve learned - and experienced - that in order to grow healthy kids, you have to cultivate their entire community to create a landscape where the HEALTHY choice is the EASY choice.\r\n\r\nIn this vision, we’ve spent the last 37 years creating and integrating gardens and the growing of food into each and every day of the school year and building the capacity of schools and teachers to harness the full potential of gardens to transform children’s health, from birth and beyond.  We’ve hauled out thousands of acres of asphalt and replaced it with thriving ecosystems full of fruits, vegetables, insects, birds, California Live Oaks, wild Lupine, and native Elderberry trees.  We’ve bridged the divides of race, socio-economics, and politics through digging our hands into the soil and cultivating beauty together.  We’ve created a cohesive community of Angelenos that won’t settle for anything but the freshest, most delicious, most local, most healthy, most affordable fruits and vegetables for every single child in every city, every day of the year. We’ve made Los Angeles into the single most shining example of a city and a county that “got it right” by its children, and has in turn created a population more healthy, more active, and more in control of its health than any other in the country."

  This website will be designed to focus on school garden resources in the LA
  region, as well as providing up to date information on events and giveaways,
  and an online forum for parents, teachers and volunteers to communicate and
  share best practices, challenges, resources, and advice.  






  3. School Garden Forum



  A school garden forum will culminate the school year to bring together all
  preschoolgrade 5 schools with gardens as well as those inspired to start their
  own programs.  This forum will host speakers, discussion roundtables, showcase
  gardens, programs and resources, provide skill building cooking demos and

What are some of your organization’s most important achievements to date?: >-
  The Garden School Foundation was founded in 2005 with the mission to create a
  model of gardenbased education for Los Angeles schools that would advance
  health outcomes and experiential learning opportunities for elementary
  students. Eight years later, we’ve created the most comprehensive program in
  the city, with students at our pilot site visiting the Â¾ acre kitchen garden
  every other week during the school day for classes in everything from Science
  and Language Arts to Cooking and Nutrition. Our Seed to Table curriculum, to
  be published this June in partnership with the verynice.co design company, is
  the first of its kind to create a simple, concise, standardsbased framework
  for integrating gardens into elementary schools, and stands to transform
  gardenbased education in Southern California for many years to come.






  In addition to piloting this program at the 24th Street Elementary School, GSF
  has worked with Widney High, a school for students with multiple physical and
  developmental disabilities, to create a Horticulture vocational program that
  includes a commercial greenhouse operation and vegetable garden. We are
  working with the school to create job opportunities for these students,
  connecting them with local urban agriculture organizations and farmers’
  markets so they can make meaningful contributions to their local community.






  GSF has cultivated a sustained network of community volunteers that contribute
  over 4,500 hours of volunteer labor each year to our organization. We train 6
  interns each semester that go on to hold jobs furthering gardenbased education
  opportunities for Los Angeles youth, and host hundreds of visitors to our site
  each year that come to learn from our model.






  Our partner, the Urban & Environmental Policy Institute (UEPI) at Occidental
  College, was instrumental in creating, cultivating and expanding farm to
  school programs, which are now linked by a national network throughout the
  United States.  UEPI has many other innovative programs involving research and
  policy change, including the Farm to Preschool program.  Farm to Preschool is
  viewed at a model program nationwide, is a national leader of the emerging

Please identify any partners or collaborators who will work with you on this project.: >-
  The Urban & Environmental Policy Institute (UEPI) at Occidental College is an
  academic center conducting research and policy work with the aid of strong
  communitybased partnerships. UEPI has been a strong leader in establishing
  fresh food programs at both the preschool and public school levels for over 14
  years, including for low income preschool and after school facilities. UEPI is
  also a leader in the emerging national Farm to Preschool movement, creating a
  network of Farm to Preschool stakeholders across the country.  The Farm to
  Preschool program brings local, affordable food to underserved preschoolers,
  their families and the wider community as well as creating a learning
  environment through classbased lessons and school gardens. 
Please explain how you will evaluate your project. How will you measure success?: >-
  Both GSF and UEPI have extensively evaluated their programs and have validated
  survey tools applicable to this proposed project.  To evaluate preschoolgrade
  5 teacher trainings (for inclass curriculum and onsite gardening as a teaching
  tool and for school consumption), teachers will be given surveys at the end of
  the training to measure effectiveness and perceived increased capacity to
  offer and sustain this gardenbased program at their school. Success will be
  measured by the number of teachers in the training who feel confident they can
  implement the program at their site. Surveys (before and at the end of the
  program, ‘pre’ and ‘post’ tests) will be given to a subset of preschoolers (at
  least 100 children) and elementary students to evaluate any increases in
  knowledge of fruits and vegetables, how food is grown, and measures any
  changes in food preferences.  Success will be measured by changes in knowledge
  and preferences as compared to schools who have not received the program,
  using data collected from a similar population during Farm to Preschool’s
  pilot program phase in 2011.  Increase in healthy food consumption will be
  measured from surveys given to teachers during the school year, as well as
  from taste test sheets that record how many children have eaten the produce
  (such as from the garden) and how many liked it.  Success will be measured by
  the increased number of children who try the produce as well as like it, over
  the course of the school year.


   


  Teachers and parents will be interviewed in focus groups to assess their
  knowledge of and    capacities for using gardens as educational tools to
  promote increased fruit and vegetable consumption amongst children. Parents
  will also be interviewed as to their knowledge of and desire to create
  sustained gardenbased programming in their local schools, and the different
  ways other schools are approaching gardens. Volunteers will be surveyed as to
  their attitudes about their own capacities to help sustain school gardens and
  implement programming, as well as their knowledge of local resources available
  to support their efforts.


   


  For the website, the number of web hits will be monitored as well as online
  forum activity between teachers, parents and other community members.  Success
  will be measured by an actively used website and vibrant forum that provides
  technical assistance and troubleshooting to school garden programs.


   


  A short evaluation form will be distributed at the end of year garden forum to
  measure increases in social and professional connectedness among participating
  schools, increase in knowledge and inspiration from the speakers and other
  related events at the forum, as well as the interest, drive and capacity of
  additional schools and teachers to start programs in the 20142015 school year.
How will your project benefit Los Angeles? Please be specific.: >-
  It’s a well examined and researched fact that the overall health of children
  in Los Angeles is poor, with children as young as age 3 suffering from
  prediabetic symptoms.  While childhood obesity rates have leveled off in Los
  Angeles, they continue to be high, with Latino and African American children
  experiencing disproportionate effects of obesity and related health impacts,
  due to many factors such as income, housing and food insecurity as well as low
  access to healthy food with high exposure to calorie and chemical laden junk
  food.  Children in L.A. and around the country are currently so unhealthy that
  their life expectancy is projected to be lower than that of their parents. 






  Research on school gardens has shown that children eat more fresh fruits and
  vegetables, perform better on tests, and are more likely to have higher
  attendance rates when they experience gardening at school.  In addition,
  gardens have been shown to increase children’s sense of ownership and pride of
  their accomplishments, an essential step toward taking control of their own
  health. As part of the regular school day, gardens provide a rich experience
  that improves both the capacity for learning and the ability to make healthy,
  informed decisions about their diets  and lives.  Even children as young as
  age 2 can garden and benefit from such experiential activities.  Farm to
  Preschool has found that children as young as 4 are asking their parents to
  buy and grow the foods they’ve eaten and grown themselves at school, something
  repeated in the feedback Garden School Foundation staff receive about the 611
  year olds in their program.






  By inspiring, creating and sustaining a culture of gardens at schools,
  children, their families and their teachers will all benefit.  Benefits are
  numerous and include (1) greater access to healthy foods; (2) increased
  consumption of healthy foods; (3) increased learning in all subjects and core
  standards; (4) skill building through the act of sowing, growing, harvesting
  and cooking food, as well as mentoring of older children to the young; (5)
  improved connection to and understanding of the environment that we live in;
  (6) more visually appealing schools that enhance learning and behavior; (7) a
  culture of connectedness to our land and each other by bringing schools and
  the community together; and certainly (8) the culminating effect of improved
  health outcomes for children as well as their families for generations.
What would success look like in the year 2050 regarding your indicator?: >-
  Los Angeles in 2050 has transformed its communities, harvesting its
  “lowesthanging fruit” to make the best use of its most neglected yet abundant
  resources. In 2050 we see all children eating healthy foods because they’ve
  learned how to grow them, and they and their families know that there’s no
  better place on earth for kids to grow food and learn outside every day of the
  year than right here in L.A. We’ve capitalized upon the fact that LAUSD land
  is public land and therefore it is and should be open and trusted to the
  public to gather, garden, learn, play, and collaborate whenever school is not
  in session. We’ve created and sustained healthy communities throughout the
  county, because we’ve learned  and experienced  that in order to grow healthy
  kids, you have to cultivate their entire community to create a landscape where
  the HEALTHY choice is the EASY choice.






  In this vision, we’ve spent the last 37 years creating and integrating gardens
  and the growing of food into each and every day of the school year and
  building the capacity of schools and teachers to harness the full potential of
  gardens to transform children’s health, from birth and beyond.  We’ve hauled
  out thousands of acres of asphalt and replaced it with thriving ecosystems
  full of fruits, vegetables, insects, birds, California Live Oaks, wild Lupine,
  and native Elderberry trees.  We’ve bridged the divides of race,
  socioeconomics, and politics through digging our hands into the soil and
  cultivating beauty together.  We’ve created a cohesive community of Angelenos
  that won’t settle for anything but the freshest, most delicious, most local,
  most healthy, most affordable fruits and vegetables for every single child in
  every city, every day of the year. We’ve made Los Angeles into the single most
  shining example of a city and a county that “got it right” by its children,
  and has in turn created a population more healthy, more active, and more in
  control of its health than any other in the country.
